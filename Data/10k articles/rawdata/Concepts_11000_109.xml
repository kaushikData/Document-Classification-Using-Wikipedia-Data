== Devadatta ==
[[Devadatta]] is noted for attempting to kill the [[Sakyamuni Buddha]] on several occasions including:
* Throwing a large rock at him. Devadatta missed, but a splinter from the rock drew blood from the Buddha's foot.
* Inciting an elephant to charge at the Buddha. The Buddha was able to pacify the elephant by directing [[Mettā]] to it.

According to [[Sutta Pitaka]], after trying to kill Sakyamuni Buddha a number of times, Devadatta set up his own Buddhist monastic order by splitting the  ([[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]). During his efforts to become the leader of his own Sangha, he proposed five extra-strict rules for monks, which he knew Buddha would not allow. Devadatta's reasoning was that after he had proposed those rules and Buddha had not allowed them, Devadatta could claim that ''he'' did follow and practice these five rules, making him a better and more pure monk. One of these five extra rules required monks to be [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]. In the [[Amitayurdhyana Sutra|Contemplation Sutra]], Devadatta is said to have convinced Prince [[Ajatasatru|Ajatasattu]] to murder his father King [[Bimbisara]] and ascend the throne. Ajatasattu follows the advice, and this action prevents him from attaining enlightenment at a later time, when listening to a teaching of the Buddha. Devadatta is the only individual from the early Buddhist tradition to have committed three anantarika-karmas.

== King Suppabuddha ==
King Suppabuddha was the father of Devadatta and [[Yasodharā]] and the father-in-law of Prince Siddhattha. One day Suppabuddha blocked the Buddha's path, refused to make way, and sent a message saying, "I cannot give way to the Buddha, who is so much younger than I". Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the bhikkhus turned back. As the Buddha turned back, he said to Ananda, "Because the king has refused to give way to a Buddha, he has committed a bad [[Karma|kamma]] and before long he will have to face the consequences". It is said that the king died on the seventh day after that event had taken place. He fell down the stairs, collapsed and died and was born in a suffering state, being unable to escape the effects of his evil kamma (according to Buddhist belief).&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~suttanta/khuddhaka/dhammapada/dha105.html IX:12 King Suppabuddha blocks the Buddha's path]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddha's prediction the earth swallowed him. It is said, "So the king went down the stairs and as soon as he stepped on the earth, it opened and swallowed him up and dragged him right down to [[Avici]] Niraya."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tipitaka.net/tipitaka/dhp/verseload.php?verse=128 Dhammapada Verse 128 Suppabuddhasakya Vatthu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Karma ==
Anyone who commits an anantarika-karma will go to [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]. The five different actions which each constitute an anantarika-karma are the only actions which can produce a definite result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aimwell.org/Books/Pesala/Hell/hell.html#Who See Ven. Pesala's exposition on Hell]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303233633/http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Pesala/Hell/hell.html |date=2010-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts claim that toward the end of Devadatta's life, he was struck by a severe remorse caused by his past misdeeds and did indeed manage to approach the Buddha and retook refuge in the [[Triple Gem]], dying shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T24/1450_010.htm Sarvastivada text the event creating a schism in the Sangha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122152230/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T24/1450_010.htm |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the gravity of his actions, he was condemned to suffer for several hundred millennia in Avici. However, it was also said that he would eventually be admitted into the heavens as a [[Pratyekabuddha]] due to his past merits prior to his corruption.

In the [[Samaññaphala Sutta]], Gautama Buddha said that if [[Ajatasattu]] hadn't killed his father, he would have attained [[sotapanna]]hood, a degree of enlightenment. But because he had killed his father he could not attain it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/T14/T14n0508.htm Buddha say King Ajatasattu asking five grave offenses sutra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723144126/http://www.cbeta.org/result/T14/T14n0508.htm |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">{{about|languages that naturally emerge in computer simulations or controlled psychological experiments with humans|planned or constructed human languages|constructed language|formal computer languages|formal language}}

'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have '''''not''''' been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes ere mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research is based on the hypothesis that [[natural language]] is a [[complex adaptive system]] that emerges through interactions between individuals and continues to evolve in order to remain adapted to the needs and capabilities of its users. By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading up to the new paradigm of [[experimental semiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pmc = 4503356
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in '''[[statistical language acquisition]]''' studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.

In [[linear algebra]], the '''characteristic polynomial''' of a [[square matrix]] is a [[polynomial]] which is invariant under [[matrix similarity]] and has the [[eigenvalues]] as [[root of a polynomial|roots]]. It has the [[determinant]] and the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix as coefficients. The '''characteristic polynomial''' of an [[endomorphism]] of [[vector space]]s of finite dimension is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of the endomorphism over any base; it does not depend on the choice of a basis. The '''characteristic equation''' is the equation obtained by equating to zero the characteristic polynomial.

The '''characteristic polynomial of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is the characteristic polynomial of its [[adjacency matrix]]. It is a [[graph invariant]], though it is not complete: the smallest pair of non-isomorphic graphs with the same characteristic polynomial have five [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CharacteristicPolynomial.html
| title = Characteristic Polynomial of a Graph – Wolfram MathWorld
|accessdate = August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

Given a square matrix ''A'', we want to find a polynomial whose zeros are the eigenvalues of ''A''.  For a [[diagonal matrix]] ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is easy to define: if the diagonal entries are ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc. then the characteristic polynomial will be:

:&lt;math&gt;(t-a_1)(t-a_2)(t-a_3)\cdots.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This works because the diagonal entries are also the eigenvalues of this matrix.

For a general matrix ''A'', one can proceed as follows. A scalar  ''λ''  is an eigenvalue of ''A'' if and only if there is an [[eigenvector]] '''v'''  ≠  0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v},\,&lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda I - A)\mathbf{v} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where '''''I'''''  is the [[identity matrix]]). Since '''v''' is non-zero, this means that the matrix ''λ'' '''''I'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'' is [[singular matrix|singular]] (non-invertible), which in turn means that its [[determinant]] is 0.  Thus the roots of the function det(''λ''&amp;nbsp;'''''I'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'') are the eigenvalues of ''A'', and it is clear that this determinant is a polynomial in ''λ''.

==Formal definition==

We consider  an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix ''A''. The characteristic polynomial of ''A'', denoted by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), is the polynomial defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced linear algebra |author=Steven Roman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWUPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |isbn=3540978372 |edition=2 |year=1992 |publisher=Springer |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_A(t) = \det \left(tI - A\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' denotes the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]].

Some authors define the characteristic polynomial to be det(''A''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;''I''). That polynomial differs from the one defined here by a sign (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so it makes no difference for properties like having as roots the eigenvalues of ''A''; however the current definition always gives a [[monic polynomial]], whereas the alternative definition is monic only when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even.

==Examples==
Suppose we want to compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 1\\
-1&amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We now compute the [[determinant]] of
:&lt;math&gt;t I-A = \begin{pmatrix}
t-2&amp;-1\\
1&amp;t-0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 
which is &lt;math&gt;(t-2)t - 1(-1) = t^2-2t+1 \,\!,&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.

Another example uses [[hyperbolic function]]s of a [[hyperbolic angle]] &amp;phi;.
For the matrix take
:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh(\varphi) &amp; \sinh(\varphi)\\ \sinh(\varphi)&amp; \cosh(\varphi) \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Its characteristic polynomial is
:&lt;math&gt;\det (tI - A) = (t - \cosh(\varphi))^2 - \sinh^2(\varphi) = t^2 - 2 t \ \cosh(\varphi) + 1 = (t - e^\varphi) (t - e^{-\varphi}).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

The polynomial ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is monic (its leading coefficient is 1) and its degree is ''n''.  The most important fact about the characteristic polynomial was already mentioned in the motivational paragraph: the eigenvalues of ''A'' are precisely the [[root of a function|root]]s of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') (this also holds for the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'', but its degree may be less than ''n'').  The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all [[polynomial expression]]s in the entries of the matrix. In particular its constant coefficient ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0)&amp;nbsp; is det(&amp;minus;''A'') = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; det(''A''), the coefficient of {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  is one, and the coefficient of {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is tr(&amp;minus;''A'') = &amp;minus;tr(''A''), where {{math|tr(''A'')}} is the matrix [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of&amp;nbsp;''A''. (The signs given here correspond to the formal definition given in the previous section;&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 28 in these [http://users.math.yale.edu/~tl292/teaching/math225/notes/week10.pdf lecture notes]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the alternative definition these would instead be det(''A'') and (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 &lt;/sup&gt;tr(''A'') respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 4 in these [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/week8.pdf lecture notes]&lt;/ref&gt;)

For a 2&amp;times;2 matrix ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is thus given by
: &lt;math&gt; t^2 - \operatorname{tr}(A) t + \det(A). &lt;/math&gt;

Using the language of [[exterior algebra]], one may compactly express the characteristic polynomial of an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix ''A'' as 
: &lt;math&gt; p_A (t) = \sum_{k=0}^n t^{n-k} (-1)^k \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda^k A) &lt;/math&gt;
where tr(Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Exterior algebra#Functoriality|exterior power]] of ''A'', which has dimension &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. This trace may be computed as the sum of all [[principal minor]]s of ''A'' of size ''k''. The recursive [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]] computes these  coefficients  more efficiently.

When the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is 0 it may alternatively be computed as a single determinant, that of the {{math|''k''×''k''}} matrix,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k!}  
\begin{vmatrix}  \operatorname{tr}A  &amp;   k-1 &amp;0&amp;\cdots &amp; \\
\operatorname{tr}A^2  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A&amp;  k-2 &amp;\cdots &amp; \\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots    \\
\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1} &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{k-2}&amp; &amp; \cdots &amp; 1    \\ 
\operatorname{tr}A^k  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1}&amp; &amp; \cdots &amp; \operatorname{tr}A
\end{vmatrix}         ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] states that replacing ''t''  by ''A'' in the characteristic polynomial (interpreting the resulting powers as matrix powers, and the constant term ''c'' as ''c'' times the identity matrix) yields the zero matrix. Informally speaking, every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This statement is equivalent to saying that the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'' divides the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.

Two [[similar matrices]] have the same characteristic polynomial.  The converse however is not true in general: two matrices with the same characteristic polynomial need not be similar.

The matrix ''A'' and its [[transpose]] have the same characteristic polynomial. ''A'' is similar to a [[triangular matrix]] [[if and only if]] its characteristic polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors over ''K'' (the same is true with the minimal polynomial instead of the characteristic polynomial). In this case ''A'' is similar to a matrix in [[Jordan normal form]].

==Characteristic polynomial of a product of two matrices==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are two square ''n×n'' matrices then characteristic polynomials of ''AB'' and ''BA'' coincide: 
:&lt;math&gt;p_{AB}(t)=p_{BA}(t).\,&lt;/math&gt;

When ''A'' is [[Non-singular matrix|non-singular]] this result follows from the fact that ''AB'' and ''BA'' are [[similar matrices|similar]]:
:&lt;math&gt;BA = A^{-1} (AB) A.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case where both ''A'' and ''B'' are singular, one may remark that the desired identity is an equality between polynomials in ''t'' and the coefficients of the matrices. Thus, to prove this equality, it suffices to prove that it is verified on a non-empty [[open subset]] (for the usual [[topological space|topology]], or, more generally, for the [[Zariski topology]]) of the space of all the coefficients. As the non-singular matrices form such an open subset of the space of all matrices, this proves the result.

More generally, if ''A'' is a matrix of order ''m&amp;times;n'' and ''B'' is a matrix of order ''n&amp;times;m'', then ''AB'' is ''m&amp;times;m'' and ''BA'' is ''n&amp;times;n'' matrix, and one has
: &lt;math&gt; p_{BA}(t) = t^{n-m} p_{AB}(t).\,&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, one may suppose ''n'' &gt; ''m'', by exchanging, if needed, ''A'' and ''B''. Then, by bordering ''A'' on the bottom by ''n'' – ''m'' rows of zeros, and ''B'' on the right, by,  ''n'' – ''m'' columns of zeros, one gets two ''n&amp;times;n'' matrices ''A' ''and ''B' '' such that ''B'A' ''= ''BA'', and ''A'B' '' is equal to ''AB'' bordered by ''n'' – ''m'' rows and columns of zeros. The result follows from the case of square matrices, by comparing the characteristic polynomials of ''A'B' '' and ''AB''.

==Secular function and secular equation==

===Secular function===
The term '''secular function''' has been used for what is now called ''characteristic polynomial'' (in some literature the term secular function is still used). The term comes from the fact that the characteristic polynomial was used to calculate [[secular phenomena|secular perturbations]] (on a time scale of a century, i.e. slow compared to annual motion) of planetary orbits, according to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s theory of oscillations.

===Secular equation===
''Secular equation'' may have several meanings.

*In [[linear algebra]] it is sometimes used in place of characteristic equation.
*In [[astronomy]] it is the algebraic or numerical expression of the magnitude of the inequalities in a planet's motion that remain after the inequalities of a short period have been allowed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://dict.die.net/secular%20equation/
| title = secular equation
|accessdate = January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[molecular orbital]] calculations relating to the energy of the electron and its wave function it is also used instead of the characteristic equation.

'''Cleaner production''' is a preventive, company-specific [[environmental protection]] initiative.  It is intended to [[waste reduction|minimize waste]] and [[Air pollutants|emissions]] and maximize product output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yacooub |first=Ali |author2=Johannes Fresner |title=Half is Enough - An Introduction to Cleaner Production |year=2006 |publisher=LCPC Press |location=[[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] |isbn=978-3-9501636-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By analysing the flow of materials and [[energy]] in a company, one tries to identify options to minimize waste and emissions out of [[Industry|industrial]] processes through [[source reduction]] strategies.  Improvements of organisation and technology help to reduce or suggest better choices in use of materials and energy,  and to avoid waste, [[waste water]] generation, and gaseous emissions, and also [[waste heat]] and noise. 

The concept was developed during the preparation of the [[Rio Summit]] as a programme of UNEP ([[United Nations Environmental Programme]]) and UNIDO ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060528092455/http://www.unido.org/doc/4460 National Cleaner Production Center Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Jacqueline Aloisi de Larderel, the former Assistant Executive Director of UNEP. The programme was meant to reduce the environmental impact of industry. It built on ideas used by 3M in its 3P programme (pollution prevention pays). It has found more international support than all other comparable programmes. The programme idea was described "...to assist developing nations in leapfrogging from pollution to less pollution, using available technologies". Starting from the simple idea to produce with less waste Cleaner Production was developed into a concept to increase the [[resource efficiency]] of production in general. UNIDO has been operating [[National Cleaner Production Centers]] and Programmes (NCPCs/NCPPs) with centres in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208113414/http://www.unido.org/en/doc/4460 UNIDO NCPC Programme, including lessons learned, and contact to National Cleaner Production Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the term [[pollution prevention]] is more commonly used for cleaner production.

Examples for cleaner production options are: 

*'''Documentation of consumption''' (as a basic analysis of material and energy flows, e. g. with a [[Sankey diagram]]) 
*'''Use of indicators and controlling''' (to identify losses from poor planning, poor education and training, mistakes)
*'''Substitution of raw materials and auxiliary materials''' (especially [[renewable]] materials and energy) 
*'''Increase of useful life of auxiliary materials and process liquids''' (by avoiding drag in, drag out, contamination) 
*'''Improved control and automatisation''' 
*'''[[Reuse]] of waste''' (internal or external) 
*'''New, low waste processes and technologies'''

One of the first [[Europe]]an initiatives in cleaner production was started in [[Austria]] in 1992 by the BMVIT (Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie). This resulted in two initiatives: "Prepare" and [[EcoProfit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701221957/http://www.prepare.at/ Prepare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoprofit.com ECOPROFIT Plattform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109072549/http://www.cpc.at/unternehmen/un_Allgemeines_e.htm Cleaner Production Center Austria] Official ECOPROFIT Trainings &amp; Distribution Center&lt;/ref&gt;

The "PIUS" initiative was founded in Germany in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pius-info.de PIUS: Produktionsintegrierter Umweltschutz]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] operates the National Cleaner Production Centre Programme with centres in [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1294">The '''Cry of Alcorta''' ({{lang-es|Grito de Alcorta}}) was an agrarian rebellion that took place in 1912 in [[Alcorta]], [[Argentina]]. It began at the south of the [[Santa Fe Province]], with requests of better working conditions and better contracts. These demonstrations bore no similarity to the contemporary [[Anarchism in Argentina|anarchists]]. On June 25 the workers refused to harvest before their requests were met. The protest quickly expanded to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Entre Ríos and Santa Fe. Although the workers had discontent with the leasing system, they did not request the complete eradication but just better terms; the few workers that proposed a radical goal did not prevail. The protest achieved the desired goals, and the [[Federación Agraria Argentina]] was established on August 15.

A '''death threat''' is a [[threat]], often made [[Anonymity|anonymously]], by one person or a group of people to kill another person or group of people. These threats are often designed to [[intimidate]] victims in order to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] their behaviour, and thus a death threat can be a form of [[coercion]]. For example, a death threat could be used to dissuade a public figure from pursuing a criminal investigation or an advocacy campaign.

In most jurisdictions, death threats are a serious type of [[criminal offence]]. Death threats are often covered by coercion statutes. For instance, the coercion statute in [[Alaska]] says:
{{quote|text=A person commits the crime of coercion if the person compels another to engage in conduct from which there is a legal right to abstain or abstain from conduct in which there is a legal right to engage, by means of instilling in the person who is compelled a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the person who makes the demand or another may inflict physical injury on anyone....&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title11/Chapter41/Section530.htm Alaska Statute 11.41.530(a)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
A death threat can be communicated via a wide range of media, among these letters, [[newspaper]] publications, [[telephone call]]s, [[blog|internet blogs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6499095.stm ''Blog death threats spark debate''] [[BBC News]] retrieved September 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[e-mail]]. If the threat is made against a political figure, it can also be considered [[treason]]. If a threat is against a non-living location that frequently contains living individuals (e.g. a building), it could be a [[Terrorism|terrorist threat]]. Sometimes, death threats are part of a wider campaign of abuse targeting a person or a group of people (see [[terrorism]], [[mass murder]]).

==Against a head of state==
In some [[Monarchy|monarchies]] and [[republic]]s, both democratic and authoritarian, threatening to kill the [[head of state]] and/or [[head of government]] (such as the [[sovereign]], [[Threatening the President of the United States|president]], or [[prime minister]]), is considered a crime, for which punishments vary. The United States law provides for up to five years in prison for threatening any type of [[threatening government officials of the United States|government official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 18 U.S. Code § 871 - Threats against President and successors to the Presidency {{!}} US Law {{!}} LII / Legal Information Institute|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/871|website = www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], under the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], it is illegal to attempt to kill or deprive the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] of his/her throne; this offense was originally punished with [[penal transportation]], and then was changed to the [[death penalty]], and currently the penalty is [[life imprisonment]].

==Osman warning, letter or notice==
Named after a high-profile case, ''[[Osman v United Kingdom]]'', these are warnings of death threat or high risk of murder that are issued by British police or legal authorities to the possible victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/2157509/Dads-death-threat-warning.html |title=Dad's death threat warning  |work=[[The Scottish Sun]] |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used when there is intelligence of the threat, but there is not enough evidence to justify the police arresting the potential murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on Friday 13 June 2008 17:49 |url=http://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/bed-news/Beds-is-one-of-nations.4185282.jp |title=Beds is one of nation's 'death-threat capitals' - News |publisher=Bedford Today |date=2008-06-13 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deconstruction (Dallas).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deconstruction of a building.]]

In the context of physical [[construction]], '''deconstruction''' is the selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for [[re-use]], [[Repurposed building stone|repurposing]], [[recycling]], and [[waste management]]. It differs from [[demolition]] where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse”.  The process of dismantling structures is an ancient activity that has been revived by the growing field of [[sustainable]], [[green building|green method of building]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings, like everything, have a life-cycle. Deconstruction focuses on giving the materials within a building a new life once the building as a whole can no longer continue.

When buildings reach the end of their useful life, they are typically demolished and hauled to [[landfill]]s. [[Building implosion]]s or ‘wrecking-ball’ style [[demolition]]s are relatively inexpensive and offer a quick method of clearing sites for new structures.  On the other hand, these methods create substantial amounts of waste. Components within old buildings may still be valuable, sometimes more valuable than at the time the building was constructed.  Deconstruction is a method of harvesting what is commonly considered “[[waste]]” and reclaiming it into useful building material.

== Contribution to sustainability ==
Deconstruction has strong ties to environmental [[sustainability]]. In addition to giving materials a new life cycle, deconstructing buildings helps to lower the need for virgin resources. This in turn leads to [[energy]] and [[Air pollution|emissions]] reductions from the [[refining]] and [[manufacture]] of new materials. As deconstruction is often done on a local level, many times on-site, energy and emissions are also saved in the [[transportation]] of materials. Deconstruction can potentially support communities by providing local jobs and renovated structures.  Deconstruction work typically employs 3-6 workers for every one employed in a comparable demolition job.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  In addition, [[solid waste]] from conventional demolition is diverted from landfills.  This is a major benefit because [[construction and demolition waste]] accounts for approximately 20% of the solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Mark, and Dennis Livingston.

==Benefits of avoiding wood waste==
In Canada, the CO2 Neutral Alliance has created a website&lt;ref&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; with resources for regulators and municipalities, developers and contractors, business owners and operators, and individuals and households. Benefits for municipalities include:&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"/&gt;
* Reducing disposal costs where waste collection, hauling or disposal is supported by the tax base
* Establishing additional revenue streams
* Making existing landfills last longer
* Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the decomposition of wood waste into methane from landfills
* Stimulating local economies with new industries and employment
Improving the local environment and overall sustainability of your community 
For every three square feet of deconstruction, enough lumber can be salvaged to build one square foot of new construction. At this rate, if deconstruction replaced residential demolition, the United States could generate enough recovered wood to construct 120,000 new affordable homes each year. The deconstruction of a typical {{convert|2,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} wood frame home can yield 6,000 board feet of reusable lumber.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood"&gt;[http://dontwastewood.com/regulators-and-municipalities.asp CO2 Neutral Alliance Don’t Waste Wood website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Every year the United States buries about 33 million tons of wood-related construction and demolition debris in landfills. As anaerobic microorganisms decompose this wood, it will release about five million tons of carbon equivalent in the form of methane gas.&lt;ref name="dontwastewood" /&gt;

== Typical methods of deconstruction ==
Deconstruction is commonly separated into two categories; [[structural]] and non-structural.  Non-structural deconstruction, also known as “soft-stripping”, consists of reclaiming non-structural components, [[home appliances|appliances]], [[door]]s, [[window]]s, and finish materials.  The reuse of these types of materials is commonplace and considered to be a mature market in many locales.

Structural deconstruction involves dismantling the structural components of a building. Traditionally this had only been performed to reclaim expensive or rare materials such as used [[brick]], [[dimension stone]], and extinct [[wood]]. In antiquity, it was common to raze stone buildings and reuse the stone; it was also common to steal stones from a building that was not being totally demolished: this is the literal meaning of the word ''[[wikt:dilapidated|dilapidated]].'' Used brick and dimension limestone in particular have a long tradition of reuse due to their durability and color changes over time. Recently, the rise of environmental awareness and sustainable building has made a much wider range of materials worthy of structural deconstruction.  Low-end, commonplace materials such as dimensional [[lumber]] have become part of this newly emerging market.

The [[United States military]] has utilized structural deconstruction in many of its bases. The construction methods of [[barracks]], among other base structures, are usually relatively simple.  They typically contained large amounts of lumber and used minimal [[adhesives]] and finish-work.  In addition, the buildings are often identical, making the process of deconstructing multiple buildings much easier.  Many barracks were built during the era prior to [[World War II|WWII]], and have aged to the point where they now need to be torn down. Deconstruction was deemed very practical due to the abundance of labor the military has access to and the value of the materials themselves.

[[Natural disasters]], such as [[hurricanes]], [[floods]], [[tsunamis]], and [[earthquakes]] often leave a vast amount of usable building materials in their wake. Structures that remain standing are often deconstructed to provide materials for rebuilding the [[region]].

== Economic potential ==
Deconstruction’s economic viability varies from project to project. The amount of time and cost of labor are the main drawbacks. Harvesting materials from a structure can take weeks, whereas demolition may be completed in roughly a day. However, some of the costs, if not all, can be recovered. Reusing the materials in a new on-site structure, selling reclaimed materials, donating materials for [[income tax]] write-offs, and avoiding landfill “tipping fees” are all ways in which the cost of deconstruction can be made comparable to demolition.

Reclaiming the materials for a new on-site structure is the most economically and environmentally efficient option. Tipping fees and the costs of new materials are avoided; in addition, the transportation of the materials is non-existent. Selling the used materials or donating them to [[non-profit organization]]s are another effective way of gaining capital. Donations to NPO’s such as [[Habitat for Humanity]]’s ReStore are tax deductible.  Many times it is possible to claim the value to be half of what that particular material would cost new.  When donating rare or [[antique]] components it is sometimes possible to claim a higher value than a comparable, brand-new material.

Value can also be added to new structures that are built by implementing reused materials.  The [[United States Green Building Council]]'s program entitled [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] ('''LEED''') offers seven credits relating to reusing materials.  (This accounts for seven out of a maximum sixty-nine credits)  These include credits for building-shell reuse, material reuse, and diverting waste from landfills.  Building shell-reuse is particularly appropriate for shells made of [[dimension stone]].

Deconstruction is well suited to job training for the construction trades. Taking down a building is an excellent way for a worker to learn how to put a building up. This is vital for the economic recovery of inner-city communities. Unskilled and low-skilled workers can receive on-the-job training in use of basic carpentry tools and techniques, as well as learning teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking and good work habits.&lt;ref&gt;Seldman, Neil, and Kivi Leroux. ''Deconstruction: Salvaging Yesterday's Buildings for Tomorrow's Sustainable Communities.'' Washington, DC: Institute for Local Self-Reliance, 2000. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
[[Image:DBNYDemolition108.jpg|thumb|right|Dismantling the [[Deutsche Bank Building]] in January 2008.]]

When choosing to deconstruct a building there are some important aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Developing a list of local contacts that are able to take used materials is an essential first step. These might include commercial architectural salvage businesses, reclamation yards, not-for-profit and social enterprise salvage warehouses, and dismantling contractors. Materials that cannot be salvaged may be recycled on-site or off-site, or taken to landfills. The next step involves identifying which, if any, are [[hazardous material]]s. [[Lead paint]] and [[asbestos]] are two substances in particular that need to be handled extremely cautiously and disposed of properly.

It is common practice, and common sense, to “soft-strip” the structure first; remove all appliances, windows, doors, and other finishing materials. These will account for a large percentage of the marketable components. After the non-structural deconstruction, structural is the next step. It is best to start at the [[roof]] and work down to the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]].

Building components that are dismantled will need to be stored in a secure, dry location. This will protect them from [[water damage]] and theft. Once separated from the structure, materials can also be cleaned and/or refinished to increase value. Building an inventory list of the materials at hand will help determine where each item will be sent.

== Designing for deconstruction (DfD) ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Tone|date=August 2008}}

"The end of the building’s useful life generates a stream of used materials that can be reprocessed for new construction. The selection of materials for reuse or recycling should not start at the end of the building’s life cycle, it should start at the design stage. Architects and engineers should keep the whole life cycle of the building in mind and select construction materials based on their capacity to be reused or recycled after the building has served its purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Abdol Chini, University of Florida, M.E. Rinker Sr. School of Building Construction&lt;/ref&gt;

An upstream approach to deconstruction can be implemented into buildings during their design process.  This is a current trend in sustainable [[architecture]]. Often, simple construction methods combined with high-grade, durable materials work best for DfD structures. Separating layers of a building’s infrastructure and making them visible can significantly simplify its deconstruction. Making components within systems separable also assists in being able to dismantle materials quickly and efficiently.  This can be achieved by using mechanical fasteners such as bolts to connect parts.  Allowing physical access to the fasteners is another needed aspect of this design. Also, it is important to use standardized materials and assemble them in a consistent manner throughout the project.

Some conventional construction methods and materials are difficult or impossible to deconstruct and should be avoided when designing for deconstruction. The use of nails and adhesives significantly slows down the deconstruction process and has a tendency to ruin otherwise reusable materials. Avoid hazardous materials altogether as they are detrimental to the natural environment and are non-reusable. Using mixed material grades makes the process of identifying pieces for resale difficult.

Deconstruction is important for more than just the end of a building’s life-cycle. Buildings that have been designed with deconstruction in mind are often easier to maintain and adapt to new uses.  Saving the shell of a building or adapting interior spaces to meet new needs ensures that new structures have a small environmental impact.

An alternative worth considering is [[modular building]], like the [[Habitat 67]] project in [[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. This was a residential structure consisting of separate, functional apartments that could be put together in a variety of ways. As people moved in or out, the units could be reconfigured as desired.

In sports, a '''depth chart''' is used to show the placements of the starting players and the secondary players. Generally a starting player will be listed first or on top while a back-up will be listed below. Depth charts also tend to resemble the actual position locations of certain players.&lt;ref name="LongCzarnecki2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Howie Long|author2=John Czarnecki|title=Football For Dummies, USA Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=an8ZIHOMda0C&amp;pg=PA244|accessdate=31 July 2013|date=12 May 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01265-9|pages=244–|quote=A depth chart lists the starting lineups for both teams by their positions on offense and defense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[Major League Baseball]] depth chart consists of  a list of players at each position, with the starter or first-string player listed first, followed by replacement and [[Platoon system|platoon players]].  For [[fantasy baseball]], typical preseason projection systems such as [[PECOTA]] construct depth charts that specify not just the order of the players at each position (starter, replacement or [[List of baseball jargon (B)#bench|bench player]]) but also the amount of playing time each person at that position will have. For example, at first base one player may be projected as playing 60 percent of the innings, and another 40 percent for the coming season, while at catcher one player may be projected as playing 80 percent of the innings, and another 20 percent.  For pitchers, the depth charts project the number of innings each roster player will pitch.

The [[line (ice hockey)|line system]] in [[ice hockey]] follows the same structure as a depth chart.

==Outside of sports==
The term depth chart is now also being used from the perspective of management theory, to address the process of key positioning leaders within the organization, considering a dynamic [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|life cycle]] perspective which includes developmental tasks such as those cited in books and articles related to the leadership pipeline subject.  A depth chart analysis for key positioning leaders should affect the development of leadership training programs and high performance development initiatives in modern corporations and enterprises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Dignity of risk''' is the idea that [[self-determination]] and the right to take reasonable risks are essential for [[dignity]] and [[self esteem]] and so should not be impeded by excessively-cautious [[caregiver]]s, concerned about their [[duty of care]].

== History ==
The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article ''The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded'' by Robert Perske:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not – this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety!&lt;ref name=Perske&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perske|first1=R|title=The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded.|journal=Mental retardation|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–7|pmid=5059995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conflict with duty of care==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Allowing people under care to take risks is often perceived to be in conflict with the caregivers' [[duty of care]]. Finding a balance between these competing considerations can be difficult when formulating policies and guidelines for caregiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interchangewa.org.au/opinion/duty-care-dignity-risk/ |title=Duty of care and the dignity of risk &amp;#124; Interchange |publisher=Interchangewa.org.au |date=2016-05-04 |author=Wendel Bamford |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2016/05/11/balancing-act-dignity-risk-vs-duty-care/ |author=Jackie Keast |title=A balancing act: dignity of risk vs. duty of care |publisher=Australian Ageing Agenda |date=2016-05-11 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Joseph E|last2=Davis|first2=Marie-Claire|title=Impediments to applying the ‘dignity of risk’ principle in residential aged care services|journal=Australasian Journal on Ageing|date=September 2013|volume=32|issue=3|pages=188–193|doi=10.1111/ajag.12014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of overprotection==
[[File:Wheelchair rugby game 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wheelchair rugby]] is a [[contact sport|full contact sport]] played by wheelchair users. In spite of the protective features of the wheelchairs, the risk of injury is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauerfeind|first1=Joanna|last2=Koper|first2=Magdalena|last3=Wieczorek|first3=Jacek|last4=Urbański|first4=Piotr|last5=Tasiemski|first5=Tomasz|title=Sports Injuries in Wheelchair Rugby – A Pilot Study|journal=Journal of Human Kinetics|date=1 January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|doi=10.1515/hukin-2015-0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Overprotection of people with disabilities causes low [[self-esteem]] and underachievement because of lowered expectations that come with overprotection. Internalisation of low expectations causes the disabled person to believe that they are less capable than others in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=KY|title=Overprotection and lowered expectations of persons with disabilities: the unforeseen consequences.|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|date=2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=181–8|pmid=16971765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elderly people, overprotection can result in learned dependency and a decreased ability for [[self-care]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennie|first1=David C.|title=Preventive care for elderly people|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Angleterre|isbn=9780521436298|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is possible to deliver physical care that has positive outcomes and returns a person to full function, yet, if during that care they have not been involved, allowed to make choices and respectfully assisted with activities of daily living, it may be possible to cause psychological damage through undermining that person's dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Mitchell|first2=Theresa|title=growing old with dignity: a concept analysis|journal=Nursing Older People|date=June 2002|volume=14|issue=4|pages=19–21|doi=10.7748/nop2002.06.14.4.19.c2212|pmid=12094515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent living ==
The right to fail and the dignity of risk is one of the basic tenets of the philosophy of the [[independent living|independent living movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deegan|first1=Patricia E.|title=The Independent Living Movement and people with psychiatric disabilities: Taking back control over our own lives.|journal=Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal|date=1992|volume=15|issue=3|pages=3–19|doi=10.1037/h0095769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ==
The first of eight "guiding principles" of the United Nations' [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] states: "Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices, and independence of persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guiding Principles of the Convention |publisher=United Nations - Division for Social Policy and Development |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/guiding-principles-of-the-convention.html|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41444">A '''Dyson sphere''' is a hypothetical [[megastructure]] that completely encompasses a [[star]] and captures a large percentage of its power output. The concept is a [[thought experiment]] that attempts to explain how a spacefaring civilization would meet its energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the home planet's resources alone. Only a fraction of a star's energy emissions reach the surface of any orbiting planet. Building structures encircling a star would enable a civilization to harvest far more energy.

The first contemporary description of the structure was by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his science fiction novel ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), in which he described "every solar system... surrounded by a gauze of light traps, which focused the escaping solar energy for intelligent use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tate|first1=Karl|title=Dyson Spheres: How Advanced Alien Civilizations Would Conquer the Galaxy|url=https://www.space.com/24276-dyson-spheres-how-advanced-alien-civilizations-would-conquer-the-galaxy-infographic.html|website=space.com|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was later popularized by [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of [[Infrared Radiation]]".&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year= 1960 |url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM |title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|Freemann J.

He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]]. Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the [[Kardashev scale]].

Since then, other variant designs involving building an artificial structure or series of structures to encompass a star have been proposed in [[exploratory engineering]] or described in [[science fiction]] under the name "Dyson sphere". These later proposals have not been limited to solar-power stations, with many involving [[space habitat|habitation]] or [[industry|industrial]] elements. Most fictional depictions describe a solid [[#Dyson shell|shell of matter]] enclosing a star, which is considered{{By whom|date=July 2018}} the least plausible variant of the idea. In May 2013, at the Starship Century Symposium in San Diego, Dyson repeated his comments that he wished the concept had not been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|title=STARSHIP CENTURY SYMPOSIUM, MAY 21 - 22, 2013|date=7 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707123030/http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|archivedate=7 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of concept ==
{{see also|Energy development}}
[[File:Freeman Dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson]]
The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of a [[thought experiment]] by physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]], when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the ''total'' energy output of the [[Sun]]. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a ''shell'') designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea.  He was inspired by the mention of the concept in the 1937 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Star Maker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disturbing the Universe |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |year=1979 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-01677-4 |page=211 |quote=Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Olaf Stapledon]], and possibly by the works of [[J. D. Bernal]], [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who seem to have explored similar concepts in their work.&lt;ref name = dsfaq-as-first-2012-01&gt;{{Cite web

== Feasibility ==
Although such megastructures may be theoretically possible, all plans to build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. The number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. [[George Dvorsky]] has advocated use of [[self-replicating robots]] to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term.&lt;ref name=dvorsky2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/03/how-to-build-dyson-sphere-in-five.html |title=How to build a Dyson sphere in five (relatively) easy steps |last1=Dvorsky |first1=George |date=2012-03-20 |access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around [[white dwarf]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Dyson Spheres around White Dwarfs|eprint=1503.04376|last1=Semiz|first1=İbrahim|last2=Oğur|first2=Salim|class=physics.pop-ph|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Pulsar|pulsars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osmanov | first1 = Z. | year = 2015| title = On the search for artificial Dyson-like structures around pulsars | arxiv = 1505.05131| journal = Int.

== Variants ==
In fictional accounts, the Dyson-sphere concept is often interpreted as an artificial hollow [[sphere]] of [[matter]] around a star. This perception is based on a literal interpretation of Dyson's original short paper introducing the concept. In response to letters prompted by some papers, Dyson replied, "A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 132|year= 1960|pages= 250–253|title= Letters and Response, Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|F. J. Dyson]], J. Maddox, P. Anderson, E. A. Sloane|doi= 10.1126/science.132.3421.252-a|pmid= 17748945| issue= 3421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyson swarm ===
[[File:Dyson Ring.PNG|thumb|A '''Dyson ring'''—the simplest form of the Dyson swarm—to scale. Orbit is 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] in radius, collectors are 1.0{{e|7}} km in diameter (10 [[Gigametre|Gm]] or ≈25 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth–Moon distance]]), spaced 3 degrees from center to center around the orbital circle.]]
[[File:Dyson Swarm.png|thumb|A relatively simple arrangement of multiple Dyson rings of the type pictured above, to form a more complex Dyson swarm. Rings' orbital radii are spaced 1.5{{e|7}} km with regard to one another, but average orbital radius is still 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Rings are rotated 15 degrees relative to one another, around a common axis of rotation.]]

The variant closest to Dyson's original conception is the "Dyson swarm". It consists of a large number of independent constructs (usually [[solar power satellite]]s and [[Space colonization|space habitats]]) orbiting in a dense formation around the star. This construction approach has advantages: components could be sized appropriately, and it can be constructed incrementally.&lt;ref name="canbuild"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#BUILT| title= Dyson FAQ: Can a Dyson sphere be built using realistic technology? | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various forms of [[wireless energy transfer]] could be used to transfer energy between swarm components and a planet.

Disadvantages resulting from the nature of [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] would make the arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the ''Dyson ring'', in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Megascale/dyson_page.html|title= Some Sketches of Dyson Spheres|accessdate= 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.

As noted [[Dyson sphere#Search for megastructures|below]], such a cloud of collectors would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

=== Dyson bubble ===
[[File:Dyson Bubble.png|thumb|A '''Dyson bubble''': an arrangement of [[statite]]s around a star, in a non-orbital pattern. As long as a satellite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to its star, it can hover at any point in space near its star. This relatively simple arrangement is only one of an infinite number of possible statite configurations, and is meant as a contrast for a Dyson swarm only. Statites are pictured as the same size as the collectors pictured above, and arranged at a uniform 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] distance from the star.
]]

A second type of Dyson sphere is the "Dyson bubble". It would be similar to a Dyson swarm, composed of many independent constructs and likewise could be constructed incrementally.

Unlike the Dyson swarm, the constructs making it up are not in orbit around the star, but would be [[statite]]s—satellites suspended by use of enormous [[light sail]]s using [[radiation pressure]] to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs would not be in danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of [[radiation pressure]] to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/sunlight_exerts_pressure.htm| title= Sunlight Exerts Pressure| accessdate=2006-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.

The practicality of this approach is questionable with modern [[material science]], but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall [[density]] of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail.&lt;ref name="stable"/&gt; To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17{{e|20}} kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"/&gt; Another illustration: Regular printing [[paper]] has a density of around 80 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Such a material has not yet been produced in the form of a working light sail. The lightest carbon-fiber [[light sail|light-sail]] material currently produced has a density—without payload—of 3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about four times as heavy as would be needed to construct a solar statite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |title=SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology |first=Greg |last=Clark |publisher=Space.com |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114020015/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |archivedate=2006-01-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single sheet of [[graphene]], the two-dimensional form of carbon, has a density of only 0.37&amp;nbsp;mg per square meter,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mitali | last = Kakran | contribution = Graphene: The New Wonder Material!!! | title = IET present around the world | date = 2011 | url = http://conferences.theiet.org/patw/-documents/mitali-kakran-slides.cfm | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; making such a single sheet of graphene possibly effective as a solar sail. However, as of 2015 graphene has not been fabricated in large sheets, and it has a relatively high rate of radiation absorption, about 2.3% (i.e., still about 97.7% will be transmitted).&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene-properties.htm |title=Graphene properties | publisher=www.graphene-battery.net | date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1201.3071|last1=Apell|first1=S. P|title=High optical absorption in graphene|last2=Hanson|first2=G. W|last3=Hägglund|first3=C|class=physics.optics|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For frequencies in the upper GHz and lower THz range, the absorption rate is as high as 50–100% due to voltage bias and/or doping.&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ultra-light [[carbon nanotube]]s meshed through [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques have densities between 1.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.4 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By the time a civilization is ready to use this technology, the [[carbon nanotube]]'s manufacturing might be optimised enough for them to have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the average sail density with [[rigging]] might be kept to 0.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a "[[Solar sail#Investigated sail designs|spin stabilized]]" light sail requires minimal additional mass in [[rigging]]). If such a sail could be constructed at this [[areal density]], a [[space habitat]] the size of the [[L5 Society]]'s proposed [[O'Neill cylinder]]—500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3{{e|6}} [[ton]]s—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4{{e|9}} kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thespacereview.com/article/317/1| title=The Space Review: The high risk frontier | first=Sam| last=Dinkin| publisher=Thespacereview.com| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between [[San Francisco]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive habitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.

In theory, if enough satellites were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid version of the Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell as high as the rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see [[#Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence|below]]).

=== Dyson shell ===
[[Image:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|A cut-away diagram of an idealized Dyson shell, a variant on Dyson's original concept, with a radius of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]]]
The variant of the Dyson sphere most often [[Dyson spheres in fiction|depicted in fiction]] is the "Dyson shell": a uniform solid shell of matter around the star.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt; Such a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star, and would intercept 100% of the star's energy output. Such a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision would be used for habitation, if the surface could be made habitable.

A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a radius of one [[astronomical unit]], so that the interior surface would receive the same amount of sunlight as Earth does per unit [[solid angle]], would have a surface area of approximately {{convert|2.8e17|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 [[yotta]][[watt]]s (3.846 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; watts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|title=NASA Sun Fact Sheet|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's [[stellar evolution|evolution]].&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#WHAT| title= Dyson FAQ: What is a Dyson Sphere? | accessdate=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately 33 [[10^18|trillion]] times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/oomm.html|title=Order of Magnitude Morality|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several serious theoretical difficulties with the solid shell variant of the Dyson sphere:

Such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with its englobed star (see [[shell theorem]]), and could drift in relation to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.&lt;ref name="stable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STABLE|title=Dyson Sphere FAQ: Is a Dyson sphere stable?|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with anything else inside it. The contents of any biosphere placed on the inner surface of a Dyson shell would not be attracted to the sphere's surface and would simply fall into the star. It has been proposed that a biosphere could be contained between two concentric spheres, placed on the interior of a rotating sphere (in which case, the force of artificial "gravity" is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, causing all matter placed on the interior of the sphere to pool around the equator, effectively rendering the sphere a [[Niven ring]] for purposes of habitation, but still fully effective as a radiant-energy collector) or placed on the outside of the sphere where it would be held in place by the star's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=Drashner|author2=Steve Bowers |author3=Mike Parisi |author4=M.

If assuming a radius of one [[Astronomical unit|AU]], then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star's gravity. Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome 1 AU in height under the Sun's gravity at that distance. Indeed, it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes, but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another, the net force on that point is immense, but finite. No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure, and form a rigid, static sphere around a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STRENGTH| title= Dyson FAQ: How strong does a rigid Dyson shell need to be? | accessdate=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed by [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] (in relation to smaller "Supra-Jupiter" constructions around a large planet rather than a star) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a [[space fountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Search [https://archive.org/web/web.php WaybackMachine] for the 14th of June 2011 copy of  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627074700/http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |archivedate=2006-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere, at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity, would press outwards on [[magnetic bearing]]s due to [[centrifugal force]]. For a Dyson shell of 1-AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun, a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity (297.9&amp;nbsp;km/s) would support 99 (a=v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/r) times its own mass in additional shell structure.

Also if assuming a radius of one AU, then there may not be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. [[Anders Sandberg]] estimates that there is 1.82{{e|26}} kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—about 8–20&amp;nbsp;cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79{{e|24}} kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#ENOUGH| title= Is there enough matter in the Solar System to build a Dyson shell?| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell would be vulnerable to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as [[comet]]s, [[meteoroid]]s, and material in [[interstellar space]] that is currently being deflected by the Sun's [[bow shock]]. The [[heliosphere]], and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.

=== Other types ===

==== Dyson net ====
Another possibility is the "Dyson net", a web of cables strung about the star that could have power or heat collection units strung between the cables. The Dyson net reduces to a special case of Dyson shell or bubble, however, depending on how the cables are supported against the sun's gravity.

==== Bubbleworld ====
A bubbleworld is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas. The shell contains air, people, houses, furniture, etc. The idea was conceived to answer the question, "What is the largest space colony that can be built?"&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#OTHER| title= Other Dyson Sphere-Like Concepts| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the volume is not habitable and there is no power source.

Theoretically, any [[gas giant]] could be enclosed in a solid shell; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt; This concept is explored peripherally in the novel ''[[Accelerando (book)|Accelerando]]'' (and the short story ''Curator'', which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by [[Charles Stross]], in which [[Saturn]] is converted into a human-habitable world.

==== Stellar engine ====
[[Stellar engine]]s are a class of hypothetical [[megastructure]]s whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star, sometimes for specific purposes. For example, [[Matrioshka brain]]s extract energy for purposes of computation; [[Stellar engine#Class A (Shkadov thruster)|Shkadov thrusters]] extract energy for purposes of propulsion. Some of the proposed stellar engine designs are based on the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/stellar_engine.html|title=Stellar engine|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[black hole]] could be the power source instead of a star in order to increase the matter-to-energy conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt;

== Search for megastructures ==
In Dyson's original paper, he speculated that sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern to that of humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev, Nikolai]]. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985IAUS..112..497K On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations]", The search for extraterrestrial life: Recent developments; Proceedings of the Symposium, Boston, MA, June 18–21, 1984 (A86-38126 17–88). Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system. Collectors would absorb and reradiate energy from the star.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt; The wavelength(s) of radiation emitted by the collectors would be determined by the [[emission spectrum|emission spectra]] of the substances making them up, and the temperature of the collectors. Because it seems most likely that these collectors would be made up of heavy elements not normally found in the emission spectra of their central star—or at least not radiating light at such relatively "low" energies compared to what they would be emitting as energetic free nuclei in the [[stellar atmosphere]]—there would be atypical wavelengths of light for the star's [[spectral type]] in the light spectrum emitted by the star system. If the percentage of the star's output thus filtered or transformed by this absorption and reradiation was significant, it could be detected at interstellar distances.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

Given the amount of energy available per square meter at a distance of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]], it is possible to calculate that most known substances would be reradiating energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Thus, a Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms not dissimilar to humans, who dwelled in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], made with materials similar to those available to humans, would most likely cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, Dyson selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his published paper.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

[[SETI]] has adopted these assumptions in their search, looking for such "infrared heavy" spectra from [[solar analog]]s. {{As of|2005}} [[Fermilab]] has an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infrared sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere|title=''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-supercivilizations-absent-from-100-000-nearby-galaxies|title=Alien Supercivilizations Absent from 100,000 Nearby Galaxies|first=Lee|last=Billings|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ2015"&gt;{{Cite web

===Postulated sightings===
On 14 October 2015, the realization of a strange pattern of light from star [[KIC 8462852]], nicknamed "Tabby's Star" after [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] — the lead researcher who discovered the irregular light fluctuation— captured by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]], raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ATL-20151013"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Andersen| first1=Ross| title=The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/ |date=13 October 2015 |work=[[The Atlantic]]| accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IND-20151015"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Williams| first1=Lee| title=Astronomers may have found giant alien 'megastructures' orbiting star near the Milky Way| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html |date=15 October 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2016, Boyajian gave a [[TED (Conference)|TED talk]] where she explained the story of how her research on the star quickly took a turn into the mysterious. However, she was skeptical and in the talk she reminded everyone that skepticism is the best policy whenever delving into alien territory. Her exact quote is as follows:

{{quote|Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wanting to understand the strange light pattern, [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet [[Transit (astronomy)|transiting]] (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 and 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1509.03622 |last1=Boyajian |first1=T. S |title=Planet Hunters X. KIC 8462852 - Where's the Flux? |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=457 |issue=4 |pages=3988 |last2=LaCourse |first2=D.

A dust cloud was proposed but the star showed no signs of being young so a dust cloud was highly improbable. Lastly, a comet shower was hypothesized. However, as Boyajian pointed out in her TED talk this was also highly improbable. 
"It would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript#t-429568 |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So after all the natural explanations turned up weak, her team decided to send off their research to SETI ([[Search for extraterrestrial life]]) to rule out alien structures. After reviewing the research, the [[SETI Institute]] was so intrigued that they decided to study the star themselves and pointed their [[Allen Telescope Array]] (ATA) at the star "with hopes of catching a tell-tale signal that might reveal a technological civilization."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Up with Tabby's Star? |url=https://www.seti.org/whats-up-with-tabby-star | date=23 May 2017 | work= [[Search for extraterrestrial life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SETI Institute]] mentioned that what caught their interest was that "the timing of the present dip (in light) suggests that whatever this material is, it is situated at just the right distance from the star to be in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]], where we believe life like ours could develop as it has on Earth."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'/&gt;

Being skeptical as Boyajian was, she finally decided to take SETI's approach and allow herself to have a bit of fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: "Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe| url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript |date= February 2016|work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The search for answers to [[KIC 8462852]] is still ongoing.

On August 25, 2016, a similar phenomenon was reported for another stellar object: [[EPIC 204278916]],&lt;ref name='EPIC'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The peculiar dipping events in the disk-bearing young-stellar object EPIC 204278916|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=463|issue=2|pages=2265|arxiv=1608.07291|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.463.2265S |doi = 10.1093/mnras/stw2155 |year=2016|last1=Scaringi|first1=S|last2=Manara|first2=C.

Dimmings of up to 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt; The researchers hypothesize that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43429">An '''eco-city''' is a city built from the principles of living within environment means. The ultimate goal of many eco-cities is to eliminate all carbon waste ([[zero-carbon city]]), to produce energy entirely through [[renewable resource]]s, and to merge the city harmoniously with the natural environment; however, eco-cities also have the intentions of stimulating [[economic growth]], reducing poverty, using higher [[population densities]], and therefore obtaining higher efficiency, and improving health.

==History==

===Origins===

The concept of the “Emils Gejs” was born out of one of the first organizations focused on eco-city development, “[[Urban Emiils]].” The group was founded by Richard Register in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1975,&lt;ref name="Urban Ecology"&gt;{{cite web|title=BallsEcology|url=http://www.urbanecology.org/history.htm|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was founded with the idea of reconstructing cities to be in balance with nature.&lt;ref name="Dimensions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseland|first=Mark|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222495799_Dimensions_of_the_eco-city|title=Dimensions of the Eco-city|journal=Cities|year=1997|volume=14|issue=4|pages=197–202|accessdate=21 November 2011|doi=10.1016/s0264-2751(97)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They worked to plant trees along the main streets, built [[solar greenhouse]]s, and worked within the Berkeley legal system to pass [[environmentally friendly]] policies and encourage public transportation. Urban Ecology then took the movement another step further with the creation of The Urban Ecologist, a journal they started publishing in 1987.

===International Eco-City Conference===

[[Urban ecology]] further advanced the movement when they hosted the first International Eco-City Conference in Berkeley, California in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devuyst|first=Dimitri|title=How green is the city?|year=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference focused on urban sustainability problems and encouraged the over 700 participants to submit proposals on how to best reform cities to work within environmental means. In 1992 Richard Register founded the organization [[Ecocity Builders]] which has acted as convener of the conference series ever since. 
Eco-City Conferences have been held in Adelaide, Australia; Yoff, Senegal; Curitiba, Brazil; Shenzhen, China; Bangalore, India; San Francisco, United States; Istanbul, Turkey; Montreal, Canada; Nantes, France and Abu Dhabi (2015).&lt;ref name="Ecocity Builders"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecocity Builders|url=http://www.ecocitybuilders.org/what-we-do/intl-conference-series/|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Conference on: Green Urbanism will be held in Italy from 12–14 October 2016 will discuss Eco-cities and Different other Topics.

Also, the conference Ice Cool Earth (ICEF), first held in Tokyo, Japan in 2014, and now every year at the same place, aims to discuss the future of economics and discuss the possibility for Eco-cities and smart-design from an energy &amp; economic perspective. The conference gather important political leaders (Prime Minister of Japan did an apparition), leading enterprise from Europe and Asia, and few academics and also have an active forum.&lt;ref name="ICEF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icef-forum.org/)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco-city criteria==
Several sets of criteria for Eco-cities have been suggested, encompassing the economic, social, and environmental qualities that an eco-city should satisfy. The ideal "eco-city" has been described as a city that fulfils the following requirements:&lt;ref name="Dimensions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|title=Green vision: the search for the ideal eco-city|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c13677ce-b062-11df-8c04-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1eCqQTdQm|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Awesome Green Roof.jpg|thumb|An example of a green roof project]]

* Operates on a [[self-contained]] economy, resources needed are found locally
* Has completely carbon-neutral and [[renewable energy]] production
* Has a well-planned city layout and [[public transportation]] system that makes the priority methods of transportation as follows possible: [[walkability|walking]] first, then [[Bicycle-friendly|cycling]], and then public transportation.
* Resource conservation—maximizing [[resource efficiency|efficiency]] of water and energy resources, constructing a [[waste management]] system that can [[recycle]] waste and reuse it, creating a [[zero-waste]] system
* [[environmental restoration|Restores]] [[environmental damage|environmentally damaged]] urban areas
* Ensures decent and affordable housing for all socio-economic and ethnic groups and improve jobs opportunities for disadvantaged groups, such as women, minorities, and the disabled
* Supports [[Local food|local agriculture and produce]]
* Promotes voluntary simplicity in lifestyle choices, decreasing [[resource efficiency|material consumption]], and increasing [[environmentalism|awareness of environmental]] and sustainability issues

In addition to these initial requirements, the city design must be able to grow and evolve as the population grows and the needs of the population change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graedel|first=Thomas|title=Industrial Ecology and the Ecocity|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/UrbanizationEngineering/IndustrialEcologyandtheEcocity.aspx|publisher=National Academy of Engineering|accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially important when taking into consideration infrastructure designs, such as for water systems, power lines, etc. These must be built in such a way that they are easy to modernize (as opposed to the dominant current strategy of placing them underground, and therefore making them highly inaccessible).

Each individual eco-city development has also set its own requirements to ensure their city is environmentally sustainable; these criteria range from zero-waste and [[zero-carbon]] emissions, such as in the [[Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city]] project and the Abu Dhabi [[Masdar City]] project, to simple urban revitalization and [[green roof]] garden projects in [[Augustenborg, Malmö|Augustenborg]], [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;Caprotti, F.

Using a different set of criteria, the International Eco-Cities Initiative recently identified as many as 178 significant eco-city initiatives at different stages of planning and implementation around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Joss, S., Tomozeiu, D. and Cowley, R., 2011. "Eco-Cities - a global survey: eco-city profiles", University of Westminster ({{ISBN|978-0-9570527-1-0}}). Available from: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/ecocities/publications&lt;/ref&gt; To be included in this census, initiatives needed to be at least district-wide in their scale, to cover a variety of sectors, and to have official policy status. Although such schemes display great variety in their ambitions, scale, and conceptual underpinnings, since the late 2000s there has been an international proliferation of frameworks of urban sustainability indicators and processes designed to be implemented across different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Joss, S., Cowley, R., de Jong, M., Müller, B., Park, B-S., Rees, W., Roseland, M., and Rydin, Y. (2015). Tomorrow’s City Today: Prospects for Standardising Sustainable Urban Development. London: University of Westminster. ({{ISBN|978-0-9570527-5-8}}) Available from: http://www.westminster.ac.uk/ecocities-leverhulme&lt;/ref&gt; This may suggest that a process of de facto eco-city 'standardisation' is underway.

==Practical achievements==

===Economic impact===
One of the major and most noticeable economic impacts of the movement towards becoming an eco-city is the notable increase in productivity across existing industries as well as the introduction of new industries, thus creating jobs.

First, the movement away from carbon-producing energy sources to more [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind, water and solar power, provides local economies with new, thriving industries.  The creation of these industries, in turn, births an increase in the demand for labor; thus, not only does total employment increase, but an increase in wages also mimics increasing employment.&lt;ref name="International Economics" /&gt;

Moreover, one of the main priorities of a sustainable city is to reduce its [[ecological footprint]] by reducing total [[carbon emissions]], which, economically speaking means increasing productivity.  Merely increasing the rate of productivity in an industry reduces costs, both monetary and environmental; that is, as an industry becomes more productive, it can more efficiently allocate and use both its physical and [[human capital]], reducing the time it takes to make the same amount of goods which also allows for a higher wage (because employees are doing more) and a lesser environmental impact (because using less energy and resources to produce the same amount).&lt;ref name="International Economics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=James|title=International Economics|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-510015-8|pages=167–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, although the initial movement towards becoming a sustainable city may be quite costly for a smaller, poorer city, the benefits of such movement are plentiful in the long-run economic model.  Moreover, as more and more countries move towards becoming more sustainable, the technologies required to initiate this movement will become more readily accessible and cheaper; therefore, many rich, developed nations should put themselves forth as an example of what other cities should model themselves like, thus sparking the innovation towards a future of [[sustainable technology]].

===Environmental standards===
Although local environmental standards may differ across eco-cities, each city nonetheless has its own appropriate and practical goals and expectations that have provided the foundation for their recognition as a sustainable city. Differences in these goals and expectations are to be expected, however, due to the limitations of technology and local financing.

The primary goal for all sustainable cities is to significantly decrease total [[carbon emissions]] as quickly as possible in order to work towards becoming a carbon-free city; that is, sustainable cities work to move towards an economy based solely on renewable energy.  Actions towards carbon-reductions can be seen on both the corporate and individual levels: many industries are working towards cleaner production, but individuals are also moving away from environmentally costly forms of transportation to more sustainable methods, such as [[public transportation]] or biking.  On this note, another common environmental goal is to increase and make more efficient the public transportation systems.

Many sustainable cities also work towards becoming more densely populated ([[urban density]]); having its citizens living closer to energy production means less environmental costs of transporting said energy to citizen households.  Additionally, citizens living closer to the city-center also mean that transportation to work is significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-Cities|url=http://www.goodplanet.info/eng/Society/Eco-cities/Eco-cities/%28theme%29/294|publisher=Good Planet|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a city’s primary goal is to increase [[environmental education]] in hopes of achieving better citizen involvement and cooperation.  By making the private sector more aware of how its behavior affects the environment, a reduction in carbon emissions becomes more of a reality.

In terms of international standards, however, we can look to the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC).  The IFC has a long history of implementing environmental and social standards in localized economies, and its primary mission is to promote [[sustainable development]] across the globe, primarily in developing countries.  One of its plans to accomplish this goal is to encourage international cooperation in order to accelerate and promote sustainable growth across nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Finance Corporation's Policy on Social and Environmental Policy|url=http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/EnvSocStandards|publisher=International Finance Corporation|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the most important aspect of setting an environmental goal is making it plausible.  Many cities across the globe set goals that, although they may be super-sustainable, are not entirely possible.  These exaggerated goals include too much sustainable development for a small time period or an expectation that is simply too expensive.  The globe needs to work together to make steps towards a sustainable future that are possible and execute them well, ultimately resulting in an overall spiral towards complete global sustainability.

===Social===

====Poverty reduction====
The development of eco-cities has aided in reducing poverty in various locations via job creation in environmentally friendly business sectors. By promoting social equity based on meeting the needs of local populations, eco-cities create sustainable business models that encourage local investment and the subsequent expansion of the job market. [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] serves as a prime example of the manner in which adopting eco-city standards can aid in reducing urban poverty. According to the [[United Nations Environment Program]], the “EcoCity [program] has mobilized the disadvantaged and unemployed people of Ivory Park (part of the city of Johannesburg) to form co-operatives to grow and buy food, to recycle, to repair bicycles, to build homes, to use and promote green energy solutions, to become eco-tourism guides and more than 300 jobs have been created” between 1991 and 2001.&lt;ref name="Eco-City, Johannesburg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-City, Johannesburg|url=http://www.unep.org/training/programmes/Instructor%20Version/Part_2/Activities/Lifestyle_Patterns/Consumption/Strategies/Eco_City.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Program|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating small local businesses, residents of eco-cities create self-sufficient small enterprises that, as an aggregate, greatly alleviate the scarcity of quality employment and create economic opportunities that continuously aid in poverty reduction. These ecologically sound small-scale practices are additionally less sensitive to economic shocks, allowing for enduring economic sustainability in eco-cities. In addition to creating [[green jobs]], eco-cities promote the deployment of green methods of saving money, such as investing in ecologically sustainable local infrastructure, carpooling, and reducing consumption of water and energy, to decrease the financial burden on the poor.&lt;ref name="Article 13: South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=CSR Best Practices- Eco-City: Johannesburg, South Africa|url=http://www.article13.com/A13_ContentList.asp?strAction=GetPublication&amp;PNID=1120|publisher=Article 13|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Population distribution====
Increasing proportions of the world population are now located in cities. As a result, eco-city models place substantial attention on mitigating and reducing the environmental damage caused by growing urban populations.&lt;ref name="World Bank Eco2 Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco2 Cities|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANDEVELOPMENT/Resources/336387-1270074782769/Eco2Cities_synopsis.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because urbanization does not appear to be slowing, eco-cities aim to increase [[urban density]] while integrating “[[green infrastructure]]” or "green spaces" into the urban landscape. Eco-cities promote compact use of land by people for residential and commercial purposes. In this way, increasing urban density reduces the strain on the environment by centralizing and, thereby, reducing [[resource consumption]]. For example, the 2006 plans for the Chinese eco-city of [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] employed this strategy.&lt;ref name="Dongtan article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=Fred|title=Eco-cities Special: A Shanghai Surprise|url=http://blog.tcrouzet.com/images_tc/ecocity_ns.pdf|publisher=New Scientist Tech|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the city planned to divide its residential and commercial land into three compact districts divided by farms, parks, lakes, and pagodas. Additionally, residents would live in ecologically designed apartment buildings six to eight stories high but appropriately spaced apart as to avoid heat island effects. Although no construction of Dongtan has happened yet, these principles are generally applicable to all eco-cities.&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=SIno-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City: A Case Study of an Emerging Eco-City in China|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/01/17/000333037_20110117011432/Rendered/PDF/590120WP0P114811REPORT0FINAL1EN1WEB.pdf|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, increased urban density reduces [[urban sprawl]], thus, decreasing dependence on cars. According to Kenworthy, urban density is accountable for 84% of the variance in car travel.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenworthy|first=Jeffrey|title=The eco-city: ten key transport and planning dimensions for sustainable city development|url=http://eau.sagepub.com/content/18/1/67.full.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the compact urban layout of eco-cities, residents are able to easily navigate their surrounding environment on foot, by bicycle, or through use of public transportation. As a result, eco-cities avoid much of the negative effects of car pollution.

Additionally, by centralizing the population within a given area, eco-cities increase the amount of land that can be used for parks and [[urban agriculture]]. As such, eco-cities increase [[food security]] and promote ecological preservation within urban areas. Urban agriculture allows for “production of fresh food and vegetables, reduction on transportation load and enrichment of environmental quality” (Lim 2010).&lt;ref name="Eco-cities in Asia book" /&gt;

====Public health====
Eco-cities aid in creating healthier urban populations through the implementation of sustainable practices that improve environmental standards and, as a result, decrease the strain on [[public health]]. By employing practices that aim to reduce [[air pollution]], eco-city standards have an indirect effect on decreasing rates of [[respiratory disease]] within urban areas. According to the [[World Health Organization]], urban outdoor air pollution is responsible for over 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. Additionally, “the mortality in cities with high levels of pollution exceeds that observed in relatively cleaner cities by 15–20%."&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=Air quality and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the implementation of “clean” practices, eco-cities greatly assist in decreasing the disease burden placed on urban residents by decreasing the risk factors associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as various forms of cancer.

Additionally, the “greenspaces” that constitute the infrastructure of eco-cities provide a unique method of reducing air pollution and promoting clean air. Urban foliage naturally cleans the air by absorbing carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Green spaces also absorb airborne particulates and reduce heat, allowing for improved levels of public health.&lt;ref name="UNEP Green economy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Towards a Green Economy|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/Portals/88/documents/ger/GER_12_Cities.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Program|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decreased dependency on cars encouraged by the compact, walkable layout of eco-cities will also help combat [[obesity]] and other [[chronic diseases]] by encouraging frequent physical activity. The World Health Organization estimates that physical inactivity leads to 3.2 million deaths per year. 2.6 million of these deaths are centralized in low and middle-income countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Thus, by reducing urban sprawl, eco-cities may help decrease rates of [[coronary heart disease]] and [[stroke]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[colon cancer]], [[breast cancer]], [[osteoporosis]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Furthermore, by decreasing the concentration of cars within city limits, eco-cities are also able to reduce the number of preventable deaths among the working age population. It is estimated that traffic accidents kill 1.2 million people per year and is the leading cause of death among people under the age of 25 (WHO, 2011).&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

Increased access to affordable vegetation via urban agriculture also permits the improvement of public health conditions by making healthy foods more available and affordable. Lye and Chen note, “An eco-city must not become or be perceived as an enclave for only the rich and powerful but must welcome and be accessible to people from various walks of life."&lt;ref name="Eco-cities in Asia book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fook|first=Lye Liang|title=Towards a Liveable and Sustainable Urban Environment: Eco-cities in Asia|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4287-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By investing in urban agriculture, eco-cities can help eliminate the prominent issue of [[food deserts]] in urban poor areas. Expanded access to vegetables will in hand aid in decreasing rates of obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other chronic illness, especially among low-income residents.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt;

===Technology and urban layout===

====Transportation====

By decreasing urban sprawl, eco-cities decrease the residential and commercial dependence on automobiles. Concurrently, improved public transportation further decreases the demand for cars. The development of [[metro station]] and [[light rail transit]] systems provide mass transit not only within sectors of a city but between cities.&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities" /&gt;  Furthermore, many eco-cities are employing expanded “clean” bus routes in order to decrease the emissions from single household vehicles. Critics note, however, that the high price of “clean” diesel, [[CNG]]/[[LNG]], [[hybrid electric buses]], and [[super capacitor]]-powered buses may not prove “economically and operationally viable” (World Bank, 2009).&lt;ref name="World Bank- Tianjin Eco-Cities" /&gt;

====Urbanism====
[[File:Jakriborg, juni 2005 c.jpg|thumb|[[Jakriborg]] in Sweden, started in the late 1990s as a [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] eco-friendly [[Planned community|new town]] near [[Malmö]]]]
Eco-cities may also seek to create [[sustainable city|sustainable urban]] environments with long-lasting structures, buildings and a great liveability for its inhabitants. The most clearly defined form of [[Walkability|walkable]] [[urbanism]] is known as the ''Charter of [[New Urbanism]]''. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=2010-12-24 }}. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.

In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]] promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as opposing solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s.

====Landscape====
Eco-cities primarily employ [[green roofs]], vertical landscaping, and bridge links as methods of decreasing the environmental impact of land use. Constructing green roofs and investing in vertical landscaping create natural insulation for residential and commercial properties as well as allows for rainfall collection. Additionally, green roofs and vertical landscaping lower urban temperatures and help prevent the [[heat island effect]]. Bridge links allow for development of a walkable city without disrupting the soil to run utility lines by connecting buildings with above ground walkways.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Energy====
[[File:London Building With Integrated Wind Turbines.jpg|thumb|London skyscraper with integrated wind turbines]]
Eco-cities look to employ [[renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panels]], and [[biogas]], to reduce emissions. Wind turbines present the opportunity of being able to provide both localized districts within eco-cities and the larger region as a whole with emission-free renewable energy that can additionally supplement existing power sources.  Furthermore, by designing buildings with [[natural ventilation]] systems, eco-cities reduce the need for air conditioning, thus, drastically decreasing commercial and residential energy use. The energy generated can come from large scale energy production systems such as solar farms which supply many homes and businesses or from individual buildings energying at least in part their own energy from solar photovoltaic or small scale wind turbines or biomass.
Many eco-cities additionally look to deploy [[solar thermal energy]]. By installing [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]], developers will be able to provide hot water for space heating and individual and community needs while reducing dependence on gas fueled boilers. While solar thermal energy appears to be a more efficient source of renewable energy, many urban planners also view [[photovoltaics]] as a viable source of energy. Photovoltaics directly convert solar energy into electricity; however, the extensive costs associated with developing this technology on the city-scale may limit its use when compared to its potential payback.  [[Biogas]] technology is also deployed as a source of renewable energy as the organic material from wastewater is converted into fuel.&lt;ref name="Biogas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purac.se/2010/02/purac-launches-new-biogas-technology-eco-city-china/?lang=en|title=Purac launches new biogas technology for Eco-city in China|publisher=Lackeby Water Group|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
Eco-cities aim to decrease water consumption by employing technologies that reduce the amount of water that is needed for [[irrigation]] and sewage flow while also preventing [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and [[greywater]] runoff from entering [[ground water]] sources. Developers suggest installing [[low flow]] fixtures, [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] to meet eco-city standards. Additionally, advanced irrigation systems ([[xeriscaping]]) aid in maintaining [[green infrastructure]] while decreasing green space consumption of water for irrigation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Leading eco-cities==

===Curitiba, Brazil===
The city of [[Curitiba, Brazil]] proactively began to address the challenges of sustainable urban development in 1966 with a master plan that outlined future integration between [[urban development]], [[transportation]] and [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities"&gt;{{cite book|title=Eco2 Cities: Ecological Cities as Economic Cities|year=2010|publisher=World Bank Publications|author=Hiroaki Suzuki|author2=Arish Dastur |author3=Sebastian Moffatt |author4=Nane Yabuki |author5=Hinako Maruyama |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This plan has been realized in modern Curitiba, which is defined by linear stretches of urban development surrounded by green space and low-density residential areas.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; The city was designed for the mobility of people, not the mobility of cars. The city’s bus system is highly developed, with high-capacity busses and dedicated lanes, it effectively reaches about 90% of the population.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;  This bus system is utilized by 45% of the population, which has caused private automobile use to drop to 22%.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Despite this decline, to prevent congestion central areas of the city have been closed to cars. These road closures have led to dynamic economic growth for local shops and the development of community space for pedestrians.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

[[File:Curitiba Brazil Structure.jpg|thumb|Linear urban development in Curitiba contrasted with surrounding residential development]]

The resulting public health and education gains from this initiative have also been substantial. Curitiba maintains the lowest air pollution rates in Brazil and over 300,000 trees in the city helps reduce natural flooding.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Curitiba has also dedicated resources to [[environmental education]] in primary school, which has translated into environmentally conscious citizens. Over 70% of city residents participate in recycling programs which fuels the city’s progressive waste processing system.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

Curitiba has maintained a consistent vision of the future and worked to attain it by through careful urban planning that takes into account transportation, while also encouraging environmental initiatives and public health. In 2010, Curitiba recognized for their achievement with the Globe Sustainable City Award due to “their understanding of sustainable city development – both regarding policy and implementation.”&lt;ref name="Globe Award Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Globe Award|url=http://globeaward.org/winner-city-2010|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroville, India===

[[Auroville]] was founded in 1968 with the intention of realizing human unity, and is now home to approximately 2,300 individuals from over 45 nations around the world (substantially less than the 50,000 anticipated). Its focus is its vibrant community culture and its expertise in renewable energy systems, habitat restoration, ecology skills, mindfulness practices, and holistic education.

===Freiburg, Germany===
The city of [[Freiburg, Germany]], whose sustainable policies date all the way back to the 1970s, has constructed itself as a sustainable city by actively committing to its target areas of energy, transportation, and to its three pillars for sustainable development: energy saving, new technology, and renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway"&gt;{{cite web|title=Freiburg in a pathway towards a sustainable city|url=http://www.wwf.fi/wwf/www/uploads/pdf/sustainable_model_city_freiburg_in_germany.pdf|publisher=Gaia Consulting|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest motivators for success can be accredited to citizen’s engagement; in the 1970s opposition to local nuclear power led to the creation of a campaign for sustainable solutions for the energy needs of the city. A network of environmentalists, research organizations, and businesses was established, helping the agenda of a sustainable city push forward.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt;
	
Taking advantage of Freiburg’s location, educated and active residents, and political priorities invested in the environment and economy has led Freiburg to be considered a Solar Capital.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green City-Freiburg|url=http://www.fwtm.freiburg.de/servlet/PB/show/1199617_l2/GreenCity_E.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with high solar electricity rates,&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt; Freiburg hosts such innovations as the world’s first football stadium with its own solar power plant and the world’s first self-sustaining solar energy building.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt; In terms of both ecology and economy, Freiburg has been extremely successful in the fields of research and marketing of renewable energy. The Freiburg science network and solar industry embraces many research institutions, like the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]], Europe’s largest solar research institute.
	
In addition to solar initiatives, over the last four decades Freiburg has made improvements to their transportation systems.&lt;ref name="Germany to test first smart road in Europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany to test first smart road in Europe|url=http://www.slashgear.com/hamburg-germany-to-test-first-smart-road-in-europe-11396318/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freiburg has over 500&amp;nbsp;km of bicycle paths and more than 5000 bicycle parking spaces as well as car-free centers, 30 kph zones, a region wide bus service, and tram lines.&lt;ref name="Freiburg pathway" /&gt;
	
Long before it was taken seriously Freiburg was resolving to cut [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. In 1966, the city resolved to lower carbon dioxide by 25 percent by 2010. Although they did not reach their initial goal by 2010, they are continually extending their goals. By 2030, they resolved to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent and be climate neutral by 2050.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;

Freiburg also focuses initiatives on [[waste management]]. Paper products are composed to 80 percent recycled materials. Financial incentive programs, like discounts for collective waste disposal and people who compost, are used to increase waste avoidance. Since 2005, Freiburg’s non-recyclable waste has been incinerated and the heat energy released is converted to supply electricity to almost 25,000 households in the city.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;
	
Freiburg is a green city. 43 percent of borough area is woodland. In 2001, the Freiburg Woodland Convention was adopted and since 2009, the city officially supported the Freiburg Convention on the Protection of Ancient Woodland. For over 20 years Freiburg has worked to maintain their public parks with principles that work with nature: they no longer use pesticides, grass is mown less, and almost 50,000 trees line streets and parks.&lt;ref name="Greencity Freiburg" /&gt;

===Stockholm, Sweden===
[[Stockholm]] in Sweden has been an environmentally focused city that is redeveloping itself to become an eco-city through efficient [[urban planning]] and resource use. Stockholm has established six environmental goals, called Vision 2030, that act as the foundation of this initiative. These goals include development of efficient transportation, sustainable energy, land, and water use, waste treatment improvements, and safe building and product materials.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; Beyond Vision 2030, Stockholm is planning to be fossil fuel free by 2050.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

In terms of urban planning, Stockholm currently requires mandatory reuse of land before [[urban sprawl]] can continue.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This policy has led to complete revitalization of run-down and abandoned industrial areas that have been transformed into modern, efficient and integrated residential and business communities.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; The [[Hammarby Sjostad]] district of Stockholm is the primary example of this practice, as this resurrected industrial area has become twice as energy efficient as the rest of the city after an environmentally focused redevelopment.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

These gains are measured by the environmental load profile of the area, a [[life-cycle assessment]] tool developed by the City of Stockholm, the [[Royal Institute of Technology]], and a consultancy firm.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This unique measure allows for environmental performance analyses, on both the small and large scale, in terms of environmental costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; This comprehensive measure has allowed Stockholm to quantify their environmental progress and could be applied as a decision-making tool in other cities or districts to aid their environmental efforts.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt;

Stockholm has pursued [[green development]] and optimization of urban systems and achieved results. These efforts were recognized in 2010 by [[European Union]], which deemed Stockholm the European Green Capital for “leading the way towards environmentally friendly urban living.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Green Capital |url=http://international.stockholm.se/Stockholm-by-theme/European-Green-Capital/ |publisher=City of Stockholm |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524154357/http://international.stockholm.se/Stockholm-by-theme/European-Green-Capital/ |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adelaide, Australia===

'''Urban forests'''

In Adelaide, South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.milliontrees.com.au {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924184135/http://www.milliontrees.com.au/ |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar power'''

The Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the Museum, Art Gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.

'''Wind power'''

South Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In 5 years to 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theclimategroup.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste recycling'''

For Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced.  Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle/can/container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Despite the sustainability, efficiency and other established benefits of ecocities, actual implementation can be difficult to attain. Existing infrastructure, both in terms of the physical city layout and existing local bureaucracy, are major, often insurmountable, obstacles to large-scale sustainable development.&lt;ref name="World Bank Eco2 Cities" /&gt; The high cost of the technological integration necessary for eco-city development is a major challenge, as many cities either can’t afford, or are not willing to take on, the extra costs.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; New-build eco-cities avoid these problems.

Challenges associated with planning and managing sustainable programs are also large. Cities that want to become more sustainable are faced with retrofitting existing structures and concurrent management of sustainable urban expansion and development. The costs and infrastructure needed to manage these large scale, two-pronged projects are great, and beyond the capabilities of most cities.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; In addition, many cities around the world are currently struggling to maintain the status quo, with budgetary issues, high rates of poverty, transportation inefficiencies, and rapid [[population growth]] encouraging reactive, coping policy.&lt;ref name="Eco2 cities" /&gt; While there are many examples worldwide, the development of ecocities is still limited due to the vast challenges and high costs associated with sustainability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24060">'''Ethnic identity development''' or '''ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development''' includes the [[identity formation]] in an individual's [[self-identification|self-categorization]] in, and psychological attachment to, (an) [[ethnic]] group(s).  Ethnic identity is characterized as part of one’s overarching [[self-concept]] and [[Identity (social science)|identification]]. It is distinct from the [[ethnogenesis|development of ethnic group identities]].

With some few exceptions, ethnic and racial identity development is associated positively with good psychological outcomes, psychosocial outcomes (e.g., better self-beliefs, less depressive symptoms), academic outcomes (e.g., better engagement in school), and health outcomes (e.g., less risk of [[risky sexual behavior]] or drug use).

''Journal of Counseling Psychology, 54,'' 271-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes gaining knowledge and understanding of [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group(s)]], as well as a sense of belonging to (an) ethnic group(s). It is important to note that given the vastly different histories of various racial groups, particularly in the United States, that ethnic and racial identity development looks very different between different groups, especially when looking at minority (e.g., Black American) compared to majority (e.g., White American) group comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=1995|title=An update of Helm's White and people of color racial identity models|url=|journal=Annual Multicultural Winter Roundtable|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity is sometimes interchanged with, held distinct from, or considered as overlapping with [[racial identity|racial]], [[cultural identity|cultural]] and even [[National identity|national identities]]. This disagreement in the distinction (or lack thereof) between these concepts may originate from the incongruity of definitions of race and ethnicity, as well as the historic conceptualization of models and research surrounding ethnic and racial identity.  Research on racial identity development emerged from the experiences of African Americans during the civil rights movement, however expanded over time to include the experiences of other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Wij"&gt;Wijeyesinghe, C. L., &amp; Jackson, B. W. (2001). New perspectives on racial identity development. New York: NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of racial identity is often misunderstood and can have several meanings which are derived from biological dimensions and social dimensions. Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual's physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.&lt;ref name="Chá"&gt;Chávez, A. F. and Guido-DiBrito, F. (1999), Racial and Ethnic Identity and Development. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 1999: 39–47. doi: 10.1002/ace.8405&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Generally, group level processes of ethnic identity have been explored by [[social science]] disciplines, including [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. In contrast, [[ethnic identity]] research within [[psychology]] usually focuses on the individual and interpersonal processes.  Within psychology, ethnic identity is typically studied by social, developmental and cross-cultural psychologists.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Phinney, J. Ethnic identity. In A. Kazdin (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 255-259). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models of ethnic development emerged both social and developmental psychology, with different theoretical roots.

===Roots in social psychology===
Ethnic identity emerged in social psychology out of [[social identity theory]]. Social identity theory posits that belonging to social groups (e.g. religious groups or occupational groups) serves an important basis for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="Tajfel"&gt;Tajfel, H. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1986). The social identity theory of inter-group behavior. In S. Worchel &amp; L. W. Austin (Eds.), Psychology of Intergroup Relations. Chicago: Nelson-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in a group(s), as well as one’s value and emotional significance attached to this membership, is an important part of one’s self-concept. One of the earliest statements of social identity was made by [[Kurt Lewin]], who
emphasized that individuals need a firm sense of group identification
in order to maintain a sense of well-being.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Lewin, K. (1948). ''Resolving social conflicts''. New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social identity theory emphasizes a need to maintain a positive sense of self. Therefore in respect to ethnic identity, this underscores affirmation to and salience of ethnic group membership(s). In light of this, affirmation of ethnicity has been proposed to be more salient among groups who have faced greater discrimination, in order to maintain self-esteem. There has also been research on family influences, such as cultural values of the family. Also, specific aspects of parenting, such as their racial socialization of youth, can contribute to the socialization of adolescents.&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Chao, R. K., &amp; Otsuki-Clutter, M. (2011). Racial and Ethnic Differences: Sociocultural and 
Contextual Explanations. Journal of Research on Adolescence (Blackwell Publishing Limited), 21(1), 47-60. doi:10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00714.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatedly, [[collective identity]] is an overarching framework for different types of identity development, emphasizing the multidimensionality of group membership.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"&gt;Ashmore, R. D., Deaux, K., &amp; McLaughlin-Volpe, T. (2004). An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 130, 80-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of collective identity includes positioning oneself psychologically in a group to which you share some characteristic(s). This positioning does not require individuals to have direct contact with all members of the group. The collective identity framework has been related to ethnic identity development, particularly in recognizing the importance of personal identification of ethnicity through categorical membership. Collective identity also includes evaluation of one’s category.&lt;ref name="Ashmore" /&gt; This affective dimension is related to the importance of commitment and attachment toward one’s ethnic group(s).  A behavioral component of collective identity recognizes that individuals reflect group membership through individual actions, such as language usage, in respect to ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"/&gt;

===Roots in developmental psychology===
Identity becomes especially salient during adolescence as recognized by [[Erik Erikson]]’s stage theory of psychosocial development.  An individual faces a specific developmental crisis at each stage of development. In adolescence, identity search and development are critical tasks during what is termed the ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’ stage.
&lt;ref name="Erikson"&gt;Erikson, E.H.(1968). Identity, youth, and crisis. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
Achievement of this stage ultimately leads to a stable sense of self.  The idea of an achieved identity includes reconciling identities imposed on oneself with one’s need to assert control and seek out an identity that brings satisfaction, feelings of industry and competence. In contrast, identity confusion occurs when individuals fail to achieve a secure identity, and lack clarity about their role in life.

[[James Marcia]] elaborated on Erik Erikson’s model to include identity formation in a variety of life domains.  Marcia’s focus of identity formation includes two processes which can be applied to ethnic identity development: an exploration of identity and a commitment.&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;Marcia, J.E. (1991). Identity  and self development.  In R. Lerner, A. Peterson, &amp; J. Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence''(Vol.1). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia defines four identity statuses which combines the presence or absence of the processes of exploration and commitment: Identity diffusion (not engaged in exploration or commitment), identity foreclosure (a lack of exploration, yet committed), moratorium (process of exploration without having made a commitment), and identity achievement (exploration and commitment of identity).

Researchers believe and have frequently reported that older individuals are more likely to be in an achieved identity status than younger people. Evidence shows that increasing age and a wide range of life experiences helps individuals develop cognitive skills. This combination of age, life experiences, and improved cognitive skills helps adolescents and young adults find their authentic selves.&lt;ref name="Bra"&gt;Branch, C. (2001). The many faces of self: ego and ethnic identities. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 162(4), 412-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescents with strong commitments to their ethnic identities also tend to explore these identities more than their peers.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;Meeus, Wim.  (2011).  The study of adolescent identity formation 2000-2010: a review of longitudinal research.  In Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21(1), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors during adolescence ==
While children in early to middle childhood develop the ability to categorize themselves and others using racial and ethnic labels, it is largely during adolescence that ethnic and racial identity develops. Adriana J. Umaña-Taylor and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Umaña-Taylor|first=Adriana J.|last2=Quintana|first2=Stephen M.|last3=Lee|first3=Richard M.|last4=Cross|first4=William E.|last5=Rivas-Drake|first5=Deborah|last6=Schwartz|first6=Seth J.|last7=Syed|first7=Moin|last8=Yip|first8=Tiffany|last9=Seaton|first9=Eleanor|date=2014-01-01|title=Ethnic and Racial Identity During Adolescence and Into Young Adulthood: An Integrated Conceptualization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12196/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1111/cdev.12196|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; write about the following concepts as playing key roles during this stage:

Cognitive milestones include: abstract thinking, introspection, metacognition, and further development of social-cognitive abilities.

Physiological changes include puberty and development of body image

== Phinney's model of ethnic identity development ==

[[Jean Phinney]]’s model of ethnic identity development is a multidimensional model, with theoretical underpinnings of both Erikson and Marcia.&lt;ref name="Phinney"&gt;Phinney, J. S. (1990). Ethnic identity in adolescents and adults: A review of research. &lt;em&gt;Psychological
Bulletin, 108&lt;/em&gt;, 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phinney1989"&gt;Phinney, J. (1989). Stages of ethnic identity in minority group adolescents.
Journal of Early Adolescence, 9, 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Erikson's identity formation, Phinney focuses on the adolescent, acknowledging significant changes during this time period, including greater abilities in cognition to contemplate ethnic identity, as well as a broader exposure outside of their own community,  a greater focus on one's social life, and an increased concern for physical appearance.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;

Phinney's Three Stage Progression: 
*Unexamined Ethnic Identity – Prior to adolescence, children either give ethnicity little thought (related to Marcia's diffuse status) or are assumed to have derived their ethnic identity from others, rather than engaging in personal examination. This is related to Marcia's foreclosed identity status.  Knowledge of one's ethnicity is "absorbed", which reflects the process of [[socialization]].
Broadly, socialization in the context of ethnic identity development refers to the acquisition of behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group(s).&lt;ref name="Rotherman"&gt;Rotherman, M., &amp; Phinney, J. (1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney &amp; M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This process recognizes that feelings about one’s ethnic group(s) can be influenced by family, peers, community, and larger society. These contextual systems or networks of influence delineate from [[ecological systems theory]].  These systems influence children’s feelings of belonging and overall affect toward ethnic group(s). Children may internalize both positive and negative messages and therefore hold conflicting feelings about ethnicity. Socialization highlights how early experiences for children are considered crucial in regards to their ethnic identity development.

*Ethnic Identity Search- During the onset of adolescence, there is a questioning of accepted views of ethnicity and a greater understanding of ethnicity in a more abstract sense. Typically this stage has been characterized as being initiated by a significant experience that creates heightened awareness of ethnicity, such as discrimination. Engagement in some form of exploration includes an interest in learning more about one's culture and actively involving oneself in activities such as talking with others about ethnicity, reading books on the subject, and thinking about both the current and future effects of one's ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; This stage is related to Erikson's ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’, and Marcia's moratorium.
*Ethnic Identity Achievement- This stage is characterized by clarity about one’s ethnic identity. The achievement phase includes a secure, confident, and stable sense of self.  Achievement also is characterized as a realistic assessment of one's in-group(s) in a larger social context.  In essence, the individual has internalized their ethnicity.This stage is related to Erikson's achieved identity, and identity achievement of Marcia. Identity achievement is also related to social identity theory in that this acceptance replaces one's negative ethnic self-image.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;  Although achievement represents the highest level of ethnic identity development, it should be noted that Phinney believes reexamination can occur depending on experiences over time.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

More recently, Phinney has focused on the continuous dimensions of one's exploration and commitment to one's ethnic group(s), rather than on distinct identity statuses.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

==Applications==
Research reveals ethnic identity development is related to psychological well-being.  Ethnic identity has been linked with positive self-evaluation&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, M.L., Way, N., Pahl, K. (2006). Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: Patterns and psychological correlates. ''Developmental Psychology, 42'', 218-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic identity development has also been shown to serve as a buffer between perceived discrimination and depression.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, L., &amp; Ong, A. D. (2010). A daily diary investigation of Latino ethnic identity, discrimination, and depression. ''Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 16''(4), 561-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, commitment of an ethnic identity may help to abate depressive symptoms experienced soon after experiencing discrimination, which in turn alleviates overall stress. Researchers posit commitment to an ethnic identity group(s) is related to additional resources accumulated through the exploration process, including social support.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;   
Ethnic identity development has been linked to happiness and decreased anxiety.  Specifically, regard for one’s ethnic group may buffer normative stress.&lt;ref name="Kiang"&gt;Kiang, L., Yip, T., Gonzales-Backen, M., Witkow, M., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2006). Ethnic identity and the daily psychological well-being of adolescents from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds. ''Child Development, 77''(5), 1338-1350.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show many positive outcomes associated with strong and stable ethnic identities, including increased self-esteem, improved mental health, decreased self-destructive behaviors, and greater academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Ort"&gt;Ortiz, A. M., &amp; Santos, S. J. (2010). Campus diversity and ethnic identity development. Diversity and Democracy, 13(2), 5-7. Retrieved from http://www.diversityweb.org/DiversityDemocracy/vol13no2/ortiz.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that ethnic identity exploration may be related to vulnerability to negative outcomes, such as depression.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;  Findings suggest this is due to an individual’s sensitivity to awareness of discrimination and conflicts of positive and negative images of ethnicity during exploration. Also, while commitment to an ethnic group(s) is related to additional resources, exploration is related to a lack of ready-access resources.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;

Studies have found that in terms of family cohesion, the closer adolescents felt to their parents, the more they reported feeling connected to their ethnic group. Given the family is a key source of ethnic socialization, closeness with the family may highly overlap with closeness with one’s ethnic group. Resources like family cohesion, proportion of same-ethnic peers, and ethnic centrality act as correlates of within-person change in ethnic identity, but it is only on the individual level and not as adolescents as a group.&lt;ref name="Kia"&gt;Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., Baldelomar, O. A., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2010). Change in Ethnic Identity Across the High School Years Among Adolescents with Latin American, Asian, and European Backgrounds. Journal of Youth &amp; Adolescence,39(6),683-693. doi:10.1007/s10964-009-9429-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
Ethnic identity development has been conceptualized and researched primarily within the United States.  Due to the fact the individuals studied are typically from the United States, it may not be appropriate to extend findings or models to individuals in other countries. Some research has been conducted outside of the United States, however a majority of these studies were in Europe or countries settled by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

Further, researchers also suggest that racial and ethnic identity development must be viewed, studied, and considered alongside the other normative developmental processes (e.g., [[gender identity]] development) and cannot be considered in a vacuum - racial and ethnic identity exist in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Joanna Lee|last2=Tolan|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Durkee|first3=Myles I.|last4=Francois|first4=, Amir G.|last5=Anderson|first5=Riana E.|date=2012-09-01|title=Integrating Racial and Ethnic Identity Research Into Developmental Understanding of Adolescents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=304–311|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Research considers some studies of ethnic developments cross-sectional in design. This type of design pales in comparison to longitudinal design whose topic of investigation is developmental in nature. This is because cross-sectional studies collect data at or around the same time from multiple individuals of different ages of interest, instead of collecting data over multiple time points for each individual in the study, which would allow the researcher to compare change for individuals over time, as well as differences between individuals.

Another research consideration in the field is why certain ethnic and racial groups are looking towards their own expanding community for mates instead of continuing interracial marriages. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that Asian-American couples have been kicking the trend and finding Asian mates because it gives them resurgence of interest in language and ancestral traditions.&lt;ref name="Swarns"&gt;Swarns, R. L. (2012, March 30). For Asian-American Couples, a Tie That Binds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/fashion/more-asian-americans-marrying-within-their-race.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further research can be found and explored throughout the many different racial and ethnic groups.

Some researchers question the number of dimensions of ethnic identity development. For example, some measures of ethnic identity development include measures of behaviors, such as eating ethnic food or participating in customs specific to an ethnic group.   One argument is that  while behaviors oftentimes express identity, and are typically correlated with identity, ethnic identity is an internal structure that can exist without behavior.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong" /&gt; It has been suggested one can be clear and confident about one's ethnicity, without wanting to maintain customs.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; Others have found evidence of a behavioral component of ethnic identity development, separate from cognition and affect, and pertaining to one's ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Gaines"&gt;Gaines, S.O., Bunce, D., Robertson, T., Wright, B. (2010). Evaluating the psychometric properties  of  the Multigroup Ethic Identity Measure (MEIM) within the United Kingdom. ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research, 10,'' 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity development points toward the importance of allowing an individual to self-identify ethnicity during data collection.  This method helps us collect the most accurate and relevant information about the subjective identification of the participant, and can be useful in particular with respect to research with multiethnic individuals.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

In [[science]], '''experimenter's regress''' refers to a loop of dependence between theory and evidence. In order to judge whether evidence is erroneous we must rely on theory-based expectations, and to judge the value of competing theories we rely on evidence. [[Cognitive bias]] affects experiments, and experiments determine which theory is valid. This issue is particularly important in new fields of science where there is no community consensus regarding the relative values of various competing theories, and where sources of experimental error are not well known. 

In a true scientific process, no consensus does exist and no consensus can exist as the process is conducted scientifically in the pursuit of knowledge. If any party involved in the process stands to personally lose or gain from the result, the process will be flawed and unscientific. 

In a true scientific process, a theory is formed after a scientist - amateur or professional - has observed a phenomenon and has asked "why?" as a result. The theory is the answer the scientist creates using logic and reason to explain the phenomenon. The scientist then focuses on how to conduct experiments to test the theory incrementally and the theory is either proven to be true or false through repeatable and legitimate experimentation. Legitimate scientific experiments conducted by the person who formulated the theory seek to prove the theory false rather than prove it true specifically to counter the effects of bias.

If experimenter's regress acts a positive feedback system, it can be a source of [[pathological science]]. An experimenter's strong belief in a new theory produces [[confirmation bias]], and any biased evidence they obtain then strengthens their belief in that particular theory. Neither individual researchers nor entire scientific communities are immune to this effect; see [[N-rays]] and [[Polywater]].

Experimenter's regress is a typical relativistic phenomenon in the [[Empirical Programme of Relativism]] (EPOR). EPOR is very much concerned with a focus on social interactions, by looking at particular (local) cases and controversial issues in the context in which they happen. In EPOR, all scientific knowledge is perceived to be socially constructed and is thus "not given by nature".

In his article ''Son of seven sexes: The Social Destruction of a Physical Phenomenon'', [[Harry Collins]] argued that scientific experiments are subject to what he calls "experimenter's regress". The outcome of a phenomenon that is studied for the first time is always uncertain and judgment in these situations, about what matters, requires considerable experience, tacit and practical knowledge. When a scientist runs an experiment, and a result comes out of this, he can never be sure whether this is the result he'd expected. The result looks good because he knows the experiment he conducted was right or that the results are wrong. The scientist, in other words, has to get the right answers in order to know that the experiment is working, or to know that the experiment is working, to get the right answer.

Experimenter's regress occurs at the "research frontier" where the outcome of research is uncertain, for the scientist is dealing with "novel phenomena". Collins puts it this way: "usually, successful practice of an experimental skill is evident in a successful outcome to an experiment, but where the detection of a novel phenomenon is in question, it is not clear what should count as a 'successful outcome' – detection or non detection of the phenomenon" (Collins 1981: 34). In new fields of research where no paradigm has yet evolved and where no consensus exists as what counts as proper research, experimenter's regress is a problem that often occurs. Also in situations where there is much controversy over a discovery or claim due to opposing interests, dissenters will often question experimental evidence that founds a theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A house built on sand : exposing postmodernist myths about science|last=Koertge|first=Noretta|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0195117264|location=|pages=151-165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because for Collins, all scientific knowledge is socially constructed, there are no purely cognitive reasons or objective criteria that determine whether a claim is valid or not. The regress must be broken by "social negotiation" between scientists in the respective field. In the case of Gravitational Radiation, Collins notices that Weber, the scientist who is said to have discovered the phenomenon, could refute all the critique and had "a technical answer for every other point" but he was not able to convince other scientists and in the end he was not taken seriously anymore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problems that come with "experimenter's regress" can never be fully avoided because scientific outcomes in EPOR are seen as negotiable and socially constructed. Acceptance of claims boils down to persuasion of other people in the community. Experimenter's regress can always become a problem in a world where "the natural world in no way constrains what is believed to be". Moreover, attempts to falsify a claim, by replicating an experiment, are hard and problematic for it involves tacit knowledge (i.e. unarticulated knowledge), matters of time and money and replication of exact similar conditions, which is hard. Tacit knowledge can never be fully articulated or translated into a set of rules.

Some commentators have argued that Collins's "experimenter's regress" is foreshadowed by Sextus Empiricus' argument that "if we shall judge the intellects by the senses, and the senses by the intellect, this involves circular reasoning inasmuch as it is required that the intellects should be judged first in order that the intellects may be tested [hence] we possess no means by which to judge objects" (quoted after Godin &amp; Gingras 2002: 140). Others have extended Collins's argument to the cases of theoretical practice ("theoretician's regress"; Kennefick 2000) and computer simulation studies ("simulationist's regress"; Gelfert 2011).

In [[mathematics]], the '''affinely extended real number system''' is obtained from the [[real number]] system {{math|ℝ}} by adding two elements: {{math|+&amp;#8239;∞}} and {{math|–&amp;#8239;∞}} (read as '''positive [[infinity]]''' and '''negative infinity''' respectively). These new elements are not real numbers. It is useful in describing various [[limit of a function|limiting behavior]]s in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], especially in the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral|integration]]. The affinely extended real number system is denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--{{math|{{overset|—|ℝ}}}}--&gt; or {{math|[–∞, +∞]}} or {{math|ℝ ∪ {–∞, +∞}|}}.

When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol {{math|+∞}} is often written simply as {{math|∞}}.

==Motivation==
===Limits===

We often wish to describe the behavior of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as either the argument &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or the function value &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; gets "very big" in some sense. For example, consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The graph of this function has a horizontal [[asymptote]] at y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Geometrically, as we move farther and farther to the right along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the [[limit of a function]] at a [[real number]], except that there is no real number to which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches.

By adjoining the elements &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we allow a formulation of a "limit at infinity" with [[topology|topological]] properties similar to those for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

To make things completely formal, the [[Construction of the real numbers#Construction from Cauchy sequences|Cauchy sequences definition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; allows us to define &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all sequences of rationals which, for any &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, from some point on exceed &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. We can define &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; similarly.

===Measure and integration===

In [[measure theory]], it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering [[improper integral]]s, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

the value "infinity" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as      

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 2n(1-nx), &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le x \le \frac{1}{n} \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if } \frac{1}{n} &lt; x \le 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the [[monotone convergence theorem]] and the [[dominated convergence theorem]] would not make sense.

==Order and topological properties==

The affinely extended real number system turns into a [[totally ordered set]] by defining &lt;math&gt;-\infty\leq a \leq +\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. This order has the desirable property that every subset has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]: it is a [[complete lattice]].

This induces the [[order topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. In this topology, a set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it contains a set &lt;math&gt;\{x : x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt; for some real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and analogously for the neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[unit interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology is [[metrizable]], corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric that is an extension of the ordinary metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

With this topology the specially defined [[Limit of a function|limits]] for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tending to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the specially defined concepts of limits equal to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, reduce to the general topological definitions of limits.

==Arithmetic operations==

The arithmetic operations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be partially extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + \infty = +\infty + a &amp; = +\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq -\infty \\
a - \infty = -\infty + a &amp; = -\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq +\infty \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty] \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in [-\infty, 0) \\
\frac{a}{\pm\infty} &amp; = 0, &amp; a &amp; \in \mathbb{R} \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty) \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (-\infty, 0)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For exponentiation, see [[Exponentiation#Limits of powers]].
Here, "&lt;math&gt;a + \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a + (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;a - (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;", while "&lt;math&gt;a - \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a - (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and {{nowrap|"&lt;math&gt;a + (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;".}}

The expressions &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty, 0 \times (\pm\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty/\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; (called [[indeterminate form]]s) are usually left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]]. These rules are modeled on the laws for [[Limit_of_a_function#Limits_involving_infinity|infinite limits]]. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, &lt;math&gt;0 \times \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The expression &lt;math&gt;1/0&lt;/math&gt; is not defined either as &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, because although it is true that whenever &lt;math&gt;f(x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is eventually contained in every [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{-\infty, +\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, it is ''not'' true that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must tend to one of these points. An example is &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 1/\sin (1/x)&lt;/math&gt; which is of the form &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; but does not tend to either &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\sin (1/x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{\sin (1/x)} = 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^+}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^-}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[absolute value|modulus]] &lt;math&gt;|1/f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;, nevertheless, does approach &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Algebraic properties==

With these definitions &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' even a [[semigroup]], let alone a [[group (mathematics)|group]], a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[field (mathematics)|field]], like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is one. However, it still has several convenient properties:
* &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a + b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; are equal if both are defined.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a + c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a + c \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c \leq b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

==Miscellaneous==

Several [[function (mathematics)|functions]] can be [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by taking limits. For instance, one defines &lt;math&gt;\exp(-\infty) = 0, \exp(+\infty) = +\infty, \ln(0) = -\infty, \ln(+\infty) = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; etc.

Some [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularities]] may additionally be removed. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;1/x^2&lt;/math&gt; can be continuously extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (under ''some'' definitions of continuity) by setting the value to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; can ''not'' be continuously extended because the function approaches &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 from below, and &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; from above.

Compare the [[projectively extended real line]], which does not distinguish between &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, on one hand a function may have limit &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line, while in the affinely extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
correspond on the projectively extended real line to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus  &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\arctan(x)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be made continuous at &lt;math&gt;x = \infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line.

{{Wiktionary|fine}}

A '''fine''' or '''mulct''' is money that a [[court of law]] or other [[authority]] decides has to be paid as punishment for a [[crime]] or other [[Offense (law)|offence]]. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel |year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheel Clamp warning sign.JPG|thumb|150px|A warning sign in Singapore that states the fine for releasing vehicles that are immobilized with wheel clamps by Singapore Police Force officers.]]

The most usual use of the term is for [[financial]] punishments for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the [[settlement (law)|settlement]] of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. A synonym, typically used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] actions, is '''mulct'''.

One common example of a fine is money paid for violations of [[traffic]] laws.  Currently in [[English law|English common law]], relatively [[Standard scale|small fines]] are used either in place of or alongside [[community service order]]s for low-level criminal offences. Larger fines are also given independently or alongside shorter [[prison]] sentences when the [[judge]] or magistrate considers a considerable amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be significant danger to the public. For instance, [[fraud]] is often punished by very large fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or [[profession]] they abused to commit their crimes.

Fines can also be used as a form of [[tax]]. Money for [[bail]] may be applied toward a fine.

A [[day-fine]] is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income.

Some fines are small, such as for [[loitering]], for which fines range from about $25 to $100. In some areas of the [[United States]] (for example [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Washington D.C.]]), fines for petty crimes, such as [[criminal mischief]] (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) range from $2500 to $5000.

==Fines by country==

===England and Wales===
In the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], unless the context otherwise requires, the expression "fine", except for the purposes of any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any pecuniary penalty or pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/150 section 150(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 32 of that Act, the expression  "fine" includes a pecuniary penalty but does not include a pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/32 section 32(9)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In sections 15 to 32 and 48 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], the expression "fine" includes any pecuniary penalty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/65 section 65(2)] (as amended by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/schedule/7/paragraph/153 paragraph 153] of Schedule 7 to the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]]). This definition previously applied to section 14 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 before it was repealed by the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, there is now a system whereby the court gives the offender a 'fine card' which is somewhat like a [[credit card]]; at any shop that has a paying-in machine he pays the value of the fine to the shop, which then uses the fine card to pass that money on to the court's [[bank account]].

A related concept is the [[fixed penalty notice]], a pecuniary penalty for some minor crimes that can be either accepted (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork, or taken to court for normal proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.

Early examples of fines include the [[weregild]] or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] payable under [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[common law]] for causing a death. The murderer would be expected to pay a sum of money or goods dependent on the social status of the victim.

====Criminal law====

=====General information=====
The Dutch Criminal Code ''(Dutch: Wetboek van Strafrecht (WvSr))'' doesn't contain specific amounts for fines for every violation of the law. Instead of that the Criminal Code provides six fine categories. Every penalty clause of the Criminal Code contains a fine category. The categories are:

These sums are only an upper limit, it's up to the judge or the prosecutor to determine the exact sum of the fine. However, the amount of the fine must be at least €3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sums of categories are always 1, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 2000 times the amount of the first category. In addition to the fine, the convict also has to pay an administration fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006717/2014-06-07#Paragraaf3a_Artikel9b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit tenuitvoerlegging geldboeten - BWBR0006717|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; of €9.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts are established by the government, via a royal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the judge convicts an individual to a fine, the judge must also set a term of substitute imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitute imprisonment will be executed in the case that the fine remains unpaid. The judge may count one day imprisonment for every unpaid €25,&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; however normally judges reckon one day for every €50 which stays unpaid. Though, the substitute imprisonment must be at least one day (even though the fine was €3) and cannot exceed one year (even though the fine was €100.000).&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"/&gt;

=====Execution of a court imposed fine=====

Once a person is irrevocable convicted to a fine, it's up to the public prosecutor to collect the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the cjib ''(centraal justiteel incassobureau (English: central judicial collection agency))'' is established.

First, the CJIB will send the convict the fine. If the convict pays the fine the case is closed (by paying, the convict loses the right to go into appeal as well), if he doesn't, the case will be continued. The CJIB will then send the convict a reminder, though this reminder will contain an increment of €15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this doesn't lead to the payment of the fine, the CJIB will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fine continues to be unpaid, the CJIB will instruct a bailiff to collect the fine nonetheless. This bailiff may, for example, seize the convict's income and sell his possessions. If these measures do not result in the full collection of the fine, the bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum, but not the entire amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again. He also won't have to pay the fine anymore and the case will be closed.

====Frequently committed traffic violations====

=====General information=====
Before 1 September 1990, all traffic violations were punished via the criminal law. The suspects were first offered a sort of plea bargain. This mostly contains a fine. If the suspect didn't pay the fine of this plea bargain, the public prosecutor had to open a criminal case, otherwise he wasn't authorized to collect the fine through force. The case had to be withdrawn when the capacity of the courts or the prosecutor's office didn't allow the start of a criminal case for a traffic violation. This was the case very often. This situation led to a negative spiral, because traffic offenders hoped and expected their case to be withdrawn, and didn't pay the plea bargain fine. This led to a growing pressure on the capacity of the courts, which causes more sepots (decisions not to prosecute). This encouraged more offenders not to pay, etc.

In order to stop this spiral, the secretary general of the justice department (at that time), Dr. Albert Mulder, designed a new system of law enforcement. Under this new system, the government acquired the right of summary foreclosure. The summary foreclosure means that the CJIB can execute the fine directly, unless the fined subject goes to appeal.

The system regarding frequently committed traffic violations is regulated by Administrative Enforcement of traffic Rules Act ''(Dutch: Wet administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften (WAHV))''. According to the WAHV the maximum sum of the administrative fine is the same as the maximum amount of the first category (Art. 2 section 3 WvSr Criminal Code).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 3 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact fine per violation is determined by an annex of the WAHV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 1 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fine, the fined subject will also have to pay €9&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; administration costs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006847/2014-06-07#Paragraaf5a_Artikel11a|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften 1994 - BWBR0006847|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the administration costs will also be determined by the minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Process of the administrative fine=====
Once a subject has been fined by an officer or photographed by a speed camera, he will receive a decision within four months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 2 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision will contain a short description of the violation, the place and time the violation was committed and sum of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject will have two choices now. He can pay the fine or he can go into appeal. In contrast to the court imposed fine, when the subject has paid the fine, he will keep the right to go into appeal. The subject can go into appeal within six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/2016-11-03#Hoofdstuk6_Afdeling6.2_Artikel6:7|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Algemene wet bestuursrecht - BWBR0005537|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, the subject appeals to the public prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIV_Artikel6 Art. 6 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor shall withdraw the fine completely when he thinks the appellant has right. He will lower the sum of the fine if he thinks that the suspect is partially right. If the prosecutor thinks that the suspect isn't right, he will uphold the fine. As long as the prosecutor has not made a decision on the appeal, the suspect does not have to pay the fine yet.

Once the prosecutor has made a decision, the suspect will again have two choices. He can pay or he goes into appeal at the sub-district judge of his arrondissement (or the arrondissement of the place where the disputed violation was committed). But now, the suspect has to pay the fine as a surety.&lt;ref name="overheid.nl1"&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 11 section 3 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; If the suspect doesn't pay the surety, the judge will declare him inadmissible (thus the fine will be upheld).&lt;ref name="overheid.nl1"/&gt; The judge will have the same choices as the prosecutor. He can withdraw the fine, lower the fine, or uphold the fine.

If the (remaining) fine is higher than €70 and the suspect or/nor the prosecutor doesn't agree with the sub-district judge's verdict, the suspect or the prosecutor can go into appeal for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; He does that at the court of appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden in Leeuwarden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukVI_Artikel14 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal will be in writing, unless the appellant, per se, wants to do it orally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 20a section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; If the fine is lower than €70, or the appellant's appeal is rejected in Leeuwarden, there will be no legal remedies anymore and the case will be closed. The appellant's surety will be transformed to a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukVII_Artikel21 Art. 21 section 2 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3252">A '''glass crusher''' provides for pulverization of [[glass]] to a yield size of 2" or less.&lt;ref&gt;(American Recycler News, {{Citation
  |title = Glass Crushers|url = http://www.americanrecycler.com/dec03/spotlight.html|accessdate = 2008-12-18}})&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Recycling]] operations may range from simple, manually-fed, self-contained machines to extravagant crushing systems complete with [[sieve|screens]], [[conveyors]], [[crushers]] and separators. All non-glass contaminants must generally be removed from the glass prior to recycling. The processes used in glass crushing for [[recycling]] involves the same methods used by the [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] industry for crushing rock into sand ([[rock crusher]]).

==Vertical shaft impactor (VSI) glass crushing==

The use of VSI crushers in large scale operations allow the production of up to 125 tons per hour &lt;ref&gt;({{Citation
 |title=CEMCO Turbo&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; 54 Model Crusher 
 |url=http://www.cemcoturbo.com/index.php?page=turbo-54 
 |accessdate=2008-12-18 
}}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; of crushed glass [[cullet]].
 
VSI [[crushers]] use a  high speed [[Turbine|rotor]] with wear-resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the glass against. The VSI crushers utilize [[velocity]] rather than surface force as the predominant force to break glass as this allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the material as well as through the mass of the material. In its shattered state, glass has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force ([[pressure]]) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubicle [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]]. As glass is 'thrown' by a VSI rotor against a solid [[anvil]], it fractures and breaks along [[fissures]]. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the glass is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI crushing is generally of a consistent cubicle shape which may optimize yield in consumptive applications such as the fabrication of [[fiberglass]], ceramic ware, flux agents and [[abrasives]]. Due to the highly abrasive nature of the glass material, a VSI crushing process is generally preferred over Horizontal Shaft Impact and most other crushing methods with higher maintenance and lower wear part lives.

VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed glass (or rock in an aggregate applications). Utilizing cast metal surfaces '[[anvils]]' are traditionally referred to as a "Shoe and Anvil VSI". Utilizing crushed material on the outer walls of the crusher for new material to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as "rock on rock VSI".

'''Helen Peterson''' (native name: Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, August 3, 1915 – July 10, 2000) was a [[Cheyenne]]-[[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist and lobbyist. She was the first director of the Denver Commission on Human Relations. She was the second Native American woman to become director of the [[National Congress of American Indians]] at a time when the government wanted to discharge their treaty obligations to the tribes by eliminating their tribal governments through the [[Indian termination policy]] and forcing the tribe members to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate]] into the mainstream culture. She authored a resolution on Native American education, which was ratified at the second Inter-American Indian Conference, held in [[Cuzco, Peru]]. She created a model program for summer school programs on ethnic studies, which was used throughout the United States. In 1986, Peterson was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] and the following year, her papers were donated to the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Anthropological Archives]].

==Early life==
Helen Louise White was born on August 3 1915 on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in [[Bennett County, South Dakota]] to Lucy (née Henderson) and Robert B. White.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=178}}{{sfn|South Dakota Birth Index|1915}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1920|p=12-B}} She was given the native name Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, meaning "woman to trust and depend on".{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} The family lived in northern Nebraska and White attended [[Hay Springs, Nebraska|Hay Springs]] High School, graduating in 1932. She went on to further her education at [[Chadron State College]], studying business education.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} On August 29 1935, White married Richard F. Peterson in [[Garden County, Nebraska]]{{sfn|Nebraska Marriage Records|1935|p=188}} and she worked at the U.S. Land Use [[Resettlement Administration]] to pay their way through school.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} Richard enlisted in the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|war effort]] and Peterson had their only child, R. Max, soon after. In 1942, the couple divorced and Peterson moved with her mother to [[Denver]].{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}}

==Career==
Peterson began work at the [[University of Denver]] as the executive director of the Rocky Mountain Council of Inter-American Affairs. In 1948, she was hired by the newly elected mayor, [[J. Quigg Newton]], to work on the Commission on Community Telations. The mayor had a goal of desegregating the community and to do that, he needed voters willing to change the [[municipal charter]]. {{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} Working with [[Bernie Valdez]], Director of the Denver Welfare Department, Peterson attempted to build bridges between the established [[Latin American]] citizens and the new [[migrant farm workers]] who had come to work on the [[beetroot]] farms. She went door to door in [[Hispanic]] neighborhoods, registering voters and organizing the community. Peterson developed cultural programs and met with city leaders to provide lecture series on issues, such as fair labor and housing laws. At the end of the year, she was made the director of the Committee on Human Relations,{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} the first person to hold the post.{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} In that capacity, she led a drive to hire minority workers and assisted the mayor in passing anti-discriminatory employment and housing regulations.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=180}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} In 1949, she was asked to go to Peru as an advisor to the United States delegation attending the Second Inter-American Indian Conference.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|pp=179–180}}{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} She authored a resolution to improve education for indigenous people, which was ratified by the conference.{{sfn|Schultz|2000|p=670}}

In 1953, Peterson was urged by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to move to [[Washington, D. C.]] and help reorganize the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}}{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=180}} The organization, founded in 1944 to fight against the government's [[Indian termination policy]] was in disarray, on the verge of bankruptcy, and was facing pressure from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for its dissolution.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} Because of Peterson's experience in organizing minority programs, she was able to slow the [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilationist]] aims of Congress and assist tribes in asserting their own [[sovereign right]]s.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} Peterson was hired to replace Frank George, who had in turn replaced [[Ruth Muskrat Bronson]] as executive director.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=74}} 

Early in 1954, Peterson scheduled an emergency conference with tribal leaders to discuss termination. The meeting was the largest gathering of protest that had ever been assembled by American Indians,{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=99}} and was scheduled in response to the passage of [[House concurrent resolution 108]], which called for the end of federal responsibility for selected tribes, which were to be debated beginning on February 15, 1954.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=111–113}} She and her mother prepared the materials for the conference on a hand cranked [[mimeograph machine]] in her basement.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=99}} Another bill was introduced that year to eliminate [[Competence (law)|competency]] restrictions on land transactions and required Peterson to mobilize tribal leaders to wire their congressmen to defeat the bill. At issue was whether property patents would be assigned by [[Dawes Act|allotment]] directly to tribal members who had no real knowledge of property values or laws governing transfer, or whether the deeds to allotted property were held in trust until allottees actually had an understanding of property ownership and fair market value.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=116–117}} Her efforts in advancing Native Americans and fighting against discriminatory legislation was recognized by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]], which named her the "Outstanding Indian of 1955".{{sfn|''Edwardsville Intelligencer''|1955|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Neosho Daily News''|1955|p=1}}

As NCAI made progress in slowing termination,{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=118}} Peterson helped develop new tactics to protect Native rights, such as creating a summer school program with [[D'Arcy McNickle]] in 1956 for ethnic studies{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}} and convincing [[NBC]] to air a program on the policy and its effect on the [[Klamath Tribes]] in 1957.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=120}} In 1958, Peterson and NCAI president [[Joseph R. Garry]] went to [[Puerto Rico]] to study the methods of [[Operation Bootstrap]], which had transformed the economic relationship between the island and the United States government. They were hopeful that the program could be mirrored for Native Americans to become self-sufficient, but legislators refused to act.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=122–123}} In 1960, at the invitation of Sol Tax, an anthropologist, Peterson met with McNickle and John Rainer to prepare materials for a conference to be held in Chicago the following year. Largely drafted by McNickle the, "Declaration of Indian Purpose" for the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference contained provisions for a reversal of the termination policy to be replaced by programs focused on development of economic, educational, social and legal nature. The declaration also called for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to be replaced by a Commission of six members, half of whom were Native American, to evaluate issues effecting tribes.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=134–135}} As the conference date neared in June 1961, factions emerged. Some felt that the organized NCAI operated more in the manner of a non-Indian reform association, rather than one that used traditional methods to address problems, whereas others felt that its focus did not adequately represent the issues of tribal identity and reservation realities.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=137}} By August, the factionalism which had become apparent in planning the convention, created calls for restructuring the NCAI and Peterson resigned.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}}

Returning to Denver in 1962, Peterson again took up the post as the director of the Commission on Community Relations.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}}  The [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956]] caused a large influx of Native Americans to the Denver area, but Congress had failed to sufficiently fund the program.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=182}} Peterson's office tried to fill the gap by providing social and employment services, as well as job training for Denver's Native American community.{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=286}} Though no longer employed at the NCAI, controversy continued and her replacement, Robert Burnette, accused both Peterson and Garry of mismanagement during their tenure.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=143}} The dispute between Burnette and his supporters and Peterson and hers, continued through the 1960s dividing the NCAI membership. Burnette was forced out in 1964 and replaced by [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], who had the difficult task of trying to bring the organization back to financial stability and heal the factionalism.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=148–149}} After eight years, of directing the Commission, Peterson accepted a position with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), working as a field liaison officer and coordinator with the [[United States Customs Service]] in Denver.{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=286}} In 1971, she returned to Washington, D. C. and served as the assistant for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In 1978, the BIA transferred her to serve as a tribal government services officer in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Focusing on treaty obligations and Indian health, she worked to ensure that federal, state, local and tribal governments worked together in serving the American Indian community.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=183}} She remained with the BIA until her retirement in 1985.{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}}

The year after her retirement, Peterson was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]].{{sfn|Colorado Women's Hall of Fame|1986}} The following year, her papers were donated to the [[National Anthropological Archives]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. When the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] Archive Center was created in 2007, her papers were transferred there.{{sfn|Smithsonian American Indian Archives|1992}} Upon her retirement, Peterson devoted her time to local and regional projects in and around Portland for the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} She remained an active member in the NCAI through the early 1990s, participating in the 1993 [[Albuquerque]] conference held at the [[University of New Mexico]] on developing inter-tribal relationships.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=150}}

==Death and legacy==
Peterson died on July 10, 2000 in a nursing home in [[Vancouver, Washington]].{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} Peterson is credited with having led NCAI to stop, or at least slow, the termination movement while she served as director of NCAI.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}} The ethnic studies program that she and McNickle developed for [[Colorado College]] between 1956 and 1970 became a model for universities throughout the United States.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5140">'''Hierarchy of death''' is a phrase used by journalists, social scientists, and academics to describe disproportionate amounts of media attention paid to various incidents of death around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keating |first=Joshua |date=2013-04-22 |title=Is it wrong to care more about 4 deaths in Boston than 80 in Syria? |publisher=Ideas.foreignpolicy.com |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/22/is-it-wrong-to-care-more-about-4-deaths-in-boston-than-80-in-syria/ |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Definitions of the hierarchy of death vary, but several themes remain consistent in terms of media coverage: domestic deaths trump foreign deaths, deaths in the [[developed world]] trump deaths in the [[developing world]], deaths of whites trump deaths of darker skinned people, and deaths in ongoing conflicts garner relatively little media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |date=2007-04-19 |title=A hierarchy of death |publisher=Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/thirtytwodieinamericanuniv |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karpf |first=Anne |date=2001-11-28 |title=Anne Karpf: The hierarchy of death |publisher=The Guardian |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/28/september11.usa |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jeffrey |date=July 23, 2014 |title=Obsessing About Gaza, Ignoring Syria (And Most Everything Else) |publisher=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/obsessing-about-gaza-ignoring-syria-and-most-everything-else/374898/ |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=R.

==Commentary==
British media commentator [[Roy Greenslade]] has been credited with coining the term while writing on the newsworthiness of those who died during [[The Troubles]]. Greenslade continues to critique the phenomenon, including media reactions to the [[Boston Marathon bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=March 30, 2011 |title=Sian murder says a lot about media's values |publisher=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/sian-murder-says-a-lot-about-medias-values-6386595.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bostonbombings&gt;{{cite web |date=April 24, 2013 |title=The hierarchy of death: Boston's bombings shock us more than the silent drone war in Pakistan.

[[NPR]] discussed the disparity in media coverage between the [[2015 Beirut bombings]] and the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], which happened with a day of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/11/paris-beirut-media-coverage/416457/|title=Paris, Beirut, and the Language Used to Describe Terrorism|last=Ajaka|first=Nadine|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/456317759/is-there-a-hierarchy-of-the-importance-of-death-in-the-news-business|title=Is There A Hierarchy Of The Importance Of Death In The News Business?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish journalist [[Allan Massie]] has also written on the topic.&lt;ref name=bostonbombings /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Massie |first=Allan |authorlink=Allan Massie |date=16 April 2013 |title=Allan Massie: Keep Boston bombings in perspective |publisher=The Scotsman |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/allan-massie-keep-boston-bombings-in-perspective-1-2898057 |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar phenomenon==
The hierarchy of death has been compared to [[missing white woman syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Owen |date=2013-04-21 |title=Owen Jones: Our shameful hierarchy - some deaths matter more than others - Comment - Voices |publisher=The Independent |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/owen-jones-our-shameful-hierarchy--some-deaths-matter-more-than-others-8581715.html |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13273">{{For|the film|High Yellow}}
[[Image:Alexandre Dumas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|French novelist [[Alexandre Dumas|Alexandre Dumas, père]] was called "High Yellow" in a 1929 issue of ''Time'' magazine.]]
'''High yellow''', occasionally simply '''yellow''' ([[African-American Vernacular English|dialect]]: '''yaller''', '''yeller'''), is a term used to describe persons classified as [[African American|black]] who also have a high proportion of white ancestry.&lt;ref name="dalzell"&gt;{{Cite book

| isbn = 9780415371827

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was in common use in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century, and is reflected in such popular songs of the era as "[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]". It is now considered offensive.&lt;ref name="Herbst1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Herbst|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiZQH5gHuggC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 December 1997|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Yarmouth, Me., USA|isbn=978-1-877864-97-1|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
"High" is usually considered a reference to a social class [[Colorism|system in which skin color]] (and associated ancestries) is a major factor, placing those of lighter skin (with more European ancestry) at the top and those of darker skin at the bottom.&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Y. | last2 = Augustson | first2 = E. | last3 = Rutten | first3 = L. | last4 = Moser | first4 = R. | last5 = Yaroch | first5 = A. | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-2048-0_2 | chapter = History and Culture of Tanning in the United States | title = Shedding Light on Indoor Tanning | pages = 5 | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-94-007-2047-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  High yellows, while still considered part of the African-American ethnic group, were thought to gain [[White privilege|privileges]] because of their skin and ancestry.&lt;ref name="banks2000"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Yellow" is in reference to the usually very pale undertone to the skin color of members of this group, due to mixture with Europeans.&lt;ref name="herbst1997"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reading of the etymology of the word "high" is that it is a slang word for "very", often used in Southern English, therefore "very yellow" (as opposed to brown).

== Use as social class distinction ==
In an aspect of [[colorism]], "high yellow" was also related to [[social class]] distinctions among people of color. In post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[South Carolina]], according to one account by historian [[Edward Ball (American author)|Edward Ball]], "Members of the colored elite were called 'high yellow' for their shade of skin", as well as slang terms meaning [[snob]]bish.&lt;ref name="Ball2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Edward|title=The Sweet Hell Inside: The Rise of an Elite Black Family in the Segregated South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m39Aw5AGm4oC&amp;pg=PA269|accessdate=6 June 2013|date=5 November 2002|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-050590-5|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New Orleans]], the term "high-yellow" was associated with [[Creoles of colour]] "[[wiktionary:brahmin|brahmins]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.chss.montclair.edu/philrelg/popcults.html |title=Popular Culture as Religion: Faiths by Which We Naturally Live |author=Stephen M.

{{quote|social life was dominated by light-skinned 'high yellow' families, some pale enough to '[[Passing (racial identity)|pass for white]],' who shunned and despised darker African-Americans. The behaviour of high yellow society was a replica of high white, except that whereas the white woman invested in tightly curled permanents and, at least if young, cultivated a deep sun tan, the colored woman used bleach lotions and [[Madam C.J. Walker|Mrs. Walker's]] "Anti-Kink" or the equivalent to [[straighten hair]].&lt;ref name="Bradbury2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=David|title=Duke Ellington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIwz2nivT0sC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=6 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-904341-66-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some cases the confusion of color with class came about because some of the lighter-skinned blacks came from families of mixed heritage free before the Civil War, who had begun to accumulate education and property. In addition, some wealthier white [[Plantations in the American South|planters]] made an effort to have their "natural sons" (the term for [[children of the plantation|children outside of marriage who were produced with enslaved women]]) educated or trained as apprentices; some passed on property to them. For instance, in 1860, most of the 200 subscription students at [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] were the mixed-race sons of white planters, who paid for their education.&lt;ref name="University1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=James T.|title=Songs of Zion : The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa: The African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States and South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfWCqvkp_OUC&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=Jan 13, 2009|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536005-9|pages=256–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Aldine Press | last = Talbert | first = Horace | title = The Sons of Allen: Together with a Sketch of the Rise and Progress of Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio | location = Xenia, Ohio | year = 1906 | url = http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/talbert/talbert.html|page=267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social distinctions made the cosmopolitan [[Harlem]] more appealing to many blacks.&lt;ref name="Bradbury2005" /&gt; The [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]] of the [[Prohibition era]] "had a [[Racial segregation|segregated]], white-only audience policy and a color-conscious, 'high yellow' hiring policy for chorus girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5ZqkgzSFRMC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=high.yellow+1923|title=From Jazz to Swing: African-American Jazz Musicians and Their Music, 1890-1935|author=Thomas J. Hennessey|year=1994|publisher=[[Wayne State University]] Press|isbn=0-8143-2179-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was common for lighter-skinned [[African Americans]] to hold "[[paper bag party|paper bag parties]]," which admitted only those whose complexion was lighter than that of a brown paper bag.

In her 1942 ''Glossary of Harlem Slang'', [[Zora Neale Hurston]] placed "high yaller" at the beginning of the entry for colorscale, which ran:

{{quote|high yaller, yaller, high brown, vaseline brown, seal brown, low brown, dark brown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | volume = 55 | issue = 223 | pages = 84–96 | last = Zora Neale Hurston | title = Story in Harlem Slang | work = The American Mercury | accessdate = 2013-06-06 | date = July 1942 | url = http://www.UNZ.org/Pub/AmMercury-1942jul-00084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Applied to individuals ==
The French author [[Alexandre Dumas]], père was the son of a French [[mulatto]] [[general]] (born in [[Saint-Domingue]] but educated by his father in France) and his French wife. He was described as having skin "with a yellow so high it was almost white". In a 1929 review, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] referred to him as a "High Yellow Fictioneer".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737949,00.html|title=High-Yellow Fictioneer|date=September 30, 1929|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art and popular culture ==
The terminology and its cultural aspects were explored in [[Dael Orlandersmith]]'s play ''Yellowman'', a 2002 [[Pulitzer Prize]] Finalist in drama. The play depicts a dark-skinned girl whose own mother "inadvertently teaches her the pain of rejection and the importance of being accepted by the 'high yellow' boys". One reviewer described the term as having "the inherent, unwieldy power to incite black Americans with such intense divisiveness and fervor" as few others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/arts_entertainment/stage.php?ak=922|title=True Colors: Insightful ''Yellowman'' at Arena Stage|author=Jolene Munch|date=March 18, 2004|work=[[Metro Weekly]]
|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase survives in folk songs such as "[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]", which originally referred to [[Emily West Morgan]], a "[[mulatto]]" indentured servant apocryphally associated with the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. [[Blind Willie McTell]]'s song "Lord, Send Me an Angel" has its protagonist forced to choose among three women, described as "[[Atlanta]] yellow", "[[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] brown", and a "[[Statesboro, Georgia|Statesboro]] blackskin".&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/NewsE/11_06/words.html|title=Talking about words: How Many Words?|author=Richard W. Bailey|date=November 2006 |publisher=[[University of Michigan|Michigan Today]] alumni newsletter|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bessie Smith]]'s song "I've Got What It Takes", by [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]], refers to "a slick high yeller" boyfriend who "turned real pale" when she wouldn't wait for him to get out of jail.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt; [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s song "We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue" makes reference to a "high yellow girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/we-the-people-who-are-darker-than-blue-lyrics-curtis-mayfield.html|title=Curtis Mayfield – We The People Who Are Darker Than Blue Lyrics – MetroLyrics|publisher=metrolyrics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Big Leg Blues", [[Mississippi John Hurt]] sings: "Some crave high yellow. I like black and brown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeniecampbell.com/wiki/index.php?title=Big_Leg_Blues|title=Big Leg Blues lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 1988 album [[Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm]] by [[Joni Mitchell]], the song "Dancin' Clown" contains the lyrics "Down the street comes last word Susie, she's high yellow, looking top nice."

On [[Ice Cube]]'s album [[War and Peace Vol 2.]] released in 2000, the song "Hello" contains the lyrics "I'm looking for a big yellow, in 6-inch stilettos".

As recently as 2004, white [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singer-songwriter [[Teena Marie]] released a song titled "High Yellow Girl", said to be about her daughter Alia Rose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/gbase/Music/Content?oid=57159|title=Rhythm &amp; Views: Teena Marie, La Doña|author=Gene Armstrong|date=June 3, 2004|work=[[Tucson Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is biracial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-6072319.html|title=At home with Teena Marie and daughter Alia Rose|date=July 1, 2005 |work=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The related phrase "high brown" was used in [[Irving Berlin]]'s original lyrics for "[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steffen|first=David J.|title=From Edison to Marconi: The First Thirty Years of Recorded Music|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|pages=133|isbn=0-7864-2061-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In mathematics, '''Hopf conjecture''' may refer to one of several conjectural statements from [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] attributed to either [[Eberhard Hopf]] or [[Heinz Hopf]].

== Positively curved Riemannian manifolds ==

: ''A compact, even-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with positive [[sectional curvature]] has positive [[Euler characteristic]]'' 

For [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]], this follows from the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. For [[4-manifold|four-dimensional manifolds]], this follows from the finiteness of the [[fundamental group]] and  [[Poincaré duality]]. The conjecture has been proved for manifolds of dimension 4''k''+2 or 4''k''+4 admitting an isometric [[torus action]] of a ''k''-dimensional torus and for manifolds ''M'' admitting an isometric action of a compact [[Lie group]] ''G'' with principal isotropy subgroup ''H'' and cohomogeneity ''k'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; k-(\operatorname{rank} G-\operatorname{rank} H)\leq 5. &lt;/math&gt; 

In a related conjecture, "positive" is replaced with "nonnegative".

== Riemannian symmetric spaces == 
: ''A compact [[symmetric space]] of rank greater than one cannot carry a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature.'' 

In particular, the four-dimensional manifold ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should admit no [[Riemannian metric]] with positive sectional curvature.

== Aspherical manifolds ==
: ''Suppose M&lt;sup&gt;2k&lt;/sup&gt; is a closed, [[aspherical manifold]] of even dimension. Then its Euler characteristic satisfies the inequality''

:: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\chi(M^{2k})\geq 0. &lt;/math&gt; 

This topological version of Hopf conjecture for [[Riemannian manifold]]s is due to [[William Thurston]]. [[Ruth Charney]] and [[Michael Davis (mathematician)|Michael Davis]] conjectured that the same inequality holds for a nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean (PE) manifold.

== Metrics with no  conjugate points==

: ''A Riemannian metric without conjugate points on n-dimensional torus is flat.''

This theorem was proved by Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov, ''Riemannian tori without conjugate points are flat'', [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]] '''4''' (1994), no. 3, 259-269, {{doi| 10.1007/BF01896241}}, {{MR|1274115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism''' was established by the [[United Nations]] General Assembly in 2017. It designated 21 August as the International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism in order to honor the victims and survivors of terrorism. In 2017 alone, nearly three-quarters of all deaths caused by terrorism were in just five countries: [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], [[Nigeria]], [[Somalia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/ce2c29cc-764d-46e6-99c3-55e966503679 UN to mark International Day of Remembrance for victims of terror on Tuesday]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a statement by the UN, the day is meant to allow victims of terrorism to have their needs supported and their rights upheld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/events/victimsofterrorismday/index.shtml International Day of Remembrance and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism, 21 August]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15448">'''Internet art''' (often referred to as '''net art''') is a form of [[digital art]]work distributed via the [[Internet]]. This form of art has circumvented the traditional dominance of the gallery and museum system, delivering aesthetic experiences via the Internet. In many cases, the viewer is drawn into some kind of [[interactivity|interaction]] with the work of art. Artists working in this manner are sometimes referred to as '''net artists'''.

Internet art can happen outside the technical structure of the Internet, such as when artists use specific social or cultural Internet traditions in a project outside it. Internet art is often—but not always—interactive, participatory, and [[multimedia]]-based. Internet art can be used to spread a message, either political or social, using human interactions.

The term ''Internet art'' typically does not refer to art that has been simply digitized and uploaded to be viewable over the Internet. This can be done through a web browser, such as images of paintings uploaded for viewing in an online gallery.&lt;ref name="nydigitalsalon.org"&gt;{{Cite web

Rather, this genre relies intrinsically on the Internet to exist, taking advantage of such aspects as an interactive interface and connectivity to multiple social and economic cultures and micro-cultures. It refers to the Internet as a whole, not only to web-based works.

Theorist and curator [[Jon Ippolito]] defined "Ten Myths" about Internet art in 2002.&lt;ref name="nydigitalsalon.org"/&gt; He cites the above stipulations, as well as defining it as distinct from commercial web design, and touching on issues of permanence, archivability, and collecting in a fluid medium.

==History and context==
Internet art is rooted in disparate artistic traditions and movements, ranging from [[Dada]] to [[Situationist International|Situationism]], [[conceptual art]], [[Fluxus]], [[video art]], [[kinetic art]], [[performance art]], [[telematic art]] and [[happenings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

performed in collaboration created for an exhibition at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]] in 1983.

Media art institutions such as [[Ars Electronica]] Festival in [[Linz]], or the [[Paris]]-based [http://www.ircam.fr/ IRCAM] (a research center for electronic music), would also support or present early Networked art.

With the rise of search engines as a gateway to accessing the web in the late 1990s, many net artists turned their attention to related themes. The 2001 'Data Dynamics' exhibit at the Whitney Museum of American Art featured 'Netomat' (Maciej Wisniewski) and 'Apartment' (Marek Walczak and [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]], which used search queries as raw material. [[Mary Flanagan]]'s '[http://www.maryflanagan.com/perpetual-bed The Perpetual Bed]' received attention for its novel use of 3D nonlinear narrative space, or what she called "navigable narratives." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Such works pointed to alternative interfaces and questioned the dominant role of search engines in controlling access to the net.

Nevertheless, the Internet is not reducible to the web, nor to search engines. Besides these [[unicast]] (point to point) applications, suggesting that there is some reference points, there is also a [[multicast]] (multipoint and acentered) internet that has been explored by very few artistic experiences, such as the [[Poietic Generator]]. Internet art has, according to Juliff and Cox, suffered under the privileging of the user interface inherent within computer art. They argue that Internet is not synonymous with a specific user and specific interface, but rather a dynamic structure that encompasses coding and the artist's intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toby Juliff|first1=Travis Cox|title=The post-display condition of contemporary computer art|journal=eMaj|date=2015|volume=8|url=https://emajartjournal.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/cox-and-juliff_the-post-display-condition-of-contemporary-computer-art.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of social networking platforms, understood to be "web-based services that allow individuals to... construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system... articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and... view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system",&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{Cite journal

Early online communities were organized around specific "topical hierarchies",&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; whereas social networking platforms consist of egocentric networks, with the "individual at the center of their own community".&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; Artistic communities on the Internet underwent a similar transition in the mid-2000s, shifting from Surf Clubs, "15 to 30 person groups whose members contributed to an ongoing visual-conceptual conversation through the use of digital media"&lt;ref name="fournineone"&gt;{{Cite web

Internet artists make extensive use of the networked capabilities of social networking platforms, and are rhizomatic in their organization, in that "production of meaning is externally contingent on a network of other artists' content".&lt;ref name="fournineone"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7678">Many believe this to be an impossible paradigm (see below) but it's the basis of nuclear fusion. In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of energy. So, what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? The colliders combine and create energy. 

The '''unstoppable force paradox''', also called the '''irresistible force paradox''', '''shield and spear paradox''', is a classic [[paradox]] formulated as "What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?" The immovable object and the unstoppable force are both implicitly assumed to be indestructible, or else the question would have a trivial resolution. Furthermore, it is assumed that they are two entities.

The paradox arises because it rests on two incompatible premises: that there can exist simultaneously such things as ''unstoppable forces'' and ''immovable objects''. The "paradox" is flawed because if there exists an unstoppable force, it follows logically that there cannot be any such thing as an immovable object and vice versa.&lt;ref name=NFLS&gt;

== Origins ==
An example of this paradox in non-western thought can be found in the origin of the Chinese word for contradiction ({{zh|c=矛盾|p=máodùn|l=spear-shield}}). This term originates from a story in the 3rd century BC philosophical book ''[[Han Feizi (book)|Han Feizi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Han Feizi'' (韓非子), chapter 36, ''Nanyi'' (難一 "Collection of Difficulties, No. 1")'.&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, a man was trying to sell a spear and a shield. When asked how good his spear was, he said that his spear could pierce any shield. Then, when asked how good his shield was, he said that it could defend from all spear attacks. Then one person asked him what would happen if he were to take his spear to strike his shield;  the seller could not answer. This led to the idiom of "''zìxīang máodùn''" (自相矛盾, "from phrase spear shield"), or "self-contradictory".

Another ancient and mythological example illustrating this theme can be found in the story of the [[Teumessian fox]], who can never be caught, and the hound [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], who never misses what it hunts. Realizing the [[paradox]], [[Zeus]] turns both creatures into static stars.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Applications ==
The problems associated with this paradox can be applied to any other conflict between two abstractly defined extremes that are opposite.

One of the answers generated by seeming paradoxes like these is that there is no contradiction – that there is a [[false dilemma]]. Dr. Christopher Kaczor suggested that the need to change indicates a lack of power rather than the possession thereof, and as such a person who was omniscient would never need to change their mind – not changing the future would be consistent with omniscience rather than contradicting it.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczor, Christopher (2009). ''This Rock'', 20(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, an unstoppable force, an object or force with infinite [[inertia]], would be consistent with the definition of an immovable object, in that they would be one and the same. Any object whose momentum or motion cannot be changed is an immovable object, and it would halt any object that moved relative to it, making it an unstoppable force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=minutephysics|title=Immovable Object vs. Unstoppable Force - Which Wins?|date=2013-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA|accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deterministic universe may contain more than one of such forces/objects as long as they are never determined to meet in the entire history of such a universe.  Indeed, in the context of such a universe, one could redefine the words "irresistible" and "immovable" to "is never successfully resisted" and "is never successfully moved" (within the fixed history of said deterministic universe) instead of the counterfactual possibilities.  This is similar to the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] of the [[grandfather paradox]] in time-travel scenarios.

==Cultural references==

In [[Iain Banks]]'s novel, ''[[Walking on Glass]]'', a supremely satisfying solution to the paradox is given.

In [[DC Comics]]' ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], [[Superman]] encounters the Ultrasphinx, who asks "What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object?", to which Superman answers "They surrender."

At Wrestlemania III, color commentator [[Gorilla Monsoon]] described the match of [[Andre the Giant]] vs [[Hulk Hogan]] as "The irresistible force meeting the immovable object."

In the film ''Imagine Me And You'' (2005) the irresistible force paradox is a recurring theme first mentioned by H and last referenced by Heck who compares Rachel's love for Luce as the unstoppable force and himself as the immovable object saying, "What you're feeling is the unstoppable force, which means I have to move."

In ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', [[KITT]] references the paradox when he was faced with the possibility of having a [[Head-on collision]] with his prototype version called KARR, who has most of KITT's abilities including a nearly indestructible body.

In [[DC Comics|DC]]'s film ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008), [[the Joker]] references the irresistible force paradox in both his final scene, as well as his final dialogue between himself and [[Batman]]. The Joker attempts to ultimately explain the reason for Batman's inability to shed his Batman identity, saying, "You just couldn't let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you, huh? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever."

In the video game World of Warcraft, players could gain a mace named "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19323 The Unstoppable Force]" and a shield called "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=19321 The Immovable Object]". And humorously, there also appears an apparent resolution to the paradox with "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=25402 The Stoppable Force]" and "[https://www.wowhead.com/item=25407 The Movable Object]".

The rock band [[Jane's Addiction]] use this paradox in the lyrics of the song "Irresistible Force" on their album "The Great Escape Artist" (2011)

In season 5, episode 13 of [[Burn notice]], Oswald refers to [[Michael Westen]] as an "unstoppable force", and refers to himself as an "immovable object". (2011)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14336">In [[psychology]] ''and'' [[cognitive science]], a '''memory bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that either enhances or impairs the recall of a [[memory]] (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many different types of memory biases, including:

* '''[[Boundary extension]]''': remembering the background of an image as being larger or more expansive than the foreground
* '''Change bias''': after an investment of effort in producing change, remembering one's past performance as more difficult than it actually was.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Childhood amnesia]]''': the retention of few memories from before the age of four.
* '''[[Choice-supportive bias]]''': remembering chosen options as having been better than rejected options (Mather, Shafir &amp; Johnson, 2000)
* '''[[Confirmation bias]]''': the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.
* '''Conservatism''' or '''Regressive bias''': tendency to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies lower than they actually were and low ones higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Attneave | first1 = F | year = 1953 | title = Psychological probability as a function of experienced frequency | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 81–86 | pmid=13084849 | doi=10.1037/h0057955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischhoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Slovic | first2 = P. | last3 = Lichtenstein | first3 = S. | year = 1977 | title = Knowing with certainty: The appropriateness of extreme confidence | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 552–564 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.3.4.552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Consistency bias''': incorrectly remembering one's past attitudes and behaviour as resembling present attitudes and behaviour.
* '''[[cue-dependent forgetting|Context effect]]''': that [[cognition]] and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa).
* '''[[Cryptomnesia]]''': a form of ''misattribution'' where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.&lt;ref name="schacter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schacter|first= Daniel L. |year=1999|title=The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=3 |pages=182–203|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182|pmid=10199218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Egocentric bias]]''': recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was.
* '''[[Fading affect bias]]''': a bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker |first=W. Richard |author2=John J. Skowronski |author3=Charles P. Thompson |year=2003 |title=Life Is Pleasant—and Memory Helps to Keep It That Way! |journal=Review of General Psychology |publisher=Educational Publishing Foundation |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |url=http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/gpr72203.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-27 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.2.203 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124181254/http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/gpr72203.pdf |archivedate=January 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Generation effect]] (Self-generation effect)''': that self-generated information is remembered best. For instance, people are better able to recall memories of statements that they have generated than similar statements generated by others.
*'''[[Gender differences in eyewitness memory]]''': the tendency for a witness to remember more details about someone of the same gender.
* '''[[Hindsight bias]]''': the inclination to see past events as being predictable; also called the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect.
* '''Humor effect''': that humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor.
* '''[[Illusory truth effect|Illusion-of-truth effect]]''': that people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one.
* '''[[Illusory correlation]]''': inaccurately seeing a relationship between two events related by coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiedler | first1 = K | year = 1991 | title = The tricky nature of skewed frequency tables: An information loss account of distinctiveness-based illusory correlations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.1.24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lag effect''': see [[spacing effect]].
* '''[[Leveling and sharpening]]''': memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling. Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koriat |first=A. |author2=M. Goldsmith |author3=A.

* '''[[Levels-of-processing effect]]''': that different methods of encoding information into memory have different levels of effectiveness (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972).
* '''[[List-length effect]]''': a smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well.
* '''[[Memory inhibition]]''': that being shown some items from a list makes it harder to retrieve the other items (e.g., Slamecka, 1968).
* '''[[Misattribution of memory]]''': when information is retained in memory but the source of the memory is forgotten. One of Schacter's (1999) [[seven sins of memory]], misattribution was divided into source confusion, cryptomnesia and false recall/false recognition.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Misinformation effect]]''': that misinformation affects people's reports of their own memory.
* '''[[Modality effect]]''': that memory recall is higher for the last items of a list when the list items were received via speech than when they were received via writing.
* '''Mood congruent memory bias''': the improved recall of information congruent with one's current mood.
* '''Next-in-line effect''': that a person in a group has diminished recall for the words of others who spoke immediately before or after this person.
* '''[[Peak-end rule]]''': that people seem to perceive not the sum or average of an experience, but how it was at its peak (e.g. pleasant or unpleasant) and how it ended.
* '''Persistence''': the unwanted recurrence of memories of a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]].
* '''[[Picture superiority effect]]''': that concepts are much more likely to be remembered experientially if they are presented in picture form than if they are presented in word form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first= D.

* '''[[Reminiscence bump]]''': the recalling of more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than personal events from other lifetime periods (Rubin, Wetzler &amp; Nebes, 1986; Rubin, Rahhal &amp; Poon, 1998).
* '''[[Rosy retrospection]]''': the remembering of the past as having been better than it really was.
* '''Saying is Believing effect''': Communicating a socially tuned message to an audience can lead to a bias of identifying the tuned message as one's own thoughts.
* '''[[Self-Reference Effect|Self-reference effect]]''': the phenomena that memories encoded with relation to the self are better recalled than similar information encoded otherwise.
* '''[[Self-serving bias]]''': perceiving oneself responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones.
* '''[[Misattribution of memory#Source confusion|Source confusion]]''': misattributing the source of a memory, e.g. misremembering that one saw an event personally when actually it was seen on television.
* '''[[Spacing effect]]''': that information is better recalled if exposure to it is repeated over a longer span of time.
* '''Stereotypical bias''': memory distorted towards [[stereotype]]s (e.g. racial or gender), e.g. "black-sounding" names being misremembered as names of criminals.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Subadditivity effect]]''': the tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = A. | last2 = Koehler | first2 = D.

* '''Suffix effect''': the weakening of the recency effect in the case that an item is appended to the list that the subject is ''not'' required to recall (Morton, Crowder &amp; Prussin, 1971).
* '''[[Suggestibility]]''': a form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory.
* '''[[Telescoping effect]]''': the tendency to displace recent events backward in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent.
* '''[[Testing effect]]''': that frequent testing of material that has been committed to memory improves memory recall.
* '''[[Tip of the tongue]]''': when a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of "blocking" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''Verbatim effect''': that the "gist" of what someone has said is better remembered than the verbatim wording (Poppenk, Walia, Joanisse, Danckert, &amp; Köhler, 2006).
* '''[[Von Restorff effect]]''': that an item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items (von Restorff, 1933).
* '''[[Zeigarnik effect]]''': that uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8494">{{Disability}}
The '''medical model of disability''', or medical model, arose from the biomedical perception of [[disability]]. This model links a disability diagnosis to an individual's physical body. The model supposes that this disability may reduce the individual's [[quality of life]] and the aim is, with medical intervention, this disability will be diminished or corrected.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fisher|first1=Pamela|last2=Goodley|first2=Dan|title=The linear medical model of disability: mothers of disabled babies resist with counter-narratives|journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illnness|date=January 2007|volume=29|issue=1|pages=66–81|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9566.2007.00518.x|pmid=17286706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical model focuses on curing or managing illness or disability. By extension, the medical model supposes a "compassionate" or [[justice|just]] society invests resources in health care and related services in an attempt to cure or manage disabilities ''medically''. This is in an aim to expand functionality and/or improve functioning, and to allow disabled persons a more "normal" life. The [[medical]] profession's responsibility and potential in this area is seen as central.

== History ==
Before the introduction of the [[biomedical model]], patients relaying their narratives to the doctors was paramount. Through these narratives and developing an intimate relationship with the patients, the doctors would develop treatment plans in a time when diagnostic and treatment options were limited.&lt;ref name="Bury"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bury|first1=Mike|title=Illness narratives: fact or fiction?|journal=Illness Narratives: Fact or Fiction?|date=2001|volume=23|issue=3|page=263|doi=10.1111/1467-9566.00252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could particularly be illustrated with aristocratic doctors treating the elite during the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawrence|first1=Christopher|title=Medicine in the making of modern Britain : 1700-1920|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780415091688|edition=Digital Printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliance of doctors on the narratives of patients diminished with the growth of bio-medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewson|first1=N|title=The disappearance of the sick man from medical cosmology|journal=Sociology|date=1976|volume=10|issue=2|page=225|doi=10.1177/003803857601000202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) introduced a framework for working with disability, publishing the "International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps." The framework proposed to approach disability by using the terms Impairment, Handicap and Disability.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps,1980&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impairment = a loss or abnormality of physical bodily structure or function, of logic-psychic origin, or physiological or anatomical origin
*Disability = any limitation or function loss deriving from impairment that prevents the performance of an activity in the time lapse considered normal for a human being
*Handicap = the disadvantaged condition deriving from impairment or disability limiting a person performing a role considered normal in respect of age, sex and social and cultural factors

=== Components and usage ===
While [[personal narrative]] is present in [[Interpersonal communication|interpersonal interactions]], and particularly dominant in Western Culture, personal narrative during interactions with medical personnel is reduced to relaying information about specific symptoms of the disability to medical professionals.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"/&gt; The medical professionals then interpret the information provided about the disability by the patient to determine a diagnosis, which likely will be linked to biological causes.&lt;ref name="FisherGoodley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bury"/&gt;The medical professionals now define what is "normal" and what is "abnormal" in terms of biology and disability.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"/&gt;

In some countries, the medical model of disability has influenced legislation and policy pertaining to persons with disabilities on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ayecBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=medical+model+of+disability+china#v=onepage&amp;q=medical%20model%20of%20disability%20china&amp;f=false|title=The Development of Disability Rights Under International Law: From Charity to Human Rights|last=Kanter|first=Arlene S.|date=2014-11-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134444663|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nX-sDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=confronting+discrimination+and+inequality+in+China#v=onepage&amp;q=confronting%20discrimination%20and%20inequality%20in%20China&amp;f=false|title=Confronting Discrimination and Inequality in China: Chinese and Canadian Perspectives|last=Mendes|first=Errol|last2=Srighanthan|first2=Sakunthala|date=2009-04-18|publisher=University of Ottawa Press|isbn=9780776617800|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] (ICF), published in 2001, defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Disability is the interaction between individuals with a health condition (such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression) and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health|url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/|work=WHO|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The altered language and words used show a marked change in emphasis from talking in terms of disease or impairment to talking in terms of levels of health and functioning. It takes into account the social aspects of disability and does not see disability only as a 'medical' or 'biological' dysfunction. That change is consistent with widespread acceptance of the [[social model of disability]].

==Criticism==
The medical model of disability focuses on the individual's limitations and ways to reduce those impairments or using adaptive technology to adapt them to society. Current definitions of disability accept biomedical assistance but focus more on factors causing environmental and social exclusion. Uncritical reliance on the medical model produces unwanted consequences.

Among advocates of [[disability rights]], who tend to subscribe to [[social model of disability|the social model]] instead, the medical model of disability is often cited as the basis of an unintended social [[wikt:degradation|degradation]] of disabled people; further, resources are seen as excessively misdirected towards an almost-exclusively medical focus when those same resources could be used towards things like [[universal design]] and [[inclusion (disability rights)|societal inclusionary practices]]. This includes the monetary and the societal costs and benefits of various interventions, be they medical, surgical, social or occupational, from [[prosthetics]], drug-based and other "cures", and medical tests such as genetic screening or [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]]. Often, a medical model of disability is used to justify large investment in these procedures, technologies and research, when adaptation of the disabled person's environment might ultimately be more beneficial to the society at large, as well as financially cheaper and physically more attainable.

Also, some disability rights groups see the medical model of disability as a [[civil rights]] issue and criticise [[charitable organizations]] or medical initiatives that use it in their portrayal of disabled people, because it promotes a [[pity|pitiable]], essentially negative, largely [[disempowered]] image of people with disabilities rather than casting disability as a political, social and environmental problem (see also the [[political slogan]] "[[Piss On Pity]]").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The [[stereotypical]] behavior of people from [[Minnesota]] to be [[courteous]], reserved, and mild-mannered, is popularly known as '''Minnesota nice'''. The cultural characteristics of "Minnesota nice" include polite friendliness, an aversion to confrontation, a tendency toward [[understatement]], a disinclination to make a fuss or stand out, emotional restraint, and [[self-deprecation]].&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Annette|year=2008|title=Creating Minnesota: A History from the Inside Out|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]] |isbn=0-87351-633-8|pages=242, 243, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social norms ==
[[Playwright]] and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that ''Minnesota nice'' is not entirely about being "nice" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the [[social order]], and keeping people in their place. He relates these [[social norms]] to the literary work of Danish-Norwegian novelist [[Aksel Sandemose]], the fictional [[Law of Jante]], and more generally, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- actually commentary, but news citation format --&gt; | url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/12/14/syljones | title = The unwritten rules that tell Minnesotans how to be nice | first = Syl | last = Jones | date = December 14, 2009 | publisher = [[Minnesota Public Radio]] | location = [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] | accessdate = December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' discusses "Wobegonics", the supposed language of Minnesotans which includes "no confrontational verbs or statements of strong personal preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19970419/97_0419WOBEGONICS.htm "Wobegonics" on ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Saturday, April 19, 1997] Retrieved December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The generosity of state citizens has been commented on; the heavily-reported [[influenza vaccine]] shortage of late 2004 did not strike the state as hard as elsewhere since many people willingly gave up [[injection (medicine)|injection]]s for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]''. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/national/12flu.html In Minnesota, Flu Vaccines Go Waiting]". 12 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept has also received some support from the academic community; a national study by Peter Rentfrow, Samuel Gosling, and Jeff Potter done in 2008 found that Minnesota was the second most [[Agreeableness|agreeable]] and fifth most [[Extroversion|extroverted]] state in the nation, traits associated with "nice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00084.x |pmid=26158954 |title=A Theory of the Emergence, Persistence, and Expression of Geographic Variation in Psychological Characteristics |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=339–69 |year=2008 |last1=Rentfrow |first1=Peter J. |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel D. |last3=Potter |first3=Jeff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minnesota nice was an influence on the [[Coen brothers]] movie ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'', set in both Minnesota and neighboring [[North Dakota]]; a documentary about the making of the movie was entitled ''Minnesota Nice''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323262/ ''Minnesota Nice''] at [[imdb.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{creationism2}}

The '''omphalos hypothesis''' is one attempt to reconcile the scientific evidence that the [[Age of the universe|universe is billions of years old]] with the [[Genesis creation narrative]], which implies that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is based on the religious belief that the universe was created by a divine being, within the past ten thousand years (in keeping with [[flood geology]]), and that the presence of objective, verifiable evidence that the universe is older than approximately ten millennia is entirely due to the creator introducing [[false evidence]] that makes the universe appear much, much older.

The idea was named after the title of an 1857 book, ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' by [[Philip Henry Gosse]], in which Gosse argued that in order for the world to be "functional", [[God]] must have created the [[Earth]] with mountains and canyons, trees with growth rings, Adam and Eve with hair, fingernails, and [[navel]]s&lt;ref name="Gardner2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z1NdAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=9780393322385|place=New York|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ὀμφαλός ''[[omphalos]]'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "navel"), and that therefore ''no'' [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] evidence about the [[age of the Earth]] or [[age of the universe|universe]] can be taken as reliable.

&lt;!-- The omphalos hypothesis is a hypothesis in the sense of [[formal logic]], rather than a [[scientific hypothesis]].{{says who|date=April 2018}}  The term denotes the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] or ''hypothesis'' of a logical [[proposition]].{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What exactly is the antecedent here? "If one attempts to reconcile..."? And what is the consequent? ??}}  In this case, the proposition has two logical outcomes:  either the Earth is more than 10,000 years old, or the objective physical evidence of the universe's age is false.{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=What does it mean for a statement to be the "outcome" of a proposition? Propositions are supposed to have truth values.}} --&gt;
Various supporters of [[Young Earth creationism]] have given different explanations for their belief that the universe is filled with false evidence of the universe's age, including a belief that some things needed to be created at a certain age for the ecosystems to function, or their belief that the creator was deliberately planting deceptive evidence.

The idea was widely rejected in the 19th century, when Gosse published his book.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|title=The rejection of Omphalos: a note on shifts in the intellectual hierarchy of mid-nineteenth century Britain|last=Roizen|first=Ron|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1982|volume=21|pages=365–369|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219011828/http://www.roizen.com/ron/omph.htm|archivedate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It saw some revival in the 20th century by some Young Earth creationists, who extended the argument to include visible light that appears to originate in far-off [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].

==Development of the idea==

=== Pre-scientific sources ===
Stories of the beginning of human life based on the [[creation story in Genesis]] have been published for centuries. The 4th-century theologian [[Ephrem the Syrian]] described a world in which divine creation instantly produced fully grown organisms:

{{quote|Although the grasses were only a moment old at their creation, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise, the trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless like ... years old as they were fully grown and fruits were already budding on their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]]: Selected Prose Works|series=The Fathers of the Church|volume=91|editor=Kathleen McVey|publisher=Catholic University of America|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8132-1421-4|chapter=Commentary on Genesis.

=== 19th-century thinkers ===
By the 19th century, scientific evidence of the Earth's age had been collected, and it disagreed with a literal reading of the biblical accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This evidence was rejected by some writers at the time, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]].  Chateaubriand wrote in his 1802 book, ''[[Génie du christianisme]]'' (Part I Book IV Chapter V) that "God might have created, and doubtless did create, the world with all the marks of antiquity and completeness which it now exhibits."  In modern times, Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]] supported a similar position, saying that the objective scientific evidence for an old universe is strong, but wrong, and that the traditional Jewish calendar is correct.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, [http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/comments/AGEOFTHEUNIVERSE.htm "The Age of the Universe"].  "The solution to the contradiction between the age of the earth and the universe according to science and the Jewish date of 5755 years since Creation is this: the real age of the universe is 5755 years, but it has misleading evidence of greater age."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, the disagreement between scientific evidence about the age of the Earth and the Western religious traditions was a significant debate among intellectuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gosse published ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'' in 1857 to explain his answer to this question.  He concluded that the religious tradition was correct.  Gosse began with the earlier idea that the Earth contained mature organisms at the instant they were created, and that these organisms had false signs of their development, such as hair on mammals, which grows over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  He extended this idea of creating a single mature organism to creating mature systems, and concluded that [[fossil]]s were an artifact of the creation process and merely part of what was necessary to make creation work.  Therefore, he reasoned, fossils and other signs of the Earth's age could not be used to prove the age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His book sold poorly and was widely rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other contemporary proposals for reconciling the stories of creation in Genesis with the scientific evidence included the ''interval theory'' or [[Gap creationism|gap theory of creation]], in which a large interval of time passed in between the initial creation of the universe and the beginning of the [[Six Days of Creation|six days of creation]].  This idea was put forward by Archbishop [[John Bird Sumner]] of Canterbury in ''Treatise on the Records of Creation''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another popular idea, promoted by the English theologian [[John Pye-Smith|John Pye Smith]], was that the Garden of Eden described the events of only one small location.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A third proposal, by French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], held that [[Day-age creationism|the six "days" of the creation story were arbitrary and large ages]] rather than 24-hour periods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theologians rejected Gosse's proposal on the grounds that it seemed to make the divine creator tell lies – either lying in the scriptures, or lying in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Scientists rejected it on the grounds that it disagreed with [[uniformitarianism]], an explanation of geology that was widely supported at the time, and the impossibility of testing or falsifying the idea.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modern creationists ===
Some modern creationists still argue against scientific evidence in the same way. For instance, [[John D. Morris]], president of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] wrote in 1990 about the "appearance of age":
{{quote|When Adam was created, he no doubt looked like a mature adult, fully able to walk, talk, care for the garden, etc. When God created fruit trees, they were already bearing fruit. In each case, what He created was functionally complete right from the start—able to fulfill the purpose for which it was created. Stars, created on Day Four, had to be seen to perform their purpose of usefulness in telling time; therefore, their light had to be visible on Earth right from the start.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Did God Create with Appearance of Age?|first=John D.|last=Morris|year= 1990|journal=Acts &amp; Facts |volume=19 |issue=9|url=http://www.icr.org/article/1088/305/|accessdate=14 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He does not extend this idea to the geological record, preferring to believe that it was all created in the Flood, but others such as Gerald E. Aardsma go further, with his idea of "virtual history". This appears to suggest that events after the creation have changed the "virtual history" we now see, including the fossils:
{{quote|
This raises one more major point of difference, the handling of the Fall. Briefly, Creation with Appearance of Age runs into a theological snag with things like fossils of fish with other smaller fish in their stomachs: "Do you mean that God chose to paint, of all things, a facade of SUFFERING and DEATH onto the creation when He gave it this arbitrary appearance of age at the time of creation?" The virtual history paradigm recognizes simply that all creation type miracles entail a virtual history, so the Fall, with its creation type miracles (by which the nature of the creation was changed—"subjected to futility") carried with it its own (fallen) virtual history, which is the virtual history we now see. We do not see the original utopian pre-Fall creation with its (presumably utopian) virtual history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Correspondence: Virtual History|first=Gerald E.|last=Aardsma|url=http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/correspondence/virtual_history.php|accessdate=13 Feb 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The past president of the Missouri Association for Creation has said:
{{quote|
The appearance of age in the things which God created is a much-debated issue in contemporary Christian scientific circles. Can God—or more accurately—would God create something which at the very moment of its creation has the appearance of age? The short answer to this question may be: How Else? How, indeed, could God create anything that did not appear to us to be aged (like a fine wine) at the moment of its creation&amp;nbsp;... Maybe you thought of a visible star—depending on its distance from the earth, its light might appear to have been traveling for over a billion years to reach your eyes. All of these things would have the appearance of age and an ongoing process at the very moment of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticisms{{anchor|Last_Thursdayism}}==

===When did false history begin?===
Though Gosse's original omphalos hypothesis specifies a popular creation story, others have proposed that the idea does not preclude creation as recently as five minutes ago, including memories of times before this created ''[[in situ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Wilcox, ''God and Evolution:A Faith-Based Understanding'', Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 2004, 30,&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is sometimes called '''Last Thursdayism''' by its opponents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Counter-creationism Handbook|last=Isaac|first=Mark|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780520249264|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in "the world might as well have been created last Thursday."

The concept is both unverifiable and [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through any conceivable scientific study—in other words, it is impossible even ''in principle'' to subject it to any form of test, by reference to any [[empirical data]], because the empirical data themselves are considered to have been arbitrarily created to look the way they do at every observable level of detail.

===A deceptive creator===
From a religious viewpoint, it can be interpreted as God having "created a fake", such as illusions of light in space of stellar explosions ([[supernovae]]) that never really happened, or [[volcano|volcanic]] [[mountains]] that were never really volcanoes in the first place and that never actually experienced erosion.

This conception has therefore drawn harsh rebuke from some theologians. Reverend Canon [[Brian Hebblethwaite]]&lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=245 Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], biography online at www.GiffordLectures.org&lt;/ref&gt; for example, preached against [[Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell's]] Five-minute hypothesis:&lt;ref name=russell5 /&gt;
{{quotation|Bertrand Russell wrote, in ''The Analysis of Mind'': "There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past.".&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, Analysis of Mind, London, ([1921]1924), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The basis for Hebblethwaite's objection, however, is the presumption of a God that would not deceive people about their very humanity—an unprovable presumption that the omphalos hypothesis rejects at the outset. Hebblethwaite also suggests that God necessarily had to create certain elements of the Universe in combination with the creation of man:

{{quotation|To be an adult human being, we have to have gone through a real process of growth and nurture and a real history of interpersonal relation in a real and specific culture. One can even suggest that it is necessary for the Creator to have fashioned us in and through a whole evolving physical universe. As, again, Austin Farrer put it, "if God wished to make no more than any single one of us, he would need to make half a universe. And why? Because no one of us would be the creature he is, if a thousand thousand lines of converging history, both physical and personal, had not met in him. Your life or mine is but a half-sentence in the book of the world. Tear it from its place, and it cannot be read; or if it can be read, it signifies nothing".&lt;ref name="Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite"&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/files/christchair/Hebblethwaite%20In%20Defence%20of%20Christianity.pdf Reverend Canon Brian Hebblethwaite], In Defence of Christianity March 6, 2005, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Brian Hebblethwaite]]|source=}}

In a rebuttal of the claim that God might have implanted a false history of the age of the Universe in order to test our faith in the truth of the Torah, [[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]], an author whose works have been banned by several [[Haredi]] rabbis for going against the tenets of the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Safran, [http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm "Gedolei Yisroel Condemn Rabbi Nosson Slifkin's Books"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229212121/http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5765/bo/aslifkin.htm |date=2007-12-29 }}. Dei'ah veDibur, January 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

{{quotation|God essentially created two conflicting accounts of Creation: one in nature, and one in the [[Torah]]. How can it be determined which is the real story, and which is the fake designed to mislead us? One could equally propose that it is nature which presents the real story, and that the Torah was devised by God to test us with a fake history!

One has to be able to rely on God's truthfulness if religion is to function. Or, to put it another way—if God went to enormous lengths to convince us that the world is billions of years old, who are we to disagree?&lt;ref&gt;Slifkin, p167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Five-minute hypothesis===
The '''five-minute hypothesis''' is a [[skeptical hypothesis]] put forth by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, with human [[memory]] and all other signs of history included. It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme [[philosophical skepticism]] with regard to memory.&lt;ref name=russell5&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Russell | first1 = Bertrand | authorlink1 = Bertrand Russell | title = Analysis of Mind | year = 1921 | publisher = G.

===Borges's ''Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius''===
[[Jorge Luis Borges]], in his 1940 work, ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', describes a fictional world in which some essentially follow as a religious belief a philosophy much like Russell's discussion on the [[logical extreme]] of Gosse's theory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://interglacial.com/~sburke/pub/Borges_-_Tlon,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius.html#backto2 Borges - Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physis''' (Greek: {{lang|grc|φύσις|italic=yes}} ''phusis'') is a Greek [[theology|theological]], [[philosophy|philosophical]], and [[science|scientific]] term usually translated into English as "[[nature (philosophy)|nature]]".

The term is central to [[Greek philosophy]], and as a consequence to [[Western philosophy]] as a whole.
In [[pre-Socratic]] usage, ''phusis'' contrasted with {{lang|grc|νόμος}} ''nomos'' "law, human convention"
Since  [[Aristotle]], however, the ''physical'' (the subject matter of ''[[physics]]'', properly  {{lang|grc|τὰ φυσικά}} "natural things") has more typically  been juxtaposed to the ''[[metaphysics|metaphysical]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in Aristotle's works so titled, ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' "Physis, translated since the Third Century B.C. usually as "nature" and less frequently as "essence", means one thing for the presocratic philosophers and quite another thing for Plato." Welch, Kathleen Ethel. "Keywords from Classical Rhetoric: The Example of Physis." Rhetoric Society Quarterly 17.2 (1987): 193-204. Print.
The Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ''Evolving Concepts of Nature''. Proceedings of the Plenary Session, 24–28 October 2014, Acta 23, Vatican City, 2015. [http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/publications/acta/acta23.html link].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-socratic usage ==
The word φύσις is a verbal noun based on [[:wikt:φύω|φύω]] "to grow, to appear" ([[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰuH-|cognate]] with English "to be"). In [[Homeric Greek]] it is used quite literally, of the manner of growth of a particular species of plant.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3:  {{lang|grc|ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε}}. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]''  (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt;  

In [[pre-Socratic philosophers|pre-Socratic]] philosophy, beginning with [[Heraclitus]], ''phusis'' in keeping with its etymology of "growing, becoming" is always used in the sense of the "natural" ''development'', although the focus might lie either with the origin, or the process, or the end result of the process. There is some evidence that by the 6th century BC, beginning with the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian School]], the word could also be used 
in the comprehensive sense, as referring to "''all'' things", as it were "Nature" in the sense of "[[Universe]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2005, p. 3.
Guthrie, W. K. C., ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.{{page needed|date=December 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sophist]] tradition, the term stood in opposition to ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}), "[[law]]" or "[[convention (norm)|custom]]", in the debate on which parts of human existence are natural, and which are due to convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunkie |first1=Roger |title=The Classical Origins of Western Culture: The Core Studies 1 Study Guide |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/studygde.htm |accessdate=30 January 2012 |series=Brooklyn College Core Curriculum Series |date=1986 |publisher=[[Brooklyn College]] |location=[[Brooklyn, NY]]  |chapter=Philosophical background of the 5th Century B.C. |chapterurl=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/studyguide/sophists.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast of ''phisis'' vs. ''[[:wikt:nomos|nomos]]'' could be applied to any subject, much like the modern contrast of "[[nature vs. nurture]]".

== In Plato's Laws ==
In book 10 of ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', Plato criticizes those who write works ''peri phuseōs''. The criticism is that such authors tend to focus on a purely "naturalistic" explanation of the world, ignoring the role of "intention" or ''technē'', and thus becoming prone to the error of naive [[History_of_atheism#Classical_Greece_and_Rome|atheism]]. Plato accuses even [[Theogony|Hesiod]] of this, for the reason that the gods in Hesiod "grow" out of primordial entities after the physical universe had been established.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Naddaf, ''The Greek Concept of Nature'' (2005), 1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turns out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist ''by'' nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise."
::— Plato's Laws, Book 10(892c) – ''translation by Benjamin Jowett''

== Aristotle ==
Aristotle sought out the definition of "physis" to prove that there was more than one definition of "physis", and more than one way to interpret nature. "Though Aristotle retains the ancient sense of "physis" as growth, he insists that an adequate definition of "physis" requires the different perspectives of the [[four causes]] (aitia): material, efficient, formal, and final."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed"&gt;Atwill, Janet. "The Interstices of Nature, Spontaneity, and Chance." Rhetoric Reclaimed: Aristotle and the Liberal Arts Tradition. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1998. N. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that nature itself contained its own source of matter (material), power/motion (efficiency), form, and end (final). A unique feature about Aristotle's definition of "physis" was his relationship between art and nature. Aristotle said that "physis" (nature) is dependent on [[techne]] (art). "The critical distinction between art and nature concerns their different efficient causes: nature is its own source of motion, whereas techne always requires a source of motion outside itself."&lt;ref name="Rhetoric Reclaimed" /&gt; What Aristotle was trying to bring to light, was that art does not contain within itself its form or source of motion. Consider the process of an acorn becoming an oak tree. This is a natural process that has its own driving force behind it. There is no external force pushing this acorn to its final state, rather it is progressively developing towards one specific end ([[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]).


==Biblical usage==
Though φύσις was often used in Hellenistic philosophy, it is used only 14 times in the New Testament (10 of those in the writings of Paul).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning varies throughout Paul's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=[[Zondervan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One usage refers to the established or natural order of things, as in ''Romans 2:14'' where Paul writes "For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by ''nature'' do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|2:14|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use of φύσις in the sense of "natural order" is ''Romans 1:26'' where he writes "the men likewise gave up ''natural'' relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Romans|1:26-1:27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danker|first1=Frederick W.|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature|date=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''1 Corinthians 11:14'', Paul asks "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|11:13|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balz|first1=Horst Robert|title=Exegetical dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Michigan1994|isbn=9780802828033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of φύσις as referring to a "natural order" in ''Romans 1:26'' and ''1 Corinthians 11:14''  may have been influenced by [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Greek philosophers, including [[Aristotle]] and the Stoics are credited with distinguishing between man-made laws and a [[natural law]] of universal validity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World|date=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-1250.|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gerhard Kittel]] states that the Stoic philosophers were not able to combine the concepts of νόμος (law) and φύσις (nature) to produce the concept of "natural law" in the sense that was made possible by [[Judeo-Christian]] theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kittel|first1=Gerhard|title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament|publisher=Eerdman's Publishing Company|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline theology]] of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] by [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], Paul writes in ''Ephesians 2:3'' that "we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by ''nature'' children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. In the next verse he writes, "by grace you have been saved." &lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Ephesians|2:3-2:4|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verbrugge|first1=Verlyn D.|title=New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology|date=2000|publisher=Zondervan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in patristic theology ==
Theologians of the early Christian period differed in the usage of this term. In [[School of Antioch|Antiochene]] circles, it connoted the humanity or divinity of Christ conceived as a concrete set of characteristics or attributes. In [[Alexandrian School|Alexandrine]] thinking, it meant a concrete individual or independent existent and approximated to [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] without being a synonym.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&amp;C Black(1965) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  While it refers to much the same thing as [[ousia]] it is more empirical and descriptive focussing on function while ousia is metaphysical and focuses more on reality.&lt;ref name="GiPT"&gt;Prestige, G.L. ''God in Patristic Thought'', SPCK (1964), p.234&lt;/ref&gt; Although found in the context of the [[Trinity|Trinitarian debate]], it is chiefly important in the [[Christology]] of [[Cyril of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="GiPT"/&gt;

== Modern usage ==
The Greek adjective ''phusikos'' is represented  in various forms in modern English:
As ''[[physics]]'' "the study of nature", as ''[[:wikt:physical|physical]]'' (via Middle Latin ''physicalis'') referring both to physics (the study of nature, the material universe) and to the [[human body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physical |title=Physical |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=20 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[physiology]] (''physiologia'') is of 16th-century coinage ([[Jean Fernel]]). The term ''physique'', for "the bodily constitution of a person", is a 19th-century loan from French. 

In medicine the suffix ''-physis'' occurs in such compounds as ''[[symphysis]]'', ''[[epiphysis]]'', and a few others, in the sense of "a growth". The physis also refers to the "[[Epiphyseal plate|growth plate]]", or site of growth at the end of long bones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5910">A '''Poincaré plot''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]], is a species of [[recurrence plot]] used to quantify [[self-similarity]] in processes, usually [[periodic function]]s.  It is also known as a '''return map'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.math.yale.edu/public_html/People/frame/Fractals/Chaos/ReturnMap/ReturnExpl.html Yale Fractal Geometry Course Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722032226/http://www.cbi.dongnocchi.it/glossary/ReturnMap.html GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF CARDIOVASCULAR DATA]&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré plots can be used to distinguish [[Chaos theory| chaos]] from randomness by embedding a data set into a higher-dimensional [[state space]].

Given a time series of the form

: &lt;math&gt;x_t, x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, \ldots, &lt;/math&gt;

a return map in its simplest form first plots (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt;), then plots (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+2&lt;/sub&gt;), then (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''+3&lt;/sub&gt;), and so on.

==Applications in electrocardiography==
An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is a tracing of the voltage changes in the chest generated by the heart, whose contraction in the normal person is triggered by an electrical impulse that originates the [[sinoatrial node]]. The ECG normally consists of a series of waves, labeled the P, Q, R, S and T waves. The P wave represents [[Depolarization#Heart|depolarization]] of the [[Atrium_(heart)|atria]], Q-R-S series of waves the depolarization of the [[Ventricle_(heart)|ventricles]], and T wave the [[repolarization]] of the ventricles. The interval between two successive R waves (the RR interval) is a measure of the heart rate.

The heart rate normally varies slightly: during a deep breath, it speeds up and during a deep exhalation, it slows down. (The RR interval will shorten when the heart speeds up, and lengthen when it slows.) An [[Heart_rate_turbulence#History|RR]] tachograph is a graph of the numerical value of the RR-interval versus time. 

In the context of [[Heart_rate#Electronic_measurement|RR tachography]], a Poincaré plot is a graph of RR(''n'') on the ''x''-axis versus RR(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) (the succeeding RR interval) on the ''y''-axis, i.e. one takes a sequence of intervals and plots each interval against the following interval.&lt;ref&gt;

In the present investigation, we assessed the use of various fractal analysis methods of HR variability to predict death in a population of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) and depressed left ventricular function. The prediction of death was evaluated in survivors of acute MI included in the Danish Investigations of Arrhythmia and Mortality on Dofetilide (DIAMOND-MI) trial.

The recurrence plot is used as a standard visualizing technique to detect the presence of oscillations in non-linear dynamic systems. In the context of electrocardiography, the rate of the healthy heart is normally tightly controlled by the body's regulatory mechanisms (specifically, by the [[autonomic nervous system]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12519">The '''principle of transformation groups''' is a rule for assigning ''epistemic'' probabilities in a statistical inference problem.  It was first suggested by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Edwin T. Jaynes]] &lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen as a generalisation of the [[principle of indifference]].

This can be seen as a method to create ''objective ignorance probabilities'' in the sense that two people who apply the principle and are confronted with the same information will assign the same probabilities.

== Motivation and description of the method ==
The method is motivated by the following normative principle, or desideratum:

''In two problems where we have the same prior information we should assign the same prior probabilities''

The method then comes about from "transforming" a given problem into an equivalent one.  This method has close connections with [[group theory]], and to a large extent is about finding symmetry in a given problem, and then exploiting this symmetry to assign prior probabilities.

In problems with discrete variables (e.g. dice, cards, categorical data) the principle reduces to the [[principle of indifference]], as the "symmetry" in the discrete case is a permutation of the labels, that is the [[permutation group]] is the relevant transformation group for this problem.

In problems with continuous variables, this method generally reduces to solving a [[differential equation]].  Given that differential equations do not always lead to unique solutions, this method cannot be guaranteed to produce a unique solution.  However, in a large class of the most common types of parameters it does lead to unique solutions (see the examples below)

== Examples ==
=== Discrete Case - coin flipping ===
Consider a problem where all you are told is that there is a coin, and it has a head (H) and a tail (T).  Denote this information by ''I''.  You are then asked "what is the probability of Heads?".  Call this ''problem 1'' and denote the probability ''P(H|I)''.  Consider another question "what is the probability of Tails?".  Call this ''problem 2'' and denote this probability by ''P(T|I)''.

Now from the information which was actually in the question, there is no distinction between heads and tails.  The whole paragraph above could be re-written with "Heads" and "Tails" interchanged, and "H" and "T" interchanged, and the problem statement would not be any different.  Using the desideratum then demands that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)=P(T|I)&lt;/math&gt;

The probabilities must add to 1, this means that

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I)+P(T|I)=1 \rightarrow 2 P(H|I)=1 \rightarrow P(H|I)=0.5 &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we have a unique solution.  This argument easily extents to ''N'' categories, to give the "flat" prior probability ''1/N''.
This provides a ''consistency'' based argument to the principle of indifference which goes as follows: ''if someone is truly ignorant about a discrete/countable set of outcomes apart from their potential existence, but does not assign them equal prior probabilities, then they are assigning different probabilities when given the same information''.

This can be alternatively phrased as: ''a person who does not use the principle of indifference to assign prior probabilities to discrete variables, is either not ignorant about them, or reasoning inconsistently''.

===Continuous Case - location parameter===

This is the easiest example for continuous variables.  It is given by stating one is "ignorant" of the location parameter in a given problem.  The statement that a parameter is a "location parameter" is that the sampling distribution, or likelihood of an observation ''X'' depends on a parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; only through the difference

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

for some normalised, but otherwise arbitrary distribution ''f(.)''.  Examples of location parameters include mean parameter of [[normal distribution]] with known variance and median parameter of [[Cauchy distribution]] with known inter-quartile range.
The two "equivalent problems" in this case, given ones knowledge of the sampling distribution &lt;math&gt;p(X|\mu,I)=f(X-\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, but no other knowledge about &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is simply given by a "shift" of equal magnitude in ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  This is because of the relation:

&lt;math&gt; f(X-\mu)=f([X+b]-[\mu+b])=f(X^{(1)}-\mu^{(1)}) &lt;/math&gt;

So simply "shifting" all quantities up by some number ''b'' and solving in the "shifted space" and then "shifting" back to the original one should give exactly the same answer as if we just worked on the original space.  Making the transformation from &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mu^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of simply 1, and so the prior probability &lt;math&gt;g(\mu) = p(\mu|I)&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy the functional equation:

&lt;math&gt;g(\mu)=\left|{\partial \mu^{(1)} \over \partial \mu}\right| g(\mu^{(1)}) = g(\mu+b)&lt;/math&gt;

And the only function which satisfies this equation is the "constant prior":

&lt;math&gt;p(\mu|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the uniform prior is justified for expressing complete ignorance of a location parameter.

===Continuous case - scale parameter===

As in the above argument, a statement that &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a scale parameter means that the sampling distribution has the functional form:

&lt;math&gt;p(X|\sigma,I)={1 \over \sigma}f\left({X \over \sigma}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, as before ''f(.)'' is a normalised probability density function.  The requirement that probabilities be finite and positive forces the condition &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  Examples include the standard deviation of a normal distribution with known mean, the [[gamma distribution]].  The "symmetry" in this problem is found by noting that

&lt;math&gt;{X \over \sigma}={X a \over \sigma a} ; a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

But, unlike in the location parameter case, the Jacobian of this transformation in the sample space and the parameter space is ''a'', not 1.  so the [[sampling probability]] changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(X^{(1)}|\sigma,I)={1 \over a} \cdot {1 \over \sigma}f\left({X a \over \sigma a}\right)= {1 \over \sigma^{(1)}}f\left({X^{(1)} \over \sigma^{(1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which is invariant (i.e. has the same form before and after the transformation), and the prior probability changes to:

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I)={1 \over a} p(\sigma^{(1)}|I)={1 \over a}p\left({\sigma \over a}|I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Which has the unique solution (up to a proportionality constant):

&lt;math&gt;p(\sigma|I) \propto {1 \over \sigma} \rightarrow p(\log(\sigma)|I) \propto 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Which is the well-known [[Jeffreys prior]] for scale parameters, which is "flat" on the log scale, although it should be noted that it is derived using a different argument to that here, based on the [[Fisher information]] function.  The fact that these two methods give the same results in this case does not imply it in general.

===Continuous case - Bertrand's paradox===
Edwin Jaynes used this principle to provide a resolution to [[Bertrand paradox (probability)|Bertrand's Paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/well.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
by stating his ignorance about the exact position of the circle.  The details are available in the reference or in the link.

== Discussion ==

This argument depends crucially on ''I''; changing the information may result in a different probability assignment.  It is just as crucial as changing [[axioms]] in [[deductive logic]] - small changes in the information can lead to large changes in the probability assignments allowed by "consistent reasoning".

To illustrate suppose that the coin flipping example also states as part of the information that the coin has a side (S) (i.e. it is a ''real coin'').  Denote this new information by ''N''.  The same argument using "complete ignorance", or more precisely, the information actually described, gives:

&lt;math&gt;P(H|I,N)=P(T|I,N)=P(S|I,N)=1/3 &lt;/math&gt;

But this seems absurd to most people - intuition tells us that we should have P(S) very close to zero.  This is because most people's intuition do not see "symmetry" between a coin landing on its side compared to landing on heads.  Our intuition says that the particular "labels" actually carry some information about the problem.  A simple argument could be used to make this more formal mathematically (e.g. the physics of the problem make it difficult for a flipped coin to land on its side) - we make a distinction between "thick" coins and "thin" coins [here thickness is measured relative to the coin's diameter].  It could reasonably be assumed that:

&lt;math&gt;P(S|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(S|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this new information probably wouldn't break the symmetry between "heads" and "tails", so ''that'' permutation would still apply in describing "equivalent problems", and we would require:

&lt;math&gt;P(T|\text{thin coin}) = P(H|\text{thin coin}) \neq P(H|\text{thick coin})=P(T|\text{thick coin})&lt;/math&gt;

This is a good example of how the principle of transformation groups can be used to "flesh out" personal opinions.  All of the information used in the derivation is explicitly stated.  If a prior probability assignment doesn't "seem right" according to what your intuition tells you, then there must be some "background information" which has not been put into the problem.&lt;ref&gt;http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmonkeys.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is then the task to try and work out what that information is.  In some sense, by combining the method of transformation groups with one's intuition can be used to "weed out" the actual assumptions one has.  This makes it a very powerful tool for prior elicitation.

Introducing the thickness of the coin is permissible because it was not specified in the problem, so this is still only using information in the question{{Huh|date=December 2017}}. Introducing a "nuisance parameter" and then making the answer invariant to this parameter is a very useful technique for solving supposedly "ill-posed" problems like Bertrand's Paradox.  This has been called "the well-posing strategy" by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/519028 |jstor=519028 |title=Bertrand's Paradox and the Principle of Indifference |year=2007 |last1=Shackel |first1=Nicholas |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=150|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/3803/1/Shackel%20Bertrand%27s%20paradox%205.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real power of this principle lies in its application to continuous parameters, where the notion of "complete ignorance" is not so well defined as in the discrete case.  However, if applied with infinite limits, it often gives [[improper prior]] distributions.  Note that the discrete case for a countably infinite set, such as (0,1,2,...) also produces an improper discrete prior.  For most cases where the likelihood is sufficiently "steep" this does not present a problem.  However, in order to be absolutely sure to avoid incoherent results and paradoxes, the prior distribution should be approached via a well defined and well behaved limiting process.  One such process is the use of a sequence of priors with increasing range, such as &lt;math&gt;f(M) = {I(M \in [-b,b]) \over 2b}&lt;/math&gt; where the limit &lt;math&gt;b \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; is to be taken ''at the end of the calculation'' i.e. after the normalisation of the posterior distribution.  What this effectively is doing, is ensuring that one is taking the limit of the ratio, and not the ratio of two limits.  See [[Limit of a function#Properties]] for details on limits and why this order of operations is important.

If the limit of the ratio does not exist or diverges, then this gives an improper posterior (i.e. a posterior which does not integrate to one).  This indicates that the data are so uninformative about the parameters that the prior probability of arbitrarily large values still matters in the final answer.  In some sense, an improper posterior means that the information contained in the data has not "ruled out" arbitrarily large values.  Looking at the improper priors this way, it seems to make some sense that "complete ignorance" priors should be improper, because the information used to derive them is so meager that it cannot rule out absurd values on its own.  From a state of complete ignorance, only the data or some other form of additional information can rule out such absurdities.

'''Project Eagle''' is an interactive art demo of a colony on [[Mars]], developed by [[Blackbird Interactive]] in collaboration with [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharaks-creators-worked-with-nasa-1792565700 |title=Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak's Creators Worked With NASA On A Cool Mars Project |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 27 November 2018, in honor of the successful ''[[InSight]]'' landing.

== Production ==

Project Eagle was built in the [[Unity (Game Engine)]] and utilizes design elements similar to that of the [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game ''[[Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak]]'', including the sensors manager view and camera systems.

The Martian terrain was generated using [[radar]] data from NASA's [[HiRISE]] camera on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackbirdinteractive.com/news/project-eagle/ |title=Project Eagle |publisher=Blackbird Interactive |date=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Project Eagle'' is set in 2117 in a hypothetical future after the first human colonists arrive on Mars in the year 2034 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcgamer.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-devs-partner-with-nasa-to-build-interactive-mars-colony/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/02/22/dice-2017-homeworld-creators-reveal-project-eagle-in-collaboration-with-nasas-jpl&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional "Eagle Base" is located at the foot of [[Mount Sharp]] (Aeolis Mons), in Quad 51 of [[Aeolis Palus]] in [[Gale Crater]], near the site of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] landing. The ''Curiosity'' landing site is marked with a [[plinth]] in Project Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/02/22/dice-2017-homeworld-creators-reveal-project-eagle-in-collaboration-with-nasas-jpl&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2017 D.I.C.E. Summit ==

Project Eagle was presented on stage at D.I.C.E. 2017 by NASA’s Dr. Jeff Norris, and BBI’s CEO Rob Cunningham and CCO Aaron Kambeitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicesummit.org/news/five_additional_speakers_cover_mars_exploration_and_vr.asp |title=Five Additional Speakers Cover Mars Exploration And Vr |publisher=Dicesummit.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk took place directly after the conference keynote speech by [[Jeffrey Kaplan (game designer)|Jeffrey Kaplan]] from [[Blizzard Entertainment]]

In [[psychology]], '''stress''' is a [[feeling]] of [[strain (disambiguation)|strain]] and [[pressure (disambiguation)|pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/stress|title=Stress|date=2013-11-18|work=Mental Health America|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress is a type of [[psychological pain]].&lt;ref name=Simandan2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.08.009 |pmid=20813575 |title=On how much one can take: Relocating exploitation and exclusion within the broader framework of allostatic load theory |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=1291–3 |year=2010 |last1=Simandan |first1=Dragos }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small amounts of stress may be desired, beneficial, and even healthy. Positive stress helps improve athletic performance. It also plays a factor in [[motivation]], adaptation, and reaction to the environment. Excessive amounts of stress, however, may lead to bodily harm. Stress can increase the risk of [[stroke]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s, [[ulcer]]s, and [[mental illness]]es such as depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Sapolsky|first1= Robert M.|authorlink= Robert Sapolsky|title= Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers|date= 2004|publisher= St. Martins Press|location= 175 Fifth Ave, New York, N.Y.|isbn= 978-0-8050-7369-0|pages= 37, 71, 92, 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans experience stress, or perceive things as threatening, when they do not believe that their resources for coping with obstacles (stimuli, people, situations, etc.) are enough for what the circumstances demand. When people think the demands being placed on them exceed their ability to cope, they then perceive stress.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"&gt;

==Popular conflation of types==
A very much overlooked side of stress is its positive adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= C.|date= 2012 |title= Stress, positive psychology and the National Student Survey |journal= Psychology Teaching Review |volume= 18|issue=2 |pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive psychological stress can lead to motivation and challenge instead of anxiety. The effects of experiencing [[eustress]], which is positive stress, versus [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], which is negative stress, are significant. While colloquially lumped together, the various types of stress should be treated as separate concepts.

==Variations==
Selye proposed that there are four variations of stress.&lt;ref name= Selye&gt;{{cite book|last=Selye|first=Hans|title=Stress without distress|year=1974|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On one axis, there is good stress ([[eustress]]) and bad stress ([[Distress (medicine)|distress]]). On the other is over-stress (hyperstress) and understress (hypostress).  The goal is to balance these as much as possible. The ultimate goal would be to balance hyperstress and hypostress perfectly and have as much eustress as possible.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"&gt;{{cite book |last= Selye|first=Hans |date=1983 |title=Stress Research Issues for the Eighties |chapter=The Stress Concept: Past, Present and Future|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first=C. L. |location= New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely useful for a productive lifestyle because it makes working enjoyable instead of a chore, as seen with distress.

==Differentiation between eustress and distress==
[[Eustress]] comes from the Greek root “eu” which means good as in euphoria.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selye |first=Hans |date= 1975|title= Implications of Stress Concept|journal=New York State Journal of Medicine|volume=75 |pages=2139–2145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eustress is when a person perceives a stressor as positive.&lt;ref name=Fevre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fevre|first=Mark Le|author2=Kolt, Gregory S. |author3=Matheny, Jonathan |title=Eustress, distress and their interpretation in primary and secondary occupational stress management interventions: which way first?|journal=Journal of Managerial Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=547–565|doi=10.1108/02683940610684391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distress stems from the Latin root “dis” as in dissonance or disagreement.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1975"/&gt; Distress is a threat to the quality of life. It is when a demand vastly exceeds a person’s capabilities.&lt;ref name= Fevre /&gt;

There is likely a connection between stress and illness.&lt;ref name="Folkman, S. 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simandan2010/&gt; Theories of the stress–illness link suggest that both [[Acute stress reaction|acute]] and chronic stress can cause illness, and several studies found such a link.&lt;ref name="Schneiderman, N. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneiderman | first1 = N. | last2 = Ironson | first2 = G. | last3 = Siegel | first3 = S.

Behavioral changes can be smoking and eating habits and physical activity.

Chronic stress and a lack of coping resources available or used by an individual can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] (see below for further information).&lt;ref&gt;Schlotz W, Yim IS, Zoccola PM, Jansen L, Schulz P (2011). The perceived stress reactivity scale: Measurement invariance, stability, and validity in three countries. Psychol Assess. (pp. 80–94).&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true regarding chronic stressors. These are stressors that may not be as intense as an acute stressor like a natural disaster or a major accident, but they persist over longer periods of time. These types of stressors tend to have a more negative impact on health because they are sustained and thus require the body's physiological response to occur daily. This depletes the body's energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time, especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided (i.e. stress of living in a dangerous neighborhood). See [[allostatic load]] for further discussion of the biological process by which chronic stress may affect the body. For example, studies have found that caregivers, particularly those of dementia patients, have higher levels of depression and slightly worse physical health than noncaregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.2.250 |pmid=12825775 |title=Differences between caregivers and noncaregivers in psychological health and physical health: A meta-analysis |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=250–67 |year=2003 |last1=Pinquart |first1=Martin |last2=Sörensen |first2=Silvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown that perceived chronic stress and the hostility associated with [[Type A personality|Type A personalities]] are often associated with much higher risks of cardiovascular disease. This occurs because of the compromised immune system as well as the high levels of arousal in the sympathetic nervous system that occur as part of the body's physiological response to stressful events.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret E. Kemeny, "The Psychobiology of Stress" in Current Directions in Psychological Science Vol. 12, No. 4 (Aug., 2003), pp. 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for individuals to exhibit [[hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]{{snd}} a term referring to the ability to be both chronically stressed and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Kobasa, S. C. (1982). The Hardy Personality: Toward a Social Psychology of Stress and Health. In G. S. Sanders &amp; J. Suls (Eds.), ''Social Psychology of Health and Illness'' (pp. 1–25). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic stress can be associated with psychological disorders such as [[delusions]].&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, C. &amp; Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. (2016). Life hassles and delusional ideation: Scoping the potential role of cognitive and affective mediators, ''Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice'' {{DOI|10.1111/papt.12089}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pathological anxiety and chronic stress lead to structural degeneration and impaired functioning of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mah L, Szabuniewicz C, Fiocco AJ |title=Can anxiety damage the brain? |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |year=2016 |pmid=26651008 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000223 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long been believed that negative affective states, such as feelings of anxiety and depression, could influence the pathogenesis of physical disease, which in turn, have direct effects on biological process that could result in increased risk of disease in the end. However, studies done by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and other places have shown this to be partly untrue; although stress seems to increase the risk of reported poor health, the ''perception'' that stress is harmful increases the risk even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026743 |pmid=22201278 |pmc=3374921 |title=Does the perception that stress affects health matter?

Chronic stress results from stressful events that persist over a relatively long period of time, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, or results from brief focal events that continue to be experienced as overwhelming even long after they are over, such as experiencing a sexual assault.

Experiments show that when healthy human individuals are exposed to acute laboratory stressors, they show an adaptive enhancement of some markers of natural immunity but a general suppression of functions of specific immunity. By comparison, when healthy human individuals are exposed to real-life chronic stress, this stress is associated with a biphasic immune response where partial suppression of cellular and humoral function coincides with low-grade, nonspecific inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natap.org/2007/HIV/101107_02.htm|title=Psychological Stress and Disease (HIV/AIDS)|website=www.natap.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though psychological stress is often connected with illness or disease, most healthy individuals can still remain disease-free after confronting chronic stressful events. Also, people who do not believe that stress will affect their health do not have an increased risk of illness, disease, or death.&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"/&gt; This suggests that there are individual differences in vulnerability to the potential pathogenic effects of stress; individual differences in vulnerability arise due to both genetic and psychological factors. In addition, the age at which the stress is experienced can dictate its effect on health. Research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong impacts on the biological, psychological, and behavioral responses to stress later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163551 |pmid=19035829 |title=Health Psychology: Developing Biologically Plausible Models Linking the Social World and Physical Health |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=60 |pages=501–24 |year=2009 |last1=Miller |first1=Gregory |last2=Chen |first2=Edith |last3=Cole |first3=Steve W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stress has a physical effect on the body, some individuals may not distinguish this from other more serious illnesses.
If the symptom is unambiguous (e.g. a breast lump), individuals are motivated to seek care regardless if they are under stress.
However, if the symptom is ambiguous (e.g. [[headache]]), they will not seek care attributing the symptom to stress if the stressor's onset is recent which began in the previous 3 weeks, and will seek care if the onset is not recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7732157 |year=1995 |author1=Cameron |first1=L |title=Seeking medical care in response to symptoms and life stress |journal=Psychosomatic medicine |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=37–47 |last2=Leventhal |first2=E. A |last3=Leventhal |first3=H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
In animals, stress contributes to the initiation, growth, and metastasis of select tumors, but studies that try to link stress and cancer incidence in humans have had mixed results. This can be due to practical difficulties in designing and implementing adequate studies.&lt;ref name = Cohen2007/&gt; Personal belief in stress as a risk factor for cancer was common in one [[UK]] study, though awareness of risk factors overall was found to be low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shahab |first1=Lion |last2=McGowan |first2=Jennifer A. |last3=Waller |first3=Jo |last4=Smith |first4=Samuel G. |title=Prevalence of beliefs about actual and mythical causes of cancer and their association with socio-demographic and health-related characteristics: Findings from a cross-sectional survey in England |journal=European Journal of Cancer |date=April 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2018.03.029 |url=https://www.ejcancer.com/article/S0959-8049(18)30778-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutral stressors==
Stress is a non-specific response.&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; It is neutral, and what varies is the degree of response. It is all about the context of the individual and how they perceive the situation. Selye defined stress as “the nonspecific (that is, common) result of any demand upon the body, be the effect mental or somatic.”&lt;ref name = "Selye 1983"/&gt; This includes the medical definition of stress as a physical demand and the colloquial definition of stress as a psychological demand. A stressor is inherently neutral meaning that the same stressor can cause either distress or eustress. It is individual differences and responses that induce either distress or eustress.&lt;ref name = "HNC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hargrove |first=M. B. |last2= Nelson|first2=D.

==Types of stressors==
A [[stressor]] is any event, experience, or environmental stimulus that causes stress in an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stressor |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/stressor |publisher=Collins English Dictionary{{snd}} Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved September 20, 2012, from CollinsDictionary.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620123917/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/stressor |archivedate=June 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events or experiences are perceived as threats or challenges to the individual and can be either physical or psychological. Researchers have found that stressors can make individuals more prone to both physical and psychological problems, including [[heart disease]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name="pastorino"&gt;Pastorino, E. &amp; Doyle-Portillo, S. (2009). What is Psychology?. 2nd Ed. Belmont, CA: Thompson Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressors are more likely to affect an individual's health when they are "chronic, highly disruptive, or perceived as uncontrollable".&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; In [[psychology]], researchers generally classify the different types of stressors into four categories: 1) crises/catastrophes, 2) major life events, 3) daily hassles/microstressors, and 4) ambient stressors.

===Crises/catastrophes===
This type of stressor is unforeseen and unpredictable and, as such, is completely out of the control of the individual.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples of [[crises]] and catastrophes include: devastating [[natural disaster]]s, such as major [[flood]]s or [[earthquake]]s, [[war]]s, etc. Though rare in occurrence, this type of stressor typically causes a great deal of stress in a person's life.  A study conducted by Stanford University found that after natural disasters, those affected experienced a significant increase in stress level.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Combat stress is a widespread acute and chronic problem. With the rapid pace and the urgency of firing first, tragic episodes of accidentally killing friendly forces (“brother” killing “brother” or fratricide) may happen. Prevention requires stress reduction, emphasis on vehicle and other identification training, awareness of the tactical situation, and continual risk analysis by leaders at all echelons.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22–51, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major life events===
Common examples of major life events include: [[marriage]], going to [[college]], [[death]] of a loved one, [[birth]] of a child, moving houses, etc. These events, either positive or negative, can create a sense of uncertainty and fear, which will ultimately lead to stress. For instance, research has found the elevation of stress during the transition from high school to university, with college freshmen being about two times more likely to be stressed than final year students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teo |first1=Loo Yee |first2=Jia Yuin |last2=Fam |title=Prevalence and determinants of perceived stress among undergraduate students in a Malaysian University |journal=Journal of Health and Translational Medicine |volume=21 |issue=1 |year=2018 |pages=1–5 |url=https://mjes.um.edu.my/index.php/jummec/article/view/11016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found major life events are somewhat rare to be major causes of stress, due to its rare occurrences.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;

The length of time since occurrence and whether or not it is a positive or negative event are factors in whether or not it causes stress and how much stress it causes. Researchers have found that events that have occurred within the past month generally are not linked to stress or illness, while chronic events that occurred more than several months ago are linked to stress and illness&lt;ref name=pmid9619470&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.3.214 |pmid=9619470 |title=Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in healthy adults |journal=Health Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=214–23 |year=1998 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Frank |first2=Ellen |last3=Doyle |first3=William J |last4=Skoner |first4=David P |last5=Rabin |first5=Bruce S |last6=Gwaltney |first6=Jack M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personality change.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt; Additionally, positive life events are typically not linked to stress{{snd}} and if so, generally only trivial stress{{snd}} while negative life events can be linked to stress and the health problems that accompany it.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; However, positive experiences and positive life changes can predict decreases in neuroticism.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"/&gt;

===Daily hassles/microstressors===
This category includes daily [[annoyance]]s and minor hassles.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; Examples include: making decisions, meeting deadlines at work or school, traffic jams, encounters with irritating personalities, etc. Often, this type of stressor includes [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]s with other people. Daily stressors, however, are different for each individual, as not everyone perceives a certain event as stressful. For example, most people find public speaking to be stressful, nevertheless, a seasoned politician most likely will not.

Daily hassles are the most frequently occurring type of stressor in most adults. The high frequency of hassles causes this stressor to have the most physiological effect on an individual. Carolyn Aldwin, Ph.D., conducted a study at the Oregon State University that examined the perceived intensity of daily hassles on an individual's mortality. Aldwin's study concluded that there is a strong correlation between individuals who rate their hassles as very intense and a high level of mortality. One's perception of his/her daily stressors can have a modulating effect on the physiological impact of daily stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2014.06.019 |pmid=24995936 |pmc=4253863 |title=Do hassles mediate between life events and mortality in older men? |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=59 |pages=74–80 |year=2014 |last1=Aldwin |first1=Carolyn M |last2=Jeong |first2=Yu-Jin |last3=Igarashi |first3=Heidi |last4=Choun |first4=Soyoung |last5=Spiro |first5=Avron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major psychological types of conflicts that can cause stress.

* The approach-approach conflict, occurs when a person is choosing between two equally attractive options, i.e. whether to go see a movie or to go see a concert.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The avoidance-avoidance conflict, occurs where a person has to choose between two equally unattractive options, for example, to take out a second loan with unappealing terms to pay off the mortgage or to face foreclosure on one's house.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;
* The approach-avoidance conflict,&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt; occurs when a person is forced to choose whether or not to partake in something that has both attractive and unattractive traits{{snd}} such as whether or not to attend an expensive college (meaning taking out loans now, but also meaning a quality education and employment after graduation).

Travel-related stress results from three main categories: lost time, surprises (an unforeseen event such as lost or delayed baggage) and routine breakers (inability to maintain daily habits).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWT rolls out solution to tackle cost of travel stress|url=http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|publisher=TTGmice|accessdate=29 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110182351/http://www.ttgmice.com/article/cwt-rolls-out-solution-to-tackle-cost-of-travel-stress/|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambient stressors===
As their name implies, these are global (as opposed to individual) low-grade stressors that are a part of the background environment.  They are defined as stressors that are "chronic, negatively valued, non-urgent, physically perceptible, and intractable to the efforts of individuals to change them".&lt;ref name=campbell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0013916583153005 |title=Ambient Stressors |journal=Environment and Behavior |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=355–80 |year=2016 |last1=Campbell |first1=Joan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of ambient stressors are pollution, noise, crowding, and traffic.  Unlike the other three types of stressor, ambient stressors can (but do not necessarily have to) negatively impact stress without conscious awareness.  They are thus low on what Stokols called "perceptual salience".{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Mentioned neither the author nor the concept before. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}&lt;ref name = campbell/&gt;

===Organizational stressors===
Studies conducted in military and combat fields show that some of the most potent stressors can be due to personal organizational problems in the unit or on the home front.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). Combat and Operational Stress Control, FM 4-02.51, Washington, DC, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Stress due to bad organizational practices is often connected to "Toxic Leadership", both in companies and in governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Whicker, Marcia Lynn. Toxic leaders: When organizations go bad. Westport, CT. Quorum Books. 1996.{{pn|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{redirects|Stress Relief|The Office episode|Stress Relief (The Office)}}
{{redirects|Stress Reliever|the track|R.E.D. (Ne-Yo album)}}
[[Stress management]] refers to a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person's levels of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of improving everyday functioning. It involves controlling and reducing the tension that occurs in stressful situations by making emotional and physical changes.

===Prevention and resilience building===
Decreasing stressful behaviors is a part of prevention, some of the common strategies and techniques are: Self-monitoring, tailoring, material reinforcement, social reinforcement, social support, self-contracting, contracting with significant other, shaping, reminders, self-help groups, professional help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greenberg|title=Comprehensive Stress Management 10E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-067104-1|pages=261–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218174937/https://books.google.com/books?id=D6Xr2waR9UEC&amp;pg=PA261|archivedate=2017-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain |date=September 2018| reason = Some of these terms are probably unclear to the non-experts.}}

Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to [[Psychological resilience|psychological resilience-building]].  A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2012"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=Build your Resilience| year=2012| publisher=Hodder| location=London| isbn=978-1-4441-6871-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwIstsEgkBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biofeedback]] may also play a role in stress management. A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased.&lt;ref name="Sutarto2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10803548.2012.11076959 |pmid=23294659 |title=Resonant Breathing Biofeedback Training for Stress Reduction Among Manufacturing Operators |journal=International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=549–61 |year=2015 |last1=Purwandini Sutarto |first1=Auditya |last2=Abdul Wahab |first2=Muhammad Nubli |last3=Mat Zin |first3=Nora }}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping mechanisms===
{{Main|Coping (psychology)}}
The Lazarus and Folkman model suggests that external events create a form of pressure to achieve, engage in, or experience a stressful situation. Stress is not the external event itself, but rather an interpretation and response to the potential threat; this is when the coping process begins.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=C.R.|last2=Lefcourt|first2=Herbert M.|title=Coping With Stress|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University|location=New York|pages=68–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various ways individuals deal with perceived threats that may be stressful. However, people have a tendency to respond to threats with a predominant coping style, in which they dismiss feelings, or manipulate the stressful situation.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt;

There are different classifications for coping, or [[defense mechanisms]], however they all are variations on the same general idea: There are good/productive and negative/counterproductive ways to handle stress. Because stress is perceived, the following mechanisms do not necessarily deal with the actual situation that is causing an individual stress. However, they may be considered coping mechanisms if they allow the individual to cope better with the negative feelings/anxiety that they are experiencing due to the perceived stressful situation, as opposed to actually fixing the concrete obstacle causing the stress. The following mechanisms are adapted from the DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.

====Highly adaptive/active/problem-focused mechanisms====
These skills are what one could call as “facing the problem head on”, or at least dealing with the negative emotions experienced by stress in a constructive manner. (generally adaptive)

* '''Affiliation''' ("[[tend and befriend]]") – involves dealing with stress by turning to a social network for support, but an individual does not share with others in order to diffuse or avoid the responsibility.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"&gt;Levo, Lynn M. (2003, September.) Understanding Defense Mechanisms. ''Lukenotes''. 7(4). St. Luke Institute, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"&gt;Adapted from DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale, APA, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Humor]]''' – the individual steps outside of a situation in order to gain greater perspective, and also to highlight any comic aspect to be found in their stressful circumstances.&lt;ref name="Levo, Lynn M. 2003"/&gt;
[[File:Two people laughing.jpg|thumb|Coping through laughter]]
::“The Association for Applied and Therapeutic Humor defines therapeutic humor as ‘any intervention that promotes health and wellness by stimulating a playful discovery, expression or appreciation of the absurdity of or incongruity of life’s situations. This intervention may enhance health or be used as a complementary treatment of illness to facilitate healing or coping whether physical, emotional, cognitive, or spiritual”.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia|title=Communication in Nursing|date=2012|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Missouri|pages=160–173|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::[[Sigmund Freud]], a well known neurologist, suggests the humor was an excellent defensive strategy in emotional situations.&lt;ref name="Coping With Stress"/&gt; When one laughs during a tough situation they feel absent from their worries, and this allows them to think differently.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; When one experiences a different mind set, they feel more in control of their response, and how they will go about dealing with the event that caused stress.

::Lefcourt (2001) suggests that this perspective-taking humor is the most effective due to its ability to distance oneself from the situation of great stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lefcourt|first1=H. M.|editor1-last=Snyder|editor1-first=C. R.|title=Coping with Stress: Effective People and Processes.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198029950|pages=68–92|chapter=The Humor Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that the use of laughter and humor creates a sense of relief of stress that can last up to 45 minutes post-laughter&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt;.

::Also, most hospitalized children have been seen to use laughter and play to relieve their fear, pain and stress. It has been discovered that there is a great importance in the use of laughter and humor in stress coping.&lt;ref name="Communication in Nursing"/&gt; Humans should use humor as a means to transcend their original understanding of an external event, take a different perspective, in which their anxiety may be minimized by.

* '''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''' – allows an "indirect resolution of conflict with neither adverse consequences nor consequences marked by loss of pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valliant | first1 = George E. | year = 2000 | title = Adaptive Mental Mechanisms | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 89–98 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.89| pmid = 11392869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, this mechanism allows channeling of troubling emotions or impulses into an outlet that is socially acceptable.
* '''Positive reappraisal''' – redirects thoughts (cognitive energy) to good things that are either occurring or have not occurred. This can lead to [[personal growth]], [[self-reflection]], and awareness of the power/benefits of one's efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Folkman | first1 = S. | last2 = Moskowitz | first2 = J. | year = 2000 | title = Stress, Positive Emotion, and Coping | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 115–118 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00073}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies on [[veteran]]s of war or peacekeeping operations indicate that persons who construe a positive meaning from their combat or threat experiences tend to adjust better than those who do not.&lt;ref name="pmid17532104"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schok ML, Kleber RJ, Elands M, Weerts JM |title=Meaning as a mission: a review of empirical studies on appraisals of war and peacekeeping experiences |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |year=2008 |pmid=17532104 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2007.04.005 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final path model fitted well (CF1 = 1, RMSEA = 0.00) and showed that direct quality of life paths with β = -0.2, and indirect social support with β = -0.088 had the most effects on reduction of stress during pregnancy.{{Non sequitur |date=September 2008| reason = Comes out of nowhere.  Phrases require further explanations. Maybe just drop the sentence.}}
Other adaptive coping mechanisms include [[Anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]], [[altruism]], and [[self-observation]].

====Mental inhibition/disavowal mechanisms====
These mechanisms cause the individual to have a diminished (or in some cases non-existent) awareness about their anxiety, threatening ideas, fears, etc., that come from being conscious of the perceived threat.

* '''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''' – This is when an individual redirects their emotional feelings about one situation to another, less threatening one.&lt;ref&gt;"displacement n." A Dictionary of Psychology. Edited by Andrew M. Colman. Oxford University Press 2009. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''' – Repression occurs when an individual attempts to remove all their thoughts, feelings, and anything related to the upsetting/stressful (perceived) threat out of their awareness in order to be disconnected from the entire situation. When done long enough in a successful way, this is more than just denial.
* '''[[Reaction formation]]''' – An individual substitutes their feelings or thoughts or behavior with the exact opposite. An attempt to remove any “unacceptable thoughts” from one's consciousness by replacing them with the exact opposite.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/engl/theory/psychoanalysis/definitions/reactionformation.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other inhibition coping mechanisms include undoing, [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[denial]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]]. Although some people claim that inhibition coping mechanisms may eventually increase the stress level because the problem is not solved, detaching from the stressor can sometimes help people to temporarily release the stress and become more prepared to deal with problems later on.

====Active mechanisms====
These methods deal with stress by an individual literally taking action, or withdrawing.

* '''[[Acting out]]''' – Often viewed as counter-normative, or problematic behavior. Instead of reflecting or problem-solving, an individual takes maladaptive action.&lt;ref name="DSM-IV Adaptive Functioning Scale 1994"/&gt;
* '''[[Passive aggression]]''' – When an individual indirectly deals with his or her anxiety and negative thoughts/feelings stemming from their stress by acting in a hostile or resentful manner towards others. Help-Rejecting Complaining can also be included in this category.

====Health promotion====
There is an alternative method to coping with stress, in which one works to minimize their anxiety and stress in a preventative manner. If one works towards coping with stress daily, the feeling of stress and the ways in which one deals with it as the external event arises becomes less of a burden.

Suggested strategies to improve stress management include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Potter|first1=Patricia|title=Canadian Fundamentals of Nursing|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|location=Toronto|pages=472–488|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Regular exercise – set up a fitness program, 3–4 times a week
# Support systems – to listen, offer advice, and support each other
# Time management – develop an organizational system
# Guided imagery and visualization – create a relaxing state of mind
# Progressive muscle relaxation – loosen tense muscle groups
# [[Assertiveness]] training – work on effective communication
# Journal writing – express true emotion, self-reflection
# Stress management in the workplace – organize a new system, switch tasks to reduce own stress.

Depending on the situation, all of these coping mechanisms may be adaptive, or maladaptive.

The body responds to stress in many ways. Readjusting chemical levels is just one of them. Here are some examples of adjustments and changes that affect communication.

====General adaptive syndrome====
In terms of measuring the body's response to stress, psychologists tend to use Hans Selye's [[General adaptation syndrome#General adaptation syndrome|general adaptation syndrome]]. This model is also often referred to as the classic stress response, and it revolves around the concept of [[homeostasis]]. General adaptive syndrome occurs in three stages:

#'''The alarm reaction'''. This stage occurs when the stressor is first presented. The body begins to gather resources to deal with the stressor. The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] and [[sympathetic nervous system]] are activated, resulting in the release of hormones from the [[adrenal gland]] such as [[cortisol]], adrenaline ([[epinephrine]]), and [[norepinephrine]] into the bloodstream to adjust bodily processes. These hormonal adjustments increase energy levels, increase muscle tension, reduce sensitivity to pain, slow down the digestive system, and cause a rise in blood pressure.&lt;ref name="GottliebBenjaminCoping"&gt;Gottlieb, Benjamin."Coping with Chronic Stress". Plenum Press. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Locus coeruleus]], a collection of Norepinephrine-containing neurons in the [[pons]] of the [[brainstem]] whose axons project to various regions of the brain, is involved in releasing Norepinephrine directly onto neurons. High levels of Norepinephrine acting as a neurotransmitter on its receptors expressed on neurons in brain regions, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]] is thought to be involved in the effects of stress on [[executive functions]], such as impaired [[working memory]].   
#'''The stage of resistance'''. The body continues building up resistance throughout the stage of resistance, until either the body's resources are depleted, leading to the exhaustion phase, or the stressful stimulus is removed. As the body uses up more and more of its resources people become increasingly tired and susceptible to illness. This stage is where psychosomatic disorders first begin to appear.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;
#'''The stage of exhaustion'''. The body is completely drained of the hormones and resources it was depending on to manage the stressor. The person now begins to exhibit behaviors such as anxiety, irritability, avoidance of responsibilities and relationships, self-destructive behavior, and poor judgment. If someone is experiencing these symptoms they have a much greater chance of lashing out, damaging relationships, or avoiding social interaction at all.&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome" /&gt;

This [[Stress (biology)#Neurochemistry and physiology|physiological stress]] response involves high levels of [[sympathetic nervous system]] activation, often referred to as the "fight or flight" response. The [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm response] involves pupil dilation, release of endorphins, increased heart and respiration rates, cessation of digestive processes, secretion of adrenaline, arteriole dilation, and constriction of veins. This high level of arousal is often unnecessary to adequately cope with micro-stressors and daily hassles; yet, this is the response pattern seen in humans, which often leads to health issues commonly associated with high levels of stress.&lt;ref name="oregonstate.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|title=HHS 231 – Extended Campus – Oregon State University|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010135321/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/dce/hhs231_w04/nine/studyguide.htm|archivedate=2012-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quality of sleep====
Sleep allows people to rest and re-energize for another day filled with interactions and tasks. If someone is stressed it is extremely important for them to get enough sleep so that they can think clearly. Unfortunately, chemical changes in the body caused by stress can make sleep a difficult thing. [[Glucocorticoid]]s are released by the body in response to stress which can disrupt sleep. Sleep comes in four stages and the deepest, most restful sleep can only be attained after having been asleep for an hour.&lt;ref name=Sleep&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craven|first1=Ruth|last2=Hirnle|first2=Constance|last3=Jensen|first3=Sharon|title=Fundamentals of Nursing: Human and Health Function|date=2013|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|page=1319|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stressful social experiences that affect communication===
When someone is stressed, many challenges can arise; a recognized challenge being communication difficulties. Here are some examples of how stress can hinder communication.

====Cultural differences: individualistic vs. collectivistic====
The cultures of the world generally fall into two categories; individualistic and collectivistic.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

* An [[individualistic]] culture, like that of the United States, where everyone is an independent entity defined by their accomplishments and goals.
* A collectivistic culture, like that of many Asian countries, prefers to see individuals as interdependent on each other. They value modesty and family.

These cultural differences can affect how people communicate when they are stressed. For example, a member of an individualistic cultural would be hesitant to ask for pain medication for fear of being perceived as weak. A member of a collectivistic culture would not hesitate. They have been brought up in a cultural where everyone helps each other and is one functional unit whereas the member of the individualistic culture is not as comfortable asking others for aid.&lt;ref name=Sleep/&gt;

====Language barriers====
{{Confusing section |date=September 2018| reason = Do the language barriers cause stress, or does stress add to language barriers?  What is cause, what is effect?  }}
Language barriers can also diminish communication due to stress.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison-Valfre|first1=Michelle|title=Foundations of mental health care|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-323-05644-1|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; All languages have their own way of using names, titles, and just interacting. These differences can make inter lingual communication relatively stressful. Not speaking the same languages, different ways of showing respect, and different use of body language can make things difficult. Being uncomfortable with the communication around a person can discourage them from communicating at all.&lt;ref name="Cultural Differences"/&gt;

====Changes in the home====
Divorce, death, and remarriage are all disruptive events in a household.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt; Although everyone involved is affected by events such as these, it can be most drastically seen in children. Due to their age, children have relatively undeveloped coping skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002059.htm|title=Stress in childhood: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason a stressful event may cause some changes in their behavior. Falling in with a new crowd, developing some new and sometimes undesirable habits are just some of the changes stress may trigger in their lives.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

A particularly interesting response to stress is talking to an [[imaginary friend]]. A child may feel angry with a parent or their peers who they feel brought this change on them. They need someone to talk to but it definitely won’t be the person with whom they are angry. That’s when the imaginary friend comes in. They “talk” to this imaginary friend but in doing so they cut off communication with the real people around them.&lt;ref name=Sleep /&gt;

==Social support and health==
Researchers have long been interested in how an individual's level and types of [[social support]] impact the effect of stress on their health. Studies consistently show that social support can protect against physical and mental consequences of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uchino | first1 = B. N. | year = 2009 | title = Understanding the links between social support and physical health: A life-span perspective with emphasis on the separability of perceived and received support | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 236–255 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01122.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkman | first1 = L. F. | last2 = Glass | first2 = T. | last3 = Brissette | first3 = I. | last4 = Seeman | first4 = T. E. | year = 2000 | title = From social integration to health: Durkheim in the new millennium | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 51 | issue = 6| pages = 843–857 | doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(00)00065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur through a variety of mechanisms. One model, known as the "direct effects" model, holds that social support has a direct, positive impact on health by increasing positive affect, promoting adaptive health behaviors, predictability and stability in life, and safeguarding against social, legal, and economic concerns that could negatively impact health. another model, the "buffering effect", says that social support exerts greatest influence on health in times of stress, either by helping individuals appraise situations in less threatening manners or coping with the actual stress. Researchers have found evidence to support both these pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S. | last2 = Wills | first2 = T. A. | year = 1985 | title = Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 310–357 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 | pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support is defined more specifically as psychological and material resources provided by a social network that are aimed at helping an individual cope with stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Social relationships and health | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 676–684 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.676 | pmid=15554821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers generally distinguish among several types of social support: instrumental support – which refers to material aid (e.g., financial support or assistance in transportation to a physician's appointment), informational support (e.g., knowledge, education or advice in problem-solving), and emotional support (e.g., empathy,  reassurance, etc.).&lt;ref name="Cohen, S. 2004"/&gt; Social support can reduce the rate of stress during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sara Shishehgar |author2=Abolfazl Mahmoodi |author3=Mahrokh Dolatian |author4=Zohreh Mahmoodi |author5=Maryam Bakhtiary |author6=Hamid Alavi Majd  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Relationship of Social Support and Quality of Life with the Level of Stress in Pregnant Women Using the PATH Model |journal=Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=560–5 |year=2013 |pmc=3871742 |doi=10.5812/ircmj.12174 |pmid=24396574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating with someone who is stressed==
{{How-to|date=August 2017}}

Social support from friends and the community can be very beneficial to helping someone communicate while stressed. Social support is giving a person the knowledge that they are part of a mutual network of caring, interested others, that enable them to lower levels of stress and be better able to cope with the stress that they undergo.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feldman &amp; Dinardo|first1=Robert S., Andrea|title=Essentials of understanding psychology|date=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson|location=Toronto|isbn=9780070974111|edition=3rd Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social and emotional support people provide for each other demonstrates that they are important and valued members of social networks.&lt;ref name="Feldman, dinardo"/&gt;

The stress of a person can greatly affect those around them, especially in families. “Families can experience many conflicting emotions when placed in the position of providing protected care for a loved one. Compassion, protectiveness, and caring can be intermingled with feelings of helplessness and being trapped."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold &amp; Boggs|first1=Elizabeth, Kathleen Underman|title=Interpersonal Relationships : Professional Communication Skills For Nurses|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9781437709445|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional support is crucial to helping families cope with the challenge of supporting their loved one (stressed person).&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships" /&gt;  This emotional support can be expressed through many communication methods.

In order to be able to effectively communicate with someone who is stressed, it is important to know how to interact with them in a way that can be beneficial for them. Therapeutic communication techniques can help with different types of communication. These techniques include but are not limited to listening, making open-ended comments, reducing distance, restating, seeking clarification, reflecting, and planning.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riley|first1=Julia Balzer|title=Communication in nursing.|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Mosby|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323083348|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actively listening to someone when they are stressed can help them release frustrations and cope with their problems. Listening shows that you are interested in the person, and can have great therapeutic value. It is important to show that the stressed person's needs are above the caregiver's in order for the interaction to be therapeutic.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt; It is important that you remain prepared mentally, emotionally, and physically to assist him or her. It is favorable to remain punctual and polite in the manner of relating to them, and that the best methods are used to promote their well-being and comfort.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Verbal communication methods===
* Making open-ended comments can allow the person who is stressed to decide the direction that the interaction can take and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* In order to validate that the message is being interpreted properly, it is a good idea to restate what the person has said. Seeking clarification can also help to ensure the understanding of what they’re communicating.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* Try reflecting about what the stressed person has said to you. It will show that you see and understand the importance in his or her feelings, ideas and interpretations. It is important to avoid being judgmental, and rejecting what the person has said. It may make them feel that they are personally being rejected.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* At the end of the conversation, it is a good idea to help them plan their goals, direction and so forth, of future interactions.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;

===Nonverbal communication methods===
* Having a posture that is slightly leaning towards the person communicates interest and encourages them to keep talking.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Reducing physical distance between yourself and the person who is stressed, indicates that you want to be involved in helping the person.&lt;ref name="Communications Textbook"/&gt;
* "Try maintaining an open, friendly expression without being boisterously cheerful. Avoid furrowed forehead or a distracted or bored expression."&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt; Making direct eye contact also generally conveys that you show interest and concern for them.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;
* It is very beneficial to generally focus on maintaining an open atmosphere when speaking to someone. However, it is also important to pay attention to their nonverbal cues as well. By using their nonverbal cues, you can interpret their mood and/or feelings. This will help with adapting to the situation and communicating better.&lt;ref name="Interpersonal Relationships"/&gt;

===How to prevent misunderstanding===
Communication is an important stress-management skill. Although this seems like an easy skill, there is much more to communication than simply speaking. In fact, communication can cause problems such as misunderstandings when not used effectively. When miscommunication happen there tends to be more problems, anger and resentment then if communication were effective in the first place. There are certain things that need to be done to achieve effective communication.&lt;ref name= Edelman&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman, C.L., Kudzma, E.C., Mandle|first=C.L.|title=Health Promotion Throughout the Life Span, Chapter 13|date=2014|volume=8th edition|pages=310–313|publisher=St. Louis, MO:Elsevier, Mosby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''first guideline'' is to be clear about is what is wanted or needed when speaking with others.

This technique requires the individual’s recognition of distorted and exaggerated expectations and thoughts.

An easy way to meet this guideline is by reflecting the purpose of the conversation in the statement. By reflecting what the desired outcome of the conversation is, there is little room for miscommunication.

The ''second guideline'' for effective communication is to use assertive communication.

An assertive statement is non-judgmental, expresses feelings and opinions and reaffirms perceived rights.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;
The best way to use the assertive technique is with manipulating the following formula:

* I feel [emotion], when you [the behavior], because [explanation].

When people are stressed, they cannot verbalize their feelings correctly. When the receiver in the conversation cannot understand the needs of the person, miscommunications happen and the person may feel victimized and blame others for not understanding. The third guideline is empathy which is defined as the ability to consider another person’s perspective and to communicate this perspective back to that person.

The ''final guideline'' to prevent misunderstandings when communicating while stressed is cognitive restructuring which facilitates assertive communication as it requires the person to identify their thoughts and feelings. Some ways to restructure cognitively is by stopping and understanding what the conversation holds.

Breathing deeply as this will release any tension and promote relaxation which will allow you to reflect on the true emotions.

Reflecting on how you feel emotionally and how you feel immediately allow you to choose the right answer.

Choosing the more realistic and helpful way of thinking allows the communication to be straight forward and upfront leaving little room for miscommunication.

By following the above techniques and guidelines, the chance of a miscommunication in a conversation will decrease. Once the ability to communicate with assertive techniques is worked into everyday life, the frequency of misunderstandings will decrease significantly.

The importance of understanding how to communicate assertively is critical for daily life. With the knowledge of how to properly communicate, whether stressed or not, the ability to communicate will become easier and result in less misunderstandings and frustrations which can contribute to one’s stress.&lt;ref name="Edelman"/&gt;

==Scales==
Life events scales can be used to assess stressful things that people experience in their lives. One such scale is the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], also known as the Social Readjustment Rating Scale, or SRRS.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes | first1 = TH | last2 = Rahe | first2 = RH  | year = 1967 | title = The Social Readjustment Rating Scale | url = | journal = J Psychosom Res | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 213–8 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4 | pmid=6059863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by psychiatrists Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe in 1967, the scale lists 43 stressful events.

To calculate one's score, add up the number of "life change units" if an event occurred in the past year. A score of more than 300 means that individual is at risk for illness, a score between 150 and 299 means risk of illness is moderate, and a score under 150 means that individual only has a slight risk of illness.&lt;ref name="pastorino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1334">'''''Pukefejden''''' ("The Puke Feud") was a [[feud]] taking between the followers of [[riksråd]] [[Erik Puke]] and the followers of the later [[Charles VIII of Sweden]] in 1436-1437. 

The feud originated from the [[Engelbrekt rebellion]], as the Puke party accused the party of Charles of having murdered [[Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson]]. After the rebellion, many fiefs had been left without a holder, and after having failed to distribute them fairly among the nobility in 1436, the opposition around Puke challenged Charles in open [[civil war]]. A number of cities, [[Arboga]], [[Köping]] and [[Örebro]], rebelled, and the rebels defeated the forces of Charles in the [[Battle of Hällaskogen]] on 17 January 1437. During peace negotiations in [[Västerås]], Eric Puke was captured and brought to Stockholm, and was executed there in March 1437.

In mathematics, a '''recurrent tensor''', with respect to a [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]] ''M'', is a [[Tensor field|tensor]] ''T'' for which there is a [[differential form|one-form]] ''ω'' on ''M'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla T = \omega\otimes T. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Parallel Tensors===
An example for recurrent [[Tensor field|tensor]]s are parallel tensors which are defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla A = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
with respect to some connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;.

If we take a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;(M,g)&lt;/math&gt; then the metric ''g''  is a parallel and therefore recurrent tensor with respect to its [[Levi-Civita connection]], which is defined via
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^{LC} g = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and its property to be torsion-free.

Parallel vector fields (&lt;math&gt;\nabla X = 0&lt;/math&gt;) are examples of recurrent tensors that find importance in mathematical research. For example, if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is a recurrent non-null vector field on a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla X = \omega\otimes X &lt;/math&gt;
for some closed [[one-form]] &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;, then X can be rescaled to a parallel vector field.&lt;ref&gt;Alekseevsky, Baum (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, non-parallel recurrent vector fields are null vector fields.

===Metric space===
Another example appears in connection with [[Weyl structure]]s. Historically, Weyl structures emerged from the considerations of [[Hermann Weyl]] with regards to properties of parallel transport of vectors and their length.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; By demanding that a manifold have an affine parallel transport in such a way that the manifold is locally an [[affine space]], it was shown that the induced connection had a vanishing torsion tensor
:&lt;math&gt;T^\nabla(X,Y) = \nabla_XY-\nabla_YX - [X,Y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Additionally, he claimed that the manifold must have a particular parallel transport in which the ratio of two transported vectors is fixed. The corresponding connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla'&lt;/math&gt; which induces such a parallel transport satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla' g = \varphi \otimes g&lt;/math&gt;
for some one-form &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Such a metric is a recurrent tensor with respect to &lt;math&gt;\nabla'&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, Weyl called the resulting manifold &lt;math&gt;(M,g)&lt;/math&gt; with affine connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; and recurrent metric &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; a metric space. In this sense, Weyl was not just referring to one metric but to the conformal structure defined by &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;. 

Under the conformal transformation &lt;math&gt;g \rightarrow e^{\lambda}g&lt;/math&gt;, the form &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; transforms as &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \varphi -d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This induces a canonical map &lt;math&gt;F:[g] \rightarrow \Lambda^1(M)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(M, [g])&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;F(e^\lambda g) := \varphi - d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[g]&lt;/math&gt; is the conformal structure. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is called a Weyl structure,&lt;ref&gt;Folland (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; which more generally is defined as a map with property
:&lt;math&gt;F(e^\lambda g) = F(g) - d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

===Recurrent spacetime===
One more example of a recurrent tensor is the curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; on a recurrent spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; for which
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \mathcal{R} = \omega \otimes \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Reductionism''' is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations between phenomena which can be described in terms of other simpler or more fundamental phenomena.&lt;ref name=MerriamWebster/&gt;

''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' suggests that reductionism is "one of the most used and abused terms in the philosophical lexicon" and suggests a three part division:&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |author=Michael Ruse |editor=Ted Honderich |isbn=9780191037474 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |chapter=Entry for "reductionism" |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=793 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1884}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Ontological reductionism''': a belief that the whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts.
#'''Methodological reductionism''': the scientific attempt to provide explanation in terms of ever smaller entities.
#'''Theory reductionism''': the suggestion that a newer theory does not replace or absorb an older one, but reduces it to more basic terms. Theory reduction itself is divisible into three parts: translation, derivation and explanation.&lt;ref name=Ney/&gt;

Reductionism can be applied to any [[phenomenon]], including [[object (philosophy)|objects]], [[explanation]]s, [[theory|theories]], and meanings.&lt;ref name=Ney/&gt;&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne&gt;
{{cite web |title=Reductionism  |author=John Polkinghorne |url=http://www.disf.org/en/Voci/104.asp |work=Interdisciplinary Encyclopedia of Religion and Science|date=2002 |publisher=Advanced School for Interdisciplinary Research; Pontifical University of the Holy Cross}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
For reductionism referred to [[explanation]]s, [[theory|theories]], and meanings, see [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s ''[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]''. Quine objected to the [[positivism|positivistic]], reductionist "belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience" as an intractable problem.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the sciences, application of methodological reductionism attempts explanation of entire systems in terms of their individual, constituent parts and their interactions. For example, the temperature of a gas is reduced to nothing beyond the average kinetic energy of its molecules in motion. [[Thomas Nagel]] speaks of 'psychophysical reductionism' (the attempted reduction of psychological phenomena to physics and chemistry), as do others and 'physico-chemical reductionism' (the attempted reduction of biology to physics and chemistry), again as do others.&lt;ref name=Nagel/&gt; In a very simplified and sometimes contested form, such reductionism is said to imply that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts.&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne/&gt;&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt; However, a more nuanced opinion is that a system is composed entirely of its parts, but the system will have features that none of the parts have.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; "The point of mechanistic explanations is usually showing how the higher level features arise from the parts."&lt;ref name=GodfreySmith/&gt;

Other definitions are used by other authors. For example, what [[John Polkinghorne]] terms 'conceptual' or 'epistemological' reductionism&lt;ref name=Polkinghorne/&gt; is the definition provided by [[Simon Blackburn]]&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;{{cite book |author=Simon Blackburn |title= Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |chapter=Entry on ‘reductionism’ |page=311 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wTQtwB1NdgC&amp;pg=PA311}}. Richard Jones distinguishes the two, arguing that many ontological and epistemological reductionists affirm the need for different concepts for different degrees of complexity while affirming a reduction of theories.  Richard H. Jones (2000), ''Reductionism: Analysis and the Fuullness of Reality'', pp. 27-28, 32. Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Jaegwon Kim]]:&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;
{{cite book |author=Jaegwon Kim |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy  |editor=Ted Honderich |isbn=9780191037474 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |chapter=Entry for ‘mental reductionism’ |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=794 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJFCAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1885}}&lt;/ref&gt; that form of reductionism concerning a program of replacing the facts or entities entering statements claimed to be true in one type of discourse with other facts or entities from another type, thereby providing a relationship between them. Such an association is provided where the same idea can be expressed by "levels" of explanation, with higher levels reducible if need be to lower levels. This use of levels of understanding in part expresses our human limitations in remembering detail. However, "most philosophers would insist that our role in conceptualizing reality [our need for an hierarchy of "levels" of understanding] does not change the fact that different levels of organization in reality do have different 'properties'."&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

Reductionism strongly represents a certain perspective of [[causality]]. In a reductionist framework, the phenomena that can be explained completely in terms of relations between other more fundamental phenomena, are termed [[epiphenomena]]. Often there is an implication that the epiphenomenon exerts no causal agency on the fundamental phenomena that explain it. The epiphenomena are sometimes said to be "nothing but" the outcome of the workings of the fundamental phenomena, although the epiphenomena might be more clearly and efficiently described in very different terms. There is a tendency to avoid considering an epiphenomenon as being important in its own right. This attitude may extend to cases where the fundamentals are not obviously able to explain the epiphenomena, but are expected to by the speaker. In this way, for example, morality can be deemed to be "nothing but" evolutionary adaptation, and consciousness can be considered "nothing but" the outcome of neurobiological processes.

Reductionism should be distinguished from [[Eliminative materialism|eliminationism]]: reductionists do not deny the existence of phenomena, but explain them in terms of another reality; eliminationists deny the existence of the phenomena themselves. For example, eliminationists deny the existence of life by their explanation in terms of physical and chemical processes.

Reductionism also does not preclude the existence of what might be termed [[Emergence|emergent phenomena]], but it does imply the ability to understand those phenomena completely in terms of the processes from which they are composed. This reductionist understanding is very different from [[emergentism]], which intends that what emerges in "emergence" is more than the sum of the processes from which it emerges.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod and Cohen "Harnessing Complexity"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Most philosophers delineate three types of reductionism and anti-reductionism.&lt;ref name="Ruse"/&gt;

===Ontological reductionism===
Ontological reductionism is the belief that reality is composed of a minimum number of kinds of entities or substances. This claim is usually [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and is most commonly a form of [[monism]], in effect claiming that all objects, properties and events are reducible to a single substance. (A [[mind-body dualism|dualist]] who is an ontological reductionist would believe that everything is reducible to two substances—as one possible example, a dualist might claim that reality is composed of "[[matter]]" and "[[spirit]]".)

Richard Jones divides ontological reductionism into two: the reductionism of substances (e.g., the reduction of mind to matter) and the reduction of the number of structures operating in nature (e.g., the reduction of one physical force to another). This permits scientists and philosophers to affirm the former while being anti-reductionists regarding the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Jones (2000), ''Reductionism: Analysis and the Fuullness of Reality'', pp. 24-26, 29-31. Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancey Murphy]] has claimed that there are two species of ontological reductionism: one that denies that wholes are anything more than their parts; and the stronger thesis of atomist reductionism that wholes are not "really real". She admits that the phrase "really real" is apparently senseless but nonetheless has tried to explicate the supposed difference between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Nancey Murphy, "Reductionism and Emergence. A Critical Perspective." In ''Human Identity at the Intersection of Science, Technology and Religion''. Edited by Nancey Murphy, and Christopher C. Knight. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2010. P. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontological reductionism denies the idea of ontological [[emergence]], and claims that emergence is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] phenomenon that only exists through analysis or description of a system, and does not exist fundamentally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9213.00136 Michael Silberstein, John McGeever, "The Search for Ontological Emergence", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 49, No. 195 (April 1999)], ({{ISSN|0031-8094}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontological reductionism takes two different forms: '''token ontological reductionism''' and '''type ontological reductionism'''.

Token ontological reductionism is the idea that every item that exists is a sum item. For perceivable items, it affirms that every perceivable item is a sum of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Token ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is generally accepted.

Type ontological reductionism is the idea that every type of item is a sum type of item, and that every perceivable type of item is a sum of types of items with a lesser degree of complexity. Type ontological reduction of biological things to chemical things is often rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_reductionism.html|title=Reductionism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|work=philosophybasics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ruse]] has criticized ontological reductionism as an improper argument against [[vitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/29/3/1061.pdf] Michael Ruse, "Do Organisms Exist?", Am. Zool., 29: 1061–1066 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological reductionism===
Methodological reductionism is the position that the best scientific strategy is to attempt to reduce explanations to the smallest possible entities. Methodological reductionism would thus include the claim that the atomic explanation of a substance's boiling point is preferable to the chemical explanation, and that an explanation based on even smaller particles ([[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, perhaps) would be even better.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}  Methodological reductionism, therefore, is the opinion that all scientific theories either can or should be reduced to a single super~theory through the process of theoretical reduction.

===Theory reductionism===
Theory reduction is the process by which one theory absorbs another. For example, both [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler's]] laws of the motion of the [[planet]]s and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s theories of motion formulated for terrestrial objects are reducible to Newtonian theories of mechanics because all the explanatory power of the former are contained within the latter. Furthermore, the reduction is considered to be beneficial because [[Newtonian mechanics]] is a more general theory—that is, it explains more events than Galileo's or Kepler's. Theoretical reduction, therefore, is the reduction of one explanation or theory to another—that is, it is the absorption of one of our ideas about a particular item into another idea.

==In science==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Reductionist thinking and methods form the basis for many of the well-developed topics of modern [[science]], including much of [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[cell biology]]. [[Classical mechanics]] in particular is seen as a reductionist framework, and [[statistical mechanics]] can be considered as a reconciliation of [[macroscopic]] [[thermodynamic laws]] with the reductionist method of explaining macroscopic properties in terms of [[microscopic]] components.

In science, reductionism implies that certain topics of study are based on areas that study smaller spatial scales or organizational units. While it is commonly accepted that the foundations of [[chemistry]] are based in [[physics]], and [[molecular biology]] is based on chemistry, similar statements become controversial when one considers less rigorously defined intellectual pursuits. For example, claims that [[sociology]] is based on [[psychology]], or that [[economics]] is based on [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] would be met with reservations. These claims are difficult to substantiate even though there are obvious associations between these topics (for instance, most would agree that [[psychology]] can affect and inform [[economics]]). The limit of reductionism's usefulness stems from [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]] of [[complex systems]], which are more common at certain levels of organization. For example, certain aspects of [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[sociobiology]] are rejected by some who claim that complex systems are inherently irreducible and that a [[holistic]] method is needed to understand them.

Some strong reductionists believe that the behavioral sciences should become "genuine" scientific disciplines based on genetic biology, and on the systematic study of culture (see Richard Dawkins's concept of [[memes]]). In his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] introduced the term "hierarchical reductionism"&lt;ref&gt;Interview with magazine ''[[Third Way (magazine)|Third Way]]'' in which [[Richard Dawkins]] discusses reductionism and religion, February 28, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the opinion that complex systems can be described with a hierarchy of organizations, each of which is only described in terms of objects one level down in the hierarchy. He provides the example of a computer, which using hierarchical reductionism is explained in terms of the operation of [[hard drive]]s, processors, and memory, but not on the level of [[logic gates]], or on the even simpler level of electrons in a [[semiconductor]] medium.

Others argue that inappropriate use of reductionism limits our understanding of complex systems. In particular, ecologist [[Robert Ulanowicz]] says that science must develop techniques to study ways in which larger scales of organization influence smaller ones, and also ways in which feedback loops create structure at a given level, independently of details at a lower level of organization. He advocates (and uses) [[information theory]] as a framework to study [[Propensity probability|propensities]] in natural systems.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Ulanowicz, ''Ecology: The Ascendant Perspective'', Columbia University Press (1997) ({{ISBN|0-231-10828-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Ulanowicz attributes these criticisms of reductionism to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] and biologist [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ulanowicz | first1 = R.E. | year = 1996 | title = Ecosystem Development: Symmetry Arising? | url = http://people.biology.ufl.edu/ulan/pubs/Symmetry.PDF | journal = Symmetry: Culture and Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–334 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130530212418/http://people.biology.ufl.edu/ulan/pubs/Symmetry.PDF | archivedate = 2013-05-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that phenomena such as [[emergence]] and work within the topic of [[complex systems]] theory pose limits to reductionism has been advocated by [[Stuart Kauffman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kauffman06/kauffman06_index.html Beyond Reductionism: Reinventing the Sacred] by Stuart Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt; Emergence is especially relevant when systems exhibit historicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|last3=Kauffman|first3=Stuart|date=2012-01-01|title=No Entailing Laws, but Enablement in the Evolution of the Biosphere|url=https://www.academia.edu/11720588|journal=Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation|series=GECCO '12|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=1379–1392|doi=10.1145/2330784.2330946|isbn=9781450311786|via=|arxiv=1201.2069|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.3838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergence is strongly related to [[nonlinearity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.riverusers.com/~rover/RedRev.pdf A. Scott, ''Reductionism Revisited'', Journal of Consciousness Studies, 11, No. 2, 2004 pp. 51–68]&lt;/ref&gt; The limits of the application of reductionism are claimed to be especially evident at levels of organization with higher amounts of [[complexity]], including living [[Cell (biology)|cells]],&lt;ref name=Huber2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huber |first1=F |last2=Schnauss |first2=J |last3=Roenicke |first3=S |last4=Rauch |first4=P |last5=Mueller |first5=K |last6=Fuetterer |first6=C |last7=Kaes |first7=J  |title=Emergent complexity of the cytoskeleton: from single filaments to tissue |journal=Advances in Physics |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=1–112 |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/00018732.2013.771509|bibcode = 2013AdPhy..62....1H |pmid=24748680 |pmc=3985726}} [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00018732.2013.771509 online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[neural networks]], [[ecosystems]], [[society]], and other systems formed from assemblies of large numbers of diverse components linked by multiple [[feedback loop]]s.&lt;ref name="Huber2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clayton2006&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last= Clayton |editor1-first= P |editor2-last= Davies |editor2-first= P |title=The Re-emergence of Emergence: The Emergentist Hypothesis from Science to Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nobel prize in physics|Nobel laureate]] [[Philip Warren Anderson]] used the idea that [[symmetry breaking]] is an example of an emergent phenomenon in his 1972 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper "More is different" to make an argument about the limitations of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/bblonder/phys120/docs/anderson.pdf Link] {{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.W.|title=More is Different|journal=Science|volume=177|issue=4047| pages=393–396|year=1972|doi=10.1126/science.177.4047.393|pmid=17796623|bibcode=1972Sci...177..393A}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observation he made was that the sciences can be arranged roughly in a linear hierarchy—[[particle physics]], [[solid state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[cellular biology]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], [[social sciences]]—in that the elementary entities of one science obeys the principles of the science that precedes it in the hierarchy; yet this does not imply that one science is just an applied version of the science that precedes it. He writes that "At each stage, entirely new laws, concepts and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology nor is biology applied chemistry."

Disciplines such as [[cybernetics]] and [[systems theory]] imply non-reductionism, sometimes to the extent of explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, in a sense, the opposite of reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DOWNCAUS.html|title=Downward Causation|work=vub.ac.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In [[mathematics]], reductionism can be interpreted as the philosophy that all mathematics can (or ought to) be based on a common foundation, which for modern mathematics is usually [[axiomatic set theory]]. [[Ernst Zermelo]] was one of the major advocates of such an opinion; he also developed much of axiomatic set theory. It has been argued that the generally accepted method of justifying mathematical [[axioms]] by their usefulness in common practice can potentially weaken Zermelo's reductionist claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;id=pdf_1&amp;handle=euclid.ndjfl/1093633905 R. Gregory Taylor, "Zermelo, Reductionism, and the Philosophy of Mathematics". ''Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Fall 1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jouko Väänänen has argued for [[second-order logic]] as a foundation for mathematics instead of set theory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.109.7000 J. Väänänen, "Second-Order Logic and Foundations of Mathematics".''The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic'', 7: 504–520 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others have argued for [[category theory]] as a foundation for certain aspects of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publdoc.html?r=1&amp;pg1=CNO&amp;s1=1406758&amp;loc=fromrevtext S. Awodey, "Structure in Mathematics and Logic: A Categorical Perspective". ''Philos. Math.'' Series III, Vol. 4, No.3 (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.W. Lawvere, "The Category of Categories as a Foundation for Mathematics". ''Proceedings of the Conference on Categorical Algebra (La Jolla, Calif., 1965)'', pp. 1–20. Springer-Verlag, New York (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] of [[Kurt Gödel]], published during 1931, caused doubt about the attainability of an axiomatic foundation for all of mathematics. Any such foundation would have to include axioms powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (a subset of all mathematics). Yet Gödel proved that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers, there are propositions about the natural numbers that cannot be proved from the axioms, but which we can prove in the natural language with which we described the axioms. Such propositions are known as formally undecidable propositions. For example, the [[continuum hypothesis]] is undecidable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] as shown by [[Forcing (mathematics)|Cohen]].

==In religion==

Religious reductionism generally attempts to explain religion by explaining it in terms of nonreligious causes. A few examples of reductionistic explanations for the presence of religion are: that religion can be reduced to humanity's conceptions of right and wrong, that religion is fundamentally a primitive attempt at controlling our environments, that religion is a way to explain the existence of a physical world, and that religion confers an enhanced survivability for members of a group and so is reinforced by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution-of-religion.com/|title=Evolution-of-religion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[James George Frazer]] employed some [[Metatheories of religion in the social sciences#Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer|religious reductionist arguments]].&lt;ref&gt;Strenski, Ivan. "Classic Twentieth-Century Theorist of the Study of Religion: Defending the Inner Sanctum of Religious Experience or Storming It." Pages 176–209 in ''Thinking About Religion: An Historical Introduction to Theories of Religion''. Malden: Blackwell, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Sigmund Freud held that religion is nothing more than an illusion, or even a mental illness, and Marx claimed that religion is "the sigh of the oppressed," and the [[opium of the people]] providing only "the illusory happiness of the people," thus providing two influential examples of reductionistic views against the idea of religion.

==In linguistics==
Linguistic reductionism is the idea that everything can be described or explained by a language with a limited number of concepts, and combinations of those concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_reductionism.html|title=Reductionism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the language [[Toki Pona]].

==In philosophy==
The concept of [[downward causation]] poses an alternative to reductionism within philosophy. This opinion is developed by [[Peter Bøgh Andersen]], [[Claus Emmeche]], [[Niels Ole Finnemann]], and [[Peder Voetmann Christiansen]], among others. These philosophers explore ways in which one can talk about phenomena at a larger-scale level of organization exerting causal influence on a smaller-scale level, and find that some, but not all proposed types of downward causation are compatible with science. In particular, they find that constraint is one way in which downward causation can operate.&lt;ref&gt;P.B. Andersen, C. Emmeche, N.O. Finnemann, P.V. Christiansen, ''Downward Causation: Minds, Bodies and Matter'', Aarhus University Press ({{ISBN|87-7288-814-8}}) (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of causality as constraint has also been explored as a way to shed light on scientific concepts such as [[self-organization]], [[natural selection]], [[adaptation]], and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Einmag_Abstr/AJuarrero.html&amp;nbsp; |first1=A |last1=Juarrero |title=Causality as Constraint |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612013407/http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Einmag_Abstr/AJuarrero.html |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free will===
{{main|Free will}}
Philosophers of the Enlightenment worked to insulate human free will from reductionism. [[Descartes]] separated the material world of mechanical necessity from the world of mental free will. German philosophers introduced the concept of the "[[Noumenon|noumenal]]" realm that is not governed by the deterministic laws of "[[Phenomena (philosophy)|phenomenal]]" nature, where every event is completely determined by chains of causality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Guyer, "18th Century German Aesthetics," [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetics-18th-german/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential formulation was by [[Immanuel Kant]], who distinguished between the causal deterministic framework the mind imposes on the world—the phenomenal realm—and the world as it exists for itself, the noumenal realm, which included free will. To insulate theology from reductionism, 19th century post-Enlightenment German theologians, especially [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Albrecht Ritschl]], used the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] method of basing religion on the human spirit, so that it is a person's feeling or sensibility about spiritual matters that comprises religion.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Clayton and Zachary Simpson, eds. ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006) p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antireductionism==
{{main|Antireductionism}}
The anti-reductionist considers as minimum requirement upon the reductionist: "At the very least the anti-reductionist is owed an account of why the intuitions arise if they are not accurate."&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Causation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGnZtUtG-nIC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292 |author=John W Carroll |chapter=Chapter 13: Anti-reductionism |isbn=978-0199279739 |publisher=Oxford Handbooks Online |year=2009 |editor1=Helen Beebee |editor2=Christopher Hitchcock |editor3=Peter Menzies }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrast to reductionism is [[holism]] or [[emergentism]]. Holism is the idea that items can have properties, (emergent properties), as a whole that are not explainable from the sum of their parts. The principle of holism was summarized concisely by [[Aristotle]] in the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]: "The whole is more than the sum of its parts".

==Alternatives==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
{{original research section|date=February 2012}}
The development of [[systems thinking]] has provided methods for describing issues in a [[holism|holistic]] rather than a reductionist way, and many scientists use a [[Holism in science|holistic paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dossey, Larry]]. ''Reinventing Medicine: Beyond Mind-Body to a New Era of Healing.'' ({{ISBN|0-06-251622-1}}) HarperSanFrancisco. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; When the terms are used in a scientific context, holism and reductionism refer primarily to what sorts of [[scientific model|models]] or theories offer valid explanations of the natural world; the scientific method of falsifying hypotheses, checking empirical data against theory, is largely unchanged, but the method guides which theories are considered. The conflict between reductionism and holism in science is not universal—it usually concerns whether or not a holistic or reductionist method is appropriate in the context of studying a specific system or phenomenon.

In many cases (such as the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases), given a good understanding of the components of the system, one can predict all the important properties of the system as a whole. In other systems{{which|date=August 2018}}, [[emergent properties]] of the system are said to be almost impossible to predict from knowledge of the parts of the system. [[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] studies systems and properties of the latter type.

[[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s metaphysics opposed reductionism. He refers to this as the "fallacy of the misplaced concreteness". His scheme was to frame a rational, general understanding of phenomena, derived from our reality.

[[Sven Erik Jorgensen]], an [[ecologist]], states both theoretical and practical arguments for a [[holistic]] method in certain topics of science, especially [[ecology]]. He argues that many systems are so complex that it will not ever be possible to describe all their details. Making an analogy to the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, he argues that many interesting and relevant ecological phenomena cannot be replicated in laboratory conditions, and thus cannot be measured or observed without influencing and changing the system in some way. He also indicates the importance of interconnectedness in biological systems. His opinion is that science can only progress by outlining what questions are unanswerable and by using models that do not attempt to explain everything in terms of smaller hierarchical levels of organization, but instead model them on the scale of the system itself, taking into account some (but not all) factors from levels both higher and lower in the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;S. E. Jørgensen, ''Integration of Ecosystem Theories: A Pattern'', 3rd ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, ({{ISBN|1-4020-0651-9}}) (2002) Chapters 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cognitive psychology]], [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] developed "constructive alternativism" as a form of [[personal construct psychology]], this provided an alternative to what he considered "accumulative fragmentalism". For this theory, knowledge is seen as the construction of successful [[mental model]]s of the exterior world, rather than the accumulation of independent "nuggets of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pope ML, Watts M |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Constructivist Goggles: Implications for Process in Teaching and Learning Physics|journal=Eur. J. Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0143-0807/9/2/004|volume=9|pages=101–109|year=1988|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/9/2/004|issue=2|bibcode = 1988EJPh....9..101P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''Fragmentalism'' is an alternative term for ontological reductionism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kukla A|title=Antirealist Explanations of the Success of Science|journal=Philosophy of Science|volume=63|issue=1|pages=S298–S305|year=1996|doi=10.1086/289964|jstor=188539}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''fragmentalism'' is frequently used in a [[pejorative]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pope ML|title=Personal construction of formal knowledge|journal=Interchange|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/VQ4L33X920880824.pdf|volume=13|issue=4|pages=3–14|year=1982|doi=10.1007/BF01191417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-realism|Anti-realists]] use the term fragmentalism in arguments that the world does not exist of separable [[entity|entities]], instead consisting of wholes. For example, advocates of this idea claim that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The linear deterministic approach to nature and technology promoted a fragmented perception of reality, and a loss of the ability to foresee, to adequately evaluate, in all their complexity, global crises in ecology, civilization and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~isre/NEWSLETTER/vol6no2/global.htm|title=Page Not Found|website=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The term "fragmentalism" is usually applied to reductionist modes of thought, frequently with the related pejorative term of ''[[scientism]]''. This usage is popular amongst some ecological activists: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is a need now to move away from [[scientism]] and the ideology of cause-and-effect determinism toward a radical [[empiricism]], such as [[William James]] proposed, as an [[epistemology]] of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com/|title=Redirecting|website=bioregionalanimism.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; These perspectives are not new and during the early twentieth century, [[William James]] noted that rationalist science emphasized what he termed fragmentation and disconnection.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin/&gt;

Such opinions also motivate many criticisms of the scientific method: 
&lt;blockquote
&gt;The scientific method only acknowledges monophasic consciousness. The method is a specialized system that emphasizes studying small and distinctive parts in isolation, which results in fragmented knowledge.&lt;ref name=Lumpkin&gt;[http://www.bioregionalanimism.com/2006/12/is-polyphasic-consciousness-necessary.html Tara W. Lumpkin, ''Perceptual Diversity: Is Polyphasic Consciousness Necessary for Global Survival?'' December 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Solid principles}}
In [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented computer programming]], '''SOLID''' is a [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and [[Software maintenance|maintainable]]. It is not related to the [[GRASP (object-oriented design)|GRASP]] software design principles. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by [[Robert C.

'''''Salva congruitate'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[W.V.O. Quine]], ''Philosophy of logic''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Latin]] scholastic term in [[logic]], which means "without becoming ill-formed",&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Benjamin Schnieder, Canonical Property Designators, P9&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[wikt:salvus|salva]]'' meaning ''rescue'', ''salvation'', ''welfare'' and ''[[wikt:congruo|congruitate]]'' meaning ''combine'', ''coincide'', ''agree''. Salva Congruitate is used in logic to mean that two terms may be [[Substitution (logic)|substituted]] for each other while preserving [[grammar|grammaticality]] in all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Quiddities, P204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, Philosophy of Logic, P18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remarks on ''salva congruitate'' ==

=== Timothy C. Potts ===

[[Timothy C. Potts]] describes ''salva congruitate'' as a form of replacement in the context of meaning. It is a replacement which preserves [[semantic]] coherence and should be distinguished from a replacement which preserves [[Syntax|syntactic]] coherence but may yield an expression to which no [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] has been given. This means that supposing an original expression is meaningful, the new expression obtained by the replacement will also be meaningful, though it will not necessarily have the same meaning as the original one, nor, if the expression in question happens to be a [[proposition]], will the replacement necessarily preserve the truth value of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Potts, ''Structures and categories for the representation of meaning'', p57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bob Hale ===

[[Bob Hale (philosopher)|Bob Hale]] explains ''salva congruitate'', as applied to singular terms, as [[Noun|substantival]] expressions in natural language, which are able to replace singular terms without destructive effect on the [[Syntax|grammar]] of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hale, Singular Terms, P34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the singular term 'Bob' may be replaced by the definite description 'the first man to swim the English Channel' ''salva congruitate''. Such replacement may shift both meaning and reference, and so, if made in the context of a sentence, may cause a change in truth-value. Thus terms which may be interchanged ''salva congruitate'' may not be interchangeable ''salva veritate'' (preserving truth). More generally, expressions of any type are interchangeable ''salva congruitate'' if and only if they can replace one another preserving grammaticality or well-formedness.

[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|360px|''Satya'' is an important concept and [[virtue]] in Indian religions. [[Rigveda]], dated to be from the 2nd millennium BC, offers the earliest discussion of ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt;&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt; It can be seen, for example, in the fifth and sixth lines, in above Rigveda manuscript image.]]
'''Satya''' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for [[truth]].&lt;ref name=aam&gt;[[Arthur Anthony Macdonell|A. A. Macdonell]], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Asian Educational Services, {{ISBN|978-8120617797}}, page 330-331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen et al (2003), Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Thomson Gale, {{ISBN|0-02-865704-7}}, page 405&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to a virtue in [[Indian religions]], referring to being truthful in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt; In Yoga, ''satya'' is one of five [[yamas]], the virtuous restraint from falsehood and distortion of reality in one's expressions and actions.&lt;ref name=grg&gt;GR Garg, Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World, Volume 3, {{ISBN|81-7022-3733}}, page 733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Vedas]] and later [[sutra]]s, the meaning of the word satya ({{linktext|सत्य}}) evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue.&lt;ref name=knt&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816077}}, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; It means being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech and action.&lt;ref name=knt/&gt;

A related concept, [[sattva]], also derived from "sat", means true essence, nature, spiritual essence, character.&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Sattva, {{oclc|492970792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sattva is also a [[guṇa]], a psychology concept particularly in the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy, where it means goodness, purity, clean, positive, one that advances good true nature of self.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [https://archive.org/stream/indianwisdomwith00moniuoft#page/94/mode/2up Indian Wisdom], Luzac &amp; Co London, page 94-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere (1977),'' The theory and practice of psychological medicine in the Ayurvedic tradition'', Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry, Volume 1, Issue 2, pp 155-181&lt;/ref&gt;

Satya has [[cognates]] in a number of diverse [[Indo-European languages]], including the word "sooth" in [[English language|English]], "istina" ("истина") in [[Russian language|Russian]], "sannhet" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and "haithya" in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], the [[liturgical language]] of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref name="prudentia"&gt;{{Citation | title= Prudentia, Volumes 11-13 | author=  Dept. of Classics and Ancient History, University of Auckland | publisher= University of Auckland Bindery, 1979 | isbn=  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S70RAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=satya | quote= ...

===Vedic literature===
{{Main|Historical Vedic religion}}
''Satya'' is a central theme in the Vedas. It is equated with and considered necessary to the concept [[Ṛta]] (Sanskrit ऋतं ṛtaṃ) – that which is properly joined, order, rule, nature, balance, harmony.&lt;ref name=rohin&gt;Roderick Hindery (2004), Comparative Ethics in Hindu and Buddhist Traditions, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808669}}, pages 51-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Beversluis, Sourcebook of the World's Religions, New World Library, {{ISBN|978-1577311218}}, pages 52-55&lt;/ref&gt; Ṛta results from Satya in the Vedas, states Holdrege,&lt;ref name=bahold/&gt; as it regulates and enables the operation of the universe and everything within it. Satya (truth) is considered essential, and without it, the universe and reality falls apart, cannot function.&lt;ref name=bahold&gt;Barbara Holdrege (2004), "Dharma", in: Mittal, S. &amp; Thursby, G. (Eds.) The Hindu World, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-21527-7}}, page 215&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Rigveda]], opposed to ''rita'' and ''satya'' are ''anrita'' and ''asatya'' (falsehood).&lt;ref name=rohin/&gt; Truth and truthfulness is considered as a form of reverence for the divine, while falsehood a form of sin. ''Satya'' includes action and speech that is factual, real, true and reverent to ''Ṛta'' in Book 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Rigveda.&lt;ref name=atdn&gt;[[Antonio T. De Nicolás]] (2003), Meditations Through the Rig Veda, {{ISBN|978-0595269259}}, pages 162-164&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Satya'' isn't merely about one's past that is in context in the Vedas, it has one's current and one's future contexts as well. De Nicolás states, that in Rigveda, "''Satya'' is the modality of acting in the world of ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'', as the truth to be built, formed or established".&lt;ref name=atdn/&gt;

===Upanishads===
''Satya'' is a widely discussed concept in various Upanishads, including the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] where ''satya'' is called the means to [[Brahman]], as well as Brahman (Being, true self).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n843/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad], Translator: S Madhavananda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chjo/&gt; In hymn 1.4.14 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, ''Satya'' (truth) is equated to [[Dharma]] (morality, ethics, law of righteousness),&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt; as

{{quote|
Nothing is higher than the Law of Righteousness (''Dharma''). The weak overcomes the stronger by the Law of Righteousness. Truly that Law is the Truth (''Satya''); Therefore, when a man speaks the Truth, they say, "He speaks Righteousness"; and if he speaks Righteousness, they say, "He speaks the Truth!" For both are one.|Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|I.4.xiv &lt;ref name=chjo&gt;[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom, Kshetra, {{ISBN|978-1495946530}}, page 481, for discussion on Satya and Brahman pages 491-505, 561-575&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paulh&gt;Paul Horsch (Translated by Jarrod Whitaker), ''From Creation Myth to World Law: The early history of Dharma'', Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol 32, pages 423–448, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Taittiriya Upanishad]]'s hymn 11.11 states,&lt;ref&gt;Original hymn is: सत्यं वद । धर्मं चर, ''satyam vada dharmam cara'', [http://sanskritdocuments.org/all_sa/tait_sa.html ॥ तैत्तिरीयोपनिषत् ॥] Sanskrit Documents&lt;/ref&gt; "Speak the Satya (truth), conduct yourself according to the Dharma (morality, ethics, law)".&lt;ref name=paulh/&gt;

Truth is sought, praised in the hymns of Upanishads, held as one that ultimately, always prevails. The Mundaka Upanishad, for example, states in Book 3, Chapter 1,&lt;ref name=eeas&gt;E. Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, page 181&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Mundaka Upanishad]], 3.1.6&lt;ref name=eeas/&gt;}}

Sandilya Upanishad of Atharvanaveda, in Chapter 1, includes ten&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali states five restraints, rather than ten. The complete list of 10 forbearances in Sandilya Upanishad are, in the order they are listed in original Upanishad manuscript: ahimsa, satya, asteya, brahmacharya, daya, arjava, kshama, dhrti, mitahara and saucha&lt;/ref&gt;  forbearances as virtues, in its exposition of Yoga. It defines Satya as "the speaking of the truth that conduces to the well being of creatures, through the actions of one's mind, speech or body."&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), page 173-174, {{oclc|23013613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Deussen|Deussen]] states that ''Satya'' is described in the major Upanishads with two layers of meanings - one as empirical truth about reality, another as abstract truth about universal principle, being and the unchanging. Both these ideas are explained in early Upanishads, composed before 500 BC, by variously breaking the word ''satya'' or ''satyam'' into two or three syllables. In later Upanishads, the ideas evolve and transcend into ''satya'' as truth (or truthfulness), and Brahman as the Being, Be-ness, real Self, the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyupani00deusgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, Harvard University Archives, pages 128-133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics===
The ''[[Shanti Parva]]'' of the [[Mahabharata]] states, "The righteous hold that forgiveness, truth, sincerity and compassion are the foremost (of all virtues). Truth is the essence of the Vedas."&lt;ref&gt;Page 392 ''Mahābhārata: Shanti parva'' (Mokshadharma parva, ch. 174-365), By Om Nath Bimali, Ishvar Chandra, Manmatha Nath Dutt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epic repeatedly emphasizes that ''Satya'' is a basic virtue, because everything and everyone depends on and relies on ''Satya''.&lt;ref name=mnd344/&gt;

===Sutras===
In the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], it is written, “When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him."&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"&gt;Patanjali, Sutra Number 2.36, Yoga Sutras 2.30-2.45; B. Ravikanth, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, {{ISBN|978-0988251502}}, pages 140-150&lt;/ref&gt; In Yoga sutra, ''Satya'' is one of the five yamas, or
virtuous restraints, along with ahimsa (restraint from violence or injury to any living being); asteya (restraint from stealing); brahmacharya (celibacy or restraint from sexually cheating on one's partner); and aparigraha (restraint from covetousness and craving). Patanjali considers ''satya'' as a restraint from falsehood in one's action (body), words (speech, writing), or feelings / thoughts (mind).&lt;ref name=grg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Palkhivala, [http://www.yogajournal.com/article/teach/teaching-the-yamas-in-asana-class/ Teaching the Yamas in Asana Class] Yoga Journal (August 28, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In Patanjali's teachings, one may not always know the truth or the whole truth, but one knows if one is creating, sustaining or expressing falsehood, exaggeration, distortion, fabrication or deception.&lt;ref name="Sutra Number 2.36"/&gt; ''Satya'' is, in Patanjali's Yoga, the virtue of restraint from such falsehood, either through silence or through stating the truth without any form of distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant, in Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions (Editor: Steven Rosen), Praeger, {{ISBN|978-0313397035}}, pages 33-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{main|Buddhism|Sacca}}

The term ''satya'' (Sanskrit; in Pali: ''sacca'') is translated in English as "reality" or "truth." In terms of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (''ariyasacca''), the Pali can be written as ''sacca'', ''tatha'', ''anannatatha'' and ''[[dharma|dhamma]]''.

'The Four Noble Truths' (''ariya-sacca'') are the briefest synthesis of the entire teaching of Buddhism, since all those manifold doctrines of the threefold [[Pali canon]] are, without any exception, included therein. They are the truth of suffering (mundane mental and physical phenomenon), of the origin of suffering (tanha 'pali' the craving), of the extinction of suffering (Nibbana or nirvana), and of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] leading to the extinction of suffering (the eight supra-mundane mind factors ).

{{Redirect|Sequential|the manual transmission|Sequential manual transmission|other uses|Sequence (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''sequence''' is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.  Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').  The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the natural number from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1.  When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is generally denoted ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (mathematics)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.
[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.svg|right|thumb|350px|An infinite sequence of [[real number]]s (in blue).  This sequence is neither increasing, decreasing, convergent, nor [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]].  It is, however, bounded.]]

==Examples and notation==
A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order.  Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Space (mathematics)|spaces]], and other mathematical structures using the [[#Limits and convergence|convergence]] properties of sequences.  In particular, sequences are the basis for [[series (mathematics)|series]], which are important in [[differential equations]] and [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]].  Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of [[prime number]]s.

There are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences.  One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements.  For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7).  This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well.  For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).  Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a [[pattern]] that can be easily discerned from the first few elements.  Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples.

===Examples===
[[File:Fibonacci blocks.svg|thumb|A [[Tessellation|tiling]] with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length.]]

The [[prime number]]s are the [[natural numbers]] bigger than 1 that have no [[divisor]]s but 1 and themselves.  Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).  The prime numbers are widely used in [[mathematics]] and specifically in [[number theory]].

The [[Fibonacci numbers]] are the integer sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements.  The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).

For a large list of examples of integer sequences, see [http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Some_Famous_Sequences On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].

Other examples of sequences include ones made up of [[rational numbers]], [[real number]]s, and [[complex numbers]].  The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...) approaches the number 1.  In fact, every real number can be written as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a sequence of rational numbers, e.g. via its [[decimal expansion]].  For instance, [[pi|{{pi}}]] is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...).  A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of {{pi}}, i.e. (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...).  This sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by eye, unlike the preceding sequence, which is increasing.

===Indexing===
Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed, or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of [[pi|{{pi}}]].  One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the ''n''th term as a function of ''n'', enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the range of values that ''n'' can take.  For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sequence of squares could be written as &lt;math&gt;(n^2)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The variable ''n'' is called an [[Indexed family|index]], and the set of values that it can take is called the [[index set]].

It is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as variables.  This yields expressions like &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes a sequence whose ''n''th element is given by the variable &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_1 &amp;= 1\text{st element of }(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \\
a_2 &amp;= 2\text{nd element } \\
a_3 &amp;= 3\text{rd element } \\
&amp;\vdots \\
a_{n-1} &amp;= (n-1)\text{th element} \\
a_n &amp;= n\text{th element} \\
a_{n+1} &amp;= (n+1)\text{th element} \\
&amp; \vdots
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. &lt;math&gt;(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; could be a different sequence than &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can even consider a sequence of sequences: &lt;math&gt;((a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N})_{m\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a sequence whose ''m''th term is the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.

An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values.  For example, the notation &lt;math&gt;(k^2)_{k = 1}^{10}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ten-term sequence of squares &lt;math&gt;(1, 4, 9, ..., 100)&lt;/math&gt;.  The limits &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the [[supremum]] or [[infimum]] of such values, respectively.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, and does not contain an additional term "at infinity".  The sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = -\infty}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a '''bi-infinite sequence''', and can also be written as &lt;math&gt;(..., a_{-1}, a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)&lt;/math&gt;.

In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off.  That is, one simply writes &lt;math&gt;(a_k)&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary sequence.  Often, the index ''k'' is understood to run from 1 to ∞.  However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in
:&lt;math&gt;(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty = ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ... ).&lt;/math&gt;
In some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred.  In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements.  For instance, the sequence of squares of [[odd number]]s could be denoted in any of the following ways.

* &lt;math&gt;(1, 9, 25, ...)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_3, a_5, ...), \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = (2k-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;((2k-1)^2)_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the [[natural numbers]].  Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.

===Defining a sequence by recursion===
Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using [[Recursive definition|recursion]].  This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule to construct each element in terms of the ones before it.  In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by the rule.  The principle of [[mathematical induction]] can be used to [[proof (mathematics)|prove]] that in this case, there is exactly one sequence that satisfies both the recursion rule and the initial conditions.  Induction can also be used to prove properties about a sequence, especially for sequences whose most natural description is recursive.

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be defined using a recursive rule along with two initial elements.  The rule is that each element is the sum of the previous two elements, and the first two elements are 0 and 1.
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, {{pad|4em}} with {{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
The first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.  A more complicated example of a sequence that is defined recursively is Recaman's sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A005132|2=Recamán's sequence|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  We can define Recaman's sequence by
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} - n&lt;/math&gt;, if the result is positive and not already in the list.  Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + n&lt;/math&gt;.

Not all sequences can be specified by a rule in the form of an equation, recursive or not, and some can be quite complicated.  For example, the sequence of [[prime number]]s is the set of prime numbers in their natural order, i.e. (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).

Many sequences have the property that each element of a sequence can be computed from the previous element.  In this case, there is some function ''f'' such that for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal definition and basic properties==
There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (''e.g.'', [[exact sequence]]) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.

===Formal definition===
For the purposes of this article, we define a sequence to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[integers]].  This definition covers several different uses of the word "sequence", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions).  However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of [[natural numbers]].  The narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice.   In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the [[codomain]] of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set '''R''' of real numbers,&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt; the set '''C''' of complex numbers,&lt;ref name=Saff&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of Complex Analysis|chapter=Chapter 2.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVsZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=saff+%26+Snider&amp;dq=saff+%26+Snider&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT7PUPaiL4OE2gXvg4GoBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw

Saff &amp; Arthur David Snider |year=2003 |isbn=01-390-7874-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[topological space]].&lt;ref name=Munkres&gt;{{Cite book|title=Topology| chapter=Chapters 1&amp;2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjoZAQAAIAAJ |author=James R. Munkres |isbn=01-318-1629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, i.e. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' rather than ''f''(''n'').  There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the input 1 is called the "first element" of the sequence, the value at 2 is called the "second element", etc.  Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. ''f'', a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in A}&lt;/math&gt;, or just as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here ''A'' is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.

Sequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces.  An important generalization of sequences is the concept of [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A '''net''' is a function from a (possibly [[uncountable]]) [[directed set]] to a topological space.  The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.

===Finite and infinite===
{{See also|ω-language}}
The '''length''' of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.

A sequence of a finite length ''n'' is also called an [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]].  Finite sequences include the '''empty sequence'''&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) that has no elements.

{{anchor|Doubly infinite|Doubly-infinite sequences}}
Normally, the term ''infinite sequence'' refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other—the sequence has a first element, but no final element.  Such a sequence is called a '''singly infinite sequence''' or a '''one-sided infinite sequence''' when disambiguation is necessary.  In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a '''bi-infinite sequence''', '''two-way infinite sequence''', or '''doubly infinite sequence'''.  A function from the set '''Z''' of ''all'' [[integers]] into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( …, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8… ), is bi-infinite.  This sequence could be denoted &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Increasing and decreasing===
A sequence is said to be ''[[monotonically increasing]]'', if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing if and only if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' ∈ '''N'''.  If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (&gt;) the previous term then the sequence is called '''strictly monotonically increasing'''.  A sequence is '''monotonically decreasing''', if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and '''strictly monotonically decreasing''', if each is strictly less than the previous.  If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a '''monotone''' sequence.  This is a special case of the more general notion of a [[monotonic function]].

The terms '''nondecreasing''' and '''nonincreasing''' are often used in place of ''increasing'' and ''decreasing'' in order to avoid any possible confusion with ''strictly increasing'' and ''strictly decreasing'', respectively.

===Bounded===
If the sequence of real numbers (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is such that all the terms are less than some real number ''M'', then the sequence is said to be '''bounded from above'''.  In other words, this means that there exists ''M'' such that for all ''n'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''M''.  Any such ''M'' is called an ''upper bound''.  Likewise, if, for some real ''m'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''m'' for all ''n'' greater than some ''N'', then the sequence is '''bounded from below''' and any such ''m'' is called a ''lower bound''.  If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be '''bounded'''.

===Subsequences===
A '''[[subsequence]]''' of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.  For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted.  However, the relative positions are preserved.

Formally, a subsequence of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is any sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(n_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.

===Other types of sequences===
Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include:
* An '''[[integer sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are integers.
* A '''[[polynomial sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.
* A positive integer sequence is sometimes called '''multiplicative''', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''nm''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; for all pairs ''n'', ''m'' such that ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on generating functions|last=Lando|first=Sergei K.|publisher=AMS|ISBN=0-8218-3481-9|chapter=7.4 Multiplicative sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances, sequences are often called ''multiplicative'', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''na''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''.  Moreover, a ''multiplicative'' Fibonacci sequence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0020739031000158362|title=Fibonacci's multiplicative sequence|first=Sergio|last=Falcon|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=310–315|doi=10.1080/0020739031000158362}}&lt;/ref&gt; satisfies the recursion relation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* A [[binary sequence]] is a sequence whose terms have one of two discrete values, e.g. [[base 2]] values (0,1,1,0, ...) , a series of coin tosses (Heads/Tails) H,T,H,H,T, ..., the answers to a set of True or False questions (T, F, T, T, ...), and so on.

==Limits and convergence==
{{Main|Limit of a sequence}}

[[File:Converging Sequence example.svg|320px|thumb|The plot of a convergent sequence (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is shown in blue.  From the graph we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as ''n'' increases.]]

An important property of a sequence is ''convergence''.  If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the ''limit''. If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''. A sequence that does not converge is '''divergent'''.

Informally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain ''arbitrarily'' close to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that given a real number &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  

For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{n+1}{2n^2}&lt;/math&gt; shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences &lt;math&gt;b_n = n^3&lt;/math&gt; (which begins 1, 8, 27, &amp;hellip;) and &lt;math&gt;c_n = (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; (which begins -1, 1, -1, 1, &amp;hellip;) are both divergent. 

If a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique.  This value is called the '''limit''' of the sequence.  The limit of a convergent sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is normally denoted &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a divergent sequence, then the expression &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless.

=== Formal definition of convergence===

A sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges to''' a real number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have&lt;ref name="Gaughan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Analysis |last=Gaughan |first=Edward |publisher=AMS (2009)|ISBN=0-8218-4787-2|chapter=1.1 Sequences and Convergence}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;|a_n - L| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complex modulus, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z^*z}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of points in a [[metric space]], then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression &lt;math&gt;|a_n-L|&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the expression &lt;math&gt;\text{dist}(a_n, L)&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications and important results===
If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/Sequences.aspx |title=Series and Sequences |last1=Dawikins |first1=Paul |work=Paul's Online Math Notes/Calc II (notes) |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n \pm b_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \pm \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Cauchy sequences===
{{Main|Cauchy sequence}}

[[File:Cauchy sequence illustration.svg|350px|thumb| The plot of a Cauchy sequence (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), shown in blue, as ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' versus ''n''.  In the graph the sequence appears to be converging to a  limit as the distance between consecutive terms in the sequence gets smaller as ''n'' increases.  In the [[real number]]s every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.]]

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large.  The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [[metric spaces]], and, in particular, in [[real analysis]].  One particularly important result in real analysis is ''Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences'':
:A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.
In contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of [[rational numbers]] that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1=2|2=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}|2=2}}
is Cauchy, but has no rational limit, cf. [[Cauchy sequence#Counter-example: rational numbers|here]].  More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an [[irrational number]] is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.

Metric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called [[complete metric space]]s and are particularly nice for analysis.

=== Infinite limits ===

In calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative.  If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily large as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we say that the sequence '''diverges''', or that it '''converges to infinity'''. An example of such a sequence is {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''}}.

If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and say that the sequence '''diverges''' or '''converges to negative infinity'''.

==Series==
{{Main|Series (mathematics)}}
A '''series''' is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence.  That is, it is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a_1 + a_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of real or complex numbers.  The '''partial sums''' of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the ''N''th partial sum of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number
:&lt;math&gt;S_N = \sum_{n = 1}^N a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N. &lt;/math&gt;
The partial sums themselves form a sequence &lt;math&gt;(S_N)_{N\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the '''sequence of partial sums''' of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is '''convergent''', and the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''value''' of the series.  The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = \lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Use in other fields of mathematics==

===Topology===
Sequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of [[metric spaces]].  For instance:
* A [[metric space]] is [[compact space|compact]] exactly when it is [[sequential compactness|sequentially compact]].
* A function from a metric space to another metric space is [[continuous function|continuous]] exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.
* A metric space is a [[connected space]] if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.
* A [[topological space]] is [[separable space|separable]] exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.

Sequences can be generalized to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].  These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.

====Product topology====
The [[product topology|topological product]] of a sequence of topological spaces is the [[cartesian product]] of those spaces, equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the [[product topology]].

More formally, given a sequence of spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, the product space

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i\in\mathbb N} X_i, &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the set of all sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''i'', &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' are the maps ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;p_i((x_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}) = x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

===Analysis===
In [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], when talking about sequences, one will generally consider sequences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)\text{ or }(x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt;
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by [[natural number]]s.

It may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from 1 or 0.  For example, the sequence defined by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1/[[logarithm|log]](''n'') would be defined only for ''n'' ≥ 2.  When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices [[large enough]], that is, greater than some given ''N''.

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some [[vector space]].  In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often [[function space]]s.  Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some [[topological space]].

====Sequence spaces====
{{main|Sequence space}}
A [[sequence space]] is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''', where '''K''' is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication.  All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].

The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or [[#c and c0|null sequence]]s form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with the sup norm.  Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fréchet space]] called an [[FK-space]].

===Linear algebra===
Sequences over a field may also be viewed as [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] in a [[vector space]].  Specifically, the set of ''F''-valued sequences (where ''F'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) is a [[function space]] (in fact, a [[product space]]) of ''F''-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.

===Abstract algebra===
Abstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.

====Free monoid====
{{Main|Free monoid}}
If ''A'' is a set, the [[free monoid]] over ''A'' (denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, also called [[Kleene star]] of ''A'') is a [[monoid]] containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of ''A'', with the binary operation of concatenation.  The [[free semigroup]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the subsemigroup of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; containing all elements except the empty sequence.

====Exact sequences====
{{Main|Exact sequence}}
In the context of [[group theory]], a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 \;\xrightarrow{f_1}\; G_1 \;\xrightarrow{f_2}\; G_2 \;\xrightarrow{f_3}\; \cdots \;\xrightarrow{f_n}\; G_n&lt;/math&gt;
of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism]]s is called '''exact''', if the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (or [[Range (mathematics)|range]]) of each homomorphism is equal to the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the next:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}(f_k) = \mathrm{ker}(f_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other [[algebraic structure]]s.  For example, one could have an exact sequence of [[vector space]]s and [[linear map]]s, or of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s.

====Spectral sequences====
{{Main|Spectral sequence}}
In [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], a '''spectral sequence''' is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  Spectral sequences are a generalization of [[exact sequence]]s, and since their introduction by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean Leray|first=Jean|last=Leray|year=1946}}, they have become an important research tool, particularly in [[homotopy theory]].

===Set theory===
An [[Order topology#Ordinal-indexed sequences|ordinal-indexed sequence]] is a generalization of a sequence.  If α is a [[limit ordinal]] and ''X'' is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' is a function from α to ''X''.  In this terminology an ω-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.

===Computing===
[[Automata theory|Automata]] or [[finite state machine]]s can typically be thought of as directed graphs, with edges labeled using some specific alphabet, Σ.  Most familiar types of automata transition from state to state by reading input letters from Σ, following edges with matching labels; the ordered input for such an automaton forms a sequence called a ''word'' (or input word).  The sequence of states encountered by the automaton when processing a word is called a ''run''.  A [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic automaton]] may have unlabeled or duplicate out-edges for any state, giving more than one successor for some input letter.  This is typically thought of as producing multiple possible runs for a given word, each being a sequence of single states, rather than producing a single run that is a sequence of sets of states; however, 'run' is occasionally used to mean the latter.

===Streams===
Infinite sequences of [[numerical digit|digits]] (or [[character (computing)|characters]]) drawn from a [[finite set|finite]] [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] are of particular interest in [[theoretical computer science]].  They are often referred to simply as ''sequences'' or ''[[Stream (computing)|streams]]'', as opposed to finite ''[[String (computer science)#Formal theory|strings]]''.  Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of [[bit]]s (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}).  The set ''C'' = {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the [[Cantor space]].

An infinite binary sequence can represent a [[formal language]] (a set of strings) by setting the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th string (in [[shortlex order]]) is in the language.  This representation is useful in the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonalization method]] for proofs.&lt;ref name=Oflazer2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oflazer|first1=Kemal|title=FORMAL LANGUAGES, AUTOMATA AND COMPUTATION: DECIDABILITY|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/pdfs/lecture-15.pdf|website=cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie-Mellon University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1972, George Duncan and Roger Jones were thrown into a river by a group of men believed to be police officers, [[Murder of George Duncan|resulting in Duncan's death]]. Jones refused to identify their attackers out of fear for his life. A group of officers were charged but acquitted, and the case is said to be the subject of a government cover-up.

* [[Suicide of Tyrone Unsworth|A gay teenager Tyrone Unsworth killed himself]] after prolonged homophobic bullying at his school, which culminated with his being hospitalized after his jaw was struck with a fence used as a weapon by another boy.
*Roffee and Waling (2016) conducted a study that aimed to investigate incidents of bullying, harassment and violence committed towards LGBTIQ people. They discovered an issue, however, when they found that many people did not view what they had been subjected to as a hate crime, or even a crime at all. Furthermore, many of the participants commented on feeling that they did not meet the criteria of being a victim of harassment, bullying or violence. This established that prospective participants may not have felt that they met the criteria and thus would not have elected to take part in the study. The conclusion of the study established that all of the participants had been subjected to some form of victimisation, with some of the attacks being extremely violent and criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306325028_Resolving_ethical_challenges_when_researching_with_minority_and_vulnerable_populations_LGBTIQ_victims_of_violence_harassment_and_bullying|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Resolving ethical challenges when researching with minority and vulnerable populations: LGBTIQ victims of violence, harassment and bullying}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this confession, details of the dreadful act became known. The victim had a deeply fragile health condition, and these boys frequently harassed, insulted, and chased her. On the 19th, a group of these boys entered the unfinished and abandoned building where Gisberta was staying, tied her up, gagged and assaulted her with extreme violence, kicking her and beating her up with sticks and stones. The group also confessed to having introduced sticks into Gisberta's anus, whose body presented great injuries, and to having abandoned her at the scene. Her body also had cigarette-burn marks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9942">'''Social network aggregation''' is the process of collecting content from multiple [[social network service]]s, such as [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], [[Flickr]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], [[YouTube]],  [[List of social networking websites|etc.]] into one unified presentation. The task is often performed by a social network aggregator (such as [[Hootsuite]], [https://taggbox.com Taggbox] and [[FriendFeed]]), which pulls together information into a single location,&lt;ref name=king&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070615_141976.htm |title=When Your Social Sites Need Networking |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Rachael King |date=2007-06-18 |work=[[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or helps a user consolidate multiple social networking profiles into one profile.&lt;ref name=mashable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2007/07/17/social-network-aggregators/ |title=20 Ways To Aggregate Your Social Networking Profiles |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Stan Schroeder |date=2007-07-17 |publisher=[[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various aggregation services provide tools or [[GUI widget|widgets]] to allow users to consolidate messages, track friends, combine bookmarks, search across multiple social networking sites, read [[RSS feed]]s for multiple social networks, see when their name is mentioned on various sites, access their profiles from a single interface, provide "lifestreams", etc.&lt;ref name=mashable/&gt; Social network aggregation services attempt to organize or simplify a user's social networking experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Upstart websites aim to consolidate social networking |author=Beth Snyder Bulik |date=2007-06-18 |publisher=[[Advertising Age]] |quote= The latest trend in the space is aggregation-websites...[which] all present variations on the theme of organizing or simplifying a consumer's social-networking experience. }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the idea has been satirized by the concept of a "social network aggregator aggregator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspot.com/News/2008/03/social-network-aggregator-aggregator-launched.html |title=Social Network Aggregator Aggregator AllMyFrickingFriends.com Launched |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Brian Briggs |date=2008-03-17 |publisher=[[BBSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other related uses of social media aggregators aside from simplifying the user's social networking experiences. Some aggregators are designed to help companies (and bloggers) improve engagement with their brand(s) by creating aggregated social streams that can be embedded into an existing website and customized to look visually intrinsic to the site. This allows potential customers to interact with all the social media posts maintained by the brand without requiring them to jump from site to site. This has the benefit of keeping customers on the brand's site for a longer period of time (increasing "time on site" metrics).

==Social network aggregators==
Social network aggregation platforms allow social network members to share social network activities like [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Stumbleupon]], [[Digg]], [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], with other major platforms. All content appears in real time to other members who subscribe to a particular community, which eliminates the need to jump from one [[social media]] network to another, trying to keep an eye on one's interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|title=Social Aggregation: defragment your online life|date=April 1, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229172414/http://tech.justmoved.in/2008/04/01/social-aggregation-defragment-your-online-life/|archivedate=December 29, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social network aggregation systems can rely on initiation by publishers or by readers. In the publisher-initiated aggregation systems, the publishers combine their own identities, which make their readers see all aggregated content once subscribed. In the reader-initiated systems (such as [[Windows Phone 7]] people hub&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/features/default.aspx|title=Windows Phone 7 Features|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Microsoft |work=[[Microsoft]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Linked Internet UI&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://research.nokia.com/page/5457 |title= Linked Internet UI Concept|accessdate=2011-11-11 |author=Nokia |date=2009-09-02 | work= [[Nokia]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), the readers combine the identities of others, which has no impact on the publishers or other readers. The publishers can still keep separate identities for different readers.

Technically, the aggregation is enabled by [[API]]s provided by social networks. For the API to access a user's actions from another platform, the user will have to give permission to the social-aggregation platform, by specifying the user-id and password of the social media to be syndicated. This concept resembles [[open ID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alchemi.co.uk/archives/hum/aggregation_of_.html |title=Aggregation of data across social networks |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=David Jennings |date=2005-08-03 |publisher=alchemi.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that [[social network service]]s are only beginning the move away from "walled gardens" to more open architectures.  Some sites are working together on a "data portability workgroup", while others are focusing on a single sign-on system called [[OpenID]] to allow users to log on across multiple sites.  Historically, the trend from private services to more open ones can be seen across many Internet services from email and instant messaging to the move that early [[online service provider]]s made to become websites.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880936 |title=Everywhere and nowhere |accessdate=2008-04-10 |date=2008-03-19 |publisher=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[OpenSocial]] initiative aims to bridge the member overlap between various online social network services.&lt;ref name=alexp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.compete.com/2007/11/12/connecting-the-social-graph-member-overlap-at-opensocial-and-facebook/ |title=Connecting the Social Graph: Member Overlap at OpenSocial and Facebook |accessdate=2008-04-10 |author=Alex Patriquin |date=2007-11-12 |publisher=[[Compete.com]] blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap between multiple social-network services==
The attraction of social network aggregation comes from the fact that some users tend to use multiple social networks: they have accounts on several social-networking sites.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; In November 2007, Alex Patriquin of [[Compete.com]] reported on the member overlap between various online social network services:&lt;ref name="alexp"/&gt;

'''Steven Goldberg''' (born 14 October 1941) is a native of New York City and chaired the Department of [[Sociology]] at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) from 1988 until his retirement in 2008. He is most widely known for his theory of [[patriarchy]], which attempts to explain male domination through biological causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23233">[[Image:Levels of existence.svg|thumb|right|The upper levels on this chart can be considered to supervene on the lower levels.]]

In [[philosophy]], '''supervenience''' refers to a relation between sets of properties or sets of facts. X is said to supervene on Y if and only if some difference in Y is necessary for any difference in X to be possible. Equivalently, X is said to supervene on Y if and only if X cannot vary unless Y varies. Here are some examples. 

* Whether there is a table in the living room supervenes on the positions of molecules in the living room.
* The truth value of (A) supervenes on the truth value of (¬A). 
* Molecular properties supervene on atomic properties. 
* The quality of Nixon’s moral character supervenes on how he is disposed to act.

A table could not be removed from a room without the positions of molecules in that room changing. In a logic with double negation elimination, the truth value of (A) could not change without the truth value of (¬A) changing. Facts about the properties of a molecule could not change without facts about its atomic constituents changing. And facts about the quality of Nixon's moral character could not change without facts about how he has acted, or about how he would be disposed to act, changing. 

Supervenience is of interest to philosophers because it differs from other nearby relations, for example [[Logical_consequence|entailment]]. It may be possible for some A to supervene on some B without being entailed by B. In such cases it may seem puzzling why A should supervene on B and equivalently why changes in A should require changes in B. Two important applications of supervenience involve cases like this. One of these is the supervenience of mental properties (like the sensation of pain) on physical properties (like the firing of ‘pain neurons’). A second is the supervenience of normative facts (facts about how things ought to be) on natural facts (facts about how things are).

These applications are elaborated below. But an illustrative note bears adding here. It is sometimes claimed (and has been claimed in earlier versions of this entry) that what is at issue in these problems is the supervenience claim itself. For example, it has been claimed that what is at issue with respect to the mind-body problem is whether mental phenomena do in fact supervene on physical phenomena. This is incorrect. It is by and large agreed that some form of supervenience holds in these cases: Pain happens when the appropriate neurons fire. The disagreement is over why this is so. Materialists claim that we observe supervenience because the neural phenomena entail the mental phenomena, while dualists deny this. The dualist’s challenge is to explain supervenience without entailment. 

The problem is similar with respect to the supervenience of normative facts on natural facts. It is agreed that facts about how persons ought to act are not entailed by natural facts but cannot vary unless natural facts vary, and this rigid binding without entailment might seem puzzling. The possibility of "supervenience without entailment" or "supervenience without reduction" is contested territory among philosophers.

== History ==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:DavidsonDonald.jpg|thumb|right|[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] popularized the use of supervenience in the philosophy of mind.]] --&gt;

Supervenience, which means literally "coming or occurring as something novel, additional, or unexpected",&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;Horgan, Terry (1993) "From supervenience to superdupervenience: meeting the demands of a material world."  ''Mind.''  '''102''': 555-86.&lt;/ref&gt; from "super," meaning on, above, or additional, and "venire," meaning to come, shows occurrences in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dating back to 1844.

Its systematic use in philosophy is considered to have begun in early 20th-century [[meta-ethics]] and [[emergentism]]. As [[G.E. Moore]] wrote in 1922, "if a given thing possesses any kind of intrinsic value in a certain degree, then... anything ''exactly like it'', must, under all circumstances, possess it in exactly the same degree".&lt;ref name="Horgan"/&gt; This usage also carried over into the work of [[R. M. Hare]]. For discussion of the emergentist roots of supervenience see [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/#2.2 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Supervenience].

In the 1970s, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] was the first to use the term to describe a broadly physicalist (and non-reductive) approach to the philosophy of mind.  As he said in 1970, "supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respects, or that an object cannot alter in some mental respects without altering in some physical respects." &lt;ref name = "Davidson"&gt;Davidson, Donald (1970) "Mental Events." Reprinted in ''Essays on Actions and Events''. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years Terry Horgan, [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], and especially [[Jaegwon Kim]] formalized the concept and began applying it to many issues in the philosophy of mind. This raised numerous questions about how various formulations relate to one another, how adequate the formulation is to various philosophical tasks (in particular, the task of formulating [[physicalism]]), and whether it avoids or entails [[reductionism]].

== Definitions ==

In the contemporary literature, there are two primary (and non-equivalent) formulations of supervenience (for both definitions let A and B be sets of properties).{{Citation needed|reason=It refers to the literature but there is no single reference in this section |date=January 2018}}

(1) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if all things that are B-indiscernible are A-indiscernible.  Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y (\forall X_{\in B} (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy) \rightarrow \forall Y_{\in A} (Yx \leftrightarrow Yy))&lt;/math&gt;
(2) A-properties supervene on B-properties if and only if anything that has an A-property has some B-property such that anything that has that B-property also has that A-property. Formally:
*&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall X_{\in A} (Xx \rightarrow \exists Y_{\in B} (Yx \and \forall y (Yy \rightarrow Xy)))&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if one lets A be a set of mental properties, lets B be a set of physical properties, and chooses a [[domain of discourse]] consisting of persons, then (1) says that any two persons who are physically indiscernible are mentally indiscernible, and (2) says that any person who has a mental property has some physical property such that any person with that physical property has that mental property.

Some points of clarification: first, the definitions above involve quantification over properties and hence [[higher order logic]].  Second, in (1), expressions of the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall X (Xx \leftrightarrow Xy))&lt;/math&gt; capture the concept of sharing all properties, or being [[indiscernible]] with respect to a set of properties.  Thus, (1) can be understood more intuitively as the claim that all objects that are indiscernible with respect to a base set of properties are indiscernible with respect to a supervenient set of properties, or, as it is also sometimes said, that B-twins are A-twins.  Finally, supervenience claims typically involve some modal force, however, the way that  [[Modal logic|modal]] force is specified depends on which more specific variety of supervenience one decides upon (see below).

(1) and (2) are sometimes called "schemata", because they do not correspond to actual supervenience relations until the sets of properties A and B, the [[domain of discourse|domain]] of entities to which those properties apply, and a modal force have been specified. For modal forms of supervenience, the modal strength of the relation is usually taken to be a parameter (that is, the possible worlds appealed to may be physically possible, logically possible, etc.). Also, note that in the early literature properties were not always central, and there remain some who prefer to frame the relation in terms of [[Predicate (logic)|predicates]], [[fact]]s, or [[entities]] instead, for example.

== Varieties of supervenience ==
Beginning in the 1980s, inspired largely by [[Jaegwon Kim]]'s work, philosophers proposed many varieties of supervenience, which [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] called the "unlovely proliferation".&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;Lewis, David (1986) ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These varieties are based both on (1) and (2) above, but because (1) is more common we shall focus on varieties of supervenience based on it.

We can begin by distinguishing between local and global supervenience:

* Local: For any two objects x and y, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if mental states locally supervene on brain states, then being in the same brain state entails being in the same mental state.

* Global: For any two worlds w1 and w2, if w1 and w2 are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

For example, if psychological properties globally supervene on physical properties, then any two worlds physically the same will be psychologically the same.  The value of global supervenience is that it allows for supervenient properties to be determined not by local properties of an individual thing alone, but by some wider spatiotemporal distribution of things and properties. For example, something's being a dollar bill depends not only on the paper and the inks it is made out of, but also on a widely dispersed variety of features of the world it occupies.

Both local and global supervenience come in many forms. Local supervenience comes in strong and weak varieties:

* Weak: For any world w, and for any two objects x in w and y in w, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.
* Strong: For any worlds w1 and w2, and for any two objects x in w1 and y in w2, if x and y are base-indiscernible, they are supervenient-indiscernible.

The difference is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, will also be psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, my physical duplicates in the actual world will have the same thoughts as I have; but my physical duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.

There are also several kinds of global supervenience relations, which were introduced to handle cases in which worlds are the same at the base level and also at the supervenient level, but where the ways the properties are connected and distributed in the worlds differ.  For example, it is consistent with global mental–physical supervenience on the simple formulation described above for two worlds to have the same number of people in the same physical states, but for the mental states to be distributed over those people in different ways (e.g. I have my father's thoughts in the other world, and he has my thoughts).  To handle this, property-preserving isomorphisms (1-1 and onto functions between the objects of two worlds, whereby an object in one world has a property if and only if the object which that function takes you to in the other world does) are used, and once this is done, several varieties of global supervenience can be defined.

Other varieties of supervenience include multiple-domains supervenience and similarity-based supervenience.

==Examples of supervenient properties==

===Value properties===
The [[Value theory|value]] of a physical object to an [[wiktionary:agent|agent]] is sometimes held to be supervenient upon the physical properties of the object.  In [[aesthetics]], the [[beauty]] of [[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte|La Grande Jatte]] might supervene on the physical composition of the painting (the specific [[molecules]] that make up the painting), the artistic composition of the painting (in this case, [[Pointillism|dots]]), the figures and forms of the painted image, or the painted canvas as a whole.  In [[ethics]], the [[good and evil|goodness]] of an act of [[charity (virtue)|charity]] might supervene on the physical properties of the agent, the mental state of the agent (his or her intention), or the external [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] itself.  Similarly, the overall suffering caused by an earthquake might supervene on the spatio-temporal entities that constituted it, the deaths it caused, or the natural disaster itself. The claim that moral properties are supervenient upon non-moral properties is called [[moral supervenience]].

===Mental properties===
In [[philosophy of mind]], many philosophers make the general claim that the mental supervenes on the physical. In its most recent form this position derives from the work of [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], although in more rudimentary forms it had been advanced earlier by others. The claim can be taken in several senses, perhaps most simply in the sense that the mental ''properties'' of a person are supervenient on their physical ''properties''. Then:

* If two persons are indistinguishable in all of their physical properties, they must also be indistinguishable in all of their mental properties.

An alternative claim, advanced especially by [[John Haugeland]], is a kind of ''weak local'' supervenience claim; or, weaker still, mere ''global'' supervenience. The claim that mental properties supervene globally on physical properties requires only a quite modest commitment: any difference between two possible worlds with respect to their instantiated mental properties entails at least ''some'' difference in the physical properties instantiated in those two worlds.  Importantly, it does ''not'' require that the mental properties of an individual person supervene ''only'' on that person's physical state.

This weak global thesis is particularly important in the light of [[direct reference]] theories, and [[semantic externalism]] with regard to the content both of words and (more relevant to our concerns here) of ''thoughts''.  Imagine two persons who are indistinguishable in their local physical properties. One has a dog in front of his eyes and the other has a dog-image artificially projected onto his retinae. It might be reasonable to say that the former is in the ''mental state'' of seeing a dog (and of knowing that he does so), whereas the latter is not in such a state of seeing a dog (but falsely believes that he sees one).

There is also discussion among philosophers about mental supervenience and our experience of duration. If all mental properties supervene only upon some physical properties at durationless moments, then it may be difficult to explain our experience of duration. The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as [[Presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], and is a form of belief in [[Galilean relativity]].

===Computational properties===
There are several examples of supervenience to be found in [[computer network]]ing. For example, in a dial-up internet connection, the audio signal on a phone line transports [[Internet Protocol|IP packets]] between the user's computer and the [[Internet service provider]]'s computer. In this case, the arrangement of bytes in that packet supervenes on the physical properties of the phone signal. More generally, each layer of the [[OSI Model]] of computer networking supervenes on the layers below it.

We can find supervenience wherever a message is conveyed by a representational medium. When we see a letter "a" in a page of print, for example, the meaning ''Latin lowercase "a"'' supervenes on the geometry of the boundary of the printed [[glyph]], which in turn supervenes on the ink deposition on the paper.

===Biological properties===
In biological systems [[phenotype]] can be said to supervene on [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mitchell, Valone| first=W.A., T.J. | year=1990 | title=The Optimization Research Program: Studying Adaptations by Their Function | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume=65 | pages=43–52| doi=10.1086/416584 | issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because any genotype encodes a finite set of unique phenotypes, but any given phenotype is not produced by a finite set of genotypes. Innumerable examples of [[convergent evolution]] can be used to support this claim. Throughout nature, convergent evolution produces incredibly similar phenotypes from a diverse set of taxa with fundamentally different genotypes underpinning the phenotypes. One example is [[Foster's rule|evolution on islands]] which is a remarkably predictable example of convergent evolution where the same phenotypes consistently evolve for the same reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Foster | first=J.B. | year=1964 | title=The evolution of mammals on islands | journal=Nature | volume=202 | pages=234–235| doi=10.1038/202234a0 | bibcode=1964Natur.202..234F | issue=4929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms released from predation tend to become larger, while organisms limited by food tend to become smaller. Yet there are almost infinite numbers of genetic changes that might lead to changes in body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=R.A. | year=1918 | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Soc Edinb. | volume=52 | pages=399–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kemper | first=K.E. | last2=Visscher | first2=P.M. | last3=Gooddard | first3=M.E. | year=2012 | title=Genetic architecture of body size in mammals | journal=Genome Biol. | volume=13 | pages=244| doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-4-244 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of convergent evolution is the loss of sight that almost universally occurs in [[cave fish]] living in lightless pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gatenby R.A., Gillies R.J  |author2=Brown J.S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2011 | title= Of cancer and cave fish  | journal= Nature Reviews Cancer | volume=11 | pages=237| doi=10.1038/nrc3036 | issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyes are expensive, and in lightless cave pools there is little reason for fish to have eyes. Yet, despite the remarkably consistent convergent evolution producing sightless cave fish, the genetics that produce the loss of type phenotype is different nearly every time. This is because phenotype supervenes on genotype.

==Arguments against supervenience-based formulations of physicalism==
Although supervenience seems to be perfectly suited to explain the predictions of physicalism (i.e. the mental is dependent on the physical), there are four main problems with it. They are ''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'', the ''lone ammonium molecule problem'', ''modal status problem'' and the ''problem of necessary beings.''

=== Epiphenomenal ectoplasm ===

''Epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' was proposed by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, in which they stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) ''W'' is identical to our world in the distribution of all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world ''W'' contains an experience called ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm'' that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then such a world could not exist because a physical duplicate of the actual world (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. This was rectified by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state "Physicalism is true at a possible world ''W'' if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of ''W'' is a duplicate of ''W simpliciter.''"{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=== The lone ammonium molecule problem ===

The ''lone ammonium molecule problem'' provides a problem for Jackson's solution to ''epiphenomenal ectoplasm''. It was proposed by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world ''W'' was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of ''W'' to be vastly different from those in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, it would not be consistent with our understanding of physicalism.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Modal status problem ===

The ''modal status problem'' is only problematic if one thinks of physicalism as a [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] truth (i.e. not [[logical truth|necessary truth]]), because it is described in terms of modal notions (i.e. through modal realism). The problem is presented when, from the statement "Minimal physical truths entail all truths," one derives the statement "''S'' (a statement that describes all minimal physical truths) entails ''S''* (a statement that describes the world)". This statement is a necessary truth, and therefore supervenience physicalism could not be contingent. The solution to this is to accept the above statement not as the equivalent of physicalism, but as an entailment of it.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Problem of necessary beings ===

The ''problem of necessary beings'' was proposed by Jackson in 1998, in which he stated that a necessary being exists in all possible worlds as a [[non-physical entity]], and therefore proves physicalism false. However, physicalism allows for the existence of necessary beings, because any minimal physical duplicate would have the same mental properties as the actual world. This however is [[paradox]]ical, based on the fact that physicalism both permits and prevents the existence of such beings. This violates [[Hume's fork]] which states, "there are no necessary connections between distinct existences".{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''TAChart''' is a [[Component (software)|component]] for the [[Lazarus (IDE)|Lazarus]] IDE that provides [[chart]]ing services. Similar to [[Tchart]] and [[Teechart]] for [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]] it supports a collection of different chart types including [[bar chart]]s, [[pie chart]]s, [[line chart]]s and [[point chart|point series]]. Apart from a screen [[Canvas (GUI)|canvas]], output is possible in form of [[SVG]], [[OpenGL]], printer, [[Windows Metafile|WMF]], and other formats.

TAChart is bundled with the [[Lazarus Component Library]]. Although not intended to be a TChart clone, why its usage differs in certain points, its basic functionality is very similar and some source code written for TeeChart may be reused.

== History ==

The first version of TAChart was developed by Philippe Martinole for the TeleAuto project, a program for automation of astronomic observations. Later functionality was introduced by Luis Rodrigues while porting the [[Epanet]] application from Delphi to Lazarus. In the ensuing years the code has extensively rewritten, expanded and is now maintained by Alexander Klenin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lazarus wiki: TAChart|url=http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/TAChart|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}

'''Value criticism''' (in German ''Wertkritik'') is a branch of [[post-Marxism]] which criticizes [[Capitalism|capitalistic society]]. Value criticism follows in the traditions of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]] developed under [[Max Horkheimer]]. Prominent adherents of value criticism include [[Robert Kurz (philosopher)|Robert Kurz]], Roswitha Scholz, [[Moishe Postone]] and Jean-Marie Vincent.
==Aspects of value criticism==
Value criticism takes crucial aspects of Marx's critiques of [[commodity fetishism]], commodities and value, while criticizing Marx's theory of [[Class conflict|class struggle]] and [[historical materialism]]. As a result, proponents of Value Criticism feel that the working class is not necessarily a revolutionary subject. Instead, it is pointed out that labor has to be understood as a historic specific entity and that criticizing capitalism implies not only criticizing the distribution process in capitalism, but also the capitalistic production process and the productive powers. From this, they conclude that [[all actually existing socialisms thus far]] have been in essence forms of [[state-led capitalism]], where production still followed capitalistic principles. This interpretation, which rejects the traditional Marxist point of view, is defended in the [[Refusal of work#Manifesto Against Labour|''Manifesto Against Labour'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krisis.org/1999/manifesto-against-labour |title=Manifesto against Labour |publisher=Krisis |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of value-direction==
In addition to value criticism, a new branch appeared within a circle of theorists led by Roswitha Scholz. The so-called critique of value direction (in German called "Wertabspaltungskritik") includes not only precise descriptions of the "abstract and fetishized character of modern domination",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platypus1917.org/2013/05/01/marx-and-wertkritik/ |title=Marx and "Wertkritik" : Platypus |publisher=Platypus1917.org |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also seeks to explain why irrational attitudes are delegated to women, while men are counted as relatively rational actors in the capitalistic society.

==Criticism==
Many leftists{{Who|date=February 2014}} claim that books such as [[Schwarzbuch Kapitalismus|''The Black Book of Capitalism'']] neither offers a realistic alternative to capitalistic society nor provide any options for actions to overcome capitalism. Additionally, Gerhard Hanloser and Karl Reitter claim that value criticism is a critique from the standpoint of the circulation sphere which can not be explained from within itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grundrisse.net/grundrisse17/17karl_reitter.htm |title=Das Kapital wieder lesen |publisher=Grundrisse.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Publishers of value criticism in Germany are the ''[[Krisis (German journal)|Krisis]]'' group and [[Exit!]], to both of which Robert Kurz made crucial contributions. Much value critical literature has still to be translated into English. Elmar Flatschart from the University of Vienna is also publishing in English for the Exit! group. Moishe Postone and his work "Time, Labor and Social Domination" is often cited by value critics.

'''Victim playing''' (also known as '''playing the victim''', '''victim card''' or '''self-victimization''') is the fabrication of victimhood for a variety of reasons such as to justify [[abuse]] of others, to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] others, a [[coping strategy]] or [[attention seeking]].

==For abuse==

Victim playing by abusers is either:&lt;ref&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2015) Life After Narcissistic Abuse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish7&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Distraction|diverting]] [[attention]] away from acts of abuse by claiming that the abuse was justified based on another person's bad behavior (typically the victim)
* soliciting [[sympathy]] from others in order to gain their assistance in supporting or [[enabling]] the abuse of a victim (known as [[proxy abuse]]).

It is common for abusers to engage in victim playing. This serves two purposes:
* [[Rationalization (making excuses)|justification]] to themselves – as a way of dealing with the [[cognitive dissonance]] that results from inconsistencies between the way they treat others and what they believe about themselves.
* justification to others – as a way of escaping harsh judgment or condemnation they may fear from others.

==For manipulation==
Manipulators often play the victim role ("poor me") by portraying themselves as victims of circumstances or someone else's behavior in order to gain [[pity]] or [[sympathy]] or to evoke [[compassion]] and thereby get something from someone. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering, and the manipulator often finds it easy and rewarding to play on sympathy to get cooperation.&lt;ref name=simon&gt;{{cite book|title=In Sheep's Clothing: Understanding and Dealing with Manipulative People |first=George K|last=Simon |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-9651696-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While portraying oneself as a victim can be highly successful in obtaining goals over the short-term, this method tends to be less successful over time:
:Victims’ talent for high drama draws people to them like moths to a flame. Their permanent dire state brings out the altruistic motives in others. It is hard to ignore constant cries for help. In most instances, however, the help given is of short duration. And like moths in a flame, helpers quickly get burned; nothing seems to work to alleviate the victims’ miserable situation; there is no movement for the better. Any efforts rescuers make are ignored, belittled, or met with hostility. No wonder that the rescuers become increasingly frustrated — and walk away.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries (2014). Are you a victim of the victim syndrome? Organizational Dynamics 43, pp 130-137 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orgdyn.2014.03.007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other goals==
Victim playing is also:   
* an attention seeking technique (see for example [[Münchausen syndrome]]).
* a strategy used by [[alcoholic]]s to elicit [[constructive criticism]], [[rescue]], or [[enabling]] behavior from others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Katie &amp; Sullivan, J. Michael Dual Diagnosis: Counseling the Mentally Ill Substance Abuser (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In corporate life==
The language of "victim playing" has entered modern [[Corporate governance|corporate life]], as a potential weapon of all professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Susan A. DePhillips, ''Corporate Confidential'' (2005) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; To define victim-players as dishonest may be an [[Empowerment|empowering]] response;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Mersino, ''Emotional Literacy for Project Managers'' (2007) p. 60 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; as too may be awareness of how childhood [[Personal boundaries|boundary issues]] can underlay the tactic.&lt;ref&gt;Mersino, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hustle of [[office politics]], the term may however be abused so as to penalize the legitimate victim of injustice, as well as the role-player.

==Underlying psychology==
[[Transactional analysis]] distinguishes real victims from those who adopt the role in [[bad faith]], ignoring their own capacities to improve their situation.&lt;ref&gt;Petruska Clarkson, ''Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy'' (London 1997) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Among the predictable interpersonal "games" psychiatrist [[Eric Berne]] identified as common among by victim-players are "Look How Hard I've Tried"  and "Wooden Leg".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (Penguin 1964) p. 92 and p. 141-2&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. D. Laing]] considered that "it will be difficult in practice to determine whether or to what extent a relationship is collusive" – when "the one person is predominantly the passive 'victim'",&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and when they are merely playing the victim. The problem is intensified once a pattern of victimization has been internalised, perhaps in the form of a [[double bind]].&lt;ref&gt;Laing, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;
