      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1374">'''Abd al-Qadir II''' was a ruler of the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] (1603/4 - 1606). According to James Bruce, he was the son of [[Unsa I]], whom Bruce describes as "a weak and ill-inclined man"&lt;ref&gt;James Bruce, ''Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile'' (1805 edition), vol. 3, p. 304, 314&lt;/ref&gt; While he was ruler of Sennar, Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia]] sent to Abd al-Qadir a ''nagarit'', or kettle-drum, richly decorated with gold, which was one of the traditional emblems of an Ethiopian [[negus]] or king; in return, Abd al-Qadir sent Susenyos a trained hunting [[falcon]]. Shortly after this diplomatic exchange, he was deposed by his brother [[Adlan I|Adlan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, ''Travels'', vol. 3 p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point following his deposition from the throne in 1606, Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia]] appointed him governor of Chilga (also known as [[Ayikel]]), an important market town near the Ethiopian border with Sennar.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal functions these proteins perform include [[Ribosomal RNA|ribosome RNA]]/[[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] recognition, delivery of the initiator Met-[[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;, methionine bound tRNAi, to the 40s [[ribosome]], and proofreading of the [[Ribosome|initiation complex]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956539514|title=Evolution of the protein synthesis machinery and its regulation|others=Hernández, Greco,, Jagus, Rosemary,|isbn=9783319394688|location=Switzerland|oclc=956539514}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Conservation of archaeal initiation factors ==

Of the three domains of life,  [[Archaea|archaea]], [[Eukaryote|eukaryotes]], and [[Bacteria|bacteria]], the number of archaeal TIFs is somewhere between eukaryotes and bacteria; eukaryotes have the largest number of TIFs, and bacteria, having streamlined the process, have only three TIFs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Not only are archaeal TIF numbers between that of bacteria and eukaryote numbers, but archaeal initiation factors are seen to have both traits of eukaryotic and prokaryotic intiation factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dmitriev|first=Sergey E.|last2=Stolboushkina|first2=Elena A.|last3=Terenin|first3=Ilya M.|last4=Andreev|first4=Dmitri E.|last5=Garber|first5=Maria B.|last6=Shatsky|first6=Ivan N.|title=Archaeal Translation Initiation Factor aIF2 Can Substitute for Eukaryotic eIF2 in Ribosomal Scanning during Mammalian 48S Complex Formation|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022283611009089|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=413|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2011.08.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Two core TIFs, [[Initiation factor|IF1]]/IF1A and [[Initiation factor|IF2]]/IF5B are conserved across the three domains of life&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There is also a semi-universal TIF found in all archaea and eukaryote called IF1/SUI1, but only in certain bacterial species (YciH). In archeaes and eukaryotes, these TIFs help correct the identification of the intiation codon, while its function is unknown in bacteria&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Just between eukaryote and archaea, a/eIF2 (trimer) and aIF6 in archaeas are conserved in eukaryotes as eIF2(trimer) and eIF6 TIFs&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== aIF1 ==

AIF1 plays a role in occupying the ribosomal A site, helping the unambiguous placement of tRNAi in the P site of in the large ribosomal subunit&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== aIF2 ==

The main function of archaeal IF2 is to join the ribosomal subunits (small and large) to form the complete single (monomeric) mRNA bound ribosome unit in the late stages of initiation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== a/eIF2 (trimer) ==

The a/eIF2 binds to the 40S small subunit of the [[ribosome]] to help guide the start translation of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] into [[Protein|proteins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogoi|first=Prerana|last2=Kanaujia|first2=Shankar Prasad|title=Archaeal and eukaryal translation initiation factor 1 differ in their RNA interacting loops|url=https://febs-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.neu.edu/doi/epdf/10.1002/1873-3468.13044|journal=FEBS Letters|doi=10.1002/1873-3468.13044}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Nihongo|'''Biollante'''|ビオランテ|Biorante|lead=yes}} is a [[kaiju]] who first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1989 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', and has since appeared in numerous licensed video games and comic books. The creature is portrayed as a genetically engineered clone of [[Godzilla]] spliced with the genes of a rose and a human. As the character was created during the end of the [[Cold War]] and a wane in the concerns over nuclear weapons represented by Godzilla, Biollante was conceived as a symbol of more contemporary controversies regarding [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name="making of"/&gt; [[WatchMojo.com]] listed Biollante as #8 on their "Top 10 Godzilla Villains" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zR__HFvn0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Top 10 Godzilla Villains|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=Youtube|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Biollante first appears in the 1989 film ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]''. After [[The Return of Godzilla|Godzilla's return in 1984]], Dr. Genshiro Shiragami attempts to use the monster's cells to genetically enhance various species of plants to create crops resistant to harsh weather. His attempts are initially thwarted when a bomb destroys his laboratory and kills his daughter Erika. Shiragami splices her DNA with that of a rose, which is nearly destroyed five years later by an earthquake. Hoping to make the rose immortal, he further splices its DNA with those of Godzilla, resulting in the creation of a hybrid mutant he christens Biollante. The creature roots itself into [[Lake Ashino]], where it begins calling out to its progenitor Godzilla. Godzilla arrives and incinerates Biollante, whose spores float into the atmosphere. The spores later land near [[Osaka]] in the form of a much more Godzilla-like Biollante, who fights Godzilla to a standstill until the latter retreats after being weakened by the Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria. Biollante subsequently dissolves again and floats into space, with an image of Erika being seen among the spores.&lt;ref name="GvB"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989). Directed by [[Kazuki Ōmori]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The creature makes a brief cameo appearance in ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', where it is speculated that its cells floating in space may have contributed to the creation of the monster [[SpaceGodzilla]].&lt;ref name="GvSG"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994). Directed by Kensho Yamashita. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:GvB - concept art.png|thumb|Biollante concept art, portraying the creature as much more humanoid in appearance]]
Biollante was first conceived by dentist Shinichiro Kobayashi, who was the winner of a story writing contest for a sequel to ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]''. In developing the character, Kobayashi kept in mind how he would feel if his daughter died, and combined this with a mental image he had consisting of Godzilla being consumed by a flower.&lt;ref name="kalat2010"&gt;Kalat, D. (2010), ''A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series'', McFarland, p. 169-78, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-47-49-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idea of Biollante's origins was not too different from those of the final film, though the creature was portrayed in his submission as having no direct link to Godzilla, and of having human-level intelligence, as well as maintaining the memories of Erika. The draft's portrayal of the character had her psychically communicating with a reporter via images of flowers with human faces, and the final Biollante creature had a woman's face.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Godziszewski, E. (1994), ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Godzilla'', Daikaiju Enterprises, pp. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koichi Kawakita]], who had previously worked for [[Tsuburaya Productions]], was assigned to designing and realizing Biollante by [[Toho]] after the company became impressed at his work in ''[[Gunhed (film)|Gunhed]]''. Kawakita made use of ''Gunhed'''s special effects team Studio OX, though designing and building the Biollante props proved problematic, as traditional suitmation techniques made realizing the requested design of the creature's first form difficult, and the resulting cumbersome model for Biollante's final form was met with disbelief from the special effects team. Biollante's first form was performed by Masao Takegami, who sat within the model's trunk area on a platform just above water level. While the creature's head movements were simple to operate, its vines were controlled by an intricate array of overhead wires which proved difficult for Godzilla performer [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] to react to during combat scenes as they offered no tension, thus warranting Satsuma to feign receiving blows from them, despite not being able to perceive them.&lt;ref name="kalat2010"/&gt; Creature designer Shinji Nishikawa originally designed Biollante's head as much more flowerlike, with four petal-like jaws, though the film's producers insisted on a more reptilian head.&lt;ref name="nishikawa"&gt;David Milne, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/nishikaw.htm "Shinji Nishikawa Interview"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Biollante's final form proved even more difficult to operate than the previous model, as its vine network took hours to rig up on set and required 32 wires to operate,&lt;ref name="kalat2010"/&gt; far more than required to operate [[King Ghidorah]] in the following film.&lt;ref name="making of"&gt;"Making of Godzilla vs. Biollante", ''Godzilla vs Biollante'' [DVD] Echo Bridge (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Visibility in the final form Biollante suit was poor, thus causing difficulties for Takegami in aiming the creature's head when firing sap, which permanently stained anything it landed on.&lt;ref name="kalat2010"/&gt;

[[File:Comparison Bioresilience with Biodiversity.jpg|thumb|Comparing the Features of Bioresilience and Biodiversity as Found on a Mountain Slope]]
'''Bioresilience''' refers to the ability of a whole [[species]] or an [[individual]] of a species to adapt to change. Initially the term applied to changes in the [[natural environment]], but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change.&lt;ref name=r0&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi= 10.1126/science.345.6195.392| bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first to note the resilience of [[life forms]] with increasing [[altitude]] and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea |last=Wulf |title=The Invention of Nature |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1171659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by [[The Mountain Institute]] when establishing two of the national parks that surround [[Mount Everest]], [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.B |last=Shrestha |title=Development Ecology of the Arun River Basin in Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research documented greater [[biodiversity]] at Everest’s base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher [[biomes]], from [[subtropical]] to [[temperate]] to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic [[robustness]] correlating directly with increasing bioresilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Taylor-Ide |title=Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest |location=San Francisco |publisher=Mercury House |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current research==
Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the [[Everest]] ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at [[Future Generations University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Impacts on Life from Climate Change|url=https://www.future.edu/biomeridian/|website=Future Generations University|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Yun |first=Joon | title=The Key To Health In Old Age: Bioresilience | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 18, 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/06/18/the-key-to-health-in-old-age-bioresillience/|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes.&lt;ref name=r0/&gt; Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oliver |first=Tom H. |last2= Heard |first2=Mathew S. |first3= Nick J.B. |last3=Isaac |last4= Roy |first4=David B. |first5=Deborah |last5=Procter |first6=Felix |last6=Eigenbrod |first7=Rob |last7=Freckleton |first8=Andy |last8=Hector |first9=C.

Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world’s second largest freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Awiti |first=Alex O. |title=Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria |journal=[[Ecology &amp; Society]] |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobby Black''' (c.1927 – 4 June 2012) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[association football|footballer]] from [[Thornhill, Dumfries and Galloway]] who played for [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]] and [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and was also capped by the Scottish League. Black later was an all England [[bowls]] champion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1033|title=QosFC: Legends - Bobby Black|website=qosfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Fife==

Having played at East Fife during undoubtedly the best period in the club's history Black won a League Cup medal with them in 1949–50. The [[Methil]] side made the [[Scottish Cup]] final that season and finished fourth in Scotland's top division. Two seasons later (Bobby Black's last at the club) they would surpass this league position and finish third – an achievement unsurpassed by the club and equalled only once.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastfife-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadlghs.asp|title=East Fife Scottish Division 1 2017/2018 - Footymad|publisher=Digital Sports Group|website=www.eastfife-mad.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other players at the club in this era included 1938 [[Scottish Cup]] winners with East Fife [[Tommy Adams (footballer)|Tommy Adams]] and [[Willie Laird]] and players who played for Scotland while with the club, [[Allan Brown (footballer)|Allan Brown]], [[Henry Morris (footballer)|Henry Morris]], [[George Aitken (footballer born 1925)|George Aitken]], [[Davie Duncan]], [[Charlie Fleming]] and [[Andy Matthew]]. [[Jimmy Philp]] was another like Black who enjoyed [[Scottish League Cup]] success with the [[Methil]] club.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~corstorphine/capped.htm |title=List of East Fife Players Capped for Scotland |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~corstorphine/famous.html |title=Famous Fifers |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his first year playing for East Fife, the [[1946–47 in Scottish football|1946-47]] season, until his departure in 1952, Black scored 23 goals in 78 league matches.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/eastfife/eastfife.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Queen of the South==

In 1952, Black signed for his local senior club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] in [[Dumfries]]. Black departed the [[Dumfries]] club in 1961 after 346 appearances and 120 goals scored. Black is the third highest all-time goalscorer for the club, behind [[Jim Patterson (footballer)|Jim Patterson]] with 251 goals and current Queens striker [[Stephen Dobbie]] who is currently on 137 goals. 

Under the management of [[Jimmy McKinnell Junior]] at Queens, a large part of Black's career at Queens included a large part of the most successful period in the club's history. Also at Queens at this time were goalkeeper [[Roy Henderson (footballer)|Roy Henderson]], full backs [[Dougie Sharpe]] and [[Jimmy Binning]] and the club's record scorer (251 strikes makes [[Jim Patterson (footballer)|Jim Patterson]] the goals king of Queens). Consistent mid table finishes in the top division in the early and mid 1950s peaked with a sixth-place finish in 1956 – a finish surpassed only once in the club's history. Queen's were subsequently relegated to the Scottish Second Division in 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Bobby Black's displays at outside right were recognised at international level when he was capped for the [[Scottish League XI]] against the [[League of Ireland XI]] in Dublin in 1954 and notched two goals in a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/bobbyblack.html|title=Bobby Black|work=Londonhearts.com|publisher=London Hearts Supporters' Club|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black's son, young Bobby, played for Queen of the South between 1971 and 1973 making 35 appearances and scoring four goals. Bobby's other son Russell was also a footballer, playing for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]].  In his two seasons at Halifax he scored 14 goals in 72 league appearances.

His grandson Jamie Paterson was also a footballer who played for [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] and [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in the senior ranks and with [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] in non-league football.

Black played his entire career wearing the same pair of football boots. Black's preference was to have his boots repaired rather than  replacing them. The boots are now on display in the Doonhamers Museum at [[Palmerston Park]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Later years==

After leaving Queen of the South Black played non-league football for [[Bath City]] and [[Bridgwater Town]] in England.&lt;ref name=20120606scotsman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/sfl-division-one/queens-mourn-passing-of-prolific-scorer-black-1-2339283|title=Queens mourn passing of prolific scorer Black |work=The Scotsman|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years he lived in [[Somerset]] until he died on 4 June 2012 aged 85.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=20120606scotsman/&gt;

Black's great-grandson is the [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]] striker [[Denny Johnstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/platinum-protege-denny-johnstone-has-fine-football-pedigree-1-807016|title=Platinum protege Denny Johnstone has fine football pedigree|work=The Scotsman|date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body donation''', anatomical donation, or body bequest is the donation of a whole body after death for research and education. Donated bodies are mostly used for medical education and research. They are used for gross anatomy, surgical anatomy and for furthering medical education. For years, only [[medical school]]s accepted bodies for donation, but now{{when|date=August 2017}} private programs also accept donors. Depending on the program's need for body donation, some programs accept donors with different specifications.{{clarification needed|date=August 2017}}

Body donation is important for understanding the human body and for making advancements in science. There is usually no cost to donate a body to science; donation programs will often provide a stipend and/or cover the cost of cremation or burial once a donated cadaver has served its purpose and is returned to the family for [[interment]]. 

Any person wishing to donate their body may do so through a willed body program. The donor may be required, but not always, to make prior arrangements with the local medical school, university, or body donation program before death. Individuals may request a consent form, and will be supplied information about policies and procedures that will take place after the potential donor is deceased.

Anatomical donation is still relatively rare, and in attempts to increase these donations, many countries have instituted programs and regulations surrounding the donation of cadavers or body parts.{{cn|date=August 2017}} For example, in some states within the United States and for academic-based programs, a person must make the decision to donate their remains themselves prior to death; the decision cannot be made by a [[power of attorney]].{{cn|date=August 2017}} If a person decides not to donate their whole body, or they are unable to, there are other forms of donation via which one can contribute their body to science after death, such as [[organ donation]] and [[tissue donation]].

== Religion ==
Many religions show support for anatomical donations. The Hindu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://giftalife.org/hindu-dharma-and-organ-donation|title=Gift a Life|last=|first=|date=|website=Gift a Life|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/about-donation/what-does-my-religion-say/buddhism/|title=Buddhism|last=|first=|date=|website=Organ Donation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/about-donation/what-does-my-religion-say/buddhism/|title=Islam|last=|first=|date=|website=Organ Donation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/about-donation/what-does-my-religion-say/christianity/|title=Christianity|last=|first=|date=|website=Organ Donation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; religions all support the idea of body donation and/or organ donation for the betterment of the world. The support of these religions is critical in many parts of the world as many people actively practice these religions.

== India ==
In 1948, the Anatomy Act was passed in all of India’s states. This allows bodies to be donated by the donor and bodies to be claimed for medical and research use if there is no claim to one’s body within a 48-hour timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rokade|first=S|date=February 2013|title=Body Donation Review|url=http://www.bjmcpune.org/journal/Body%20Donation%20Review.pdf|journal=Medical Journal of Western India|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the US, India also has specific guidelines for accepting bodies for donations. Donations that are not deemed suitable include bodies with HIV/AIDS, hepatitis (A, B, and C), donated organs, extreme BMI, or skin diseases.

Some leaders have donated their bodies for medical research, such as communist leader [[Jyoti Basu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/body-donation-buddha-biman-and-many-more-ready-to-follow-suit/569939/ | title=Body donation: Buddha, Biman and many more ready to follow suit | publisher=The Indian Express | date=21 January 2010 | accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jana Sangh leader [[Nanaji Deshmukh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-23/patna/40747822_1_body-donation-pledge-one-body | title=68 BJP leaders pledge to donate their bodies | publisher=Times of India | date=23 July 2013 | accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, many people in India donate their bodies after death by signing a pledge form with two accompanying witness signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-07/allahabad/39814122_1_body-donation-cadaver-donation-mln-medical-college | title=110 to pledge body donation to further medical education | publisher=Times of India | date=7 June 2013 | accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Body donation in the UK is governed by the [[Human Tissue Authority]] (HTA) under the auspices of the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]]. The HTA licenses and inspects establishments, such as medical schools, which teach anatomy using donated bodies. Under the Human Tissue Act, written consent must be given prior to death; consent cannot be given by anyone else after death.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hta.gov.uk/about_hta/faqs/body_donation_faqs.cfm Human Tissue Authority Body Donation FAQs] in the UK&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum age to consent to donate one's body in the UK is 17.

The Human Tissue Authority provides information to donors about where they can donate and answers many prevalent questions related to tissue donation on their website. The Human Tissue Authority provides the links to each establishment’s information, but each establishment has its own guidelines for body donation. The HTA also provides the tools to find donation sites local to the person wishing to donate their body, or tissues.

Although most establishments accept most donations, donors who have had an autopsy may be declined from a program. Certain programs also may decline bodies of donors who have died abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hta.gov.uk/faqs/body-donation-faqs|title=Human Tissue Authority|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Only the legal next-of-kin of the deceased can provide the necessary consent for donation if the donor did not provide it to the specific accepting program prior to death.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Body donation is not regulated through licensure and inspection by the federal government and most states. However, United States House Bill 5318 was introduced on July 31, 2014 under the Energy and Commerce Committee. If passed as written, Health and Human Services would oversee the industry. Any entity (including U.S. Medical Schools) are subject to this legislation if tissue crosses state lines.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

[[Body broker]]s (or non-transplant tissue banks) engage in the acquisition of [[Cadaver|cadavers]], often via offers of free cremation, and then subsequently process the cadaver and resell body parts in a largely unregulated national market.&lt;ref name="ReutersPart1"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-bodies-brokers/ In the U.S. market for human bodies, almost anyone can dissect and sell the dead], Reuters, Brian Grow and John Shiffman, 25 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal right for an individual to choose body donation is governed by the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]], which has been largely adopted by most states. Laws relating to the transportation and disposition of human bodies currently apply, regardless of the recent House Bill introduced.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The [[American Association of Tissue Banks]] (AATB) provides accreditation to non-transplant tissue bank research and education programs to establish that the level of medical, technical, and administrative performance meets or exceeds the standards set by the AATB. Whole body donation and non-transplant tissue banking remains an industry with limited regulation, and while it is not a legal requirement, accreditation allows for individuals choosing to donate their body to medical research or education programs to choose a program with the highest quality standards.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The [http://ameraus.org American Medical Education and Research Association (AMERA)] is a peer-recognized national accrediting body in the United States that provides accreditation to organizations using standards developed solely for non-transplant organizations. This includes whole body donor organizations, university anatomical programs, bio-repository programs, and end users of human tissue. AMERA encourages the industry to become accredited and involved in establishing standards that are relevant to non-clinical tissue organizations.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Many medical programs in the United States now hold student-led memorial services for the donated bodies. This is to show respect for the donors and their families, and  to shine a positive light on the process of body donation.&lt;ref&gt;Riederer, B. M. (2016), Body donations today and tomorrow: What is best practice and why?. Clin. Anat., 29: 11–18. doi: 10.1002/ca.22641&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many private body donation programs in the US. Each of these private programs accepts bodies from certain surrounding areas. Most programs also have guidelines for bodies they will and will not accept. Generally, programs will not accept bodies that are positive for Hepatitis (A, B, and C), HIV/AIDS, history of illegal drug use, or fall within an extreme category for their [[Body mass index|BMI]]. The embalming process adds even more weight to a donor's body, so if they have a high BMI the programs may not take them because they cannot handle the weight of the donor after embalming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/donating-your-body-science-nobody-wants-chubby-corpse-f1C6436539|title=NBC News|last=|first=|date=|work=NBC News|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a donor has a specific disease prior to death, which is not contagious, and would like to be a part of a program’s study they may contact that research program specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medcure.org/donor|title=MEDCURE, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=MEDCURE Whole Body Donation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germany ==
Body disposal and donation are regulated by the ''Bestattungsgesetze'' (funeral laws) of the states. In Germany, the right to autonomy extends beyond death, as a result of which the instructions given by a deceased during their lifetime must be respected when dealing with their body. A body donation can only take place if the deceased signed a declaration of last will in their lifetime, stating the intention of donating their body to an anatomical institute. Relatives of the deceased can neither give permission nor deny body donation against said declaration, the institute however may deny the body. Denial of the body may occur if it carries infectious diseases, has had organs or body parts removed for donation or surgery, is gravely injured or otherwise unfit for teaching, if the body is located too far away from the institute or for reasons of storage capacity.  Most institutes require an advance fee to be deposited to pay for funeral costs. &lt;ref&gt;Marburg University [https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb20/anatomie/prosek/faq ''Häufig gestellte Fragen zur Körperspende''] ''(FAQ on body donation)'' (German), retrieved 6 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motives behind the decision ==
The decision to become a body donor is influenced by factors such as: social awareness, cultural attitudes and perceptions of body donation, cultural attitudes and perceptions of death, religion, and perceptions of the body-mind relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Savulescu, J. (2003). Death, Us and Our Bodies: Personal Reflections. Journal of Medical Ethics, 29(3), 127-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate most donors are primarily driven by [[altruism]] and their desire to aid the advancement of medical knowledge and to be useful after death.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, S., Venbrux, E., Eisinga, R., Kuks, J. B. M., Veening, J. G., Gerrits, P. O. (2010). Motivation for body donation to science: More than an altruistic act. Annals of Anatomy, 192(2), 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons include helping future generations, expressing gratitude for life and good health or for the medical field, to avoid a funeral or to avoid waste.&lt;ref&gt;Bolt, S., Venbrux, E., Eisinga, R., Kuks, J. B. M., Veening, J. G., Gerrits, P. O. (2010). Motivation for body donation to science: More than an altruistic act. Annals of Anatomy, 192(2), 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The offering of financial incentives as a way to increase donor numbers or as an acknowledgement for donors is generally considered to detract from the act of donation and serve as a deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;Ajita, R. &amp; Singh, I. (2007). Body Donation and Its Relevance in Anatomy Learning – A Review. Journal of the Anatomical Society of India, 56(1), 44-47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a US study showing a positive correlation between body donation numbers and funeral cover cost savings offered as compensation suggests that, in reality, the added incentive could be a persuasive factor for donors.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, D. E. &amp; Sayre, E. A. (2007). Paying for Bodies, But Not for Organs. Regulation, 29(4), 14-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of donors ==
Bodies donated to any organization are used for scientific research and medical training. Bodies are used to teach medical students anatomy, but they are also used to improve and create new medical technologies. Many programs that accept body donations have specific research affiliations, these can be viewed by looking at each programs website. These can include cancer research, Alzheimer’s research, and research into improving surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifelegacy.org/body-donation-helps/|title=Life Legacy|last=|first=|date=|website=Life Legacy|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130170553/http://www.lifelegacy.org/body-donation-helps/#|archive-date=2016-11-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed below are examples of research conducted with donated bodies:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://medcure.org/donor|title=MEDCURE, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=MEDCURE Whole Body Donation|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cancer
* Cardiovascular Diseases 
* Diabetes
* Hip Replacement
* Knee Replacement 
* Neurological Conditions
* Paramedic Training 
* Shoulder Replacement
* Spinal Disorders
* Tumor Removal

Some programs accept whole bodies but distribute different body parts based on need. This ensures a maximum benefit from each donation. These programs can assist with research as shown above, technical training, or improvement/research of medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biogift.org/donate-body-to-science.php|title=donate-body-to-science|last=|first=|date=|website=BioGift|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After bodies are accepted for donation, a timeframe of six months to three years is expected before the donor's body will be returned to the family. This takes into account embalming, research, and the number of bodies the program has access to at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/bodydonation/faq.cfm|website=OHSU |title=Body Donation FAQ|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each undirected edge represents dependency. In this example there are 3 hidden units and 4 visible units. This is not a restricted Boltzmann machine.]]
A '''[[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] machine''' (also called '''stochastic Hopfield network with hidden units''') is a type of [[stochastic neural network|stochastic]] [[recurrent neural network]] (and [[Markov random field]]{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}). 

Boltzmann machines can be seen as the [[stochastic process|stochastic]], [[generative model|generative]] counterpart of [[Hopfield net]]s. They were one of the first neural networks capable of learning internal representations, and are able to represent and (given sufficient time) solve difficult combinatoric problems. 

They are theoretically intriguing because of the locality and [[Hebbian]] nature of their training algorithm, and because of their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference, but if the connectivity is properly constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-0643-3_76|title=International Neural Network Conference|first=Thomas R.|last=Osborn|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=785–785|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-0643-3_76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are named after the [[Boltzmann distribution]] in statistical mechanics, which is used in their sampling function. That's why they are called as Energy Based Models(EBM). They were invented in 1985 by [[Geoffrey Hinton]], then a Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and [[Terry Sejnowski]], then a Professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines|number=1|year=1985|author1=Ackley, David H|author2=Hinton Geoffrey E|author3=Sejnowski, Terrence J|journal=Cognitive science|volume=9|pages=147–169|publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Boltzmannexamplev2.png|thumb|right|alt=A graphical representation of an example Boltzmann machine with weight labels.| A graphical representation of a Boltzmann machine with a few weights labeled. Each undirected edge represents dependency and is weighted with weight &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. In this example there are 3 hidden units (blue) and 4 visible units (white). This is not a restricted Boltzmann machine.]]

A Boltzmann machine, like a [[Hopfield net]]work, is a network of units with an "energy" defined for the overall network. Its units produce [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] results. Unlike Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machine units are [[stochastic]]. The global energy, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, in a Boltzmann machine is identical in form to that of a Hopfield network:

:&lt;math&gt;E = -\left(\sum_{i&lt;j} w_{ij} \, s_i \, s_j + \sum_i \theta_i \, s_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the connection strength between unit &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; is the state, &lt;math&gt;s_i \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, of unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the bias of unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the global energy function. (&lt;math&gt;-\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is the activation threshold for the unit.)

Often the weights, &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, are represented as a symmetric matrix &lt;math&gt;W=[w_{ij}]&lt;/math&gt;, with zeros along the diagonal.

==  Unit state probability ==

The difference in the global energy that results from a single unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; equaling 0 (off) versus 1 (on), written &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i&lt;/math&gt;, assuming a symmetric matrix of weights, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i = \sum_{j&gt;i} w_{ij} \, s_j + \sum_{j&lt;i} w_{ji} \, s_j + \theta_i&lt;/math&gt;

This can be expressed as the difference of energies of two states:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i = E_\text{i=off} - E_\text{i=on}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the energy of each state with its relative probability according to the [[Boltzmann factor]] (the property of a [[Boltzmann distribution]] that the energy of a state is proportional to the negative log probability of that state) gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_i = -k_B\,T\ln(p_\text{i=off}) - (-k_B\,T\ln(p_\text{i=on}))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is Boltzmann's constant and is absorbed into the artificial notion of temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. We then rearrange terms and consider that the probabilities of the unit being on and off must sum to one:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E_i}{T} = \ln(p_\text{i=on}) - \ln(p_\text{i=off})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E_i}{T} = \ln(p_\text{i=on}) - \ln(1 - p_\text{i=on})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E_i}{T} = \ln\left(\frac{p_\text{i=on}}{1 - p_\text{i=on}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\Delta E_i}{T} = \ln\left(\frac{1 - p_\text{i=on}}{p_\text{i=on}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\Delta E_i}{T} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{p_\text{i=on}} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E_i}{T}\right) = \frac{1}{p_\text{i=on}} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;p_\text{i=on}&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th unit is on gives:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\text{i=on} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-\frac{\Delta E_i}{T})}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the [[temperature]] of the system. This relation is the source of the [[logistic function]] found in probability expressions in variants of the Boltzmann machine.

== Equilibrium state ==

The network runs by repeatedly choosing a unit and resetting its state. After running for long enough at a certain temperature, the probability of a global state of the network depends only upon that global state's energy, according to a [[Boltzmann distribution]], and not on the initial state from which the process was started. This means that log-probabilities of global states become linear in their energies. This relationship is true when the machine is "at [[thermal equilibrium]]", meaning that the probability distribution of global states has converged. Running the network beginning from a high temperature, its temperature gradually decreases until reaching a [[thermal equilibrium]] at a lower temperature. It then may converge to a distribution where the energy level fluctuates around the global minimum. This process is called [[simulated annealing]].

To train the network so that the chance it will converge to a global state is according to an external distribution over these states, the weights must be set so that the global states with the highest probabilities get the lowest energies. This is done by training.

==Training==

The units in the Boltzmann machine are divided into 'visible' units, V, and 'hidden' units, H. The visible units are those that receive information from the 'environment', i.e. the training set is a set of binary vectors over the set V. The distribution over the training set is denoted &lt;math&gt;P^{+}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.  
  
As is discussed above, the distribution over global states converges as the Boltzmann machine reaches [[thermal equilibrium]]. We denote this distribution, after we [[Marginal distribution|marginalize]] it over the hidden units, as &lt;math&gt;P^{-}(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

Our goal is to approximate the "real" distribution &lt;math&gt;P^{+}(V)&lt;/math&gt; using the &lt;math&gt;P^{-}(V)&lt;/math&gt; produced (eventually) by the machine. To measure how similar the two distributions are, the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]], &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;G = \sum_{v}{P^{+}(v)\ln\left({\frac{P^{+}(v)}{P^{-}(v)}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over all the possible states of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the weights, since they determine the energy of a state, and the energy determines &lt;math&gt;P^{-}(v)&lt;/math&gt;, as promised by the [[Boltzmann distribution]]. Hence, we can use a [[gradient descent]] algorithm over &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, so a given weight, &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is changed by subtracting the [[partial derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the weight.

There are two alternating phases to Boltzmann machine training. One is the "positive" phase where the visible units' states are clamped to a particular binary state vector sampled from the training set (according to &lt;math&gt;P^{+}&lt;/math&gt;). The other is the "negative" phase where the network is allowed to run freely, i.e. no units have their state determined by external data. Surprisingly enough, the gradient with respect to a given weight, &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by the simple proven equation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackley|first=David H.|author2=Hinton, Geoffrey E. |author3=Sejnowski, Terrence J. |title=A Learning Algorithm for Boltzmann Machines|journal=[[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]]|year=1985|volume=9|issue=1|pages=147–169|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0901_7|url=http://learning.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/cogscibm.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718022336/http://learning.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/cogscibm.pdf|archivedate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{G}}{\partial{w_{ij}}} = -\frac{1}{R}[p_{ij}^{+}-p_{ij}^{-}]&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that units ''i'' and ''j'' are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the positive phase.
* &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}^{-}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that units ''i'' and ''j'' are both on when the machine is at equilibrium on the negative phase.
* &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denotes the learning rate

This result follows from the fact that at [[thermal equilibrium]] the probability &lt;math&gt;P^{-}(s)&lt;/math&gt; of any global state &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; when the network is free-running is given by the [[Boltzmann distribution]] (hence the name "Boltzmann machine").

Remarkably, this learning rule is fairly biologically plausible because the only information needed to change the weights is provided by "local" information. That is, the connection (or [[synapse]] biologically speaking) does not need information about anything other than the two neurons it connects. This is far more biologically realistic than the information needed by a connection in many other neural network training algorithms, such as [[backpropagation]].

The training of a Boltzmann machine does not use the [[EM algorithm]], which is heavily used in [[machine learning]]. 
By minimizing the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|KL-divergence]], it is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Therefore, the training procedure performs gradient ascent on the log-likelihood of the observed data. This is in contrast to the EM algorithm, where the posterior distribution of the hidden nodes must be calculated before the maximization of the expected value of the complete data likelihood during the M-step.

Training the biases is similar, but uses only single node activity:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{G}}{\partial{\theta_{i}}} = -\frac{1}{R}[p_{i}^{+}-p_{i}^{-}]&lt;/math&gt;

==Problems==

The Boltzmann machine would theoretically be a rather general computational medium. For instance, if trained on photographs, the machine would theoretically model the distribution of photographs, and could use that model to, for example, complete a partial photograph.

Unfortunately, there is a serious practical problem with the Boltzmann machine, namely that it seems to stop learning correctly when the machine is scaled up to anything larger than a trivial machine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} This is due to a number of effects, the most important of which are:

* the time the machine must be run in order to collect equilibrium statistics grows exponentially with the machine's size, and with the magnitude of the connection strengths{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* connection strengths are more plastic when the units being connected have activation probabilities intermediate between zero and one, leading to a so-called [[variance trap]]. The net effect is that noise causes the connection strengths to follow a [[random walk]] until the activities saturate.

==Restricted Boltzmann machine==
[[File:Restricted Boltzmann machine.svg|thumb|right|alt=Graphical representation of an example restricted Boltzmann machine |Graphical representation of a restricted Boltzmann machine. The four blue units represent hidden units, and the three red units represent visible states. In restricted Boltzmann machines there are only connections (dependencies) between hidden and visible units, and none between units of the same type (no hidden-hidden, nor visible-visible connections).]]
{{main article|Restricted Boltzmann machine}}
Although learning is impractical in general Boltzmann machines, it can be made quite efficient in 
an architecture called the "restricted Boltzmann machine" or "RBM" which does not allow intralayer connections between hidden units. After training one RBM, the activities of its hidden units can be treated as data for training a higher-level RBM. This method of stacking RBMs makes it possible to train many layers of hidden units efficiently and is one of the most common [[deep learning]] strategies. As each new layer is added the overall generative model gets better.

There is an extension to the restricted Boltzmann machine that affords using real valued data rather than binary data. Along with higher order Boltzmann machines, it is outlined here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdIURAu1-aU].

One example of a practical application of Restricted Boltzmann machines is the performance improvement of speech recognition software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/144412/DBN4LVCSR-TransASLP.pdf |title=Context-Dependent Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deep Boltzmann machine ==
A deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) is a type of binary pairwise [[Markov random field]] ([[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected]] probabilistic [[graphical model]]) with multiple layers of [[Latent variable|hidden]] [[random variables]]. It is a network of symmetrically coupled stochastic [[Binary variable|binary units]]. It comprises a set of visible units &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nu} \in \{0,1\}^D&lt;/math&gt; and layers of hidden units &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{h}^{(1)} \in \{0,1\}^{F_1}, \boldsymbol{h}^{(2)} \in \{0,1\}^{F_2}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{h}^{(L)} \in \{0,1\}^{F_L}&lt;/math&gt;. No connection links units of the same layer (like [[Restricted Boltzmann machine|RBM]]). For the {{H:title|Deep Boltzmann machine|DBM}}, the probability assigned to vector {{mvar|'''&amp;nu;'''}} is
: &lt;math&gt;p(\boldsymbol{\nu}) = \frac{1}{Z}\sum_h e^{\sum_{ij}W_{ij}^{(1)}\nu_i h_j^{(1)} + \sum_{jl}W_{jl}^{(2)}h_j^{(1)}h_l^{(2)}+\sum_{lm}W_{lm}^{(3)}h_l^{(2)}h_m^{(3)}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{h} = \{\boldsymbol{h}^{(1)}, \boldsymbol{h}^{(2)}, \boldsymbol{h}^{(3)} \}&lt;/math&gt; are the set of hidden units, and &lt;math&gt;\theta = \{\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)}, \boldsymbol{W}^{(2)}, \boldsymbol{W}^{(3)} \} &lt;/math&gt; are the model parameters, representing visible-hidden and hidden-hidden interactions.&lt;ref name="ref12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinton|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|date=2012|title=A better way to pretrain deep Boltzmann machines|url=http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/NIPS2012_1178.pdf|journal=Advances in Neural|volume=3|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a DBN only the top two layers form a restricted Boltzmann machine (which is an undirected [[graphical model]]), while lower layers form a directed generative model. In a DBM all layers are symmetric and undirected.

Like [[Deep belief network|DBNs]], DBMs can learn complex and abstract internal representations of the input in tasks such as [[Object recognition|object]] or [[speech recognition]], using limited, labeled data to fine-tune the representations built using a large supply of unlabeled sensory input data. However, unlike DBNs and deep convolutional neural networks, they adopt the [[Inference (neural network)|inference]] and training procedure in both directions, bottom-up and top-down pass, which allow the Deep Boltzmann machine to better unveil the representations of the input structures.&lt;ref name="ref32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinton|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|date=2009|title=Efficient Learning of Deep Boltzmann Machines|url=http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/AISTATS09_SalakhutdinovH.pdf|volume=3|pages=448–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref42"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bengio|first1=Yoshua|last2=LeCun|first2=Yann|date=2007|title=Scaling Learning Algorithms towards AI|url=http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/bib/pub_subject/language/pointeurs/bengio+lecun-chapter2007.pdf|volume=1|pages=1–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref22"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larochelle|first1=Hugo|last2=Salakhutdinov|first2=Ruslan|date=2010|title=Efficient Learning of Deep Boltzmann Machines|url=http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/AISTATS2010_SalakhutdinovL10.pdf|pages=693–700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the slow speed of DBMs limits their performance and functionality. Because exact maximum likelihood learning is intractable for DBMs, only approximate maximum likelihood learning is possible. Another option is to use mean-field inference to estimate data-dependent expectations and approximate the expected sufficient statistics by using ''[[Markov chain Monte Carlo]]'' ''(MCMC)''.&lt;ref name="ref12" /&gt; This approximate inference, which must be done for each test input, is about 25 to 50 times slower than a single bottom-up pass in DBMs. This makes joint optimization impractical for large data sets, and restricts the use of DBMs for tasks such as feature representation.

== History ==
The Boltzmann machine is a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] version of the [[Hopfield net]]work.

The idea of using stochastic weights in [[Ising model]]s considered by:
* David Sherrington and Scott Kirkpatrick, Solvable Model of a Spin-Glass, Phys. Rev. Lett. 35, 1792 (1975)

However, in cognitive sciences, it is often thought to have been first described by:
* Geoffrey E. Hinton and Terrence J. Sejnowski, Analyzing Cooperative Computation. In Proceedings of the 5th Annual Congress of the Cognitive Science Society, Rochester, New York, May 1983.
* Geoffrey E. Hinton and Terrence J. Sejnowski, Optimal Perceptual Inference. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 448–453, IEEE Computer Society, Washington, D.C., June 1983.

However, it should be noted that these articles appeared after the seminal publication by John Hopfield, where the connection to physics and statistical mechanics was made in the first place, mentioning spin glasses:

* John J. Hopfield, Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 79 no. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;2554–2558, April 1982.

The idea of applying the Ising model with annealed [[Gibbs sampling]] is also present in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] project:

* Hofstadter, Douglas R., The Copycat Project: An Experiment in Nondeterminism and Creative Analogies. MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Memo No. 755, January 1984.
* Hofstadter, Douglas R., A Non-Deterministic Approach to Analogy, Involving the Ising Model of Ferromagnetism. In E. Caianiello, ed. The Physics of Cognitive Processes. Teaneck, New Jersey: World Scientific, 1987.

Similar ideas (with a change of sign in the energy function) are also found in [[Paul Smolensky]]'s "Harmony Theory".

The explicit analogy drawn with statistical mechanics in the Boltzmann Machine formulation led to the use of terminology borrowed from physics (e.g., "energy" rather than "harmony"), which has become standard in the field. The widespread adoption of this terminology may have been encouraged by the fact that its use led to the importation of a variety of concepts and methods from statistical mechanics.
However, there is no reason to think that the various proposals to use simulated annealing for inference described above were not independent.
([[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] made a similar analogy during the dawn of psychophysics.)

Ising models are now considered to be a special case of [[Markov random field]]s, which find widespread application in various fields, including [[linguistics]], [[robotics]], [[computer vision]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3248">'''Cadena temporal''' and '''cadena perpetua''' were legal punishments. Cadena temporal included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance. Cadena perpetua is identical except that it is a sentence of life as opposed to a temporary status.

The "title" of the punishment is actually descriptive, as ''cadena'' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning chain&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=cadena&lt;/ref&gt; while temporal means impermanent or temporary, in addition to the meaning it shares with English&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/AS.cfm?e=temporal&lt;/ref&gt; and ''perpetua'', means continuous in [[latin (language)|Latin]] and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/cgi-bin/aglimpse-latin/16/www/Lexis/Latin?query=perpetua&amp;case=on&amp;whole=on&amp;errors=0&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}

One of the places these punishments were provided for was the [[Philippine]] legal system. This was a result of the Spanish Penal Code of 1870, which was adopted due to the country having been a Spanish colony until 1898. Cadena temporal was among the penalties repealed in 1932 with the enactment of the [[Revised Penal Code of the Philippines]].

The use of this colonial punishment has been reviewed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Weems v. United States]]'', 217 U.S. 349 (1910).&lt;ref&gt;http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=217&amp;invol=349&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the Spanish penal Code, the punishment of "cadena temporal" was from twelve years and one day to twenty years (arts. 28 and 96), which 'shall be served' in certain '[[Prison|penal institutions]].' And it was provided that 'those sentenced to cadena temporal (and cadena perpetua) shall labor for the benefit of the state. They shall always carry a chain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists; they shall be employed at hard and painful labor, and shall receive no assistance whatsoever from without the institution.'  There were, besides, certain accessory penalties imposed with it.

In Weems, the Supreme Court ruled this punishment to be "[[cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]]" for a crime of "corruptly, and with intent then and there to deceive and defraud the United States government of the Philippine Islands and its officials, falsify[ing] a public and official document." ''Weems v. United'' States breaks away with the "[[Originalism|historic method]]" of interpretation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibiting such penalties. It thus paves the way to a modern interpretation of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] based on a new criterion: the "[[Living Constitution|evolving standards of decency of a maturing society]]" designed by the Supreme Court in [[Trop v. Dulles]], 356 U. S. 86 (1957) {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14846">'''Common coding theory''' is a [[cognitive psychology]] theory describing how perceptual representations (e.g. of things we can see and hear) and motor representations (e.g. of hand actions) are linked.  The theory claims that there is a shared representation (a common code) for both perception and action.  More important, seeing an event activates the action associated with that event, and performing an action activates the associated perceptual event.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, W. (1984). Modes of linkage between perception and action. In W. Prinz &amp; A.-F. Sanders (Eds.), Cognition and motor processes (pp. 185-193). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of direct perception-action links originates in the work of the American psychologist [[William James]] and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner [[Roger Sperry]].  Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R.W. | year = 1952 | title = Neurology and the mind-body problem | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 291–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: [[perception]] is a means to action and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is a means to perception.  Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.

==Background==
The classical approach to cognition is a 'sandwich' model which assumes three stages of information processing: [[perception]], [[cognition]] and then [[Action (philosophy)|action]].  In this model, perception and action do not interact directly, instead cognitive processing is needed to convert perceptual representations into action.  For example, this might require creating arbitrary linkages (mapping between sensory and motor codes).&lt;ref&gt;Massaro, D. W. (1990). An information-processing analysis of perception and action. In O. Neumann &amp; W. Prinz (Eds.), Relationships between perception and action: Current approaches (pp. 133-166). Berlin: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the common coding account claims that perception and action are directly linked by a common computational code.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, W. (2005). Experimental approaches to action. In J. Roessler and N. Eilan (Eds.), Agency and self-awareness (pp. 165-187). New-York, Oxford University press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory, put forward by German scientist [[Wolfgang Prinz]] and his colleagues from the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences]], claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W | year = 1997 | title = Perception and action planning | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1080/713752551}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory also states that [[perception]] of an [[Action (philosophy)|action]] should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knoblich | first1 = G. | last2 = Flach | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 467–472 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a claim suggests that we represent observed, executed and imagined actions in a commensurate manner and makes specific predictions regarding the nature of action and perceptual representations.  First, representations for observed and executed actions should rely on a shared neural substrate.  Second, a common cognitive system predicts facilitation of action based on directly prior perception and vice versa. Third, such a system predicts interference effects when action and perception attempt to access shared representations simultaneously.

==Evidence for common coding==
In the past decade, a growing number of results have been interpreted in favor of the common coding theory.

For instance, one functional MRI study demonstrated that the brain's response to the 2/3 power law of motion (i.e., which dictates a strong coupling between movement curvature and velocity) is much stronger and more widespread than to other types of motion. Compliance with this law was reflected in the activation of a large network of brain areas subserving motor production, visual motion processing, and action observation functions. These results support the common coding and the notion of similar neural coding for motion perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eran Dayan | first1 = E. | last2 = Casile | first2 = A. | last3 = Levit-Binnun | first3 = N. | last4 = Giese | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Hendler | first5 = T. | last6 = Flash | first6 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Neural representations of kinematic laws of motion: Evidence for action-perception coupling | journal = PNAS | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 20582–20587 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0710033104 | pmid=18079289 | pmc=2154474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most direct evidence for common coding in the brain now stems from the fact that pattern classifiers that can differentiate based on brain activity whether someone has performed action A or B can also classify, above chance, whether that person heard the sound of action A or B, thereby demonstrating that action execution and perception are represented using a common code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0003690| title = Testing Simulation Theory with Cross-Modal Multivariate Classification of fMRI Data| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 3| issue = 11| pages = e3690| year = 2008| last1 = Etzel | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gazzola | first2 = V. | last3 = Keysers | first3 = C. | pmid=18997869 | pmc=2577733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further support originates in EEG studies investigating the physiological substrate of perception and action in cognitive tasks. Segregating cortical activity by an [[independent component analysis]] (ICA) consistently reveals component relating to the processing of sensory stimuli and simultaneously to generating appropriate motor responses. This provides evidence for a common code involved in the whole perception-action loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-04757-8| title = EEG correlates of sensorimotor processing: independent components involved in sensory and motor processing| journal = Sci Rep| volume = 7| pages = 4461| year = 2017| last1 = Melnik | first1 = A | last2 = Hairston | first2 = WD | last3 = Ferris | first3 = DP | last4 = König | first4 = P | pmid=28667328 | pmc=5493645}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recently, the common coding theory received increased interest from researchers in developmental psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sommerville | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Decety | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Weaving the fabric of social interaction: Articulating developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience in the domain of motor cognition | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 179–200 | doi=10.3758/bf03193831 | pmid=16892982}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive neuroscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = P.L. | last2 = Decety | first2 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Motor cognition: A new paradigm to investigate social interactions | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2004.01.020 | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; robotics,&lt;ref&gt;Proctor and Vu (2006). Stimulus-response compatibility: Data, theory and application. Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; and social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Bargh | first2 = J.A. | year = 2001 | title = The perception-behavior expressway: automatic effects of social perception on social behavior | url = | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commensurate representation==
Common coding posits, on top of separate coding, further domains of representation in which afferent and efferent information share the same format and dimensionality of representation. Common coding refers to 'late' afferent representations (referring to events in the environment) and 'early' efferent representations (referring to intended events). Such representations are commensurate since they both exhibit distal reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W | year = 1992 | title = Why don't we perceive our brain states? | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/09541449208406240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hommel | first1 = B. | last2 = Müsseler | first2 = J. | last3 = Aschersleben | first3 = G. | last4 = Prinz | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The theory of event coding (TEC): A framework for perception and action planning | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 849–878 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000103 | pmid=12239891}}&lt;/ref&gt; They permit creating linkages between perception and action that do not rely on arbitrary mappings. Common coding conceives action planning in terms of operations that determine intended future events from given current events (matching between event codes and action codes). In particular perception and action may modulate each other by virtue of similarity. Unlike rule-based mapping of incommensurate codes which requires preceding acquisition of mapping rules, similarity-based matching of commensurate codes requires no such preceding rule acquisition.

==Ideomotor principle==
In line with the ideomotor theory of [[William James]] (1890) and [[Hermann Lotze]] (1852), the  common coding theory posits that actions are represented in terms of their perceptual consequences. Actions are represented like any other events, the sole distinctive feature being that they are (or can be) generated through bodily movements. Perceivable action consequences may vary on two major dimensions: resident vs. remote effects, and 'cool' versus 'hot' outcomes (i.e., reward values associated with action outcomes).&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, A., &amp; Balleine, B. W. (2002). The role of learning in the operation of motivational systems. In H. Pashler &amp; R. Gallistel (Eds.), Stevens' handbook of experimental psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 497-533). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals perform actions they learn what their movements lead to (Ideomotor learning). The ideomotor theory claims that these associations can also be used in the reverse order (cf. William James, 1890 II, p.&amp;nbsp;526): When individuals perceive events of which they know (from previous learning) that they may result from certain movements, perception of these events may evoke the movements leading to them (Ideomotor control). The distinction between learning and control is equivalent to the distinction between forward and inverse computation in motor learning and control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wolpert|Wolpert, D.]], &amp; [[Zoubin Ghahramani|Ghahramani, Z.]] (2004). Computational motor control. In M. S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), The cognitive neurosciences (3 ed., pp. 485-494). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideomotor learning supports prediction and anticipation of action outcomes, given current action. Ideomotor control supports selection and control of action, given intended outcomes.

==Related approaches==
While most traditional approaches tend to stress the relative independence of perception and action, some theories have argued for closer links. [[Motor theory of speech perception|Motor theories of speech]] and action perception have made a case for motor contributions to perception.&lt;ref&gt;Viviani, P. (2002). Motor competence in the perception of dynamic events: A tutorial. In W. Prinz &amp; B. Hommel (Eds.), Common mechanisms in perception and action: Attention and  Performance (Vol. XIX, pp. 406-442). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liberman | first1 = A. M. | year = 1982 | title = On finding that speech is special | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 148–167 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close non-representational connections between perception and action have also been claimed by ecological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, C. A., &amp; Turvey, M. T. (1982). Observational perspective and descriptive level in perceiving and acting. In W. B. Weimer &amp; D. S. Palermo (Eds.), Cognition and the symbolic processes (Vol. 2, pp. 1-19). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. J. (1979). The ecological approach to visual perception. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;
Today common coding theory is closely related to research and theory in two intersecting fields of study: [[Mirror neurons]] systems and embodied cognition. As concerns mirror systems, common coding seems to reflect the functional logic of mirror neurons and mechanisms in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Craighero | first2 = L. | year = 2004 | title = The mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 169–192 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid=15217330}}&lt;/ref&gt; As concerns embodied cognition, common coding is compatible with the claim that meaning is embodied, i.e. grounded in perception and action.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, A. (2004) Action in Perception. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barsalou | first1 = L. W. | year = 2008 | title = Grounded cognition | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 617–645 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2595">In [[mathematics]], '''computational group theory''' is the study of
[[group (mathematics)|group]]s by means of computers. It is concerned
with designing and analysing [[algorithm]]s and
[[data structure]]s to compute information about groups. The subject
has attracted interest because for many interesting groups
(including most of the [[sporadic groups]]) it is impractical
to perform calculations by hand.

Important algorithms in computational group theory include:
* the [[Schreier–Sims algorithm]] for finding the order of a [[permutation group]]
* the [[Todd–Coxeter algorithm]] and [[Knuth–Bendix algorithm]] for [[coset enumeration]]
* the [[product-replacement algorithm]] for finding random elements of a group

Two important [[computer algebra system]]s (CAS) used for group theory are
[[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]] and [[Magma computer algebra system|Magma]]. Historically, other systems such as CAS (for [[character theory]]) and [[Cayley computer algebra system|Cayley]] (a predecessor of Magma) were important.

Some achievements of the field include:
* complete enumeration of [[List of small groups|all finite groups of order less than 2000]]
* computation of representations for all the [[sporadic groups]]

READ THIS FIRST:
The use of event vs "alleged event" has been discussed many times on the talk page of this article and on the [[Good Friday]] page, and the result was not to use it.
This article includes WP:RS references that state that the general scholarly consensus (per WP:RS/AC) is that the crucifixion was, in fact, a historical event, and hence per WP:LEAD the introduction of the article should not say "supposedly occurred", "was alleged to have occurred", "is a Biblical story", etc. and should say "occurred" based on many talk page discussions.
Do not change it to any of those, or a variant of them.

ALSO:
The theology concerning the event is discussed later in the article. The introductory sentence introduces the event, not the theology.

He was then hung between two convicted thieves and, according to the [[Gospel of Mark]], died some six hours later. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating "[[Jesus, King of the Jews|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]" which, according to the [[Gospel of John]], was written in three languages. They then divided his garments among themselves and cast lots for his seamless robe, according to the Gospel of John. According to the Gospel of John after Jesus' death, one soldier pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died, then [[O Blood and Water|blood and water]] gushed. The Bible describes [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven statements]] that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several [[supernatural]] events that occurred.

Collectively referred to as the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]], Jesus' suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion are the central aspects of [[Christian theology]] concerning the doctrines of [[Christian soteriology|salvation]] and [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

Blomberg 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}} pages&amp;nbsp;211–214&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher M. Tuckett]] states that, although the exact reasons for the death of Jesus are hard to determine, one of the indisputable facts about him is that he was crucified.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N. A. Bockmuehl 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-79678-4}} page 136&lt;/ref&gt;

While scholars agree on the historicity of the crucifixion, they differ on the reason and context for it. For example, both [[E. P. Sanders]] and [[Paula Fredriksen]] support the historicity of the crucifixion but contend that Jesus did not foretell his own crucifixion and that [[Jesus predicts his death|his prediction of the crucifixion]] is a "church creation" (p.&amp;nbsp;126).&lt;ref name=Ernest125/&gt;  [[Geza Vermes]] also views the crucifixion as a historical event but provides his own explanation and background for it.&lt;ref name=Ernest125&gt;''A Century of Theological and Religious Studies in Britain, 1902–2007'' by [[Ernest Nicholson]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-726305-4}} pages&amp;nbsp;125–126 [https://books.google.com/books?id=E-UkAAAAYAAJ Link 126]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John P. Meier]] views the crucifixion of Jesus as historical fact and states that, based on the [[criterion of embarrassment]], Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.&lt;ref name=JMeier126&gt;John P. Meier "How do we decide what comes from Jesus" in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 {{ISBN|1-57506-100-7}} pages&amp;nbsp;126–128&lt;/ref&gt; Meier states that a number of other criteria, e.g., the criterion of [[multiple attestation]] (i.e., confirmation by more than one source) and the criterion of coherence (i.e., that it fits with other historical elements) help establish the crucifixion of Jesus as a historical event.&lt;ref name=JMeier132&gt;John P. Meier "How do we decide what comes from Jesus" in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 {{ISBN|1-57506-100-7}} pages&amp;nbsp;132–136&lt;/ref&gt;

Although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary, the 1968 archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem of the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels.&lt;ref&gt;David Freedman, 2000, ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2400-4}}, page 299.&lt;/ref&gt; The crucified man was identified as [[Yehohanan ben Hagkol]] and probably died about 70 AD, around the time of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] against Rome. The analyses at the [[Hadassah Medical School]] estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and displayed in the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/arch-nt.html|title=Archaeology and the New Testament|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/crucifixion.htm Article on the Crucifixion of Jesus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament narrative==
{{See also|Gospel harmony}}
The earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s. There are other, more implicit references in the New Testament epistles. In the [[Synoptic Gospel|synoptic]] gospels, [[Jesus predicts his death]] in three separate places.&lt;ref&gt;''St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith'' by Michael Keene 2002 {{ISBN|0-7487-6775-4}} pages&amp;nbsp;24–25&lt;/ref&gt; All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of [[Arrest of Jesus|Jesus' arrest]], [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|initial trial at the Sandhedrin]] and final trial at [[Pilate's court]], where Jesus is flogged, condemned to death, is led to the place of crucifixion initially [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]] before Roman soldiers induce Simon of Cyrene to carry it, and then Jesus is crucified, [[Entombment of Christ|entombed]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] from the dead. His death is described as a [[sacrifice]] in the Gospels and other books of the New Testament.&lt;ref name ="David Hawkin"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawkin | first =  David J.| title = The twenty-first century confronts its gods: globalization, technology, and war | publisher =SUNY Press | year = 2004 | page =&amp;nbsp;121}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;Powell, Mark A. ''Introducing the New Testament''. Baker Academic, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8010-2868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.91}}

After arriving at [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus was offered wine mixed with [[myrrh]] or [[Citrullus colocynthis|gall]] to drink. Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations of the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reza Aslan]], ''Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth'', Random House, 2014. {{ISBN|0812981480}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark's Gospel, he endured the torment of crucifixion for some six hours from the third hour, at approximately 9 am,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|15:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|15:34-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" which, according to the Gospel of John, was in [[INRI|three languages]], and then divided his garments and casted lots for his seamless robe. According to the Gospel of John, the Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the two crucified thieves (breaking the legs hastened the onset of death), as Jesus was dead already. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven statements]] altogether.&lt;ref name = "JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-06-117393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Synoptic Gospels]], various [[#Reported extraordinary occurrences|supernatural events]] accompany the crucifixion, including [[Crucifixion darkness and eclipse|darkness]], an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. Following Jesus' death, his body was removed from the [[cross]] by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and buried in a [[Sepulchre|rock-hewn tomb]], with [[Nicodemus]] assisting.

According to all four gospels, Jesus was brought to the "[[Calvary|Place of a Skull]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:33}} - "place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull)"; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:22}} (same as Matthew); {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:32-33}} - "place that is called The Skull"; {{Bibleref2|John|19:17}} - "place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha"&lt;/ref&gt; and crucified with two thieves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:38}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:27-28}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:33}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the charge of claiming to be "[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:37}} - "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:26}} - "The King of the Jews."; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:38}} - "This is the King of the Jews." Some manuscripts add ''in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew''; {{Bibleref2|John|19:19-22}} - "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." "...&amp;nbsp;it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek."&lt;/ref&gt; and the soldiers divided [[Seamless robe of Jesus|his clothes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:35-36}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:24}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:34}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; before he bowed his head and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:50}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:37}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:46}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, Joseph of Arimathea requested the body from Pilate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:57-58}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:42-43}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:50-52}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Joseph then placed in a new garden tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:59-60}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:46}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:53}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:41-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three [[Synoptic gospels]] also describe [[Simon of Cyrene]] bearing the cross,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:31-32}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:20-21}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a crowd of people mocking Jesus&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:39-43}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:29-32}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:35-37}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the thieves/robbers/rebels,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:44}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:32}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:39}}&lt;/ref&gt; darkness from the 6th to the 9th hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:33}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Holy of Holies|temple veil]] being torn from top to bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:51}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:38}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Synoptic Gospels also mention several witnesses, including a [[centurion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:54}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:39}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several women who watched from a distance&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:55-56}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:40-41}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:49}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of whom were present during [[Entombment of Christ|the burial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:61}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:47}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:54-55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke is the only gospel writer to omit the detail of sour wine mix that was offered to Jesus on a reed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:34}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|27:47-49}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:23}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|15:35-36}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:29-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while only Mark and John describe Joseph actually taking the body down off the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|15:45}}; {{Bibleref2|John|19:38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several details that are only found in one of the gospel accounts. For instance, only Matthew's gospel mentions an earthquake, resurrected saints who went to the city and that Roman soldiers were assigned to guard the tomb,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:51}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|27:62-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Mark is the only one to state the actual time of the crucifixion (the third hour, or 9&amp;nbsp;am) and the centurion's report of Jesus' death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Mark|15:25}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|15:44-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of Luke]]'s unique contributions to the narrative include Jesus' words to the women who were mourning, one criminal's rebuke of the other, the reaction of the multitudes who left "beating their breasts", and the women preparing spices and ointments before resting on the Sabbath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|23:27-32}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Luke|23:40-41}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Luke|23:48}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Luke|23:56}}&lt;/ref&gt; John is also the only one to refer to the request that the legs be broken and the soldier's subsequent piercing of Jesus' side (as fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy), as well as that [[Nicodemus]] assisted Joseph with burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|19:31-37}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|John|19:39-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (1 Cor. 15:4), Jesus was raised from the dead ("on the third day" counting the day of crucifixion as the first) and according to the canonical Gospels, [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appeared to his disciples]] on different occasions before [[Ascension of Jesus|ascending]] to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|19:30–31}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account given in [[Acts of the Apostles]] says that Jesus remained with the apostles for forty days, whereas the account in the Gospel of Luke makes no clear distinction between the events of Easter Sunday and the Ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, The Resurrection, (Penguin, 2008) page 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus, (Penguin, 1993), page 276.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most biblical scholars agree that St. Luke also wrote the Acts of the Apostles as a follow-up volume to his Gospel account, and the two works must be considered as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction, (Intervarsity, 1990) pages 125, 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (written about 93 AD) Jewish historian [[Josephus]] stated ([[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Ant 18.3]]) that Jesus was crucified by Pilate, writing that:&lt;ref name=Theissen81 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man,&amp;nbsp;... He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles&amp;nbsp;... And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross&amp;nbsp;...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most modern scholars agree that while this Josephus passage (called the ''[[Josephus on Jesus#Testimonium Flavianum|Testimonium Flavianum]]'') includes some later [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]], it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate.&lt;ref name="Kostenberger104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, Craig A. 2001 page 316"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wansbrough, Henry 2004 page 185"/&gt; [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] states that there is "broad consensus" among scholars regarding the nature of an authentic reference to the crucifixion of Jesus in the ''Testimonium''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, James (2003).

Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus.

Dunstan 2010 {{ISBN|0-7425-6833-4}} page 293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus' characterization of "Christian abominations" may have been based on the rumors in Rome that during the [[Eucharist]] rituals Christians ate the body and drank the blood of their God, interpreting the symbolic ritual as cannibalism by Christians.

Another possible reference to the crucifixion (''"hanging" cf. {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:39}}; {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:13}}'') is found in the Babylonian [[Talmud]]:
{{Quote|On the eve of the Passover [[Yeshu]] was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, 'He is going forth to be stoned because he has practised sorcery and enticed Israel to [[apostasy]]. Anyone who can say anything in his favour, let him come forward and plead on his behalf.' But since nothing was brought forward in his favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover!|[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin 43a]]| ''Babylonian Talmud'' (Soncino Edition)}}

Although the question of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be about Jesus, [[Peter Schäfer]] stating that there can be no doubt that this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (Aug 24, 2009) {{ISBN|0-691-14318-8}} page 141 and 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.&lt;ref&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E.

{{main|Chronology of Jesus}}

There is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a [[Good Friday|Friday]] on or near [[Passover]] ([[Nisan]] 15), during the governorship of [[Pontius Pilate]] (who ruled AD 26–36).&lt;ref name="Lémonon 1981 29–32"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lémonon |first=J.P. |title=Pilate et le gouvernement de la Judée: textes et monuments, Études bibliques |publisher=Gabalda |location=Paris |year=1981 |pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have provided estimates for the year of crucifixion in the range 30–33 AD,&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L.

Since an [[Hebrew calendar|observational calendar]] was used during the time of Jesus, including an ascertainment of the new moon and ripening barley harvest, the exact day or even month for Passover in a given year is subject to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Babylonian Talmud |chapter=Tractate Sanhedrin 10b |url=http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Babylonian Talmud |chapter=Tractate Sanhedrin 11b |url=http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_11.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=January 2014}} Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different [[astronomy|astronomical]] models.

Others have countered by saying that this ignores the Jewish idiom by which a "day and night" may refer to any part of a 24-hour period, that the expression in Matthew is idiomatic, not a statement that Jesus was 72 hours in the tomb, and that the many references to a resurrection on the third day do not require three literal nights.&lt;ref name=Nis167 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.ie/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=Blomberg+%22Wednesday+crucifixion%22&amp;btnG=|title=Blomberg "Wednesday crucifixion" - Google Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Path to the crucifixion===
{{Main|Christ carrying the Cross|Via Dolorosa}}
[[File:5 Andrea di Bartolo. Way to Calvary. c. 1400, Thissen-Bornhemisza coll. Madrid.jpg|thumb|[[Andrea di Bartolo]], ''Way to Calvary'', c. 1400. The cluster of halos at the left are the [[Virgin Mary]] in front, with the [[Three Marys]].]]
The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] whom the Roman soldiers order to carry the cross after Jesus initially carries it but then collapses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:32}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:21}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Gospel of John just says that Jesus "bears" his own cross.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:17}} &lt;!-- However, John uses "bastazō" with a figurative meaning of ''enduring'' or ''sustaining''.&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongGreek|941}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the first two accounts use "airō" which literally means to ''raise'', ''take up'', or ''lift'',&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongGreek|142}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Luke uses "pherō̄" which literally means to ''bear'', ''carry'', or ''bring forth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{StrongGreek|5342}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Luke's gospel also describes an interaction between Jesus and the women among the crowd of mourners following him, quoting Jesus as saying "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:28-31}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] has Jesus address these women as "daughters of Jerusalem", thus distinguishing them from the women whom the same gospel describes as "the women who had followed him from Galilee" and who were present at his crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:46|ESV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|23:55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the path that Jesus took is called [[Via Dolorosa]] ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Way of Grief" or "Way of Suffering") and is a street in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. It is marked by nine of the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]]. It passes the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Ecce Homo Church]] and the last five stations are inside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

There is no reference to a woman named [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]]&lt;ref&gt;Lavinia Cohn-Sherbok, ''Who's who in Christianity'', (Routledge 1998), page 303.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Gospels, but sources such as ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' describe her as a pious woman of [[Jerusalem]] who, moved with pity as [[Jesus]] carried his cross to [[Golgotha]], gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Notes and Queries]]'', Volume 6 July–December 1852, London, page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Archaeological journal (UK), Volume 7, 1850 page 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15362a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Veronica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Butler, 2000 ''Lives of the Saints'' {{ISBN|0-86012-256-5}} page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
[[File:Golgotha cross-section.svg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the historical site]]
The precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:20}} {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|13:12}} accessible to passers-by{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:39}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:21,29-30}} and observable from some distance away.{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:40}} [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] identified its location only as being north of [[Mount Zion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Onomasticon (Concerning the Place Names in Sacred Scripture) |author=Eusebius of Caesarea |author-link=Eusebius of Caesarea |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_onomasticon_02_trans.htm#G_THE_GOSPELS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times.

[[Calvary]] as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull (''calvaria''), which is used in the [[Vulgate]] translation of "place of a skull", the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word ''Gûlgaltâ'' which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:33}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:22}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|23:33}}; {{bibleverse||John|19:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text does not indicate why it was so designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as a place of public execution, Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of "a skull". While often referred to as "Mount Calvary", it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to the Presbyter Faustus |author=Eucherius of Lyon |author-link=Eucherius of Lyon |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/eucherius.htm |quote=The three more frequented exit gates are one on the west, another on the east, and a third on the north. As you enter the city from the northern side, the first of the holy places due to the condition of the directions of the streets is to the church which is called the Martyrium, which was by Constantine with great reverence not long ago built up. Next, to the west one visits the connecting places Golgotha and the Anastasis; indeed the Anastasis is in the place of the resurrection, and Golgotha is in the middle between the Anastasis and the Martyrium, the place of the Lord's passion, in which still appears that rock which once endured the very cross on which the Lord was. These are however separated places outside of Mount Sion, where the failing rise of the place extended itself to the north. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613200112/http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/eucherius.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional site, inside what is now occupied by the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in the [[Christian Quarter]] of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], has been attested since the 4th century. A second site (commonly referred to as Gordon's Calvary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Charles Gordon's Letters Discussing His Discovery of "Cavalry" in Jerusalem|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?cavalry-crucifixion-sites-identified|work=SMF Primary Source Documents|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), located further north of the Old City near a place popularly called the [[Garden Tomb]], has been promoted since the 19th century.

{{See also|Women at the crucifixion}}
The Gospel of Matthew describes many women at the crucifixion, some of whom are named in the Gospels. Aside from these women, the three Synoptic Gospels speak of the presence of others: "the chief priests, with the scribes and elders";&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:41|ESV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|15:31|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:35|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; two robbers crucified, one on Jesus' right and one on his left,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|15:27|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:38|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom the Gospel of Luke presents as the [[penitent thief]] and the [[impenitent thief]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:39-43|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the soldiers",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:36|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus";&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:54|ESV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Mark|15:39|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; passers-by;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|15:29|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:39|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "bystanders",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|15:35|ESV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:45|ESV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Luke|23:35|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle";&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:48|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "his acquaintances".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|23:49|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of John also speaks of women present, but only mentions the soldiers&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:23-24|ESV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||John|19:32-34|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the [[disciple whom Jesus loved]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:26-27|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospels also tell of the arrival, after the death of Jesus, of [[Joseph of Arimathea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Mark|16:43-46|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:57-50|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:50-53|ESV}}, {{bibleverse||John|19:38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Nicodemus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:39|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method and manner===

[[File:JUSTUS LIPSIUS 1594 De Cruce p 10 Torture stake.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Torture stake'', a simple wooden torture stake. Image by [[Justus Lipsius]].]]
Whereas most Christians believe the [[gibbet]] on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold the view that a single upright stake was used. The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous. The [[Koine Greek]] terms used in the New Testament are ''[[stauros]]'' ({{lang|grc|σταυρός}}) and ''xylon'' ({{lang|grc|ξύλον}}). The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross.&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2396298|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon,σταυρός|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''crux'' was also applied to objects other than a cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=crux&amp;highlight=crux Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[early Christianity|early Christian]] writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], which was certainly earlier than 135,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the date of the work, see [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html Information on Epistle of Barnabas] and Andrew C.

Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any ''he stretched out his hands'', and so Israel was again victorious" (Epistle of Barnabas, 12:2-3).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Martyr]] (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: "That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xl.html|title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]], who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having "five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails."&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm II, xxiv, 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} page 826&lt;/ref&gt; However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails.&lt;ref name=Kitto &gt;''Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Part 2'' by John Kitto 2003 {{ISBN|0-7661-5980-9}} page 591&lt;/ref&gt; These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=IreneE &gt;''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} page 64&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western Church]], before the [[Renaissance]] usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other.&lt;ref name=IreneE /&gt; Nails are almost always depicted in art, although [[Roman Empire|Romans]] sometimes just tied the victims to the cross.&lt;ref name=IreneE /&gt; The tradition also carries to Christian [[emblem]]s, e.g. the [[Jesuits]] use three nails under the [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS monogram]] and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.&lt;ref&gt;''The visual arts: a history'' by Hugh Honour, John Fleming 1995 {{ISBN|0-8109-3928-2}} page 526&lt;/ref&gt;

The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Some theories suggest that the Greek word ''cheir'' (χειρ) for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through [[Destot's space]] (between the [[capitate]] and [[lunate bone]]s) without fracturing any bones.&lt;ref name=Ball82 &gt;''The Crucifixion and Death of a Man Called Jesus'' by David A Ball 2010 {{ISBN|1-61507-128-8}} pages 82–84&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] of the [[forearm]].&lt;ref name=Moore639 &gt;''The Chronological Life of Christ'' by Mark E. Moore 2007 {{ISBN|0-89900-955-7}} page&amp;nbsp;639–643&lt;/ref&gt; Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails.&lt;ref&gt;''Holman Concise Bible Dictionary'' Holman, 2011 {{ISBN|0-8054-9548-7}} page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue of debate has been the use of a hypopodium as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight. In the 17th century [[Rasmus Bartholin]] considered a number of analytical scenarios of that topic.&lt;ref name=Kitto /&gt; In the 20th century, forensic pathologist [[Frederick Zugibe]] performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions.&lt;ref name=Moore639 /&gt; His experiments support an angled suspension, and a two-beamed cross, and perhaps some form of foot support, given that in an ''Aufbinden'' form of suspension from a straight stake (as used by the [[Nazi]]s in the [[Dachau concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]), death comes rather quickly.&lt;ref&gt;''Crucifixion and the Death Cry of Jesus Christ'' by Geoffrey L Phelan MD, 2009 ISBN pages&amp;nbsp;106–111&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Sayings of Jesus on the cross}}
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - What Our Lord Saw from the Cross (Ce que voyait Notre-Seigneur sur la Croix) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Tissot]], What Our Lord Saw from the Cross, c.1890, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The Gospels describe various "last words" that Jesus said while on the cross,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas W. Walker, ''Luke'', (Westminster John Knox Press, 2013) page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

'''Mark / Matthew'''
* "E′li, E′li, la′ma sa‧bach‧tha′ni?" {{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:46}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:34}} ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?").  However, as Aramaic linguist Steve Caruso of [http://aramaicnt.org/what-is-galilean-aramaic/ AramaicNT.org]&lt;ref&gt;http://aramaicnt.org/what-is-galilean-aramaic/&lt;/ref&gt; explains, Jesus most likely spoke Galilean Aramaic, which would render the pronunciation of these words as follows:  [http://aramaicnt.org/2015/03/31/my-god-my-god-why-have-you-forsaken-me/ əlahí əlahí ləmáh šəvaqtáni].&lt;ref&gt;http://aramaicnt.org/2015/03/31/my-god-my-god-why-have-you-forsaken-me/&lt;/ref&gt;

The only words of Jesus on the cross mentioned in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of [[Psalm 22]]. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, some commentators consider it a literary and theological creation; however, [[Geza Vermes]] points out that the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'.&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) page 122.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Brown, ''The Death of the Messiah'' Volume II (Doubleday, 1994) page 1051&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke'''
* "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." [Some early manuscripts do not have this]{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:34}}
* "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:43}}
* "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:46}}

The Gospel of Luke does not include the aforementioned exclamation of Jesus mentioned in Matthew and Mark.&lt;ref&gt;John Haralson Hayes, ''Biblical Exegesis: A Beginner's Handbook'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1987) page 104-5. The author suggests this possibly was designed to play down the suffering of Jesus and replace a cry of desperation with one of hope and confidence, in keeping with the message of the Gospel in which Jesus dies confident that he would be vindicated as God's righteous prophet.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John'''
* "Woman, behold, your son!" {{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:25-27}}
* "I thirst."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:28}}
* "It is finished."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30}}

The words of Jesus on the cross, especially his [[last words]], have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;David Anderson-Berry, 1871 ''The Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross'', Glasgow: Pickering &amp; Inglis Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rev. John Edmunds, 1855 ''The seven sayings of Christ on the cross'' Thomas Hatchford Publishers, London, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Pink, 2005 ''The Seven Sayings of the Saviour on the Cross'' Baker Books {{ISBN|0-8010-6573-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Peter Long, 1966 ''The wounded Word: A brief meditation on the seven sayings of Christ on the cross'' Baker Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Ross Macduff, 1857 ''The Words of Jesus'' New York: Thomas Stanford Publishers, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watson, 1847 ''The seven sayings on the Cross'' John Masters Publishers, London, page 5. The difference between the accounts is cited by [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] as a reason to doubt their historicity. James G. D. Dunn, ''Jesus Remembered'', (Eerdmans, 2003) page&amp;nbsp;779–781.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. "John" p.&amp;nbsp;302–310&lt;/ref&gt;

====Darkness====
{{main|Crucifixion darkness}}
[[File:Christ at the Cross - Cristo en la Cruz.jpg|thumb|200px|''Christ on the Cross'', by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], showing the skies darkened]]
In the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judea (or the whole world) is "darkened for three hours," from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon). There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Keith Broadhead ''Prophet, Son, Messiah: Narrative Form and Function in Mark'' (Continuum, 1994) page 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event, mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the Passover, which takes place at the full moon. Christian traveller and historian [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and Christian theologian [[Origen]] refer to Greek historian [[Phlegon of Tralles|Phlegon]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written "with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Origen |author-link=Origen |title=''Contra Celsum (Against Celsus)'', Book 2, XXXIII |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]: "This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ante-Nicene fathers |last=Donaldson |first=Coxe |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |volume=6 |year=1888 |location=New York |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5gsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologist [[Tertullian]] believed the event was documented in the Roman archives.&lt;ref&gt;"In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn, when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ, no doubt thought it an eclipse. You yourselves have the account of the world-portent still in your archives."{{cite web |author=Tertullian |author-link=Tertullian |title=''Apologeticum'' |url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington of [[Oxford University]] considered the possibility that a lunar, rather than solar, eclipse might have taken place.&lt;ref name=HumWadJASA&gt;Colin J. Humphreys and W. G. Waddington, ''The Date of the Crucifixion '' Journal of the American Scientific Affiliation 37 (March 1985)[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1985/JASA3-85Humphreys.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Humphreys]], ''The Mystery of the Last Supper'' Cambridge University Press 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-521-73200-0}}, p. 193 (However note that Humphreys places the Last Supper on a Wednesday)&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that such an eclipse would have been visible, for thirty minutes, from Jerusalem and suggested the gospel reference to a solar eclipse was the result of a scribe wrongly amending a text. Historian David Henige dismisses this explanation as 'indefensible'&lt;ref name="henige"&gt;{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | authorlink=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and astronomer Bradley Schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1990, March). Lunar visibility and the crucifixion. Royal Astronomical Society Quarterly Journal, 31(1), 53-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, B. E. (1991, July). Glare and celestial visibility. Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 103, 645-660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the Mark Gospel, amended in the Luke and Matthew accounts, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event, and not intended to be taken literally.&lt;ref&gt;Burton L. Mack, ''A Myth of Innocence: Mark and Christian Origins'' (Fortress Press, 1988) page 296; George Bradford Caird, ''The language and imagery of the Bible'' (Westminster Press, 1980), page 186; Joseph Fitzmyer, ''The Gospel According to Luke, X-XXIV'' (Doubleday, 1985) page 1513; William David Davies, Dale Allison, ''Matthew: Volume 3'' (Continuum, 1997) page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; This image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers, a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as [[Philo]], [[Dio Cassius]], [[Virgil]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth &amp; Helwys Publishing, 1999) page 264.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Géza Vermes]] describes the darkness account as typical of "Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord", and says that those interpreting it as a datable eclipse are "barking up the wrong tree".&lt;ref&gt;Géza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) pages 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synoptic gospels state that the [[Veil#Biblical references|veil]] of [[temple in Jerusalem|the temple]] was torn from top to bottom.

The Gospel of Matthew mentions an account of earthquakes, rocks splitting, and the opening of the graves of dead [[saint]]s and describes how these resurrected saints went into the holy city and appeared to many people.&lt;ref&gt;John Yueh-Han Yieh, ''One Teacher: Jesus' Teaching Role in Matthew's Gospel Report'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2005) page 65; Robert Walter Funk, ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus'' (Harper San Francisco, 1998) pages 129-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Mark and Matthew accounts, the [[centurion]] [[Longinus|in charge]] comments on the events: "Truly this man was the Son of God!"{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:39}} or "Truly this was the [[Son of God]]!".{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:54}} The Gospel of Luke quotes him as saying, "Certainly this man was innocent!"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:47}}

A widespread 6.3 magnitude earthquake has been confirmed to have taken place between 26-36 AD in the time of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson Williams, Markus Schwab and A. Brauer (2012). ''An early first-century earthquake in the Dead Sea''. International Geology Review.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229810999_An_early_first-century_earthquake_in_the_Dead_Sea full article]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors concluded that:
{{Quote|Plausible candidates include the earthquake reported in the Gospel of Matthew, an earthquake that occurred sometime before or after the crucifixion and was in effect ‘borrowed’ by the author of the Gospel of Matthew, and a local earthquake between 26 and 36 AD that was sufficiently energetic to deform the sediments at Ein Gedi but not energetic enough to produce a still extant and extra-biblical historical record. If the last possibility is true, this would mean that the report of an earthquake in the Gospel of Matthew is a type of allegory.}}

A number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by [[physicians]] and Biblical scholars. In 2006, Matthew W. Maslen and Piers D. Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from [[cardiac rupture]] to [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Medical theories on the cause of death in Crucifixion '' J R Soc Med April 2006 vol. 99 no. 4 185-188.

In 1847, based on the reference in the Gospel of John ({{Bibleref2|John|19:34}}) to blood and water coming out when Jesus' side was pierced with a spear, physician William Stroud proposed the ruptured heart theory of the cause of Christ's death which influenced a number of other people.&lt;ref&gt;William Stroud, 1847, ''Treatise on the Physical Death of Jesus Christ'' London: Hamilton and Adams.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Seymour, 2003, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4527-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cardiovascular collapse theory is a prevalent modern explanation and suggests that Jesus died of profound shock. According to this theory, the scourging, the beatings, and the fixing to the cross would have left Jesus dehydrated, weak, and critically ill and that this would have led to cardiovascular collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/byustudies/050325cause.html |title=''The Search for the Physical Cause of Christ's Death'' BYU Studies |access-date=2009-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210172435/http://meridianmagazine.com/byustudies/050325cause.html |archive-date=2009-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frugalsites.net/jesus/death.htm The Physical Death Of Jesus Christ, Study by The Mayo Clinic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131191153/http://www.frugalsites.net/jesus/death.htm |date=2009-01-31 }} citing studies by Bucklin R (The legal and medical aspects of the trial and death of Christ.

Writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', physician William Edwards and his colleagues supported the combined cardiovascular collapse (via [[hypovolemic]] shock) and exhaustion [[asphyxia]] theories, assuming that the flow of water from the side of Jesus described in the [[The Gospel of John|Gospel of John]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn.|19:34}} was [[pericardial fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, William D.; Gabel, Wesley J.; Hosmer, Floyd E; ''On the Physical Death of Jesus'', JAMA March 21, 1986, Vol 255, No. 11, pp 1455–1463 [http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/deathjesus.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Crucifixion of Jesus'', physician and [[forensic pathologist]] [[Frederick Zugibe]] studied the likely circumstances of the death of Jesus in great detail.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Zugibe, 2005, ''The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry'' Evans Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59077-070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JW Hewitt, ''The Use of Nails in the Crucifixion '' Harvard Theological Review, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Zugibe carried out a number of experiments over several years to test his theories while he was a medical examiner.&lt;ref name=experiments/&gt; These studies included experiments in which volunteers with specific weights were hanging at specific angles and the amount of pull on each hand was measured, in cases where the feet were also secured or not.

[[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]], a French physician, and the chief surgeon at Saint Joseph's Hospital in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]] Oct 12, 1978, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesized that Jesus would have had to relax his muscles to obtain enough air to utter his last words, in the face of exhaustion asphyxia.&lt;ref&gt;Barbet, Pierre. ''Doctor at Calvary'', New York: Image Books, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Barbet's theories, e.g., location of nails, are disputed by Zugibe.

[[Orthopedic surgeon]] Keith Maxwell not only analyzed the medical aspects of the crucifixion, but also looked back at how Jesus could have carried the cross all the way along [[Via Dolorosa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmbcth.com/pmbc_037.htm Keith Maxwell MD on the Crucifixion of Christ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117095319/http://www.pmbcth.com/pmbc_037.htm |date=2011-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southasianconnection.com/articles/184/1/Jesus-Suffering-and-Crucifixion -From-a-Medical-Point-of-View/Page1.html ''Jesus' Suffering and Crucifixion from a Medical Point of View'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the [[Catholic Medical Association]], Phillip Bishop and [[physiologist]] Brian Church suggested a new theory based on [[suspension trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lq.cathmed.metapress.com/content/tp560727r314u06n Catholic Medical Association, Linacre Quarterly, August 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709233606/http://lq.cathmed.metapress.com/content/tp560727r314u06n |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, historians FP Retief and L. Cilliers reviewed the history and pathology of crucifixion as performed by the Romans and suggested that the cause of death was often a combination of factors. They also state that Roman guards were prohibited from leaving the scene until death had occurred.&lt;ref name="retief"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Retief |first1=FP |last2=Cilliers |first2=L. |title=The history and pathology of crucifixion. |journal=South African Medical Journal = Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif vir Geneeskunde |date=December 2003 |volume=93 |issue=12 |pages=938-41 |pmid=14750495 |url=http://www.samj.org.za/index.php/samj/article/viewFile/2462/1710 |accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians believe that Jesus' death was instrumental in restoring humankind to [[Salvation (Christianity)|relationship with God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul II |first1=Pope John |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Urbi Et Orbi Communications |year=1994 | page=376}} Online: https://books.google.com/books?id=tVJXcOVY2UgC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwarz |first1=Hans |title=True Faith in the True God: An Introduction to Luther's Life and Thought |location=Minneapolis |publisher= Augsburg Fortress |year=1996 | pages=47–48}} Online: https://books.google.com/books?id=l3rDtUQRdKAC&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe that through faith in Jesus' substitutionary death (among other interpretive theories see below) and triumphant [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Benedict XVI |first1=Pope |title= Principles of Catholic Theology: Building Stones for a Fundamental Theology |location=San Francisco |publisher= Ignatius Press |year=1987 | pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvin |first1=Jean |title=Institutes of the Christian Religion |location=Philadelphia |publisher= Presbyterian Board of Publication and Sabbath-School Work |year=1921 | pages=477–479}} Online: https://books.google.com/books?id=UU9Ygc_c5woC&lt;/ref&gt; people are reunited with God and receive new joy and power in this life as well as eternal life in [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] after the body's death. Thus the crucifixion of Jesus along with his resurrection restores access to a vibrant experience of God's presence, [[Love of God (Christianity)|love]] and [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] as well as the confidence of [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=12: On the Royal Road of the Holy Cross |last=Kempis |first1=Thomas |title=The Inner Life |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2005}} Online: https://books.google.com/books?id=13QRjJjhEqkC “In the Cross is salvation; in the Cross is life; in the Cross is protection against our enemies; in the Cross is infusion of heavenly sweetness; in the Cross is strength of mind; in the Cross is joy of spirit; in the Cross is excellence of virtue; in the Cross is perfection of holiness. There is no salvation of soul, nor hope of eternal life, save in the Cross.”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christology of the crucifixion===
{{see also|Lamb of God}}
The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent [[resurrection of Jesus]] provide a rich background for [[Christology|Christological]] analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the [[Pauline epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Mark Allan Powell and David R. Bauer 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25752-6}} page 106&lt;/ref&gt; Christians believe Jesus' suffering was foretold in the [[Hebrew Bible]], such as in [[Psalm 22]], and [[Isaiah]]'s songs of the [[suffering servant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Passion |last=Cross |first1=Frank L. |last2=Livingstone |first2=Elizabeth A. |title=The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Johannine]] "agent Christology" the submission of Jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an agent of God or servant of God, for the sake of eventual victory.&lt;ref name=Cullmann &gt;''The Christology of the New Testamen''t by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Johannine exegesis of God'' by Daniel Rathnakara Sadananda 2005 {{ISBN|3-11-018248-3}} page 281&lt;/ref&gt; This builds on the [[salvation in Christianity|salvific]] theme of the [[Gospel of John]] which begins in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]] with [[John the Baptist]]'s proclamation: "The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world".&lt;ref name=Pollard &gt;''Johannine Christology'' and the Early Church by T. E. Pollard 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-01868-4}} page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hengel371 &gt;''Studies in Early Christology'' by Martin Hengel 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-04280-4}} page 371&lt;/ref&gt; Further reinforcement of the concept is provided in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:14|Revelation 21:14]] where the "[[Lamb of God|lamb slain but standing]]" is the only one worthy of handling the scroll (i.e. the book) containing the names of those who are to be saved.&lt;ref name=DeHaan &gt;''Studies in Revelation'' by [[M. R. DeHaan|Martin Ralph DeHaan]], 1998 {{ISBN|0-8254-2485-2}} page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

A central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".&lt;ref name=Matera67 &gt;''New Testament christology'' by Frank J. Matera 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25694-5}} page 67&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the lawless" is viewed as the fulfillment of the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Matera67 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 {{ISBN|0-664-25221-4}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#6:12|Galatians 6:12]] may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 &gt;''Christology'' by Hans Schwarz 1998 {{ISBN|0-8028-4463-4}} pages&amp;nbsp;132–134&lt;/ref&gt; For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:8|1 Corinthians 2:8]].&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Philippians#2:8|Philippians 2:8]]) died "at the right time" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#4:25|Romans 4:25]]) based on the plan of God.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt; For Paul the "power of the cross" is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Schwarz132 /&gt;

However, the belief in the redemptive nature of Jesus' death predates the Pauline letters and goes back to the earliest days of Christianity and the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]].&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado (Sep 14, 2005) {{ISBN|0-8028-3167-2}} pages&amp;nbsp;130–133&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nicene Creed]]'s statement that "for our sake he was crucified" is a reflection of this core belief's formalization in the fourth century.&lt;ref name=Harris12&gt;''Christian Theology'' by J. Glyndwr Harris (Mar 2002) {{ISBN|1-902210-22-0}} pages&amp;nbsp;12–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Calvin]] supported the "agent of God" Christology and argued that in his trial in [[Pilate's Court]] Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.&lt;ref name=CalvinC &gt;''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-54154-9}} page 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures'' by [[Hughes Oliphant Old]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4775-7}} page 125&lt;/ref&gt; This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church]]es. In the Eastern Church [[Sergei Bulgakov]] argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was "[[Pre-existence of Christ|pre-eternally]]" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.&lt;ref name=SBulgakov &gt;''The Lamb of God'' by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} page 129&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western Church, [[Karl Rahner]] elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the [[Lamb of God]] (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to [[Baptism in Christianity|baptismal water]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atonement ===
{{main|Atonement in Christianity|Salvation (Christianity)}}
Jesus' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological [[soteriology|interpretations]] as to how [[salvation]] is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{Bibleref2|Matthew|6:14–15}}. See also [[Sermon on the Mount]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[substitutionary atonement]] view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God.&lt;ref name="Atonement"&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctrine of the Atonement |work=Catholic Encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02055a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a [[martyr]]dom.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk ''Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation'', (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011) {{ISBN|978-1-4563-8980-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestants]] typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of [[penal substitution]]. [[Liberal Protestant]]s typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the [[moral influence theory of atonement]]. Both views are popular within the [[Roman Catholic church]], with the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction]] doctrine incorporated into the idea of [[penance]].&lt;ref name="Atonement"/&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition this view of atonement is balanced by the duty of Roman Catholics to perform [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ball, Ann |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=0-87973-910-X |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor |location=Huntington, Ind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in the encyclical ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]]'' of [[Pope Pius XI]] were defined as "some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Miserentissimus Redemptor'' |publisher=Encyclical of Pope Pius XI |url= http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140812031528/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |archivedate=2014-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] referred to these [[Acts of Reparation]] as the "unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vatican archives |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502234831/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, another common view is [[Christus Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Christus Victor#Development of the Christus Victor view after Aulén|Development of the Christus Victor view after Aulén]]&lt;/ref&gt; This holds that Jesus was sent by God to defeat death and [[Satan]]. Because of his [[Perfection of Christ|perfection]], voluntary death, and resurrection, Jesus defeated Satan and death, and arose victorious. Therefore, humanity was no longer bound in sin, but was free to rejoin God through faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Johnson, Alan F. |author2=Robert E. Webber |title=What Christians Believe: A Biblical and Historical Summary |publisher=Zondervan |year=1993 |pages=261–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{main|Islamic view of Jesus' death}}
{{see also|Jesus in Islam}}
Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an argument in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.

Professor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:

{{quote|"The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ. Rather, it challenges human beings who in their folly have deluded themselves into believing that they would vanquish the divine Word, Jesus Christ the Messenger of God. The death of Jesus is asserted several times and in various contexts." (3:55; 5:117; 19:33.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ayoub |first=Mahmoud M. | author-link=Mahmoud M. Ayoub| last2= |first2= |date=April 1980 |title=Towards an Islamic christology II: The death of Jesus, reality or delusion (A study of the death of Jesus in Tafsir literature) |url= |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=106 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1980.tb03405.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The below quranic verse says Jesus was neither killed nor crucified:

{{Quote| "And they said we have killed the Messiah Isa son of Maryam, the Messenger of God.  They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, though it was made to appear like that to them; those that disagreed about him are full of doubt, with no knowledge to follow, only supposition: they certainly did not kill him.  On the contrary, God raised him unto himself. God is almighty and wise."|''Quran surah 4 ([[An-Nisa]] النساء) ayah 157-158''&lt;ref name="Cite quran|4|157|e=158|s=ns"&gt;{{Cite quran|4|157|e=158|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Contrary to Christian teachings, some Islamic traditions teach that Jesus [[entering heaven alive|ascended to Heaven]] without being put on the cross, but that God transformed another person to appear exactly like him and to be then crucified instead of him. This thought is supported in misreading an account by [[Irenaeus]], the 2nd-century [[Alexandria]]n [[Gnostic]] [[Basilides]] when refuting a heresy denying the death.&lt;ref&gt;"Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all" ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103124.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', book I, ch. 24, 4]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art, symbolism and devotions==
[[File:Detalle crucificado Luján Pérez, 1793.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Detail of the countenance of Christ just dead (1793), by José Luján Pérez, [[Las Palmas Cathedral|Canary Islands Cathedral]], [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].]]

&lt;!--There was a "Too many images" tag on this article once and the number of images was reduced and they were moved to the gallery. Please try not too add images all over the place in this article, not to attract another "Too many images" tag. --&gt;

Since the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of [[Christian symbolism]], and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of [[Christian art]], giving rise to specific artistic themes such as [[Ecce Homo]], [[The Raising of the Cross]], [[Descent from the Cross]] and [[Entombment of Christ]].

The [[Crucifixion, seen from the Cross (James Tissot)|Crucifixion, seen from the Cross]] by Tissot presented a novel approach at the end of the 19th century, in which the crucifixion scene was portrayed from the perspective of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''James Tissot: the Life of Christ'' by Judith F. Dolkart 2009 {{ISBN|1-85894-496-1}} page 201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Art and the Death of a Culture|first=H. R.|last=Rookmaaker|page=73|publisher=Crossway Books|year=1970|isbn=0-89107-799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian symbolism#Cross and crucifix|symbolism of the cross]] which is today one of the most widely recognized Christian symbols was used from the earliest Christian times and [[Justin Martyr]] who died in 165 describes it in a way that already implies its use as a symbol, although the [[crucifix]] appeared later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Symbolism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Veneration of Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masters such as [[Caravaggio]], [[Rubens]] and [[Titian]] have all depicted the [[Commons:Category:Paintings of crucifixion|Crucifixion scene]] in their works.

Devotions based on the process of crucifixion, and the sufferings of Jesus are followed by various Christians. The [[Stations of the Cross]] follows a number of stages based on the stages involved in the crucifixion of Jesus, while the [[Rosary of the Holy Wounds]] is used to meditate on the wounds of Jesus as part of the crucifixion.

The presence of the Virgin Mary under the cross{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:26-27}} has in itself been the subject of [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]], and well known Catholic symbolism such as the [[Miraculous Medal]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s Coat of Arms bearing a [[Marian Cross]]. And a number of Marian devotions also involve the presence of the Virgin Mary in Calvary, e.g., Pope John Paul II stated that "Mary was united to Jesus on the Cross".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm3.htm EWTN: ''Mary was United to Jesus on the Cross'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19881123en.html Vatican website on ''Behold Your Mother!'']&lt;/ref&gt; Well known works of Christian art by masters such as [[Raphael]] (e.g., the [[Mond Crucifixion]]), and [[Caravaggio]] (e.g., his [[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment]]) depict the Virgin Mary as part of the crucifixion scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">'''European Data Format''' ('''EDF''')  is a standard [[file format]] designed for exchange and storage of medical [[time series]]. Being an open and non-proprietary format, EDF(+) is commonly used to archive, exchange and analyse data from commercial devices in a format that is independent of the acquisition system. In this way, the data can be retrieved and analyzed by independent software. EDF(+) software (browsers, checkers, ...) and example files are freely available.

EDF was published in 1992 and stores multichannel data, allowing different sample rates for each signal. Internally it includes a header and one or more data records. The header contains some general information (patient identification, start time...) and technical specs of each signal (calibration, sampling rate, filtering, ...), coded as ASCII characters. The data records contain samples as [[little-endian]] [[16-bit]] integers. EDF is a popular format for [[polysomnography]] (PSG) recordings.

EDF+ was published in 2003 and is largely compatible to EDF: all existing EDF viewers also show EDF+ signals. But EDF+ files also allow coding discontinuous recordings as well as annotations, stimuli and events in [[UTF-8]] format. EDF+ has applications in PSG, [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[electrocardiography]] (ECG), [[electromyography]] (EMG), and Sleep scoring. EDF+ can also be used for nerve conduction studies, evoked potentials and other data acquisition studies.

The '''French submarine ''Diane''''' was the [[lead ship|lead boat]] of [[Diane-class submarine (1916)|the class]] of two [[List of submarines of France|submarine]]s built for the [[French Navy]] during [[World War I]].

On 11 February 1918, ''Diane'' suffered an internal explosion in the [[Bay of Biscay]] off [[La Pallice]], [[Vendée]], [[France]], and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyFrench.htm |title=French Navy |publisher=Naval History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Gearhead is '''Nathan Finch''', a former engineer at General Robotics. While he was kidnapping and holding Gloria Osteen, his boss' daughter, for ransom, he runs afoul of [[Batman]] who rescues her. Unfortunately, he was not able to save Nathan from falling to an icy death. Nathan Finch's body was discovered by two down-and-out people who take him to an underworld doctor named Dr. Bascomb. It turned out that Nathan was not dead and the doctor wanted his knowledge of cybernetics. Due to ravages of frostbite, Dr. Bascomb removed his arms and legs and replaced them with cybernetic arms and legs. Following a training with his cybernetic limbs, Nathan becomes Gearhead and develops his own cybernetic arsenal of removable body parts as well as a goal to exterminate Batman, whom he refers to as the "vermin".&lt;ref name="Detective Comics #717"&gt;''Detective Comics'' #717. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloria Osteen later receives a call from Nathan to meet him at Babylon Towers. During the confrontation between the two of them, Batman arrived and fought Gearhead as they neared a grinder where Gearhead started to choke Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #712. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As Gearhead started to get Batman close to the grinder, Gloria decided to help Batman by activating a hydraulic magnet in order to get Gearhead off of Batman. With his legs removed, Finch still managed to get away with a Batarang still in his cybernetic arm. While enlisting the help of [[Tim Drake|Robin]], Batman traced Gearhead to the sewers where he found a batarang and no Gearhead. Just then, Gearhead attacks Batman. While chasing Gearhead, Batman figured out that his attack on Gloria was a cover so that he can have revenge on Batman. When they fell into the water, Batman broke off one of Gearhead's arms as Gearhead uses his other arm to get away. While Batman left a note for Gloria complete with Gearhead's arm stating that Gearhead is not after her, Gearhead is seen at his hideout rebuilding his body and planning his revenge on Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #713. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Batman stops three thieves, Gearhead watches from the rooftops where he recaps his origin. Later at his hideout, Gearhead watches a wildlife television show as he gets an idea on how to defeat Batman. The next day, Gearhead attends the press release at Drexel Pharmaceuticals that debut of chips that would bind to living tissue and help fight diseases faster. As the press think that Gearhead is a concerned citizen when he asked about the chips on anyone who is part human and part mechanical, this attracts the attention of Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth. Later that night, Gearhead begins his heist at Drexel Pharmaceuticals when Batman arrives. Upon luring Batman to the parking lot and recapping the "tools" that Dr. Bascomb gave him, Gearhead assembles a big car-like structure up to his waist and is directed by his arms. Batman enters the [[Batmobile]] and chases after Gearhead which is what Gearhead had wanted. In the empty part of Gotham City, Gearhead released a miniature car which disabled the Batmobile. After the Batmobile crashes into a pillar, Gearhead decides to let the local street punks deal with Batman.&lt;ref name="Detective Comics #717"/&gt; Gearhead then watches as the steet punks close in on the crashed Batmobile. After Batman recovered and got away from the street punks, Gearhead pursued Batman onto the freeway where the bombs dropped by Batman had no effect on it. When Batman spilled oil, it caused Gearhead to slip into a wall which damaged the wheels. This causes Gearhead to activate the spider-like legs on his vehicle. When Batman accelerated Gearhead enough to crash into a wall, it ejected Gearhead landing him on the railroad tracks. Even though it seemed that Gearhead was crushed by the train, Gearhead survived without his cybernetic legs as he crawls somewhere to plan revenge on Batman.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #718. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nicholas Scratch orders his henchmen to find someone to cause chaos in [[Gotham City]], they introduced him to Gearhead, Dynamiteer, and Tumult.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #727. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and Robin defeated Tumult, they are being watched by a vengeful Gearhead.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #728. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As Nightwing and Robin patrol Gotham City, they are still being watched by Gearhead through a camera device and is curious to where Batman is. Upon pulling off an ambush, Gearhead took Nightwing captive and had Robin tell Batman that he has less than an hour to confront him or he will kill Nightwing. As Gearhead was starting to lose his patience while tying Nightwing to the soon-to-be-destroyed bridge, he hears Batman's voice which actually came from a voice modulator that Robin used to distract Gearhead while he freed Nightwing. After Nightwing and Robin escaped into the water, Gearhead was attacked by a mob of Nicholas Scratch's minions. As Gearhead shot at them, he accidentally shot the detonators which destroyed the bridge and prevented the villains from leaving Gotham City.&lt;ref&gt;''Detective Comics'' #729. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

He played a part in the ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'' section of the ''[[Batman: No Man's Land|No Man's Land]]'' crossover, in which he is one of a number of villains competing for control of [[Gotham City]]'s sewers. Without the use of his cybernetic arms and legs, he is forced into partnership with the thuggish Tommy Mangles who carries around Finch's torso. The two of them scared off any refugees they came across and stole their supplies. Their actions surprised a rat that worked for [[Ratcatcher (comics)|Ratcatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' Vol. 4 #67. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Gearhead and Tommy Mangles are later dragged underwater and find themselves in a different place from where they were before. The two of them get lost in the sewers.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' Vol. 4 #68. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Gearhead and Tommy Mangles are still lost as they check the map to see where they are. They find blocks of ice floating in the water and suggests they head back as Gearhead doesn't like the ice. Tommy Mangles didn't listen to Gearhead and were frozen in ice when it turns out that they are near [[Mr. Freeze]]'s hideout.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' Vol. 4 #69. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As Gearhead and Tommy Mangles are now captives of Mr. Freeze, Gearhead is informed by Mr. Freeze to tell him something useful. Gearhead mentions the storage room with canned food and other products. Mr. Freeze then freezes Gearhead and left to go look for the storage room. After Detective Mackenzie Bock arrested Mr. Freeze and Ratcatcher upon Robin defeating them, the [[Gotham City Police Department]] found the frozen bodies of Gearhead and Tommy Mangles and took them into police custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Robin'' Vol. 4 #70. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

He put in an appearance in the comic mini-series ''[[Rush City (comics)|Rush City]]'', where he is physically attached to his car and allies with Arthur Bellingame.&lt;ref&gt;''Rush City'' #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Rush (comics)|Rush]] and [[Black Canary]] catch up to Anatol Arraza, Gearhead also arrives as well as an army of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and the [[Department of Extranormal Operations|DEO]] as it is discovered that Anatol has a ten-megaton bio-weapon surgically implanted inside of his stomach and is keyed to his body's metabolism and is set to detonate should Anatol ever fall asleep.&lt;ref&gt;''Rush City'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Gearhead then pursues Rush and Black Canary. Rush unleashes small versions of his car Sam which unleashes an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] that disables Gearhead. Gearhead revives and drives away. Gearhead catches up to Rush and Black Canary as he brings out metal drills and circular saws from the engine of his car to attack. Rush and Black Canary work together to disable Gearhead.&lt;ref&gt;''Rush City'' #3. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Gearhead became a member of [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Infinite Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and Abilities==
The Nathan Finch version of Gearhead has genius-level intellect. He also can design gadgets that would be of use to him.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:GearHead.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gearhead as seen in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
Gearhead first appeared in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "RPM" voiced by [[Will Friedle]]. In this version, Gearhead (Nathan Finch) is a criminal car racer, who operates with advanced forms of [[nanotechnology]].  Like in the comics he is a [[cyborg]], as the Batman says, "He doesn't control nanotechnology; he ''is'' nanotechnology". Aside from his bionics, Gearhead's appearance is altered, donning a yellow racing outfit (albeit with a visorless helmet), a black stripe down the middle of each part and grey, and metal fingers on his left glove (his right arm is sleeveless and the hand on that arm is bare-handed). His right arm has cords that transmit some kind of nanotechnological virus which infects the vehicle and alters it into a more hi-tech form with advanced features and his signature yellow and black colour scheme. His fingertips can extend to form claws when he is engaged in combat. His right arm bears certain shells of the nanotechnological virus, which he can fire at other vehicles and control them remotely. Also, he has a robotic right eye that can automatically guide and maneuver his vehicle through traffic and other obstructions for him. Gearhead first shows up in a yellow race car during a charity race that Bruce Wayne is also competing in. Gearhead wins the race and steals all the charity money and rides off, leaving all the contestants baffled. Soon after, he ends up getting chased by the Batman in his [[Batmobile]]. However, Gearhead appears to be too fast for the Batman, and later the Batman eventually loses control of the Batmobile and falls off a cliff. He manages to jump in time, but the Batmobile is destroyed. Later, at the [[Batcave]], Wayne builds a new Batmobile with upgraded parts from other prototypes in his possession, from Wayne Industries technology and even from the nanotechnological shell that he recovered from a vehicle that Gearhead was controlling. With a bigger and better vehicle, the Batman, along with the [[Batgirl]], outraces Gearhead and defeats him. When he tries to steal the new Batmobile by injecting his cords into it, he is electrocuted, as the Batman tells that he reversed the effects of the virus so that it can't infect his vehicle. Gearhead is then sent to jail. Gearhead is later seen in "Rumors" as one of the villains captured by Rumor.

===Toys===
Two action figures of Gearhead were made for ''The Batman'' toyline. One for ''EXP'' line, and one for the ''Shadowtek'' line. However, Mattel renamed him "Metal Head" due to legal reasons.

===Miscellaneous===
Gearhead appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman Strikes!]]''. In issue #36, it is revealed he used to be Nathan Finch, a big celebrity in underground racing. A car accident severely crippled him, making him lose the use of his arms and legs, and destroyed his career. Finch, lusting for power and glory, gained cybernetic parts and nanotechnology from an unknown benefactor becoming Gearhead and wreaked havoc in Gotham City. Gearhead later makes a cameo alongside many rogues in [[Arkham Asylum]] in issue #39 who take revenge against recently imprisoned [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]].

'''Harrison’s rule''' is an observation in evolutionary biology by Launcelot Harrison which states that in comparisons across closely related species, host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively.

== Parasite species’ body size increases with host species’ body size== 
Launcelot Harrison, an Australian authority in zoology and parasitology, published a study in 1915 concluding that host and parasite body sizes tend to covary positively,&lt;ref name=Harrison_1915&gt; {{cite journal | last= Harrison| first=Launcelot| title =Mallophaga from Apteryx, and their significance; with a note on the genus Rallicola | journal= [[ Parasitology]] | year=1915 | volume=8 | pages=88–100 | url= http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/0182.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; a covariation later dubbed as 'Harrison’s rule'. Harrison himself originally proposed it to interpret the variability of congeneric [[louse]] species. However, subsequent authors verified it for a wide variety of parasitic organisms including [[nematodes]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = TB | last2 = Anderson | first2 = RV| last3 = Ingham | first3 = RE|  title = Natural selection and the distribution of nematode sizes | journal= [[Ecology (journal) | Ecology]] | year= 1980| volume = 61 | pages= 232–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harveyetal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harvey | first1 = PH| last2 = Keymer | first2 = AE| title = Comparing life histories using phylogenies | journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]]| year= 1991| volume = 332 | pages= 31–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Legendre | first2 = P| last3 = Gardner | first3 = SL| last4 = Hugot | first4 = JP| title = Body size evolution of oxyurid (Nematoda) parasites: the role of hosts | journal= [[Oecologia]] | year= 1996| volume =  107| pages=274–282 | url= https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1082&amp;context=parasitologyfacpubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Sorci | first2 = G| title = Determinants of life-history evolution in nematodes | journal= [[Parasitology Today]] | year= 1998| volume =  14| pages=193–196 |url= https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42637076/Determinants_of_Life-history_Evolution_i20160212-1576-1hyxt2f.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522433278&amp;Signature=HpOSTvmt%2F3St5u2%2FMJuahK8ICCM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDeterminants_of_life-history_evolution_i.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhizocephala | rhizocephalan barnacles]],&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Poulin | first1 = R| last2 = Hamilton | first2 = WJ | title = Ecological correlates of body size and egg size in parasitic Ascothoracida and Rhizocephala (Crustacea) | journal= Acta Oecologica | year= 1997| volume =  18| pages=621–635 | url = https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45685938/s1146-609x_2897_2980047-120160516-31435-jwqyhj.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522433364&amp;Signature=LcVBc91CR%2F4%2BfvR8bHW69ltMOSY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEcological_correlates_of_body_size_and_e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fleas]], [[lice]], [[ticks]], parasitic [[flies]] and [[mites]], as well as herbivorous insects associated with specific host plants.&lt;ref name=Harveyetal&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Morand | first1 = S| last2 = Hafner | first2 = MS | last3 = Page| first3 = RDM| last4= Reed| first4 = DL| title = Comparative body size relationships in pocket gophers and their chewing lice | journal= [[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] | year= 2000| volume = 70 | pages= 239–249 | url= http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/37965.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = KP| last2 = Bush| first2 = SE| last3 = Clayton | first3 = DH| title = Correlated evolution of host and parasite body size: tests of Harrison’s rule using birds and lice | journal= [[Evolution]] | year= 2005| volume = 59 | pages= 1744–1753 |url = http://www.phthiraptera.info/Publications/46181.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The variability of parasite species’ body size increases with host species’ body size==
[[Robert Poulin (zoologist)|Robert Poulin]] observed that in comparisons across species, the [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] of parasite body size also increases with host body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poulin|first=R|title= Evolutionary ecology of parasites |year=2006|publisher= Princeton University Press | isbn= 9780691120850}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is self-evident that we expect greater variation coming together with greater mean body sizes due to an allometric [[power law]] scaling effect.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Xiao | first1 = X| last2 = White | first2 = EP| last3 = Hooten | first3 = MB | last4 = Durham | first4 =SL| title = On the use of log-transformation vs. nonlinear regression for analyzing biological power-laws | journal= [[Ecology (journal) | Ecology]] | year= 2011| volume = 92| pages= 1887–1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poulin referred to parasites’ increasing body size variability due to biological reasons, thus we expect an increase greater than that caused by a scaling effect.

Recently, Harnos et al. applied phylogenetically controlled statistical methods to test Harrison’s rule and Poulin’s s Increasing Variance Hypothesis in avian lice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harnos | first1 = A| last2 = Lang | first2 = Z| last3 = Petras | first3 = D | last4 = Bush | first4 =SE| last5 = Szabo | first5 =K| last6 = Rozsa | first6 =L| title = Size matters for lice on birds: coevolutionary allometry of host and parasite body size | journal= [[Evolution (journal) | Evolution]] | year= 2017| volume = 92| pages= 1887–1894 | url= http://www.zoologia.hu/list/2017%20Evolution.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results indicate that the three major families of avian lice ([[Ricinidae]], [[Menoponidae]], [[Philopteridae]]) follow Harrison’s rule, and two of them (Menoponidae, Philopteridae) also follow Poulin’s supplement to it.

==Implications==
The [[allometry]] between host and parasite body sizes constitutes an evident aspect of [[host–parasite coevolution]]. The slope of this relationship is a taxon-specific character. Parasites' body size is known to covary positively with fecundity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villa | first1 = SM| last2 = Evans | first2 = MD| last3 = Subhani | first3 = YK | last4 = Altuna | first4 = JC| last5 = Bush | first5 = SE| last6 = Clayton | first6 = DH| title = Body size and fecundity are correlated in feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera): implications for Harrison's rule | journal= [[Ecological Entomology]] (in press)| year= 2018| volume = | pages= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus it likely affects the [[virulence]] of parasitic infections as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11348">A '''hierarchical control system''' is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a [[hierarchical]] [[tree (data structure)|tree]].  When the links in the tree are implemented by a [[computer network]], then that hierarchical control system is also a form of [[networked control system]].

== Overview ==
A human-built system with complex behavior is often organized as a hierarchy. For example, a [[command hierarchy]] has among its notable features the [[organizational chart]] of superiors, subordinates, and lines of [[organizational communication]]. Hierarchical control systems are organized similarly to divide the decision making responsibility.

Each element of the hierarchy is a linked [[Node (networking)|node]] in the tree. Commands, tasks and goals to be achieved flow down the tree from superior nodes to subordinate nodes, whereas sensations and command results flow up the tree from subordinate to superior nodes. Nodes may also exchange messages with their siblings.  The two distinguishing features of a hierarchical control system are related to its layers.&lt;ref&gt;Findeisen, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

* Each higher layer of the tree operates with a longer interval of planning and execution time than its immediately lower layer.
* The lower layers have local tasks, goals, and sensations, and their activities are planned and coordinated by higher layers which do not generally override their decisions. The layers form a [[hybrid intelligent system]] in which the lowest, reactive layers are sub-symbolic. The higher layers, having relaxed time constraints, are capable of reasoning from an abstract world model and performing planning.  A [[hierarchical task network]] is a good fit for planning in a hierarchical control system.

Besides artificial systems, an animal's control systems are proposed to be organized as a hierarchy. In [[perceptual control theory]], which postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions, the organism's control systems are suggested to be organized in a hierarchical pattern as their perceptions are constructed so.

==Control system structure==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation.]]

The accompanying diagram is a general hierarchical model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control of an industrial control system.

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

== Applications ==

=== Manufacturing, robotics and vehicles ===
Among the [[robotic paradigms]] is the hierarchical paradigm in which a robot operates in a top-down fashion, heavy on planning, especially [[motion planning]].  [[Computer-aided production engineering]] has been a research focus at [[NIST]] since the 1980s.  Its Automated Manufacturing Research Facility was used to develop a five layer production control model.  In the early 1990s [[DARPA]] sponsored research to develop [[Networked control system|distributed (i.e. networked) intelligent control systems]] for applications such as military command and control systems.  NIST built on earlier research to develop its [[Real-Time Control System]] (RCS) and [[Real-time Control System Software]] which is a generic hierarchical control system that has been used to operate a [[Cellular manufacturing|manufacturing cell]], a robot [[crane (machine)|crane]], and an [[vehicular automation|automated vehicle]].

In November 2007, [[DARPA]] held the [[DARPA Grand Challenge|Urban Challenge]].  The winning entry, Tartan Racing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/GRANDCHALLENGE/Teams/TartanRacing.asp] Tartan Racing team description&lt;/ref&gt; employed a hierarchical control system, with layered mission [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[motion planning]], behavior generation, perception, world modelling, and [[mechatronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Urmson, C. et al., [http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/TechPapers/Tartan_Racing.pdf Tartan Racing: A Multi-Modal Approach to the DARPA Urban Challenge] 2007, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
[[Subsumption architecture]] is a methodology for developing [[artificial intelligence]] that is heavily associated with [[behavior based robotics]].  This architecture is a way of decomposing complicated intelligent behavior into many "simple" behavior modules, which are in turn organized into layers. Each layer implements a particular goal of the [[software agent]] (i.e. system as a whole), and higher layers are increasingly more abstract. Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers, e.g. the decision to move forward by the eat-food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest obstacle-avoidance layer. Behavior need not be planned by a superior layer, rather behaviors may be triggered by sensory inputs and so are only active under circumstances where they might be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, R. A. [http://www.ece.osu.edu/~fasiha/Brooks_Planning.html "Planning is just a way of avoiding figuring out what to do next"], Technical report, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinforcement learning]] has been used to acquire behavior in a hierarchical control system in which each node can learn to improve its behavior with experience.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Y., and Asada, M., [http://citeseer.comp.nus.edu.sg/rd/0%2C465821%2C1%2C0.25%2CDownload/http://citeseer.comp.nus.edu.sg/cache/papers/cs/24389/http:zSzzSzwww.er.ams.eng.osaka-u.ac.jpzSzpaperszSz1999zSzTakahashi99d.pdf/behavior-acquisition-by-multi.pdf Behavior Acquisition by Multi-Layered Reinforcement Learning.] In Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, pages 716-721&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Albus-node.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Constituents in a node from [[James Albus]]'s Reference Model Architecture]]
[[James Albus]], while at NIST, developed a theory for intelligent system design named the Reference Model Architecture (RMA),&lt;ref&gt;Albus, J. S. [http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/documents/albus/Ref_Model_Arch345.pdf A Reference Model Architecture for Intelligent Systems Design.] In Antsaklis, P.J., Passino, K.M. (Eds.) (1993) An Introduction to Intelligent and Autonomous Control. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993, Chapter 2, pp27-56. {{ISBN|0-7923-9267-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a hierarchical control system inspired by RCS. Albus defines each node to contain these components.
* ''Behavior generation'' is responsible for executing tasks received from the superior, parent node.  It also plans for, and issues tasks to, the subordinate nodes.
* ''Sensory perception'' is responsible for receiving sensations from the subordinate nodes, then grouping, filtering, and otherwise processing them into higher level abstractions that update the local state and which form sensations that are sent to the superior node.
* ''Value judgment'' is responsible for evaluating the updated situation and evaluating alternative plans.
* ''World Model'' is the local state that provides a [[model (abstract)|model]] for the controlled system, controlled process, or environment at the [[abstraction level]] of the subordinate nodes.
At its lowest levels, the RMA can be implemented as a subsumption architecture, in which the world model is mapped directly to the controlled process or real world, avoiding the need for a mathematical abstraction, and in which time-constrained [[reactive planning]] can be implemented as a [[finite state machine]].  Higher levels of the RMA however, may have sophisticated mathematical world models and behavior implemented by [[automated planning and scheduling]].  Planning is required when certain behaviors cannot be triggered by current sensations, but rather by predicted or anticipated sensations, especially those that come about as result of the node's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Meystel, A. M., Albus, J.S., Intelligent Systems, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 2002, pp 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Szostak has made significant contributions to the field of [[genetics]]. His achievement helped scientists to map the location of [[gene]]s in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His research findings in this area are also instrumental to the [[Human Genome Project]]. He was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]], along with [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and [[Carol W. Greider]], for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by [[telomere]]s.

== Early life ==
Szostak grew up in [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]].  Although Szostak does not speak Polish, he stated in an interview with [[Wprost]] weekly that he remembers his Polish roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wprost.pl/ar/174858/Chce-poznac-pierwsze-kroki-ewolucji/ I want to get to know first steps of evolution - Interview with Jack Szostak (in Polish)] "Moi pradziadowie wyemigrowali z Polski do USA. Ja urodziłem się w Londynie, a potem mieszkałem w Kanadzie. Niestety, nie mówię po polsku, ale chętnie przyznaje się do swoich polskich korzeni"( English translation: "My grandparents emigrated from Poland to the U.S.A. i was born in London, and then lived in Canada. Unfortunately, I do not speak Polish, but I eagerly confess to my Polish roots")&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Riverdale High School (Quebec)]] and graduated at the age of 15 with the scholars prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack W. Szostak - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/szostak-bio.html|website=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc]] in [[cell biology]] from [[McGill University]] at the age of 19. In 1970, as an undergraduate, he participated in [[The Jackson Laboratory]]'s Summer Student Program under the mentorship of Dr. Chen K. Chai. He completed his [[PhD]] in [[biochemistry]] at [[Cornell University]] (advisor Prof. [[Ray Wu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g274621682085040/|title=Ray Wu, as remembered by a former student|first=Jack|last=Szostak|date=1 February 2009|journal=Science in China Series C: Life Sciences|volume=52|issue=2|pages=108–110|doi=10.1007/s11427-009-0023-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) before moving to Harvard Medical School to start his own lab at the Sydney Farber Cancer Institute. He credits [[Ruth Sager]] for giving him his job there when he had little yet to show.  In 1984 Howard Goodman lured him away to Massachusetts General Hospital and the Department of Molecular Biology. He was granted tenure and a full professorship at Harvard Medical School in 1988.

== Research ==
Szostak has made contributions to the field of [[genetics]]. He is credited with the construction of the world's first [[yeast artificial chromosome]]. That achievement helped scientists to map the location of [[gene]]s in mammals and to develop techniques for manipulating genes. His achievements in this area are also instrumental to the [[Human Genome Project]].

His discoveries have helped to clarify the events that lead to chromosomal recombination—the reshuffling of genes that occurs during [[meiosis]]—and the function of [[telomere]]s, the specialized [[DNA]] sequences at the tips of chromosomes.

In the early 90s his laboratory shifted its research direction and focused on studying RNA enzymes, which had been recently discovered by Cech and Altman. He developed the technique of [[in vitro evolution]] of RNA (also developed independently by [[Gerald Joyce]]) which enables the discovery of RNAs with desired functions through successive cycles of selection, amplification and mutation. He isolated the first [[aptamer]] (term he used for the first time). He isolated RNA enzymes with RNA ligase activity directly from random sequence (project of [[David Bartel]]).

Currently his lab focuses on the challenges of understanding the [[origin of life]] on Earth, and the construction of artificial cellular life in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploringorigins.org/ Exploringorigins.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his research, he has delivered talks about the origin of life on Earth, as he did at the first [[Starmus Festival]] in the Canary Islands, in 2011. He subsequently joined the Starmus Board of Directors, and his 2011 lecture was published in the book ''Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/starmus-festival-and-stephen-hawking-launch-the-book-starmus-50-years-of-man-in-space-274263251.html |title=Starmus Festival and Stephen Hawking Launch the Book 'Starmus, 50... - TENERIFE, Spain, September 7, 2014 /PR Newswire UK/ |location=united kingdom, spain, russia |publisher=Prnewswire.co.uk |date=2014-09-07 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honors ==
Szostak has received several awards and honors for his contributions. He is a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and [[New York Academy of Sciences]], and is a member of the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] Collegium of Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thekf.org/kf/programs/eminentscientists/|title=Kosciuszko Foundation - American Center of Polish culture - Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry|author=|date=|website=www.thekf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received the following awards:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An organism's genes are stored within DNA molecules, which are found in chromosomes inside its cells' nuclei. When a cell divides, it is important that its chromosomes are copied in full, and that they are not damaged. At each end of a chromosome lies a "cap" or telomere, as it is known, which protects it. After Elizabeth Blackburn discovered that telomeres have a particular DNA, through experiments conducted on ciliates and yeast, she and Jack Szostak proved in 1982 that the telomeres' DNA prevents chromosomes from being broken down,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Randolph Webb''' (April 2, 1920&amp;nbsp;– December 23, 1982) was an American actor, [[television producer]], [[Television director|director]], and [[screenwriter]], who is most famous for his role as [[Joe Friday|Sgt. Joe Friday]] in the [[Dragnet (franchise)|''Dragnet'' franchise]] (which he created). He was the founder of his own production company, [[Mark VII Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert A.|last=Jones|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-20/news/mn-602_1_clean-living|title=Jack Webb Doesn't Live Here Anymore|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 20, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Barbara|last=Thornburg|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-mininni-feb06-pictures,0,5745730.photogallery|title=Former Palm Springs home of 'Dragnet' star Jack Webb|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Webb was born in [[Santa Monica, California]], on April 2, 1920, son of Samuel Chester Webb and Margaret (née Smith) Webb.&lt;ref name=mnf&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IosyS2rjwMgC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Chester+Webb%22&amp;hl=en | title=My Name's Friday: The Unauthorized But True Story of Dragnet and the Films of Jack Webb | first=Michael J. | last=Hayde | publisher=Cumberland House Publishing | location=[[Nashville, Tennessee]] | date=2001 | isbn=1-58182-190-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LDS family records show that Samuel C. Webb (b. 1890 Henrietta, Clay County, Texas, son of James H. Webb and Mary Elizabeth Gambell) married May 30, 1917, in Superior, Mineral, Montana, to Margaret Smith age 18 born Caldwell, Canyon Co, Idaho, daughter of [https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MM5G-TJS Frank J. Smith and Emma Strickland].&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] section of Los Angeles. His father left home before Webb was born, and Webb never knew him.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Webb, Laconic Sgt. Friday On TV 'Dragnet' Series, Is Dead|first=Frank J.|last=Prial|date=December 24, 1982|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/24/obituaries/jack-webb-laconic-sgt-friday-on-tv-dragnet-series-is-dead.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Webb was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith of his mother, who was of Irish and Native American descent. One of the tenants in his mother's boarding house was a former [[jazz]] musician, who began Webb's lifelong interest in jazz by giving him a recording of [[Bix Beiderbecke]]'s "At the Jazz Band Ball."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Webb lived in the parish of Our Lady of Loretto Church and attended Our Lady of Loretto Elementary School in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], where he served as an altar boy.&lt;ref name=OLL&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Lady of Loretto Elementary School: OLL Historic Timeline|url=http://www.ollalumni.com/historic-timeline.php|accessdate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905002033/http://www.ollalumni.com/historic-timeline.php|archivedate=September 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended [[Belmont High School (Los Angeles)|Belmont High School]], near downtown Los Angeles. Webb was elected student-body president of his high school. He wrote to Belmont's student body in the 1938 edition of its yearbook, ''Campanile,'' "You who showed me the magnificent warmth of friendship which I know, and you know, I will carry with me forever."&lt;ref&gt;''Campanile 1938,'' Belmont High School, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Webb attended [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|St. John's University, Minnesota]], where he studied art.
 
During [[World War II]], Webb enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps]], but he "washed out" of flight training. He later received a hardship discharge because he was the primary financial support for both his mother and grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
===Acting===
Following his discharge, he moved to [[San Francisco]], where a wartime shortage of announcers led to a temporary appointment to his own radio show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[KGO Radio]].&lt;ref name=pn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gustafson|first1=Craig|title=Pat Novak ... for Hire|journal=Nostalgia Digest|date=Spring 2009|volume=35|issue=2|pages=4–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jack Webb Show'' was a half-hour comedy that had a limited run on ABC radio in 1946. Prior to that, he had a one-man program, ''One Out of Seven,'' on KGO in which he dramatized a news story from the previous week.&lt;ref name=mnf/&gt;

By 1949, he had abandoned comedy for drama, and starred in ''[[Pat Novak for Hire]],'' a radio show originating from KFRC about a man who worked as an unlicensed private detective. The program co-starred [[Raymond Burr]]. ''Pat Novak'' was notable for writing that imitated the [[hard-boiled]] style of such writers as [[Raymond Chandler]], with lines such as: "She drifted into the room like 98 pounds of warm smoke. Her voice was hot and sticky--like a furnace full of marshmallows."

Webb's radio shows included ''[[Johnny Madero, Pier 23]],'' ''Jeff Regan, Investigator,'' ''Murder and Mr. Malone,'' ''Pete Kelly's Blues,'' and ''One Out of Seven.'' Webb provided all of the voices on ''One Out of Seven,'' often vigorously attacking racial prejudice.

Webb's most famous motion-picture role was as the combat-hardened [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] [[drill instructor]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]] in the 1957 film ''[[The D.I. (film)|The D.I.]],'' with [[Don Dubbins]] as a callow Marine [[private (rank)|private]]. Webb's hard-nosed approach to this role, that of Drill Instructor [[Technical Sergeant]] James Moore, would be reflected in much of his later acting. But ''The D.I.'' was a box-office failure.

Webb was approached to play the role of Vernon Wormer, Dean of Faber College, in ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]],'' but he turned it down, saying "the movie didn't make any damn sense"; [[John Vernon]] ultimately played the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Food Fight! ‘Fat, Drunk, and Stupid,’ by Matty Simmons|first=Peter|last=Keepnews|date=June 1, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/books/review/fat-drunk-and-stupid-by-matty-simmons.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dragnet'' and stardom ===
Webb had a featured role as a crime-lab technician in the 1948 film ''[[He Walked by Night]],'' based on the real-life murder of a [[California Highway Patrol]]man by [[Erwin Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;''Crazy Like A Fox.'' The Los Angeles ''Times,'' June 2, 1947; ''Man Continues to Fight Police Despite Wounds.'' The Los Angeles ''Times,'' December 21, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced in [[semidocumentary]] style with technical assistance provided by Detective Sergeant Marty Wynn of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD). ''He Walked By Night's'' thinly veiled fictionalized recounting of the 1946 Walker crime spree gave Webb the idea for ''Dragnet:'' a recurring series based on real cases from LAPD police files, featuring authentic depictions of the modern police detective, including methods, mannerisms, and technical language.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Jack, and Ellroy, James. ''The badge: true and terrifying crime stories that could not be presented on TV, from the creator and star of Dragnet.'' New York: Thunder's Mouth Press; {{ISBN|1-56025-688-5}} (2005), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

With much assistance from Sgt. Marty Wynn and legendary LAPD chief [[William H. Parker (police officer)|William H. Parker]], ''Dragnet'' premiered on NBC Radio in 1949 and ran till 1957. It was also picked up as a television series by [[NBC]], which aired episodes each season from 1952 to 1959. Webb played Sgt. [[Joe Friday]] and [[Barton Yarborough]] co-starred as Sgt. Ben Romero. After Yarborough's death, [[Ben Alexander (actor)|Ben Alexander]] joined the cast.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Webb Dedicates Dragnet Radio Episode 133 "The Big Sorrow" to the memory of Barton Yarborough "who created and portrayed the role of Sargent Ben Romero." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCcPPiondX4)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jack Webb Harry Morgan Dragnet 1968.JPG|thumb|left|Webb with [[Harry Morgan]] in the program's second, and best-known, version, in 1968]]
Webb was a stickler for attention to detail. He believed viewers wanted "[[realism (arts)|realism]]" and tried to give it to them. Webb had tremendous respect for those in law enforcement. He often said, in interviews, that he was angry about the "ridiculous amount" of abuse to which police were subjected by the press and the public. Webb was also impressed by the long hours, the low pay, and the high injury rate among police investigators of the day, particularly in the LAPD, which had by then acquired a notorious reputation for jettisoning officers who had become ill or injured in the line of duty; in  James Ellroy and his book  ''The badge: true and terrifying crime stories that could not be presented on TV, from the creator and star of "Dragnet"'', one of Erwin Walker's victims, LAPD detective LT Colin Forbes, was among those whose experiences were so noted.&lt;ref&gt;Webb and Ellroy, p. 103: "One of many examples of selfless service was that of LAPD detective Lt. Colin Forbes, who went to work each day carrying a .45-caliber slug next to his spine after being shot by none other than [[Erwin Walker]]. After his health was ruined from years of stakeouts and violent altercations with criminals, Lt. Forbes would be pensioned off at a mere $300 a month by the LAPD at the age of 46."&lt;/ref&gt;

In announcing his vision of ''Dragnet,'' Webb said he intended to perform a service for the police by showing them as low-key working-class heroes. ''Dragnet'' moved away from earlier portrayals of the police in shows such as ''Jeff Regan'' and ''Pat Novak,'' which had often shown them as brutal and even corrupt. ''Dragnet'' became a successful television show in 1952. [[Barton Yarborough]] died of a heart attack in 1951, after filming only two episodes, and Barney Phillips (Sgt. Ed Jacobs) and Herbert Ellis (Officer Frank Smith) temporarily stepped in as partners. Veteran radio and film actor Ben Alexander took over the role of jovial, burly Officer Frank Smith. Alexander was popular and remained a cast member until the show's cancellation in 1959. In 1954, a full-length feature-film adaptation of the series was released, starring Webb, Alexander, and [[Richard Boone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046931/|title=Dragnet|date=September 4, 1954|publisher=|accessdate=March 26, 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television version of ''Dragnet'' began with this narration by [[George Fenneman]]: "Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent." Webb would intone, "This is the city: Los Angeles, California." He would then make a historical or topical point, describe his duties, his partner, and superior on the episode. The radio series had a similar opening, though Webb, as Friday, did not give a unique LA-themed opening. Webb then set the plot by describing a typical day and then led into the story. "It was Wednesday, March 19th. It was cool in Los Angeles. I was at headquarters, working narcotics...." At the end of each show, Fenneman repeated his opening narration, revised to read: "The story you have just seen is true. The names were changed to protect the innocent."

A second announcer, [[Hal Gibney]], usually gave dates when and specify courtrooms where trials were held for the suspects, announcing the trial verdicts after commercial breaks. Many suspects shown to have been found guilty at the end were also shown as having been confined to the [[San Quentin State Prison|California State Prison]] at San Quentin. Webb frequently recreated entire floors of buildings on sound stages, such as the police headquarters at Los Angeles City Hall and a floor of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]].''

In ''Dragnet's'' early days, Webb continued to appear in movies, notably as the best friend of [[William Holden]]'s character in the 1950 [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]].'' In 1950, Webb appeared alongside future 1960s ''Dragnet'' partner [[Harry Morgan]] in the [[film noir]] ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]].'' In contrast to the pair's straight-arrow image in ''Dragnet,'' here Webb played a vicious [[card sharp]] in ''Dark City'' and Morgan a punch-drunk ex-fighter. Also in 1950, Webb appeared in ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]],'' the film in which Marlon Brando made his film debut.  Both actors played paraplegics undergoing rehabilitation at a veterans' hospital. In a subplot, Webb's character, a cynical intellectual, is fleeced of his life savings by a woman who feigns romantic interest.

In 1951, Webb introduced a short-lived radio series, ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (radio series)|Pete Kelly's Blues]],'' in an attempt to bring the music he loved to a broader audience. That show became the basis for a 1955 [[Pete Kelly's Blues (1955 film)|movie of the same name]]. In 1959, a television version was made. Neither was very successful. Pete Kelly was a cornet player who supplemented his income from playing in a nightclub band by working as a private investigator.

==1960s==
In 1963, Webb took over from [[William T. Orr]] as executive producer of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Bros.]] detective series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]].'' He brought about wholesale changes in the program and retained only [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]], in the role of private detective Stuart Bailey. Gone were co-stars [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] and [[Edd Byrnes]] and the lively series set. The altered program began with Bailey quietly entering an elevator to an upper floor of a bleak office building. The story lines were far different from those of the first five years of the series. The result was a disaster, and critics accused Webb of being out of touch with the younger generation, a perception that ''Dragnet'' subsequently did nothing to correct. Ratings fell, and ''77 Sunset Strip'' was cancelled before the end of the sixth season. [[John Gavin]]'s ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]],'' a light-hearted [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, filled the remaining three months of the Friday-night time slot vacated on ABC by ''77 Sunset Strip.''

Meanwhile, Webb teamed with actor [[Jeffrey Hunter]] to form Apollo Productions. They produced a failed television series, ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]],'' with Hunter in the title role. In the summer of 1963, Webb pushed ''Temple Houston'' to production. The series was loosely based on the life of the frontier lawyer [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of the legendary [[Texas|Texan]] [[Sam Houston]]. The series was added to the NBC schedule after the planned drama, ''The Robert Taylor Show,'' based on case files of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare]], was suddenly disbanded after making four episodes. Under orders from Webb, ''Temple Houston'' episodes were put together in just two or three days each, something previously thought impossible in television production. Work began on August 7, 1963, with the initial airing set for September 19. [[Jimmy Lydon]], a former [[child actor]], adult actor, and a [[Television production|television producer]] with Warner Bros. at the time, recalled that Webb told the staff, "Fellas, I just sold ''Temple Houston.'' We gotta be on the air in four weeks; we can't use the pilot, we have no scripts, no nothing--do it!"&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt; Lydon recalled the team having worked around the clock to get ''Temple Houston'' on the air. Co-producer [[William Conrad]] directed six episodes, two scripts simultaneously on two different soundstages at WB. "We bicycled Jeff (series star Jeffrey Hunter) and Elam (supporting star [[Jack Elam]]) between the two companies, and Bill shot 'em both in four-and-a-half days. Two complete one-hour shows!" recalled Lydon.&lt;ref name=wtha&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967," ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]],'' Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Temple Houston'' ended after its 26-week run. In a 1965 interview with ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]],'' Hunter described the situation:{{quote|In the first place, we had no time to prepare for [the series]. I was notified on July 17 to be ready to start August 7 for an October air date. When we reached the screen we did not have a single segment ready. It was done so fast the writers never got a chance to know what it was all about. We all wanted to follow the line indicated by the [[Television pilot|pilot]] film, which we thought would make a charming series. NBC, however, favored making it serious.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Spiro, "Happy in Hollywood," ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]],'' July 4, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===1967: ''Dragnet'' returns===
Shortly after leaving his position at Warner Bros., Webb teamed with [[Universal Television]] to begin work on a new ''Dragnet'' series. A pilot telefilm, based on the [[Harvey Glatman]] serial killings, was produced in 1966 for NBC, with Webb's Sgt. Joe Friday joined by Harry Morgan as Officer Bill Gannon. (Webb had tried to get Ben Alexander to reprise his role as Frank Smith, but he was unable to get Alexander to leave the ABC series ''[[Felony Squad]].'')

The new ''Dragnet'' premiered as a midseason replacement series on January 12, 1967, and aired until April 16, 1970. To distinguish it from the original series, the year of production was added to the title (''Dragnet 1967,'' ''Dragnet 1968,'' etc.). The revival emphasized crime prevention and outreach to the public. Its attempts to address the contemporary youth-drug culture (such as "[[The LSD Story]]" episode, guest-starring [[Michael Burns (actor and historian)|Michael Burns]] as Benjamin John "Blue Boy" Carver, voted 85th-best TV episode of all time by ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[TV Land]]) have led certain episodes on the topic to achieve cult status due to their strained attempts to be "with-it", such as Joe Friday grilling "Blue Boy" by asking him, "You're pretty high and far out, aren't you? What kind of kick are you on, son?" Don Dubbins, who had acted alongside Webb in ''The D.I.'' in 1957, was another featured actor in Mark VII Limited programs beginning in the 1960s.

In 1968, Webb and his production partner [[R.A. Cinader]] launched ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC. A spinoff of ''Dragnet,'' ''Adam-12'' starred [[Martin Milner]] and [[Kent McCord]] as a pair of LAPD beat cops, and followed their escapades while on patrol. Running till 1975, for a total of seven seasons, ''Adam-12'' was Webb's second-longest running television series, with the eight seasons recorded by the original ''Dragnet'' being the longest.

Also in 1968, Webb and [[Johnny Carson]] performed a sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that has since become known as the "Copper Clapper Caper" sketch. Webb, in character as Joe Friday, was working on the case of a robbery at a school-bell factory. Carson played the owner of the factory and victim of the theft, which consisted of each bell being relieved of its clapper (the device that makes the bell ring). The sketch's dialogue consisted of Webb and Carson discussing the situation in deadpan style and using alliteration and tongue twisters to describe the incident, each word having either a "c" or "cl" sound at the beginning. Both Webb and Carson tried desperately not to lose composure, but both did, near the  end of the sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjquGpmgwOo | title=Jack Webb and Johnny Carson | publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and 1980s==
In 1970, Webb decided to bring an end to ''Dragnet'' and cease acting to focus on expanding Mark VII Limited's production profile.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1971, Webb entered the world of district attorneys and federal government work with two series. The first, ''[[The D.A. (1971 TV series)|The D.A.]]'', starred [[Robert Conrad]] and Harry Morgan as a pair of Los Angeles County ADAs, with Conrad playing a junior ADA and Morgan his superior. The second, ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury|O'Hara, United States Treasury]],'' was a co-production of Webb and [[David Janssen]], the former star of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' and future star of ''[[Harry O]],'' for [[CBS]] (a rare non-NBC Mark VII effort) and featured Janssen as a Nebraska county sheriff-turned-[[United States Treasury Department]] agent. Neither series lasted very long, as ''The D.A.,'' Webb's last 30-minute series, was cancelled after 15 episodes and ''O'Hara'' ended after 22.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Later in the 1971–72 season, Webb and Cinader launched ''[[Emergency!]]'', a spin-off of ''Adam-12'', which focused on the fictional Station 51 Rescue Squad of [[Los Angeles County Fire Department|L.A. County Fire Department]], which also featured one of the first [[paramedic]] units, and its work in conjunction with the emergency room staff of the fictional Rampart General Hospital.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb cast his ex-wife, [[Julie London]], as well as her second husband and ''Dragnet'' ensemble player [[Bobby Troup]], as head nurse Dixie McCall and Dr. Joe Early, respectively, with [[Randolph Mantooth]] and [[Kevin Tighe]] playing paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto and [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] playing Dr. Kelly Brackett, Rampart's Chief of Emergency Medicine.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

''Emergency!'' ran as part of NBC's Saturday-night lineup for six entire seasons, and it was a popular series, sometimes winning its time slot against CBS's popular Saturday-night comedy block, which included ''[[All in the Family]].''{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The series came to an end in 1977, but it spawned a series of telefilms that ran until 1979.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Webb's company and Universal also contracted with animator Fred Calvert to produce a spin-off Saturday-morning cartoon show for NBC titled ''[[Emergency +4]],'' which ran for three seasons (the last in reruns) and featured the paramedics Gage and DeSoto assisted by four youngsters and their three pets.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

''Emergency!'' was Webb's last sustained success. Of the remaining series his company produced, the only two that lasted longer than one season were ''[[Hec Ramsey]],'' a two-season component of the ''[[NBC Mystery Movie]]'' wheel series that featured former ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' star [[Richard Boone]] as a pioneering [[forensic scientist]] in the Old West,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and ''[[Project UFO]]'', an anthology based on the investigations into UFOs as compiled by [[Project Bluebook]] that also ran for two seasons beginning in 1978.

In 1987, [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]] starred in a movie parody (and homage) to Webb, titled ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', along with Harry Morgan, who reprised his role from the television series as William Gannon, who had by now become a captain of detectives. The comedy film was written and directed by [[Tom Mankiewicz]], in his directorial debut. Aykroyd acted out the role of Joe Friday, described as the nephew of the original series lead, while Hanks co-starred as Detective Officer Pep Streebeck, Friday's new smart-alecky and streetwise partner.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Personal life==
Webb's personal life was better defined by his love of [[jazz]] than his interest in police work. He had a collection of more than 6,000 jazz recordings.&lt;ref name=mnf/&gt; His lifelong interest in the [[cornet]] allowed him to move easily in the jazz culture, where he met singer and actress [[Julie London]]. They married in 1947 and had daughters Stacy (1950–1996) and Lisa, born 1952. They divorced in 1954.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He was married three more times after that, to Dorothy Towne for two years beginning in 1955, to former [[Miss USA]] [[Jackie Loughery]] for six years beginning in 1958, and to his longtime associate, Opal Wright, for the last two years of his life.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Stacy Webb authorized and collaborated on a book, ''Just the Facts, Ma'am; The Authorized Biography of Jack Webb, Creator of Dragnet, Adam-12, and Emergency!,'' of which Daniel Moyer and Eugene Alvarez were the primary authors. It was published in 1999. Stacy did not live to see the publication of the book, having been killed in a collision with a California Highway Patrol car three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/STACY+WEBB%2C+DAUGHTER+OF+ACTRESS%2C+LATE+ACTOR.-a083969282 |title=STACY WEBB, DAUGHTER OF ACTRESS, LATE ACTOR. | publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Jack Webb Grave.JPG|thumb|120px|The grave of Jack Webb at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], in the Hollywood Hills.]]
Despite his string of short-lived series in the late 1970s, Webb still kept trying to recapture his previous success and decided to bring ''Dragnet'' back to television for a third series in 1983. Five scripts had been produced and [[Kent McCord]], one of the stars of ''Adam-12,'' was cast as Joe Friday's new partner.

Webb died on December 23, 1982, of an apparent heart attack at age 62.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He is interred at Sheltering Hills Plot 1999, [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles, and was given a funeral with full Los Angeles police honors. On Webb's death, Chief [[Daryl Gates]] announced that badge number 714, which was used by Joe Friday in ''Dragnet,'' would be retired. Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] ordered all flags lowered to half staff in Webb's honor for a day, and Webb was buried with a replica LAPD badge bearing the rank of sergeant and the number 714.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Jack Webb has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], one for radio (at 7040 Hollywood Boulevard) and the other for television (at 6728 Hollywood Boulevard). In 1992, Webb was posthumously inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Webb|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/jack-webb|website=Television Academy|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacob Cornelis Matthieu''' ('''J. C. M.''') '''Radermacher ''' (1741 – 24 December 1783) was a Dutch botanist and author.

Radermacher was born in [[The Hague]], [[Holland]]. He was an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] ([[Jakarta]]) as well as a talented naturalist.  Born into an influential Dutch family, his father was [[Jacob Cornelis Radermacher]] (1700-1748), who was treasurer-general to the prince.  His uncle and his nephew were members of the Board of Directors of the VOC.  In 1757, then only sixteen years old, he had traveled to Indonesian to work as a merchant for the VOC. On 21 May 1761 Jacob married Margaretha Sophia Verijssel.  In 1762 Radermacher created a [[Freemasons|Freemasonic circle]] in Batavia becoming the first Freemasonic lodge in [[Asia]].  In 1763 he returned to Holland to continue his studies, and graduated in [[law]] at [[Harderwijk]]. After graduation on 13 June 1766 he established himself as a lawyer in [[Arnhem]].  After a short time, Radermacher made the decision to return to Batavia. On 20 December 1766 with his wife Margaretha and two sons Frans Reinier and Johannes Cornelis, they boarded the ship ''Tulpenburg'' bound for Indonesia. His youngest son, Johannes Cornelis, still an infant, died within one month of their departure. By 1776, Radermacher was promoted by the VOC to title of "Extra-Ordinair Council of India".

During his years in Batavia, Radermacher was a staunch promoter of the arts and sciences in the Far East.  On 24 April 1778 he founded the [[Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences]] ("Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en etenschappen"). He also donated a substantial amount of writings and collections to start the museum.  During this time he also catalogued a significant amount of flora and fauna of the islands of [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sumatra]].  The trees of the genus "[[Radermachera]]" are named for him.

By 1781 Radermacher was named Commissioner Concerning the Fleet and the Army, and Common Council of India.  After the death of his first wife, he married Bataviase Anna Bosch.  For health reasons in 1783, he requested permission to return to Holland.  However, while en route home in the Indian Ocean on 24 December, there was a mutiny on board the ship and Radermacher was murdered.

==Family==
Jafar b. Ali b. Muḥammad ( 226-271 A.H.) was the son of the tenth Imam, [[Ali al-Hadi]] and the brother of eleventh Imam [[Hasan al-Askari]]. Also, he had one older brother, [[Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi|Muhammad]] who died before his [[Ali al-Hadi|father's]] death.&lt;ref name="The Essence of Islam"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reza |first1=Saiyed Jafar |title=The Essence of Islam |publisher=Concept Publishing Company, 2012 |isbn=9788180698323 |page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Essence_of_Islam.html?id=bqwrA5KlYxwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Challenge==
===After Ali al-Hadi of death===
After the death of Ali al-Hadi, Jafar b. Ali claimed Imamate and he founded followers.&lt;ref name="The Essence of Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reza |first1=Saiyed Jafar |title=The Essence of Islam |publisher=Concept Publishing Company, 2012 |isbn=9788180698323 |page=255 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Essence_of_Islam.html?id=bqwrA5KlYxwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;The biographers attribute to him as Kazzab (liar).&lt;ref name="Misbah-uz-Zulam"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Imam |first1=Sayyid Imdad |title=Misbah-uz-Zulam, Roots of the Karbala’ Tragedy |publisher=Ansariyan Publications - Qum |isbn=978-964-219-103-1 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Misbah-uz-Zulam-Roots-Karbala-Tragedy/dp/B00G17R3CY |ref=claimed}}&lt;/ref&gt;Muhammadyyas and [[Twelver]] believes that he was immoral.&lt;ref name="The Essence of Islam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Modarressi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Modarressi |first1=Hossein |title=Crisis and Consolidation in the Formative Period of Shi'Ite Islam: Abu Ja'Far Ibn Qiba Al-Razi and His Contribution to Imamite Shi'Ite Thought (English and Arabic Edition) |publisher=Darwin Press, Incorporated (June 1, 1993) |isbn=978-0878500956 |url=https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/2752/Crisis_and_Consolidation_in_the_Formative_Period_of_Shi'ite_Islam_Abu_Ja'far_ibn_Qiba_al-Razi_and_His_Contribution_to_Imamite_Shi'ite_Thought_-_Hossein_Modarres.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is unexpected that Shia considers Imam as one who acts contrary to the orders of religion but it seems that these reports are somewhat correct.&lt;ref name="Al-majlisi"/&gt; For his followers in defense of him, said: "Jafar's personality changed comparison when he was young."&lt;ref name="Modarressi"/&gt;He tried to be al-Askari in jail, though he always failed in his efforts.&lt;ref name="Misbah-uz-Zulam"/&gt;Jafar b. Ali's followers became famous Ja’fariyyas and al-Askari's followers were known Twelver.&lt;ref name="The Essence of Islam"/&gt; 
===After Hasan al-Askari of death===
After the death of Hasan al-Askari, even though,al-Askari's mother was still alive, Jafar requested his property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Momen |first1=Moojan |title=An Introduction to Shiʻi Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism |publisher=Yale University Press; New edition edition (September 10, 1987) |isbn=978-0300035315 |page=161–163. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Shi%CA%BBi_Islam.html?id=B0OL5Z8S-V0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that his brother never had a [[Mahdi|son]].&lt;ref name="Misbah-uz-Zulam"/&gt;On the other hand, according to the [[Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi]], he hid his son, for fear of his brother, Jafar, who was coveted to his property.&lt;ref name="Al-majlisi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-majlisi |first1=Allamah Muhammad Baqir |title=Amazon.com Barnes&amp;Noble.com Books-A-Million IndieBound Find in a library All sellers »  Get Textbooks on Google Play Rent and save from the world's largest eBookstore.

Later, between Twelver, he became famous to Ja’far, The Liar (Kazzab) and when he repented, he got the title of Tawwab (the repentant).&lt;ref name="The Essence of Islam2"/&gt;

'''Japanese submarine ''I-180''''' (originally '''''I-80''''') was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] (''KD7'' sub-class) [[cruiser submarine]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Ordered in 1939 under the [[4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1939)|4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]], she was laid down at the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] on 17 April 1941 as ''I-80''. Launched on 7 February 1942, she was renumbered ''I-180'' on 20 May 1942, and completed on 15 January 1943.&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-180.htm |title=IJN Submarine I-180: Tabular Record of Movement |first1=Bob |last1=Hackett |first2=Sander |last2=Kingsepp |work=combinedfleet.com |year=2012|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service history==
At the end of March 1943, with her sister ships ''I-177'' and ''I-178'', ''I-180'' departed from [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] to patrol off the east coast of Australia. There she torpedoed and sank the Australian merchant ship {{SS|Wollongbar|1922|2}} on 29 April 1943, the Norwegian merchant ship {{SS|Fingal||2}} on 5 May 1943, and damaged the Australian merchant vessels ''Ormiston'' and ''Caradale'' on 12 May 1943.&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt;

In mid-July 1943 ''I-180'' was diverted from her patrol to [[Kolombangara]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], arriving in the aftermath of [[Battle of Kolombangara|the battle]] and rescuing 21 survivors from the [[light cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Jintsu||2}}.&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt;

On 12 October 1943, the Allies launched an [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|air offensive against Rabaul]], with 349 aircraft attacking the port and airfields. During the attack ''I-180'' sustained a direct hit which wrecked her superstructure and prevented her from diving. She sailed on the surface back to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] for repairs and was operational again early the next year.&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt;

In late March 1944 she sailed from [[Ominato]] to patrol off the [[Aleutian Islands]]. On 19 April she sank the [[liberty ship]] SS ''John Straub'',&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt; and almost certainly also sank the Soviet cargo ship ''Pavlin Vinogradov'' on 22 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/bibl/paperno/for_65_engl.htm |title=Losses of the Soviet Transport Fleet |first=Alla |last=Paperno |work=The Unknown World War II in the North Pacific |year=2011 |accessdate=20 January 2012}} (Translated by Alexey Barmin &amp; Dmitriy Tegin)&lt;/ref&gt;

Late on 25 April, she was detected while surfaced by the destroyer escort {{USS|Gilmore|DE-18|6}} south-west of [[Chirikof Island]]. The submarine promptly [[crash dive]]d, and over the next three hours ''Gilmore'' laid down three barrages of Mark 10 "[[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]]" [[anti-submarine mortar]] shells without result, and then two patterns of [[depth charge]]s, before finally seeing a heavy underwater explosion at 01:12 on 26 April&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt; at {{Coord|55|9|57|N|155|40|0|W|scale:500000|display=inline,title}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wikimapia.org/16178023/Wreck-of-HIJMS-I-180 |title=Wreck of HIJMS I-180 |work=wikimapia.org |year=2011 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1944 ''I-180'' was presumed lost, along with all people on board dead, and on 10 July 1944 was removed from the Navy List.&lt;ref name="combinedfleetI-180"/&gt;

'''Jeitinho''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒejˈtʃĩɲu|br}}, literally "little way") is finding a way to accomplish something by [[bending the rules|circumventing or bending the rules]] or social conventions. Most times it is harmless, made for basic ordinary opportunistic advantages, as [[gatecrashing]] a party just to get free food and beverage. But sometimes it is used for questionable, serious violations, where an individual can use [[Appeal to emotion|emotional resources]], [[blackmail]], family ties, promises, rewards or money to obtain (sometimes illegal) favors or to get advantage. Some people see it as a typically [[Brazil]]ian method of social navigation, but people forget to mention that this expression also comes from the necessity associated to a lack of resources and help. Most Brazilians have to be creative and invent new simpler ways to do things they need, as living.&lt;ref&gt;"Popular cinema in Brazil, 1930-2001", by Stephanie Dennison, Lisa Shaw, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6499-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQsHp5Re3IoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=malandragem&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rCb6TezzNofniAK4vtDoBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=malandragem&amp;f=false section "Malandragem and jeitinho"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "jeitinho" is the [[Inho|diminutive form]] of ''jeito'', which comes from the expression ''[[wikt:dar um jeito|dar um jeito]]'', meaning "to find a way". It implies the use of resources at hand, as well as personal connections, and creativity. ''Como é que ele conseguiu os bilhetes?'' How did he get the tickets? ''Ele deu um jeito.'' He found a way.

One way to understand jeitinho is as a ''recurso de esperteza'', which means a resource used by ''espertos'' — savvy, cunning, or sly individuals who use common sense and prior knowledge, as well as naturally gifted [[intelligence]] in their thought processes. It implies that a person is "[[Know-how|street-smart]]", but not necessarily "book-smart." It typically also connotes [[opportunism]], [[pragmatism]], and [[Social network|using one's networks]], with little regard for the law, the state or for persons outside of one's own circle or family.

==Scholarly discussion==
Brazilian scholar and historian [[Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda]] connects the concept of jeitinho to Brazil's mixed heritage and [[Iberia]]n ancestry in his book "Roots of Brazil" (Raízes do Brasil). In this work, jeitinho is tied to the idea that a typical Brazilian is a friendly, cordial man, prone to making initial decisions based on his emotions instead of his reason, and that this feature can be found everywhere in the country, from the highest offices of government to the most common situations of everyday life. Jeitinho is also observed in Rio de Janeiro's carnival industry by the scholar [[Roberto DaMatta]] in his book "Carnavais, Malandros e Heróis" (Carnival, Rogues and Heroes. Notre Dame Press). Da Matta sees jeitinho in the creative culture of carnival.

==Similarity to other terms==
The terms "malandro" and "[[malandragem]]", which can be roughly translated as "rogue" and "roguishness", are very similar to the "jeitinho", but these terms imply a greater degree of breaking the rules, as opposed to [[bending the rules]].

Elsewhere in Latin America, similar concepts include ''[[viveza criolla]]'' in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], and ''[[malicia indígena]]'' in [[Colombia]].

Bartlett was reported to have lived to "extreme old age."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Perry | first = Arthur Latham | title = Williamstown and Williams College | publisher = Norwood Press | year = 1899 | page = 534 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3MWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment'''&lt;ref name=AsianScientist-2011-11-09&gt;Asian Scientist, [http://www.asianscientist.com/topnews/phobos-grunt-yinghuo-1-technical-glitch-2011/ "Phobos-Grunt Mission Carrying Yinghuo-1 Space Probe Suffers Technical Glitch"], Srinivas Laxman, 9 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ('''LIFE''' or '''Phobos LIFE'''&lt;ref&gt;The Planetary Society, [http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/life/201109.html "Phobos LIFE Ready to Launch"], Bruce Betts, September 2011 (accessed 11-11-11)&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[interplanetary mission]] developed by the [[Planetary Society]]. It consisted of sending selected microorganisms on a three-year interplanetary round-trip in a small capsule aboard the Russian [[Fobos-Grunt]] spacecraft in 2011, which was a failed sample-return mission to the Martian moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. The Fobos-Grunt mission failed to leave Earth orbit,&lt;ref name=Novosti-2011-12-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=UT-11-12-13&gt;Universe Today, [http://www.universetoday.com/91766/russian-space-program-prepares-for-phobos-grunt-re-entry/ "Russian Space Program Prepares for Phobos-Grunt Re-Entry"], David Warmflash, 13 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and was destroyed.

The goal was to test whether selected [[organism]]s can survive an as yet undetermined number of years in [[outer space|deep space]] by flying them through interplanetary space. The experiment would have tested one aspect of [[transpermia]], the hypothesis that [[life]] could survive space travel, if protected inside rocks blasted by impact off one planet to land on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=David |last1=Warmflash |first2=Neva |last2=Ciftcioglu |first3=George |last3=Fox |first4=David S. |last4=McKay |first5=Louis |last5=Friedman |first6=Bruce |last6=Betts |first7=Joseph |last7=Kirschvink |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/phobosdeimos2007/pdf/7043.pdf |title=Living interplanetary flight experiment (LIFE): An experiment on the survivalability of microorganisms during interplanetary travel |conference=Workshop on the Exploration of Phobos and Deimos |date=November 5–7, 2007 |location=[[Ames Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zak1 /&gt;

==Precursor==
Prior to the ''Phobos LIFE'' experiment, a precursor ''LIFE'' prototype was successfully flown in 2011 aboard the final flight of [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]], [[STS-134]]. Known as the '''Shuttle-LIFE''' (also '''LIFE'''&lt;ref&gt;Astrobiology.com, [http://www.astrobiology.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=33436 "LIFE Launches Aboard Endeavour's Last Flight"], The Planetary Society, 27 April 2011 (accessed 11-11-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) experiment.&lt;ref name=Space.com-11-11-11&gt;SPACE.com, [http://www.space.com/13596-phobos-grunt-life-experiment-salvaged.html "Salvaging Science from Stricken Mars Moon Probe: A Scientist's View"], David Warmflash, 11 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Astrobiology.com, [https://archive.is/20120718041939/http://www.astrobiology.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=33568 "LIFE Ready to Launch on Endeavour's Last Flight"], The Planetary Society, 16 May 2011 (accessed 11-11-11)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The experiment==
The project includes representatives of all [[Three-domain system|three domains of life]]: [[bacteria]], [[eukaryota]] and [[archaea]].  The capsule was transporting 10 types of organisms in 30 self-contained samples, i.e., each in triplicate.  In addition, one or more natural native soil samples were flown in their own self-contained capsule.&lt;ref name=planetary-faq /&gt; The Phobos-Soil sample return mission was the only attempted biological science mission that would have returned to Earth from deep space, far beyond the protection of Earth’s magnetic field; sending biological samples through deep space is therefore a much better test of interplanetary survivability than sending the samples on a typical Earth-orbiting flight.&lt;ref name=planetary-faq /&gt;

The project was being done in collaboration with the [[Russian Space Research Institute]], the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University|Moscow State University]], the [[American Type Culture Collection]] (ATCC), and the Institute for Aerospace Medicine in Germany.

=== Specimens ===
Three fundamental guidelines governed the selection of the organisms:&lt;ref name=planetary-organisms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/innovative_technologies/life/organisms.html |title=Ten Hardy Organisms Selected for the LIFE Experiment: Who will Survive the 3-Year Space Odyssey? |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |accessdate=2 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120141404/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/innovative_technologies/life/organisms.html |archivedate=January 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the organisms selected represent the [[Three-domain system|three domains of life]] – [[eukaryote]], [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Second, the organisms are very well studied (e.g., having their [[genome]] sequenced and studied in many other experiments) to make it possible to accurately assess the effects of the long exposure to space. If they had already been studied in space conditions so much the better, since it would enable researchers to pinpoint precisely how organisms were affected by the years-long exposure to the interplanetary environment. Finally, a strong preference was given to organisms that appear to stand the best chance of surviving the journey. These are [[extremophile]]s, organisms that thrive in conditions that would kill the vast majority of Earthly creatures.

The 10 'passenger' organisms selected are listed below:&lt;ref name=planetary-organisms /&gt;

[[Bacteria]]&lt;ref name=bacteria /&gt;
*''[[Bacillus safensis]]''
**Discovered in [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]'s 'clean' room: Spacecraft Assembly Facility.&lt;ref name="The Planetary Report"&gt;The Planetary Report, Volume XXIX, number 2, March/April 2009, "We make it happen!

*[[Animal]]ia – [[Tardigrade]]s ('water bears')
**Have survived vacuum and radiation in low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=tardigrades /&gt;

===Capsule design===
The mass of the Bio-Module on board the Fobos-Grunt spacecraft was 100&amp;nbsp;grams or less.  The design is a short [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]. The bio-module provided 30 small tubes (3 millimeters in diameter) for individual microbe samples. It also accommodated a native sample of bacteria – derived from a [[permafrost]] region on [[Earth]] – within a cavity 26&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref name=planetary-faq /&gt;

==Mission failure==
The module passed stress tests including a shake test with vibrations at frequencies to 1,100&amp;nbsp;Hz and an impact test of 4,000 g, designed to simulate the potential impact of the capsule on Earth.&lt;ref name=planetary-20081015 /&gt; The LIFE experiment was launched on November 8, 2011 on board the [[Fobos-Grunt#Launch|Fobos-Grunt]], however, the spacecraft failed to depart Earth orbit due to a programming error,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Stephen | last = Clark | title = Russia: Computer crash doomed Phobos-Grunt | date = 6 February 2012 | url = http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1202/06phobosgrunt/ | work = Spaceflight Now | accessdate =29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Programmers are to be blamed for the failure of Phobos mission | date = 31 January 2012 | url = http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c142/330393.html | work = ITAR-TASS News Agency | accessdate =29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fell back to Earth in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=Novosti-2011-12-13&gt;RIA Novosti, [http://en.ria.ru/science/20111213/170212896.html "Phobos-Grunt mission ‘impossible,’ says chief designer"], 13 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The module was not recovered.&lt;ref name="Phobos LIFE Reflections"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00003327/ |title=Bruce Betts: Reflections on Phobos LIFE |author=Emily Lakdawalla |date=January 13, 2012 |work=The Planetary Society Blog |accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is seeking out future exploratory opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atomicwriter.com/blog4/2011/12/10/update-on-phobos-wheres-a-shuttle-when-you-need-it/ "Update on Phobos – Where’s a shuttle when you need it?"] Victor Grippi – The Atomic Writer.

'''Magog''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], generally as an enemy and foil personality of [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]]. He first appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #1 (May 1996), and was created by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]. In 2009, Magog was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 75th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html Magog is number 75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509075950/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/75.html |date=May 9, 2009 }} [[IGN]]. Retrieved 10-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Kingdom Come'', Magog's lack of conventional heroic qualities of idealism puts him at odds with Superman's morality.  After taking over Superman's place within the world's superhero community, his reckless actions with other would-be superheroes ultimately caused a nuclear disaster in [[Midwestern United States]]; overwhelmed by guilt, he then realizes that Superman was right and seeks to atone for his crimes. In 2008, a parallel universe version of the character is introduced in DC Comics' main continuity; his destiny seemingly parallel to the original version's and some fear him due to their awareness of his counterpart's actions, yet granting him a benefit of doubt to prove himself as a true hero differs from his doppelgänger.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
Magog debuted in the first issue of the [[Elseworlds]] mini-series ''Kingdom Come'' in May 1996. Within this possible future, he represents the violent, modern-style heroes who come into conflict with the classic, moralistic heroes of the past.

''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' is a [[graphic novel]] rife with [[bible|biblical]] references. [[Gog and Magog]] are both biblical characters from the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Book of Ezekiel]], and the [[Book of Revelation]] as well as names that appear in a variety of subsequent legends. In addition to taking his name from the [[Old Testament]], Magog represents the [[Golden calf]], that is, a [[idolatry#False idol|false idol]].{{deadlink|date=August 2013}}&lt;ref name=keystothekingdom&gt;[http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html "Keys to the Kingdom" - Magog] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050110010727/http://www.captionbox.net/keystokingdom/magog.html |date=January 10, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's appearance was based on that of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].&lt;ref name=WizadXtra&gt;Brick, Scott (March 2007). "Alex Ross". ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra!]]''. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ComicBookResources&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonah |last=Weiland |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=7045 |title=Ten Years Later: Reflecting on "Kingdom Come" with Alex Ross |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=May 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magog's character design was based on superhero design trends of the time, especially Cable, and Cable's creator [[Rob Liefeld]] himself. [[Alex Ross]] stated, "As I remember, Mark originally told me, 'Make him look like everything we hate in modern superhero design.'"&lt;ref name=keystothekingdom /&gt; Ross has gone into more detail in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]]:

{{cquote|That's a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing from was — really only two key designs of Rob's — the design of Cable. I hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character — the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what's with all the guns? But the thing is, when I put those elements together with the helmet of [[Shatterstar]] — I think that was his name — well, the ram horns and the gold, suddenly it held together as one of the designs that I felt happiest with in the entire series.&lt;ref name=WizadXtra/&gt;&lt;ref name=ComicBookResources/&gt;}}

===After ''Kingdom Come''===
The character was featured in ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3.  Introduced in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #12 as '''Lance,''' the character was introduced as Magog in ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18.

Following the appearance in ''Justice Society of America'', the character received his own eponymous title, written by [[Keith Giffen]] and penciled by [[Howard Porter (artist)|Howard Porter]]. Giffen commented on the series and his reaction to character:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/050929-Giffen-Magog.html |title=Why Magog? - Keith Giffen on the New Series |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=May 29, 2009  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I guess they wanted to see if Magog had legs. I'll be honest with you, when they first called me up and said, "Do you want to take a crack at Magog?," I had no idea what I was going to do here. I mean, the character was not among my top 10... Then I actually sat down and started reading it and getting into this guy's head. And I found his voice. Now I love the book. I love the book and I love the character. I'm having a lot of fun with it....what struck me was that, underlying all the glitz and the armor and all, this guy is still a soldier. He's David Reid, lance corporal. So I thought about how I could apply a real hardcore military mindset to a superhero and get into his head.}}

[[Scott Kolins]] took over the series with issue #11 as both writer and artist. However, the planned five-issue story was cut to two when the series was canceled with issue #12 because of low sales, but the story would be finished in a double-sized issue of ''Justice Society of America Special'' #1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Renaud |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=26342 |title=Scott Kolins Talks "Magog"  |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===''Kingdom Come''===
Magog, "The New Man of Tomorrow," is a hero with a rising career in the last days of [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]]'s declining popularity. His true origins are never revealed in the story. His most controversial act at the time was killing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who was in custody for the murder of [[Lois Lane]] and dozens of other members of the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.  Magog then surrenders to Superman and the authorities. When put on trial for murder, Magog is acquitted, the feeling being that it is time for psychotic super-villains like the Joker to be killed off rather than preserve the belief of heroes of Superman's generation that all life is sacred no matter what the crime or risk of [[recidivism]].

Superman publicly denounces Magog and the acquittal, prompting Magog to challenge him to a fight. Superman, disgusted with the verdict, refuses the challenge and instead goes into self-imposed exile. During the next ten years, a new generation of heroes following Magog's violent approach begins to arise. Magog himself begins operating with a team of heroes known as the Justice Battalion (a group composed of characters based on the heroes of [[Charlton Comics]], who also inspired Alan Moore's "[[Watchmen]]"). During a one-sided and unnecessarily brutal battle with the villainous [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], Magog's teammate [[Captain Atom]] is critically injured, causing him to explode with the force of an atomic bomb. This disaster leaves [[Kansas]] completely destroyed, over a million people killed, and much of America's heartland is covered in deadly radiation, destabilizing the American economy.

Magog and [[Metal Men|Alloy]] are the only survivors of the Kansas blast. This cataclysm is the event which finally draws Superman and many of the heroes of his generation out of retirement, thus leading to the story's inevitable generational conflict. Initially, Magog is considered the most wanted and dangerous criminal in the world and is hunted by Superman's new [[Justice League]]. They finally confront him as he tries with little success to put some small order back amongst the ruins of Kansas. Superman goads him with the remark "You must be proud (of this destruction)", which results in Magog lashing out at the Man of Steel, blaming him for the present crisis since he would not adapt to modern ways. After the attack fails to harm Superman, Magog quietly surrenders. It becomes apparent that he is traumatized by his experience and seeks forgiveness.

He is taken into custody by the League and held in their special prison where he and others are lectured about their violent ways, although Magog appears to spend most of his time remorsefully in his cell. However, the jail's walls are pierced by a brainwashed [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and in the battle that follows, Magog noticeably avoids fighting and just sticks to saving as many lives as he can. At the end of ''Kingdom Come'', Magog retires to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], where he is seen caring for the crippled Japanese superheroine Tokyo Rose, and giving Swastika a hard clout when he fails to show proper respect to [[Wonder Woman]] and the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]. In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] novelization, it is revealed that Magog even becomes the Dean of Students at [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].

===''Justice Society of America''===
[[Lance Corporal]] '''David Reid''', great-grandson of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], was with the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] platoon assigned to halt the looting of the National Museum of Iraq during the Iraq War. Reid tracked one of the looters and found an artifact that was a stone fragment of the Old God Gog. Upon touching it, Reid blacked out, waking up three weeks later to find that he was now filled with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma energy]] and that a mark shaped like the [[Eye of Providence]] had opened up on his left arm. With the aid of a pointed hand-held device (which earned him the nickname '''"Lance"'''), Reid was able to project focused blasts of energy.

Because the modern Justice Society of America tries to keep the legacies of former heroes alive, and because Franklin Roosevelt was credited with bringing the JSA together in the first place, the Society asked Reid to join them.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #12 (March 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Justice Society encounters the Third World survivor [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]], several of their number have themselves "healed" by him. When Gog sets out to save a village from a rogue military attack, the JSA assist him. During the conflict, Lance is struck by an RPG missile and killed. Gog stands over Lance and brings him back to life, replacing his ruined left arm and right eye with gold metal. Gog then dubs Reid Magog.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #18 (September 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Thankful for Gog's gift, Magog then leads half of the Justice Society in support of Gog, using his staff to send the members who don't agree with Gog's ways back to the Justice Society's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19 (October 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Society discovers that Gog is rooting himself to the Earth, which would cause the planet's destruction if he were ever to leave, and seek to destroy Gog to prevent this. Magog protects Gog until he sees him remove the gifts he gave to the Justice Society and use the corpses of [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]]'s wife and [[Alan Scott]]'s [[Jade (comics)|daughter]] to torture them. Magog then turns on Gog as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21 (November 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Gog orders Magog to serve him or have his gift of life taken from him. Magog refuses, saying that he would rather die than live without freedom. The Society finally manages to topple Gog, and Magog beheads him with his staff. After Gog's head is removed from his body, his effects on the Justice Society are reversed, except for Magog, who for some reason remains in his altered state.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22 (December 2008). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, David leaves the JSA, returning to his family's farm.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23 (January 2009). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; He later returns to the team, but his military training causes him to chafe under the Society's comparatively lax security and combat ethics.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29 (July 2009). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; After the team barely survives a mass supervillain attack and returns to the brownstone to find Mister Terrific had been stabbed by [[Jeremy Karne|All-American Kid]], Magog greatly voices his disdain for the Society's methods, even getting into a brief altercation with the original [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #30 (August 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''JSA All-Stars''===
After the split that occurs in the Justice Society, Magog forms and joins the newly formed All-Stars (a team composed mostly of the Justice Society's younger heroes), alongside Power Girl, and helps lead the team along with her. The team has a new ongoing series beginning December 2, 2009, written by Matt Sturges and illustrated by Freddie Williams II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/comics/jsa-all-stars-2009/jsa-all-stars-1|title=JSA ALL-STARS #1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solo series===
In September 2009, a Magog solo series was launched, written by Keith Giffen and illustrated by Howard Porter. The series, while loosely tied into the events of ''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) and the ''JSA All-Stars'' spin-off series, focuses on Magog as his own character. As such, Giffen gave Magog his own rogues gallery as well as explored Magog's origin, powers, and relationships. The series was canceled with issue #12 because of low sales.

The first story arc revolves around Magog's origins and his fight against a mysterious weapons-development group called Flashpoint, run by the warden of Haven Prison (first introduced in the pages of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''), D.P. Macklin. Magog meets his mother, a high-ranking woman called Alba, Firstborn of the Thirty-Three and Duchess of Blighted Albion, and his friend Axel, a former soldier who owns a gasoline station and auto repair shop who has created a souped-up search engine called Mirage, and teaches a young waitress named Lauren self-defense techniques after noticing that she is being beaten regularly by the man she lives with. Additionally, Magog meets and fights a once-rich, now-deformed homeless man known as Miasma, who was the leader of an underground city.&lt;ref&gt;''Magog'' #1–6 (November 2009–April 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Magog attacks Haven's underground Flashpoint facilities, D.P. Macklin contacts the [[Justice Society of America]] and frames Magog for the ensuing prison break. After a lengthy skirmish with both prisoners and his fellow JSA members, Magog is officially kicked out of the All-Stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America Annual'' #2 (April 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent events, Axel has surmised that David Reid may, in fact, be possessed by an extradimensional entity, which is the root of his powers. Magog is skeptical of such allegations, and a visit with [[Zatanna]] has turned up no evidence to support Axel's theory thus far.&lt;ref&gt;''Magog'' #7 (May 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final issue, Magog faces his old friend Eric, who is now the cyborg warrior N.I.L.8., along with his group who are using Gog's technology to bring destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Magog'' #12 (August 2010. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magog finds he has been controlled by the cult of Gog. When the Justice Society learn of Gog's technology, they arrive to save the planet. The JSA free Magog from the cult's control and he destroys N.I.L.8. Magog seemingly sacrifices himself when he finds the heart of Gog's technology and defeats it. He awakens in Albion with his enemy Kiera at his side. He refuses to be a pawn any longer and walks away.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice Society of America Special'' #1 (November 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Generation Lost''===
{{Main|Justice League: Generation Lost}}
Following the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', murderer and former [[Justice League International]] founder [[Maxwell Lord]] is returned to life and uses his psychic abilities to erase his existence from the memories of all but a handful of people. Lord then uses his powers to influence several high-ranking members of the military into believing [[Captain Atom]] should be apprehended for alleged wrongdoings. Magog is called in to restrain Atom in the event that he tries to flee, but ultimately fails as the hero defeats him and escapes.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (June 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this event, Maxwell Lord is informed by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] that he has been resurrected in order to prevent Magog from instigating a massive war involving Earth's metahumans.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brightest Day]]'' #7 (August 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Max then sees a vision of himself killing a distraught Magog with Magog's own staff as Magog begs for mercy.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #7 (August 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Max later sees a vision of the future where a team led by Magog attacks [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]. Parasite's absorption of Captain Atom causes an explosion that destroys everything within a large radius and annihilates over a million people (tying into the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' future).&lt;ref name="jlgl10"&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #10 (September 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, Magog is seen talking to Max who instructs Magog to find and kill Captain Atom.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #9 (September 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Max upgrades Magog's staff, giving him "the right tools for the job".&lt;ref name="jlgl10"/&gt; Magog then locates the JLI at [[OMAC (comics)|OMAC]] factory and attacks Captain Atom.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #12 (October 2010). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In their battle, Captain Atom manages to convince Magog he's being used and Magog remembers Max's existence; however, Max is on hand using his powers to force Magog to kill himself with his own staff, then makes everyone in the vicinity believe Captain Atom killed Magog.&lt;ref name=jlgl13&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #13 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; After Max escapes and undoes the global mindwipe, he released a statement onto the Internet exonerating Captain Atom of the deaths in Chicago, saying far worse would have happened if he had not intervened.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #24 (April 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Superman/Wonder Woman: Casualties of War''==
[[The New 52]] reboot of Magog occurred in Superman/Wonder Woman # 13–17. Superman and Wonder Woman are now a romantic couple. They repel an invasion of parademons on Metropolis, but there are civilian casualties, including David Reid's mother (which he blames on them). Five years later, the two heroes are fighting two super-villains. A new hero, Wonderstar, a.k.a. David Reid who has amnesia, aids them. He seems to idolize Superman and Wonder Woman. Later in issue #14, Wonderstar's powers go out of control. Superman and Wonder Woman restrain him until a magic portal appears in the sky, dropping a golden staff weapon that looks like a two-pronged trident. Wonderstar touches it and becomes Magog. Circe the witch, Wonder Woman's archenemy, had cast spells to turn David Reid into Magog and make his wish come true (revenge on Superman and  Wonder Woman). In Superman/Wonder Woman #17, Circe's desire is for Diana to suffer and watch the death of Superman. Circe captures the couple and gloats, but when Wonder Woman outsmarts her, Circe retreats from Superman through a magic portal admitting defeat. Magog is defeated by Wonder Woman and deprived of his now-powerless staff, reverting him to a 10-year-old boy.

==Collected editions==
*''Magog: Lethal Force'' (Collects ''Magog'' #1–5)

==Powers and abilities==
Reid possesses great amounts of plasma energy within him, which were originally focused into energy blasts by the device on his left arm. After his resurrection as Magog, his left arm is now metal and his energy blasts are focused through a staff given to him by Gog. He also possesses enhanced strength and endurance as the original Magog did. The staff was later upgraded by Max Lord to emit a form of radiation that harmed Captain Atom.&lt;ref name=jlgl13 /&gt; He is capable of flight, as well as teleportation of himself and others, though this last ability has not been seen since Gog's death. Keith Giffen, however, has stated that much of his power remains unexplored for the time being. When powered up, Magog is granted enhanced vision in his blind eye (despite the fact it keeps the appearance of a pupiless orb) and is able to switch to infrared or tap into more exotic wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;''Magog'' #3 (November 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magog is also able to take on a more normal appearance, with skin (or a close approximation of it) magically covering his right arm. However, as David Reid, Magog is half-blind and scarred.&lt;ref&gt;''Magog'' #1 (September 2009). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, David Reid was a member of [[Team 7 (comics)|Team 7]], an elite unit of soldiers led by [[Grifter (Wildstorm)|Grifter]]. David and most of his teammates were ultimately killed during a botched attack on a terrorist training camp.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance]]'' #2 (July 2011). [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
David Reid appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Failsafe", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. He is depicted as a soldier who fought under [[General Wade Eiling]] during an alien invasion that took out the members of the Justice League. The events of this episode turned out to be a mind-training exercise conducted by [[Martian Manhunter]] that went horribly wrong.

==Career==
[[File:Margueritedelamotte.jpg|thumb|De La Motte in 1921.]]

She developed a close friendship with Fairbanks and his wife, actress [[Mary Pickford]].
Her career as an actress slowed dramatically at the end of the silent film era of the 1920s. She did continue acting in bit parts through the sound era and made her final appearance in the 1942 film ''[[Overland Mail (film)|Overland Mail]]'' opposite both Noah Beery, Sr. and [[Noah Beery, Jr.]], as well as [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]]

Rivkin whom she later divorced after four years of marriage.&lt;ref name=cut/&gt; Her cousin, [[Clete Roberts]], was an American war correspondent and journalist, who appeared in two episodes of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H*]]'' in the 1970s.
 
===Later years===
After her film career ended, De La Motte worked as an inspector in a southern California war plant during [[World War II]]. Later she came to [[San Francisco, California]], where she worked in the [[Red Cross]] office.&lt;ref name=cut&gt;{{cite book|last=Brettell|first=Andrew|author2=King, Noel|author3=Kennedy, Damien|author4= Imwold, Denise|others=Leonard, Warren Hsu; von Rohr, Heather|title=Cut!: Hollywood Murders, Accidents, and Other Tragedies|publisher=Barrons Educational Series|year=2005|page=71|isbn=0-7641-5858-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Medusa''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|dj|uː|z|ə|,_|-|s|ə}}; Μέδουσα "guardian, protectress")&lt;ref&gt;Probably the feminine present participle of ''medein'', "to protect, rule over" (''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''; compare [[Medon]], [[Medea]], [[Diomedes]], ''etc.''). If not, it is from the same root, and is formed after the participle. ''[[OED]]'' 2001 revision, ''s.v.''; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2365585 ''medein''] in [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[monster]], a [[Gorgon]], generally described as a winged human female with living venomous snakes in place of hair. Those who gazed upon her face would [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turn to stone]]. Most sources describe her as the daughter of [[Phorcys]] and [[Ceto]],&lt;ref&gt;as in [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 270, and Pseudo-Apollodorus ''[[Bibliotheke]]'', 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; though the author [[Hyginus]] makes her the daughter of Gorgon and Ceto.&lt;ref&gt;"From Gorgon and Ceto, Sthenno, Eurylae, Medusa".&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hesiod]] and [[Aeschylus]], she lived and died on an island named Sarpedon, somewhere near [[Cisthene (Mysia)|Cisthene]]. The 2nd-century BCE novelist Dionysios Skytobrachion puts her somewhere in [[Libya]], where [[Herodotus]] had said the [[Berbers]] originated her myth, as part of [[Traditional Berber religion|their religion]].

Medusa was beheaded by the hero [[Perseus]], who thereafter used her head, which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bullfinch |first=Thomas |url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/tbulfinch/bl-tbulfinch-age-15.htm |title=Bulfinch Mythology&amp;nbsp;– Age of Fable&amp;nbsp;– Stories of Gods &amp; Heroes |quote=...and turning his face away, he held up the Gorgon's head.

In [[classical antiquity]] the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the [[apotropaic magic|evil-averting device]] known as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]''.

==Classical mythology==
[[File:Close up of Gorgon at the pediment of Artemis temple in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Archaic Greece|archaic]]
Medusa wearing the belt of the intertwined snakes, a fertility symbol, as depicted on the west [[pediment]] of the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis Temple in Corfu]], exhibited at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]]]]

The three [[Gorgon]] sisters—Medusa, [[Stheno]], and [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]]—were all children of the ancient marine deities [[Phorcys]] (or "Phorkys") and his sister [[Ceto]] (or "Keto"), [[chthonic]] monsters from an [[wikt:archaic|archaic]] world.  Their genealogy is shared with other sisters, the [[Graeae]], as in [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which places both trinities of sisters far off "on Kisthene's dreadful plain":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Near them their sisters three, the Gorgons, winged&lt;br /&gt;
With snakes for hair— hatred of mortal man—&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While ancient Greek vase-painters and relief carvers imagined Medusa and her sisters as having monstrous form, sculptors and vase-painters of the fifth century began to envisage her as being beautiful as well as terrifying. In an ode written in 490 BC [[Pindar]] already speaks of "fair-cheeked Medusa".&lt;ref&gt;(Pythian Ode 12). Noted by Marjorie J. Milne in discussing a [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured vase]] in the style of [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]], ca. 450–30 BC, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; Milne noted that "It is one of the earliest illustrations of the story to show the Gorgon not as a hideous monster but as a beautiful woman. Art in this respect lagged behind poetry." (Marjorie J. Milne, "Perseus and Medusa on an Attic Vase" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' New Series, '''4'''.5 (January 1946, pp. 126–130) 126.p.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a late version of the Medusa myth, related by the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (''Metamorphoses'' 4.770), Medusa was originally a ravishingly beautiful maiden, "the jealous aspiration of many suitors," but because [[Poseidon]] had raped her in [[Athena]]'s temple, the enraged Athena transformed Medusa's beautiful hair to serpents and made her face so terrible to behold that the mere sight of it would turn onlookers to stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=umsythkvbmMC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Medusa+raped+pregnant+by+poseidon#v=onepage&amp;q=Medusa&amp;f=false|page=30|author=Philip Freeman|title=Oh My Gods: A Modern Retelling of Greek and Roman Myths|isbn=9781451609981|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ovid's telling, Perseus describes Medusa's punishment by [[Minerva]] (Athena) as just and well earned.

[[File:Seleukos I Nikator Æ 750607.jpg|thumb|left|Coins of the reign of [[Seleucus I Nicator]] of Syria, (312–280 BC)]]
In most versions of the story, she was beheaded by the [[Greek hero|hero]] [[Perseus]], who was sent to fetch her head by King [[Polydectes]] of [[Serifos|Seriphus]] because Polydectes wanted to marry his mother. The gods were well aware of this, and Perseus received help. He received a mirrored shield from [[Athena]], gold, winged sandals from [[Hermes]], a sword from [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hades]]'s [[Cap of invisibility|helm of invisibility]]. Since Medusa was the only one of the three Gorgons who was mortal, Perseus was able to slay her while looking at the reflection from the mirrored shield he received from Athena. During that time, Medusa was pregnant by [[Poseidon]]. When Perseus beheaded her, [[Pegasus]], a winged horse, and [[Chrysaor]], a giant wielding a golden sword, sprang from her body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' 281; Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2. 42, ''et al.'' Harris, Stephen L. and Gloria Platzner. ''Classical Mythology: Images and Insights.'' 2nd ed. (New York: Mayfield Publishing), 1998. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jane Ellen Harrison]] argues that "her potency only begins when her head is severed, and that potency resides in the head; she is in a word a mask with a body later appended... the basis of the [[Gorgoneion]] is a [[cult (religion)|cultus object]], a ritual mask misunderstood."&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Odyssey]]'' xi, [[Homer]] does not specifically mention the [[Gorgon]] Medusa:

{{quote|Lest for my daring [[Persephone]] the dread,&lt;br /&gt;
From Hades should send up an awful monster's grisly head.}}

[[File:Sousse mosaic Gorgon 03.JPG|thumb|right|The Medusa's head central to a mosaic floor in a [[tepidarium]] of the Roman era. Museum of Sousse, Tunisia]]
Harrison's translation states "the Gorgon was made out of the terror, not the terror out of the Gorgon."&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;

According to [[Ovid]], in northwest Africa, Perseus flew past the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], who stood holding the sky aloft, and transformed him into stone when he tried to attack him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Lancelyn Green]] suggests in his ''Tales of the Greek Heroes'' written for children that Athena used the aegis against Atlas.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, the [[coral (precious)|coral]]s of the [[Red Sea]] were said to have been formed of Medusa's blood spilled onto seaweed when Perseus laid down the petrifying head beside the shore during his short stay in [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Ethiopia]] where he saved and wed his future wife, the lovely princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]. Furthermore, the poisonous vipers of the [[Sahara]], in the ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.1515, Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 4.770 and Lucan's'' [[Pharsalia]]'' 9.820, were said to have grown from spilt drops of her blood. The blood of Medusa also spawned the [[Amphisbaena]] (a horned dragon-like creature with a snake-headed tail).

Perseus then flew to Seriphos, where his mother was being forced into marriage with the king, Polydectes, who was turned into stone by the head. Then Perseus gave the Gorgon's head to Athena, who placed it on her shield, the [[Aegis]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, "Perseus".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some classical references refer to three Gorgons; Harrison considered that the tripling of Medusa into a trio of sisters was a secondary feature in the myth:
{{quote|The triple form is not primitive, it is merely an instance of a general tendency... which makes of each woman goddess a trinity, which has given us the [[Horae]], the [[Charites]], the [[Semnai]], and a host of other triple groups. It is immediately obvious that the Gorgons are not really three but one + two. The two unslain sisters are mere appendages due to custom; the real Gorgon is Medusa.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt;}}

==Modern interpretations==
[[File:Glittica romana, medusa, sardonice, II-III sec dc..JPG|thumb|A Roman cameo of the 2nd or 3rd century]]

===Historical===
A number of early classics scholars interpreted the myth of the Medusa as a quasi-historical – "based on or reconstructed from an event, custom, style, etc., in the past",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/quasihistorical|title=the definition of quasihistorical|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "sublimated" memory of an actual invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Robert|title=The Greek Myths|year=1955|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0241952743|pages=17, 244|quote=A large part of Greek myth is politico-religious history. Bellerophon masters winged Pegasus and kills the Chimaera. Perseus, in a variant of the same legend, flies through the air and beheads Pegasus's mother, the Gorgon Medusa; much as Marduk, a Babylonian hero, kills the she-monster Tiamat, Goddess of the Seal. Perseus's name should properly be spelled Perseus, 'the destroyer'; and he was not, as Professor Kerenyi has suggested, an archetypal Death-figure but, probably, represented the patriarchal Hellenes who invaded Greece and Asia Minor early in the second millennium BC, and challenged the power of the Triple-goddess. Pegasus had been sacred to her because the horse with its moon-shaped hooves figured in the rain-making ceremonies and the installment of sacred kings; his wings were symbolical of a celestial nature, rather than speed.&lt;br/&gt;Jane Harrison has pointed out (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion) that Medusa was once the goddess herself, hiding behind a prophylactic Gorgon mask: a hideous face intended to warn the profane against trespassing on her Mysteries. Perseus beheads Medusa: that is, the Hellenes overran the goddess's chief shrines, stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks, and took possession of the sacred horses—an early representation of the goddess with a Gorgon's head and a mare's body has been found in Boeotia. Bellerophon, Perseus's double, kills the Lycian Chimaera: that is, the Hellenes annulled the ancient Medusan calendar, and replaced it with another.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellen Harrison|first=Jane|title=Prolegomena: To The Study Of Greek Religion|origyear=1908|date=June 5, 1991|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691015147|pages=187–188|url=https://archive.org/details/prolegomenatost01harrgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Joseph Campbell]]:

{{quote|The legend of Perseus beheading Medusa means, specifically, that "the Hellenes overran the goddess's chief shrines" and "stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks", the latter being apotropaic faces worn to frighten away the profane.

That is to say, there occurred in the early thirteenth century B.C. an actual historic rupture, a sort of sociological trauma, which has been registered in this myth, much as what Freud terms the latent content of a neurosis is registered in the manifest content of a dream: registered yet hidden, registered in the unconscious yet unknown or misconstrued by the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Masks of God, Vol. 3: Occidental Mythology.|last=Campbell|first=Joseph|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1968|isbn=978-0140194418|location=London|pages=152–153. "We have already spoken of Medusa and of the powers of her blood to render both life and death. We may now think of the legend of her slayer, Perseus, by whom her head was removed and presented to Athene. Professor Hainmond assigns the historical King Perseus of Mycenae to a date c. 1290 B.C., as the founder of a dynasty; and Robert Graves–whose two volumes on The Greek Myths are particularly noteworthy for their suggestive historical applications–proposes that the legend of Perseus beheading Medusa means, specifically, that "the Hellenes overran the goddess's chief shrines" and "stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks", the latter being apotropaic faces worn to frighten away the profane. That is to say, there occurred in the early thirteenth century B.C. an actual historic rupture, a sort of sociological trauma, which has been registered in this myth, much as what Freud terms the latent content of a neurosis is registered in the manifest content of a dream: registered yet hidden, registered in the unconscious yet unknown or misconstrued by the conscious mind. And in every such screening myth–in every such mythology {that of the Bible being, as we have just seen, another of the kind}–there enters in an essential duplicity, the consequences of which cannot be disregarded or suppressed."}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Psychoanalysis===
[[File:Medusa.jpg|thumb|left|''Medusa'' by [[Arnold Böcklin]], circa 1878]]

In 1940, [[Sigmund Freud]]'s "Das Medusenhaupt ([[Medusa's Head]])" was published posthumously. In Freud's interpretation: "To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|date=Summer 2017|title=Medusa's Head|url=|journal=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.|publisher=The Hogarth Press|volume= XVIII|pages=273.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this perspective the 'ravishingly beautiful' Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father's retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.

[[Archetypal literary criticism]] continues to find [[Psychoanalysts|psychoanalysis]] useful. Beth Seelig analyzes Medusa's punishment from the aspect of the crime of having been raped rather than having willingly consented in Athena's temple as an outcome of the goddess' unresolved conflicts with her own father, [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Seelig, B.J. (2002). [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ijp.083.0895a "The Rape of Medusa in the Temple of Athena: Aspects of Triangulation"]. ''International Journal of Psycho-Analysis'', 83:895–911.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
[[File:Medusa by Carvaggio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Medusa (Caravaggio)|Medusa]]'', by [[Caravaggio]] (1595)]]

In the 20th century, [[feminists]] reassessed Medusa's appearances in literature and in modern culture, including the use of Medusa as a [[logo]] by fashion company [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gevrilgroup.com/versace/gianni-versace-medusa-logo/|title=Versace Medusa Head Logo|author=|date=|website=gevrilgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, A. (1994). ''Archetypal empowerment in poetry: Medusa, Aphrodite, Artemis, and bears : a gender comparison''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-20865-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, A. G. (1997). [http://worldcat.org/oclc/39703715 "Endless the Medusa: a feminist reading of Medusan imagery and the myth of the hero in Eudora Welty's novels."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garber, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Medusa" itself is often used in ways not directly connected to the mythological figure but to suggest the gorgon's abilities or to [[connotation|connote]] malevolence; despite her origins as a beauty, the name in common usage "came to mean monster."&lt;ref&gt;Garber, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Female Rage: Unlocking Its Secrets, Claiming Its Power'' by Mary Valentis and Anne Devane notes that "When we asked women what female rage looks like to them, it was always Medusa, the snaky-haired monster of myth, who came to mind ... In one interview after another we were told that Medusa is 'the most horrific woman in the world' ... [though] none of the women we interviewed could remember the details of the myth."&lt;ref name="Wilk 217-218"&gt;Wilk, pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medusa's visage has since been adopted by many women as a symbol of female rage; one of the first publications to express this idea was a feminist journal called ''Women: A Journal of Liberation'' in their issue one, volume six for 1978. The cover featured the image of the Gorgon Medusa by Froggi Lupton, which the editors on the inside cover explained "can be a map to guide us through our terrors, through the depths of our anger into the sources of our power as women."&lt;ref name="Wilk 217-218"/&gt;

In issue three, Fall 1986 for the magazine ''Woman of Power'' an article called ''Gorgons: A Face for Contemporary Women's Rage,'' appeared, written by Emily Erwin Culpepper, who wrote that "The Amazon Gorgon face is female fury personified. The Gorgon/Medusa image has been rapidly adopted by large numbers of feminists who recognize her as one face of our own rage."&lt;ref name="Wilk 217-218"/&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] analyses the passage from horrorism to compassion in the figure of the Medusa through [[Adriana Cavarero]]'s philosophy and [[Bracha Ettinger]]'s art and Matrixial theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Griselda Pollock]], "From Horrorism to Compassion" in G. Pollock (ed.) ''Visual Politics of Psychoanalysis'', London: I.B.Tauris, 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-78076-316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nihilism===
[[File:Vincenzo gemito, medusa, 1911 02.JPG|thumb|An embossed plaque in the [[Art Nouveau]] style from 1911]]

Medusa has sometimes appeared as representing notions of [[scientific determinism]] and [[nihilism]], especially in contrast with [[romanticism|romantic idealism]].&lt;ref name="Myth and Literary History"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bogan/medusamyth.htm |title= Medusa in Myth and Literary History |accessdate= 2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petersen&gt;Petersen, Per Serritslev. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v026/26.1petersen.pdf "Jack London's Medusa of Truth."] ''Philosophy and Literature'' 26.1 (2002). pp. 43–56.&lt;/ref&gt; In this interpretation of Medusa, attempts to avoid looking into her eyes represent avoiding the ostensibly depressing reality that the universe is meaningless. [[Jack London]] uses Medusa in this way in his novel ''[[The Mutiny of the Elsinore (novel)|The Mutiny of the Elsinore]]'':&lt;ref&gt;London, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I cannot help remembering a remark of [[Benjamin De Casseres|De Casseres]]. It was over the wine in Mouquin's. Said he: "The profoundest instinct in man is to war against the truth; that is, against the Real. He shuns facts from his infancy. His life is a perpetual evasion. Miracle, chimera and to-morrow keep him alive. He lives on fiction and myth. It is the Lie that makes him free. Animals alone are given the privilege of lifting the veil of Isis; men dare not. The animal, awake, has no fictional escape from the Real because he has no imagination. Man, awake, is compelled to seek a perpetual escape into Hope, Belief, Fable, Art, God, Socialism, Immortality, Alcohol, Love. From Medusa-Truth he makes an appeal to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya-Lie]]." |[[Jack London]]|''The Mutiny of the Elsinore''}}

Medusa has been depicted in several works of art, including:
* Medusa on the breastplate of [[Alexander the Great]], as depicted in the [[Alexander Mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]'s [[House of the Faun]] (c. 200 BC)
* Medusa column bases of [[Basilica Cistern]] in Constantinople.

*[[:Image:Dalí.Perseo.JPG|''Perseus'']] (bronze sculpture) by [[Salvador Dalí]]

Medusa remained a common theme in art in the nineteenth century, when her myth was retold in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''Mythology''. [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' [[List of paintings by Edward Burne-Jones#The Perseus Cycle (1875-90s)|Perseus Cycle]] of paintings and a drawing by [[Aubrey Beardsley]] gave way to the twentieth century works of [[Paul Klee]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre et Gilles]], and [[Auguste Rodin]]'s bronze sculpture ''[[:File:Zürich - Kunsthaus - Rodin's Höllentor IMG 7384 ShiftN.jpg|The Gates of Hell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilk, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flags and emblems===
The head of Medusa is featured on some regional symbols. One example is that of the flag and emblem of [[Sicily]], together with the three legged ''[[Flag of Sicily|trinacria]]''. The inclusion of Medusa in the center implies the protection of the goddess [[Athena]], who wore the Gorgon's likeness on her [[aegis]], as said above. Another example is the coat of arms of [[Dohalice]] village in the [[Czech Republic]].

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Medusa and Gorgons|Greek mythology in popular culture}}
&lt;!--this is not the place to add a bulleted list--&gt;
The petrifying image of Medusa makes an instantly recognizable feature in popular culture. Medusa has been featured in several works of fiction, including video games, movies, cartoons and books. In particular, the designer [[Versace]]'s symbol is reflected through the Medusa-head symbol. It was chosen because she represents beauty, art, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rosenthalusa.com/index.php/fuseaction/elwin/elwinID/1680/elwinBG/ffffff/elwinOffset/10/elwinAlt/Versace%20Medusa.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215224507/http://www.rosenthalusa.com/index.php/fuseaction/elwin/elwinID/1680/elwinBG/ffffff/elwinOffset/10/elwinAlt/Versace%20Medusa.htm |archivedate=2012-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Acosta was born in [[El Paso, Texas]] to Manuel and Juanita (''née'' Fierro) Acosta, from Mexico and El Paso, respectively. Oscar was the third child born but second to survive childhood. He had an older brother, Roberto, born in 1934.&lt;ref name="birthcertificate"/&gt; After the family moved to California, the children were raised in the small [[San Joaquin Valley]] rural community of [[Riverbank, California]], near [[Modesto, California|Modesto]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt;  Acosta's father was drafted during [[World War II]].

After finishing high school, Acosta joined the [[U.S. Air Force]]. Following his discharge, Acosta worked his way through [[Modesto Junior College]]. He went on to [[San Francisco State University]] where he studied creative writing,&lt;ref name="cdlib"/&gt; becoming the first member of his family to get a college education. He attended night classes at [[San Francisco Law School]] and passed the California Bar exam in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oscar Acosta - #38731|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/38731|publisher=[[State Bar of California]]|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Acosta began working locally as an antipoverty attorney for the East Oakland [[Legal Aid]] Society.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

In 1968, Acosta moved to East Los Angeles and joined the [[Chicano Movement]] as an activist attorney, defending [[Chicano]] groups and activists. He represented the Chicano 13 of the [[East L.A. walkouts]], [[Rodolfo Gonzales]], members of the [[Brown Berets]], and other residents of the East L.A. barrio. His controversial defenses earned him the ire of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], who often followed and harassed him. Local law enforcement and the FBI linked Acosta to an organization called the Chicano Liberation Front, which claimed responsibility for numerous bombings in southern and northern California.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1970, Acosta ran for sheriff of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] against [[Peter J. Pitchess]], and received more than 100,000 votes. During the campaign, he was jailed for two days for [[contempt of court]]. He vowed that if elected, he would do away with the Sheriff's Department as it was then constituted. Known for loud ties and a flowered attaché case with a Chicano Power sticker, Acosta lost to Pitchess' 1.3 million votes, but did beat Everett Holladay, Monterey Park Chief of Police.

In 1972, Acosta published his first novel, ''[[Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo]],'' about a lawyer fighting for the rights of a marginalized people. In 1973, Acosta published ''[[The Revolt of the Cockroach People]]'', a fictionalized version of the 1970 [[Chicano Moratorium]] as well as an account of Ruben Salazar's death.

==Friendship with Hunter S. Thompson==

In the summer of 1967, Acosta met author [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. In 1971, Thompson wrote an article on Acosta and the injustice in the barrios of East [[Los Angeles]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, titled "[[Strange Rumblings in Aztlan]]". This article also discusses the death of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' columnist [[Rubén Salazar]]. While working on the article, Thompson and Acosta decided that a trip to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], was in order, so that they could freely discuss Salazar and racial injustice in L.A. away from any police supervision. Thompson wrote about this trip in his 1972 novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.

The legal department of the publisher of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' said the book could not be published without clearance by Acosta, as references to him were recognizable. Acosta initially refused the clearance, saying that he was insulted by Thompson's alteration of his race—Thompson had described him as a "300-pound [[Samoans|Samoan]]." He understood, however, that inserting his real name and race would necessitate extensive rewriting and delay publication of the book, so he promised clearance provided that his name and picture would appear on the [[dustjacket]].

== Disappearance ==
In May 1974, Acosta disappeared while traveling in [[Mazatlán]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=martinez/&gt; His son, Marco Acosta, believes that he was the last person to talk to his father. Acosta telephoned his son from Mazatlán, telling him that he was "about to board a boat full of white snow." Marco is later quoted in reference to his father's disappearance: "The body was never found, but we surmise that probably, knowing the people he was involved with, he ended up mouthing off, getting into a fight, and getting killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/603|title=Shermakaye Bass|accessdate=2009-01-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Bkg2Aj1a?url=http://www.gettingit.com/article/603|archivedate=2012-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Thompson's investigation of Acosta's disappearance, titled "The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat," was published in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Hunter S.|title=The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-banshee-screams-for-buffalo-meat-19771215|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=25 March 2015|date=December 15, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thompson, Acosta was a powerful attorney and preacher but suffered from an [[addiction]] to [[amphetamines]], and had a predilection for [[LSD]]. The article was Thompson's response to rumors that Acosta was alive somewhere around Miami.

Thompson wrote he believed Acosta was either murdered by drug dealers or was the victim of a political assassination.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt; Others have speculated that Acosta [[drug overdose|overdosed]] or suffered a nervous breakdown during his trip.&lt;ref name=martinez/&gt;

==Quotes about Acosta==
{{quote|Oscar was not into serious street-fighting, but he was hell on wheels in a bar brawl. Any combination of a 250 lb Mexican and LSD-25 is a potentially terminal menace for anything it can reach – but when the alleged Mexican is in fact a profoundly angry [[Chicano]] lawyer with no fear at all of anything that walks on less than three legs and a de facto suicidal conviction that he will die at the age of 33 – just like [[Jesus Christ]] – you have a serious piece of work on your hands. Especially if the bastard is already 33½ years old with a head full of Sandoz acid, a loaded .357 Magnum in his belt, a hatchet-wielding Chicano bodyguard on his elbow at all times, and a disconcerting habit of projectile vomiting geysers of pure blood off the front porch every 30 or 40 minutes, or whenever his malignant ulcer can't handle any more raw tequila.|[[Hunter S. Thompson]], "The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat," ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' #254, December 15, 1977}}

{{quote|Every century there are a few individuals who are destined to lead the weak, to hold unpopular beliefs and, most important, who are willing to die for their cause. My father's whole life was given to the fight for "the people".|[[Marco Acosta]]}}

{{quote|One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die.|[[Hunter S. Thompson]], "The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat," ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' December 15, 1977, eventually used in the film adaption of ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]].''}}

==Motion pictures==
The film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' (1980) loosely depicts Acosta's life and his relationship with Hunter S. Thompson. Its name is derived from Thompson's article about Acosta, "The Banshee Screams for Buffalo Meat," in reference Acosta's book ''[[Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo]]''. Actor [[Peter Boyle]] portrayed Acosta, whose character is named "Carl Lazlo, Esquire"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moorhead|first=Jim|title=It Gets Rather Messy 'Where Buffalo Roam'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lWFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4890,3521947&amp;dq=oscar+zeta+acosta+boyle|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=April 28, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Murray]] portrayed Thompson.

''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998) is a film adaptation of Thompson's [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|novel of the same name]], a fictionalized account of Thompson and Acosta's trip to Las Vegas in 1971. [[Benicio del Toro]] portrays Acosta,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olsen|first=Mark|title=A rebel force|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/11/entertainment/et-benecio11|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to in the film and novel as "Dr. Gonzo," while [[Johnny Depp]] portrayed Thompson (under the alias of [[Raoul Duke]]).

''[[The Rise and Fall of the Brown Buffalo]]'' (2017) is a documentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brownbuffalofilm.com|title=Welcome|website=City Projects Presents|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the life and career of Acosta with dramatic reenactments.

===Men and LGBT===

* [[LGBT]] [[Domestic violence]] – an under-researched area with a very wide range of estimates of prevalence. Lesbians often have fewer resources available for shelter and counselling.&lt;ref name="10 women"&gt;[http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageID=691 ''Ten Things Lesbians Should Discuss with their Health Care Providers.''] Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.

Fiebert, shows that women are as likely to be abusive to men, but the men are less likely to be hurt. However, he noted, men are seriously injured in 38% of the cases in which "extreme aggression" is used. Fiebert additionally noted that his work was not meant to minimize the serious effects of men who abuse women.{{#tag:ref|Martin S.

This survey tool was developed in the 1970s and may not be appropriate for intimate partner violence research because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics; it also leaves out sexual assault and violence by ex-spouses or partners and does not determine who initiated the violence.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"/&gt;|group=nb}}

Another study published in the [[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence &amp; Victims Journal Vol. 1]] concluded that a feminist analysis of Domestic Abuse was necessary to combat common misconceptions. The study found that 92% of women who used violence against their male partners were in self-defense, and that violence reciprocated by victims may be an integral part of abuse [[victimology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Neil | last2 = Gottman | first2 = John | title = When men batter women: new insights into ending abusive relationships | url = http://www.gottman.com/shop/when-men-batter-women/ | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, NY | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781416551331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==
* [[Conflict tactics scale]] – research method for identifying intimate partner violence by measuring the conflict tactic behaviors.
* [[Cycle of abuse]] – [[social cycle theory]] to explain patterns of behavior of a violent intimate relationship: Tension building phase, acting-out phase, reconciliation / honeymoon phase, and calm phase, which leads back to the tension building phase.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Lenore E. (1979) ''The Battered Woman''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cycle of violence]]
** Within a relationship – repeated acts of [[violence]] as a cyclical pattern, associated with high emotions and doctrines of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] or [[revenge]]. The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship. Each phase may last a different length of time and over time the level of violence may increase.
** Intergenerational cycle of violence – violence that is passed from father to son or daughter, parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics between partners==

* Situational couple violence – arises infrequently out of conflicts that escalate to arguments and then to violence, rather than a general pattern of control. It is likely the most common type of intimate partner violence. Women are "almost as likely" as men to be abusers, however, women are more likely to be physically injured, require police intervention and become fearful of their mates.&lt;ref name=CLASP3&gt;[http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications_states/files/0314.pdf ''A Sociologist’s Perspective on Domestic Violence,''] ''A Conversation with Michael Johnson, Ph.D.'' Theodora Ooms, interviewer.

==Impacts==
The incidence of abuse may result in the following:
* [[Effects of domestic violence on children]] – dysfunctions in the physical, behavioral, emotional, and social areas of life which affect their [[quality of life|well-being]], [[child development]], [[teen dating violence|teen dating experiences]], future domestic situations and mortality.
* [[Mental illness]] &lt;ref name=Shipway&gt;Shipway, Lynn. (2004). ''Domestic violence: a handbook for health professionals.''

** [[Battered person syndrome]] – physical and [[psychology|psychological condition]] victims of domestic abuse, which may be manifested as a type of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), from an ongoing [[Cycle of abuse]].
** [[Self-harm]] – intentional, direct injuring of body tissue most often done without [[suicide|suicidal]] intentions.&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;
* [[Suicide]],&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayhew/&gt; – act of intentionally causing one's own [[death]].

===Remedies===
* [[Evidence-based prosecution#Context within domestic violence prosecution|Evidence-based prosecution of domestic violence]] – prosecutors aggressively trying domestic violence cases, basing their cases on evidence rather than victim cooperation, resulting in higher conviction rates.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Jeffrey. (1996).[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf ''The Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits''] National Institute of Justice. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Injunction]] – [[equitable remedy]] in the form of a [[court order]] that requires a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts. A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or [[civil penalty|civil penalties]] and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. In some cases, breaches of injunctions are considered serious criminal offenses that merit arrest and possible prison sentences.
** [[Restraining order]] – requires a party to do, or to refrain from doing, certain acts. A party that refuses to comply with an order faces criminal or civil penalties and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. Breaches of restraining orders can be considered serious criminal offences that merit arrest and possible prison sentences. The term is most commonly used in reference to [[domestic violence]], [[harassment]], [[stalking]] or [[sexual assault]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8750">The '''Oxnard strike of 1903''' was a [[labor rights]] dispute in the southern [[California]] coastal city of [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] between local landowners and the majority [[Japanese American|Japanese]] and [[Mexico|Mexican]] labor force.

==History==

===Before the strike===
In 1887, Henry, James, Benjamin, and Robert Oxnard sold their Brooklyn sugar refinery and moved to [[California]] to capitalize on the growing agricultural economy of the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/06/17/104784988.pdf "Sugar Men Divided by Threat of Jail."] ''The New York Times,'' June 17, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, following the enactment of the [[Dingley Act|Dingley Tariff Bill]] that heavily taxed foreign sugar, [[Henry T. Oxnard|Henry]], James, and Robert Oxnard formed the [[American Beet Sugar Company]]. Although the seasonal Chinese and Mexican laborers already in place in the county easily satisfied agricultural labor needs early in the factory's history, decline in Chinese populations due to [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]s and use of Mexican workers in other agricultural efforts led to an increase in Japanese worker recruitment. By 1902 nine major Japanese contractors saw to the seasonal needs in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Almaguer p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these contractors had already caused minor slowdowns and protests over wages, recently arrived bank owners and merchants organized an owner-interest oriented contracting company called the [[Western Agricultural Contracting Company]] (WACC). The WACC quickly replaced the Japanese contractors as principal contractors to the [[Oxnard Plain]] and even forced some of them to subcontract through the WACC. Comprising more than 90 percent of the work force, the WACC had a near [[monopoly]] of the workers.

===The strike and the JMLA===
On February 11, 1903, 500 [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and 200 [[Mexican people|Mexican]] laborers became the charter members of the [[Japanese-Mexican Labor Association]] (JMLA) joined together and formed their organization based on the grievances of the Oxnard laborers. Overcoming obvious language barriers between the two constituent groups, they immediately elected Kosaburo Baba (president), Y. Yamaguchi (secretary of the Japanese branch), and J.M. Lizarras (secretary of the Mexican branch); Baba and Lizarras were both labor contractors and Yamaguchi has been recognized as a boarding student recruited from San Francisco. Their immediate concerns opposed the WACC on three conditions:

* they accused the WACC of artificially suppressing wages;
* they opposed the subcontracting system arguing that it forced workers to pay double commissions; and
* they called for the freedom to buy goods rather than be subjected to the inflated prices of the company store.

In order to remedy these issues, the JMLA membership ceased working through the WACC (essentially declaring a strike). The strike came at a serendipitously precarious time in the sugar beet season, the staple crop of Oxnard Plain agriculture, since the labor-intensive and yield-defining work of thinning the seedlings needed to be done within the scope of a few weeks.

By the first week in March, the JMLA recruited a membership larger than 1,200 workers (over 90% of the labor force of the county's beet industry). The JMLA's increased recruitment pulled the WACC's former contracted workers from it and essentially brought the sugar industry to a standstill.

On March 23, 1903, the strike reached its turning point. Although an official investigation blamed the violence and sole death of Mexican laborer Luis Vasquez on the strikers, witnesses certify that [[Anglo]] farmers shot into a crowd of strikers thus killing Vasquez and wounding four others. With the highly negative press reaction to the incident, the WACC conceded to most of the laborers' demands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views5.htm "A History of Mexican Americans in California: Historic Sites: The Cottage Hotel."] [https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views.htm Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California.] [[National Park Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese and Mexican laborers, formerly pitted against each other, had unified to achieve their labor goals. The success JMLA achieved showed the effectiveness of a multi-racial labor front and showed that class, and not race, could be the unifier in labor organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Raymond (2002). [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/aasc/classweb/winter02/aas197a/rramirez2.html "Immigrant Workers and 'Shared Leadership'."] [http://www.asianam.ucla.edu/ Asian American Studies Classweb]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the JMLA was unable to hold on to its victories as it lost authority due to the [[American Federation of Labor]](AFL) under [[Samuel Gompers]] denying them a charter due to their large Japanese membership.&lt;ref&gt;Acuña, Rodolfo.

'''Paul Anthony "Paulie" Ayala''' (born April 22, 1970) is an American former [[professional boxer]] who held the [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[bantamweight]] titles, and the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] [[super bantamweight]] title. In 1999 he was voted "[[Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|Fighter of the Year]]" by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine for his first bout against [[Johnny Tapia]], which also won "[[Ring magazine Fight of the Year|Fight of the Year]]" honors.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;Tim Graham, ESPN.com, [http://a.espncdn.com/boxing/columns/graham/796589.html Good guy Ayala gets overlooked], Accessed June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zimmerman&gt;Jeff Zimmerman, Fight News, [http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/paulie-ayalas-punching-out-parkinsons-biggest-fundraiser-to-date-234619 Paulie Ayala's Punching Out Parkinson's Biggest Fundraiser to Date: Hall of Famer Terry Norris and Dewey Bozella will be guest speakers], Accessed June 9, 2014,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Mallison, August 6, 2013, Star-Telegram, [http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/08/06/5060442/former-boxing-champ-paulie-ayala.html?rh=1 Former Boxing Champ Paulie Ayala], Accessed June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mac Engel, Star-Telegram, January 13, 2013, [http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/01/14/4547259/former-boxing-champion-paulie.html?storylink=addthis Former boxing champion Paulie Ayala stays busy in retirement], Accessed June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Slater, June 6, 2014, Eastside Boxing, [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/2014/erik-morales-an-appreciation/ Erik Morales: an appreciation], Accessed June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emily White Youree and Joan Kurkowski-Gillen, May. 18, 2014, in the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram, a book entitled ''Legendary Locals of Fort Worth'', [http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/05/18/5819629/new-notable-fort-worth-in-the.html New &amp; Notable: Fort Worth in the spotlight], Accessed June 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Ayala began his professional fighting career with a six-round decision win over Jaime Olvera on November 27, 1992. He had seven fights in 1993, including one against future NABO champion and world title challenger Jesse Magana. Ayala won all seven of those bouts, four by [[knockout]]. Magana was knocked out in the fourth round, after which Ayala went on to score wins over prospects Evgeny Novoselov and George Acevedo.

In 1994, he won all four of his bouts, including one over veteran Lee Cargle. Cargle was knocked out by Ayala in round three. 1995 was a productive year for Ayala, who won all five of his fights, including his first regional championship bout. By defeating Mike Espinoza by knockout in three rounds at the [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] Convention Center, Ayala claimed the [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] bantamweight title. He defended it twice before the end of the year, beating Mario Diaz and Sergio Millan, both by decision in 12 rounds.

Ayala only had two fights in 1996, both of them successful defenses of his NABF title. In the first, he knocked out Roland Gomez in seven rounds but was forced to take a seven-month layoff due to a broken Hand. Returning to the ring in September, Ayala defeated Ivan Alvarez by decision in twelve to retain the NABF bantamweight title.

He began 1997 by defeating Cuauhtemoc Gomez by decision in twelve, once again retaining his belt as the headliner at the [[Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort Atlantic City|Tropicana Casino]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Ayala won three more bouts that year, defeating heavy-handed puncher Nestor Lopez in a co-main event feature on an [[pay-per-view#HBO PPV|HBO pay-per-view]] card, headlining at [[The Orleans]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]] with a fifth-round knockout over Roberto Lopez to retain the NABF belt. This was followed by another HBO PPV appearance, in which Ayala won a unanimous decision against Ricardo Medina.

At the beginning of 1998, Ayala was very close to a world championship bout. Fighting two more bouts, he received his first chance at a world title by becoming the mandatory contender for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] belt. Ayala then traveled to Japan to challenge WBC bantamweight champion [[Joichiro Tatsuyoshi]] on August 23. Ayala lost the fight by a sixth-round [[referee technical decision|technical decision]] when the fight was stopped due to a cut. Tatsuyoshi came out fast in the opening rounds, but Ayala rallied back to win the fifth and sixth rounds unanimously. During the fight, an accidental clash of heads caused a cut and Ayala was docked 2 points. The fight was stopped in round seven due to the severity of the cut, sending the decision to the scorecards and thereby handing victory to Tatsuyoshi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=491&lt;/ref&gt;

===WBA bantamweight title===
After a win against Ivan Salazar, Ayala began 1999 by beating David Vazquez by decision in ten. Unable to secure a rematch with Tatsuyoshi, Ayala nonetheless got his second chance at becoming a world champion, this time against [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] bantamweight champion [[Johnny Tapia]]. The fight took place in [[Las Vegas]] on June 26.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doghouseboxing.com/Ken/Hissner093009.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala handed Tapia his first career loss and became world champion by winning a twelve-round unanimous decision, in what turned out to be both Ayala's [[Showtime Championship Boxing|Showtime]] debut and [[Ring magazine Fight of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine's Fight of the Year]] for 1999.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/07/sports/sp-32939 Ayala-Tapia Rematch Seeks Same Flair as the Original – Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayala retained his title against WBA #1 contender Sithai Condo before the end of that year, earning [[Ring magazine Fighter of the Year|''The Ring'' magazine Fighter of the Year]] honours. In his second title defense, he defeated [[Johnny Bredahl]] via twelve-round decision. On October 7, 2000, Ayala and Tapia met in a rematch for the vacant [[International Boxing Association (professional body)|IBA]] [[featherweight]] title, at a [[catch weight|catchweight]] of 124 lbs. As with the first fight, this took place on Showtime. Due to Tapia being unable to make the bantamweight limit, Ayala's WBA bantamweight title was not at stake. Ayala defeated Tapia once again by a twelve-round uanimous decision, a result which was seen as controversial.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;

On March 30, 2001, Ayala recovered from a fourth-round knockdown to retain his WBA bantamweight title with a twelve-round decision against Hugo Dianzo in an [[ESPN]] telecast bout. Ayala then vacated his title in order to move up in weight.

===Super bantamweight===
On August 4, 2001, Ayala challenged world champion [[Clarence Adams (boxer)|Clarence Adams]], who had vacated his WBA [[super bantamweight]] title in order to face Ayala for the vacant [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] title. Ayala defeated Adams via [[split decision]]. In a rematch of their closely contested bout, Ayala successfully defended his IBO title by defeating Adams in a wide unanimous decision. Both bouts were featured on HBO telecasts.

===Featherweight===
Continuing his rise in weight, on November 16, 2002 Ayala met world champion [[Érik Morales]] for the vacant WBC featherweight title, this time winding up on the losing end of a twelve-round unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/Morales-vs-Ayala.php Erik Morales Vs. Paulie Ayala: Morales too strong for gallant Ayala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213225806/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/Morales-vs-Ayala.php |date=2006-02-13 }} ''eastsideboxing.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayala returned to the ring on November 15, 2003, dropping back down to super bantamweight and defeating Edel Ruiz in a ten-round unanimous decision in Fort Worth, Texas. On June 19, 2004 in Los Angeles, Ayala once again ventured into the featherweight division. In a losing effort against fellow former world champion [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], Ayala was knocked out in ten rounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infiniteboxing.com/articles/broy/061904.htm Marco Antonio Barrera Floors Paulie Ayala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805213017/http://infiniteboxing.com/articles/broy/061904.htm |date=2007-08-05 }} ''infiniteboxing.com''&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, Ayala surprised many of his boxing fans by announcing his retirement from the sport.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2004-06-20-ayala-barrera_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Punching Out Parkinson's===
Following retirement, Ayala has contributed to helping those who suffer from [[Parkinson's disease]]. In Fort Worth, Texas at his University of Hard Knocks gym, Ayala started a program to help Parkinson's patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/08/06/5060351/boxing-the-pain-away.html Former Boxing Champ Takes On Parkinson's]&lt;/ref&gt; Using his expertise, he teaches non-contact boxing techniques to regain coordination, strength and balance in order to improve the quality of life for his students and create an environment of camaraderie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulieayala.com/punching-out-parkinsons-uhk-boxing-program Punching Out Parkinsons UHK Boxing Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Petz''''' ('''''Dogz''''' and '''''Catz''''') is a series of single-player video games dating back to 1995, in which the player can adopt, raise, care for and breed their own [[virtual pet]]s. The original ''Petz'' has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dogz and Catz Dash Past 1.5 Million Mark; PF.Magic's Virtual Petz Brand Established as Leader in Category.|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dogz+and+Catz+Dash+Past+1.5+Million+Mark%253B+PF.Magic's+Virtual+Petz...-a020299674|website = The Free Library|accessdate = 2015-11-09|date = 1998-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brand has grown to over 22 million copies since coming under Ubisoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubisoft 2010-11 H1 Earnings Presentation|accessdate=9 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121230140/http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/gallery_files/site/270/1042/2349.pdf|archivedate=21 November 2010|url=http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/gallery_files/site/270/1042/2349.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Petz games were developed by [[P.F. Magic]]. After earning revenues of $8 million in 1997, P.F. Magic was acquired by [[The Learning Company]] for $15.8 million in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Co. to acquire PF. Magic|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/learning-co-to-acquire-pf-magic/|website = Cnet|accessdate = 2017-09-23|date = 1998-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[UbiSoft]] acquired the entertainment division of The Learning Company, granting Ubisoft exclusive publishing rights to 88 titles, including Dogz and Catz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ubi Soft Acquires The Learning Company's Entertainment Division|url = http://www.gamezone.com/news/ubi_soft_acquires_the_learning_company_s_entertainment_division|website = Gamezone|accessdate = 2017-09-23|date = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After UbiSoft acquired the series, some games that were actually Japanese in origin were localized under the Petz name. For example, Petz: Hamsterz Life 2 on Game Boy Advance is a localization of Hamster Club 3, and distinctly different from its DS counterpart, although both DS Hamsterz games were also Japanese-developed but published in English territories by UbiSoft.

==Gameplay==
The player starts at the Adoption Center, where they may choose a Dogz or Catz to adopt of a Breedz and gender of their choice. Once the player has found a Petz, they can adopt and name their new Puppyz or Kittenz. After around three days (real time) the Petz become adults. Adult Petz can then breed and have Kittenz or Puppyz of their own in ''Petz 3'', ''Petz 4'', and ''Petz 5''. Cross-breeding can create different types of petz, called 'Mixed Breeds'.

There are a number of Toyz, food and water bowls, and Treatz available. Petz can learn tricks with positive rewards such as petting and Treatz, or trained not to do something using the punishment (water) spray bottle. Petz must be looked after properly; abused or neglected Petz may run away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Petz|url=http://www.pfmagic.com/about/default.asp|website=Petz.com|publisher=PF Magic|accessdate=9 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621192958/http://www.pfmagic.com/about/default.asp|archivedate=21 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Software Review: Petz: Dogz 5 &amp; Catz 5|url=http://www.edutainingkids.com/review/petzcatzdogz5.html|website=Edutaining Kids|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players may share their Petz with others who have the game via an email. Each version allows the importing of Petz from all earlier versions. There is also a camera feature, permitting snapshots of petz to be taken and saved as .bmp files.

Other animals include Pigz and Bunnyz.  Later versions of the games included a ''Petz Web Fun Pack'', ''Petz Publisher'' and a ''Petz Player'' web browser plug-in, allowing players to publish their Petz online in playable webpages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Fun Pack Help|url=http://www.webpetz.com/Pet/Petz5WebFunPack/html/help.htm|website=WebPetz|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Petz Publisher does not work anymore, due to the fact that the website has been remodeled with the newer Petz games by Ubisoft.

Users learned how to reverse-engineer the system, and began producing additional Breedz, Toyz, playscenes, clothes, and developer tools for the games, as permitted by [[PF Magic]], [[Mindscape]], and [[Ubisoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hansmeyer|first1=Becky|title=Ballz &amp; Linez: Remembering the Golden Age of Petz Hexing|url=http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2015/03/11/ballz-linez-remembering-the-golden-age-of-petz-hexing/|website=Becky Hansmeyer|accessdate=9 November 2015|date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breedz==

Each Petz breedz has its own body shape and colour variations.

''Catz and Dogz 1'' began with 5 Breedz per game.
''Petz 2'', ''3'' and ''4'' contain 10 Breedz per game, referred to as the Original PF Magic Breedz. In ''Petz 5'' there are 16 different Dogz and 16 different Catz Breedz in the adoption center.

==Breeding and Petz geneticz==

[[Image:Mixed Breed.PNG|thumb|right|200px| Mixed Breedz often clearly show traits of their base Breedz, but also have mutations (e.g. the ruddy fur and black eyes/eyelids in this case).]]

Petz in the game can become attracted to one another and breed to produce offspring. This feature was introduced in ''Petz 3'' and has also appeared in ''Petz 4'' and ''Petz 5''. In ''Petz 3'' and ''Petz 4'', a petz couple could only produce one Kittenz/Puppyz per breeding, but in ''Petz 5'' a mother can bear up to four offspring per litter.

The user can encourage Petz to fall in love by squirting them with love potions and perfumes and giving them food with [[aphrodisiac]]-like qualities, as well as using other means. When Petz have mated, a heart will appear on the screen informing the user of the female's pregnancy (which generally lasts 3 – 5 days). In that time, females will become noticeably rounder and will require extra food and attention.

Petz's genes carry through to their offspring but can mutate, resulting in different fur and eye colours to that of the parents. The shape and size of body parts is also inherited in "sections;" e.g. the legs, head, and ears could be inherited from one parent and the feet, tail, and body could be inherited from the other parent.

When two different breeds of Petz are bred together, the offspring will have the base personality of one parent (or ancestor). The base personality can be determined by the Petz' eyes, their personality and behavior and how they pose.

===Petz life cycle===

[[Image:Breed Differences.png|thumb|right|200px|The difference between a high-generation Calico (left) and one from the adoption center (right) can be easily seen, despite being the same breed.]]

When Petz have Kittenz/Puppyz, the player is asked to name the offspring. During the first few days of a Petz' life, it is blind, small and cannot walk. The mother feeds her infant and the user can also do so with the milk bottle.

The [[newborn]] will later open its eyes and is able to walk around, jump onto ledges and stop suckling. They can eat from food bowls and drink from the milk bottle, but cannot swallow treats.

In ''Petz 5'', when the Puppyz/Kittenz are young, they remain in the nursery room with their mother until they are weaned. Only the mother and offspring can access this room and the mother and offspring cannot be taken out separately. When the Puppyz/Kittenz have grown up, the nursery becomes inaccessible. In ''Petz 3'' and ''4'', the mother and her single Puppyz/Kittenz have free access to all areas.

Eventually, the offspring will separate from their mothers as they grow to Kittenz and Puppyz.

[[File:Bgbo frosch ies.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|The [[common frog]] is a poikilotherm and is able to function over a wide range of body core temperatures.]]
A '''poikilotherm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔɪ|k|ə|l|ə|ˌ|θ|ɜr|m|,_|p|ɔɪ|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|ə|ˌ|θ|ɜr|m}}) is an [[animal]] whose internal temperature varies considerably.  It is the opposite of a [[homeotherm]], an animal which maintains [[thermal]] [[homeostasis]].  While the term in principle can apply to all [[organism]]s, it is generally only applied to animals, and mostly to [[vertebrate]]s. Usually the fluctuations are consequence of variation in the [[Ambient temperature|ambient environmental temperature]]. Many terrestrial [[ectotherm]]s are poikilothermic.&lt;ref name="hilde"&gt;{{cite book|page=429|isbn=0-471-29505-1|author=Milton Hildebrand; G. E. Goslow, Jr. Principal ill. Viola Hildebrand.|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|title=Analysis of vertebrate structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments to the point that they are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are [[homeotherm]]ic).  It is this distinction that often makes the term "poikilotherm" more useful than the vernacular "cold-blooded", which is sometimes used to refer to [[ectotherm]]s more generally.

Poikilothermic animals include types of vertebrate animals, specifically some fish, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as a large number of [[invertebrate]] animals.  The [[naked mole-rat]] is the only mammal that is currently thought to be poikilothermic.&lt;ref name="Daly et al., (1997)"&gt;Daly, T.J.M., Williams, L.A. and Buffenstein, R., (1997).  Catecholaminergic innervation of interscapular brown adipose tissue in the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). Journal of Anatomy, 190: 321-326. {{doi|10.1046/j.1469-7580.1997.19030321.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2010)"&gt;Sherwin, C.M. (2010). The Husbandry and Welfare of Non-traditional Laboratory Rodents. In "UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory Animals", R. Hubrecht and J. Kirkwood (Eds).  Wiley-Blackwell.  Chapter 25, pp. 359-369&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The term derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''poikilos'' ({{lang|el|ποικίλος}}), meaning "varied," ultimately from "thousand-making" and ''thermos'' ({{lang|el|θερμός}}), meaning "heat".

== Physiology ==
[[File:Homeothermy-poikilothermy.png|thumb|250 px|right|Sustained energy output of a poikilotherm (a [[lizard]]) and a [[homeotherm]] (a [[mouse]]) as a function of core body temperature. The homeotherm has a much higher output, but can only function over a very narrow range of body temperatures.]]

Poikilotherm animals must be able to function over a wider range of temperatures than homeotherms. The speed of most chemical reactions vary with temperature, and in order to function poikilotherms may have four to ten [[enzyme]] systems that operate at different temperatures for an important chemical reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cavalier-Smith|first=T.|title=Coevolution of vertebrate genome, cell, and nuclear sizes|journal=Symposium on the Evolution of Terrestrial Vertebrates|pages=51–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, poikilotherms often have larger, more complex [[genome]]s than homeotherms in the same [[ecological niche]]. [[Frog]]s are a notable example of this effect, though their complex development is also an important factor in their large genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan Gregory|first=T.|title=Genome size and developmental complexity|journal=Genetica|date=1 January 2002|volume=115|issue=1|pages=131–146|doi=10.1023/A:1016032400147}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because their metabolism is variable and generally below that of homeothermic [[animals]], sustained high-energy activities like powered [[flight]] in large animals or maintaining a large [[brain]] is generally beyond poikilotherm animals.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, P., Stone, G., &amp; Johnston, I. A. (2000): Environmental physiology of animals. ''Blackwell Science'', London. 644 pages, {{ISBN|0-632-03517-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolism of poikilotherms favors strategies such as sit-and-wait hunting over chasing prey for larger animals with high movement cost. As they do not use their [[metabolism]]s to heat or cool themselves, total energy requirement over time is low.  For the same body weight, poikilotherms need only 5 to 10% of the energy of [[homeotherm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, N. A., Reece, J. B., et al. (2002). Biology. 6th edition. Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations in poikilotherms==

*Some adaptations are behavioral. Lizards and [[snake]]s bask in the sun in the early morning and late evening, and seek shelter around noon.
*The eggs of the [[yellow-faced bumblebee]] are unable to regulate heat. A behavioral adaptation to combat this is incubation, where to maintain the internal temperatures of eggs, the queen and her workers will incubate the brood almost constantly, by warming their abdomens and touching them to the eggs. The bumblebee generates heat by shivering flight muscles even though they are not flying. 
*[[Termite]] mounds are usually oriented in a north-south direction so that they absorb as much heat as possible around dawn and dusk and minimise heat absorption around noon.
* Tuna are able to warm their entire bodies through a heat exchange mechanism called the [[rete mirabile]], which helps keep heat inside the body, and minimises the loss of heat through the [[gill]]s. They also have their swimming muscles near the center of their bodies instead of near the surface, which minimises heat loss.
*[[Gigantothermy]] means using a low ratio of surface area to volume to minimise heat loss, such as in [[sea turtle]]s.
*[[Camel]]s, although they are homeotherms, thermoregulate using a method termed "temperature cycling" to conserve energy. In hot deserts, they allow their body temperature to rise during the day and fall during the night, adjusting their body temperature to cycle over approximately 6°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animal Physiology|last=Hill|first=Richard|publisher=Sinauer Associates|year=2016|isbn=978-1605354712|location=Sunderland, MA|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
It is comparatively easy for a poikilotherm to accumulate enough energy to reproduce.  Poikilotherms at the same [[trophic level]] often have much shorter generations than homeotherms: weeks rather than years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Such applies even to animals with similar ecological roles such as [[cat]]s and [[snake]]s.

This difference in energy requirement also means that a given food source can support a greater density of poikilothermic animals than homeothermic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, J.B, Steen, H. &amp; Stenseth, N.C. (1991): Population Dynamics of Poikilotherm and Homeotherm Vertebrates: Effects of Food Shortage. OICOS Vol. 60, No 2 (March, 1991), pp 269-272. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3544877 summary]&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the predator-prey ratio which is usually higher in poikilothermic fauna compared to homeothermic ones. However, when homeotherms and poikilotherms have similar niches, and compete, the homeotherm can often drive poikilothermic competitors to extinction, because homeotherms can gather food for a greater fraction of each day.

==In medicine==
In medicine, loss of normal thermoregulation in humans is referred to as "poikilothermia".  This is usually seen with sedative and hypnotic drugs or in '[[compartment syndrome]]'.  For example, [[barbiturate]]s, [[ethanol]], and [[chloral hydrate]] may precipitate this effect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  [[REM sleep]] is also considered a poikilothermic state in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sleep Medicine Essentials|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=12|author=Leon Rosenthal|authorlink=Physiologic Processes During Sleep|editor=Teofilo Lee-Chiong|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

=== Serene Village ===
The player wakes up transformed into a Pokémon and only remembering that they used to be a human. When they are suddenly attacked by Beheeyem, a friendly [[Nuzleaf]] helps them escape, gives them shelter in Serene Village, and enrolls them in a school for young Pokémon. There, they meet their partner, who dreams of joining the Exploration Society but has become the town pariah due to his overeager nature. Taking advantage of the player not knowing the area, school bullies [[Pancham (Pokémon)|Pancham]] and [[Shelmet]] trick the player (and the partner, to their chagrin) to enter a mine owned by a [[Gabite]], but the local [[Drilbur]] diffuse the situation before it gets out of control.

Several days later, the other kids ask the player where they're from, having ascertained that they can't feasibly be Nuzleaf's kid. Not wanting to hid the truth, the player reveals what he remembers, but Pancham gets everyone (except the partner and the school principal) to think they're a pathological liar looking for attention. The next day, Nuzleaf's neighbor, [[Roselia]], arrives at the school looking for her daughter [[Budew]], who's disappeared without any real explanation. Recalling a conversation they had with the partner's father about a special honey that Budew overheard, the player and partner rush to a nearby meadow and save her, winning the respect of their classmates and the town. That night, the partner sympathizes with the player's outsider status and gives him one of the Harmony Scarves they have as a sigh of friendship.

They eventually meet [[Ampharos]], a member of the Exploration Society who gives them a Connection Orb and names them junior Exploration Society members. After saving Panchem and Shelmet from a group of [[Litwick]] who came to town to fead on their fears, Nuzleaf informs the pair that he wants them to join him to explore Revelation Mountain, a local mountain range the town has guarded for years with no reason why. However, the Beheeyem are spotted outside the village, forcing the player and partner to flee to Lively Town, the site of the Exploration Society headquarters.

=== Lively Town and the Exploration Society ===
Upon arriving, Ampharos inducts them into the Exploration Society and introduces them to the other members: explorers [[Archen]], [[Bunnelby]], [[Buizel]], archaeologist [[Mawile]], astronomer [[Jirachi]], communications officer [[Dedenne]], and cook [[Swirlix]]. After a few days of work, Archen invites them to a trip to the Air Continent, where they discover that a malicious entity has been turning Pokémon to stone. The Society initially assumes [[Entei]] is involved after [[Latios]] and [[Latias]] are found turned to stone, but when the player and partner inexplicably evolve to their final forms and defeat him, they realize he was only investigating the current events.

A few days later, the entity confronts Entei. Although the Society is unable to prevent Entei from being turned to stone, they find evidence that implies that [[Krookodile]], a local thug, is the culprit. When it is found that a dungeon called the Prehistoric Ruins may help them find more answers, the Society initially intends to go, but the player and partner hear that Krookodile is headed towards Serene Village and leave with Archen to intercept him. Nuzleaf meets up with them and informs them that Krookodile was heading up Revelation Mountain and joins the chase. At the top, the group discovers a sealed spring that can return petrified Pokémon to normal. They confront Krookodile, but Nuzleaf, along with the legendary Pokémon [[Yveltal]], petrifies the group, dries out the spring water, and begin attacking Pokémon around the world. Ampharos, Jirachi, and [[Espurr]] manage to survive while everyone else the player knew is turned to stone.

=== Escaping the Voidlands and going to the Tree of Life ===
During this time, the player wakes up in a world called the Voidlands and is reunited with most of the Society. As they try to find a way back to their world, the discover that the planet's life source, the Tree of Life, was once pulled toward the sun by the entity, now known as Dark Matter, but was stopped by 'the alignment of the stars'.  However, they are attacked by manifestations of the Voidlands' darkness. [[Raikou]], Entei, and [[Suicune]] save the player, partner, and Mawile, but the others are incapacitated. They make their way up Reverse Mountain, the only way out of the Voidlands, but the battle at the top is so fierce that the player and partner's allies have to sacrifice themselves to let them escape.

The player and partner return to the Society headquarters but are confronted by an escaped Beheeyem, who informs them that Dark Matter feeds on the negativity of others and can possess Pokémon. He also mentions that he believes the Tree of Life to be in the deepest part of the Prehistoric Ruins. He leads the player and partner to the ruins, but when they reach the depths, they realize that Nuzleaf, anticipating Beheeyem's betrayal, lied about the Tree's true location. Nuzleaf reveals that Beheeyem was responsible for the player's memory loss before using the room's energy to attempt to send the player back to the Voidlands. Ampharos, Jirachi, Espurr, and [[Celebi (Pokémon)|Celebi]] intervene and transport them to the Tree of Life.

=== Defeating Dark Matter and conclusion ===
Celebi explains that the player might have been summoned once before by [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] and the Harmony Scarves protect its wearers from turning to stone when near the Tree of Life. Upon reaching the end of the forest, they find the Tree of Life near dead and guarded by Yveltal, Nuzleaf, and the remaining Beheeyem, whom Dark Matter has corrupted. The group manage to defeat them and free them from their brainwashed state, but the battle allowed Dark Matter, who was inside the Tree of Life, to get the energy needed to pull the Tree out of the ground and send the planet toward the sun.

However, various flying Pokémon stall the ascent long enough for [[Arceus]] to send the player and partner into the Tree of Life. After saving Yveltal and the others, the two battle and destroy Dark Matter. The Society and [[Xerneas]], the physical form of the Tree of Life, congratulate them, but the player soon becomes worried that they might be forced to leave the Pokémon world. When expressing their concerns to the partner, the partner informs them that, upon talking with Xerneas, they are the reincarnation of Mew and have to leave the world. The partner tells the player to not be upset before departing in a ball of light.

=== After Story ===
Some time later, the player has returned to working at the Exploration Society, but has lost motivation since their partner left. Ampharos advises the player to seek out a Pokémon named [[Xatu]] on the possibility of bringing back their partner. Upon reaching him, Xatu tells the player that Mew is living in a dungeon called Mystery Forest. However, the Mew the player finds is nothing like their partner. Initially returning home alone, the player discovers Mew following them and Ampharos brings him on to help the player with work. After several days of work, the player and mew bond, allowing the player to get over the pain of their partner's departure. However, the player wakes up one day on the Serene Village hill with Mew gone and no memory of how they wound up there. After returning to the headquarters and not finding Mew there either, their memories come flooding back: Mew had gotten sick at some point and Xatu feared Dark Matter might be involved. Thinking the hill might help, the player took Mew there but was attacked by an unknown party upon arrival.

Immediately, Ampharos and Mawile come forward with a letter saying the individuals that took Mew were at Purifying Cave. At the depths of the cave, the player discovers the kidnappers were Nuzleaf and the Beheeyem, having learned of Dark Matter's presence in Mew and intending to destroy Mew before Dark Matter could revive. The player demands that Mew stays, as they can't bear losing another friend. The player's Harmony Scarf begins to glow and revives the partner. Ampharos, Mawile and Xatu then show up and explain that the partner was inside Mew and his kidnapping was a ruse to bring him back. Mew then returns home, and the player and partner resume their work.

In April 2015, editors of ''[[Famitsu|Famitsu DS+Wii]]'' magazine stated that a new ''Pokémon'' game would be revealed the following month, and that more details would come in a future issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pokebip.com/pokemon/news3309__famitsu_ds_+_wii_tease_une_annonce_pokemon_pour_le_mois_prochain_.html |title=Famitsu DS + Wii tease une annonce Pokémon pour le mois prochain! |trans-title=Famitsu DS + Wii tease a Pokemon announcement for the next month! |language=French |date=April 23, 2015 |author=Brybry |publisher=Pokébip |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon'' was later officially announced by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] via a press release on May 21, confirming the game's release for late 2015 in Japan and North America, and early 2016 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nintendoeverything.com/pokemon-super-mystery-dungeon-announced-coming-to-3ds-winter-2015/ |title=Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon announced, coming to 3DS winter 2015 |date=May 21, 2015 |accessdate=May 21, 2015 |author=Brian |publisher=Nintendo Everything}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like previous entries in the ''Mystery Dungeon'' subseries, it is developed by [[Spike Chunsoft]].&lt;ref name=JP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/cho_dungeon/# |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |script-title=ja:『ポケモン超不思議のダンジョン』公式サイト |trans-title="Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon" Official Website |accessdate=May 21, 2015|language=Japanese }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gameplay footage from the title was first showcased on a [[List of Nintendo Direct presentations|Nintendo Direct]] broadcast on May 31, 2015, along with a final Japanese release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/05/video_first_pokemon_super_mystery_dungeon_footage_revealed |publisher=Nintendo Life |author=Olney, Alex |date=May 31, 2015 |accessdate=May 31, 2015 |title=Video: First Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon Footage Revealed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qadariyah''' (or '''Qadariya''') is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted that humans possess free will, whose exercise makes them responsible for their actions, justifying divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Qadariyyah|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-1901|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the [[Mu'tazili]]s and rejected by the [[Ash'ari]]s.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah/&gt;

Qadariya was one of the first philosophical schools in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;History of Syria including Lebanon and Palestine, by Philip K. Hitti, pg. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest document associated with the movement is the ''Risala'' by [[Hasan al-Basri]], which was composed between 75/694 and 80/699, though debates about free will in Islam probably predate this text.&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sunni sources, the Qadariyah were censured by [[Muhammad]] himself by being compared to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], who likewise deny [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The vision of Islam|date=1994|publisher=Paragon House|isbn=9781557785169|page=258|author=Sachiko Murata, [[William Chittick]]|edition=illustrated|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported in [[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: 
Narrated [[Abdullah ibn Umar]]: The Prophet said, "The Qadariyyah are the [[Magi|Magians]] of this community. If they are ill, do not pay a sick visit to them, and if they die, do not attend their funerals."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: Model Behavior of the Prophet (Kitab Al-Sunnah): Book 40: Hadith 4674.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scorpions''' are [[predation|predatory]] [[arachnid]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Scorpiones'''. They have eight legs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scorpionworlds.com/|title= Scorpion facts and information |publisher=ScorpionWorlds|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are easily recognized by the pair of grasping [[pedipalp]]s and the narrow, segmented tail, often carried in a characteristic forward curve over the back, ending with a [[venom]]ous [[stinger]]. Scorpions range in size from 9&amp;nbsp;mm / 0.3 in. (''[[Typhlochactas mitchelli]]'') to 23&amp;nbsp;cm / 9 in. (''[[Heterometrus swammerdami]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Manny Rubio |year=2000 |title=Scorpions: Everything About Purchase, Care, Feeding, and Housing |publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]] |isbn=978-0-7641-1224-9 |chapter=Commonly Available Scorpions|pages=26–27

|quote=The Guinness Book of Records claims [...] Heterometrus swammerdami'', to be the largest scorpion in the world [9 inches (23 cm)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of scorpions goes back to the [[Silurian]] period 430 million years ago. They have adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and can now be found on all continents except Antarctica. Scorpions number about 1750 described [[species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kovarex.com/scorpio/pdf/scorpions-Kovarik-2009.pdf |format=PDF |author=František Kovařík |year=2009 |title=Illustrated catalog of scorpions, Part I |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 13 extant (living) families recognised to date. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has undergone changes and is likely to change further, as genetic studies are bringing forth new information.

All scorpions have a venomous sting, but the vast majority of the species do not represent a serious threat to humans and in most cases healthy adults do not need any medical treatment after being stung.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web |title=Diseases and Conditions – Scorpion stings|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scorpion-stings/basics/definition/con-20033894|publisher=[[Mayo Clinic]]|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 25 species are known to have venom capable of killing a human.&lt;ref name="Biology"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biology of Scorpions |author=Gary A. Polis |year=1990 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1249-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OqeAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} In some parts of the world with highly venomous species human fatalities regularly occur, primarily in areas with limited access to medical treatment.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[:wikt:scorpion|scorpion]]'' is thought to have originated in [[Middle English]] between 1175 and 1225 AD from [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|scorpion}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Scorpion |encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] |edition=4th |year=2003 |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/scorpion}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from Italian ''{{Lang|it|scorpione}}'', both derived from the Latin ''{{Lang|la|scorpius}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Scorpion |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com |publisher=[[Random House]] |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scorpion |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[romanization]] of the Greek word {{lang|el|[[:wikt:σκορπίος|σκορπίος]]}}&amp;nbsp;– ''{{lang|el|skorpíos}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2395171 σκορπιός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==

[[File:Vista ventral de un escorpión.jpg|thumb|Ventral view of an unidentified scorpion species where the [[Pecten (biology)|pectines]] can easily be observed with a comb like structure in an inverted V shape.]]

The body of a scorpion is divided into two parts ([[Tagma (arthropod anatomy)|tagmata]]): the head ([[cephalothorax]]) and the [[abdomen]] ([[opisthosoma]]), which is subdivided into a broad anterior ([[mesosoma]]), or preabdomen, and a narrow tail-like posterior ([[metasoma]]), or postabdomen.&lt;ref name="Biology"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Cephalothorax===
The [[cephalothorax]], also called the ''[[prosoma]]'', comprises the [[carapace]], eyes, [[chelicerae]] (mouth parts), [[pedipalp]]s (the pedipalps of scorpions have [[chela (organ)|chelae]], commonly called claws or pincers) and four pairs of [[arthropod leg|walking legs]]. The scorpion's exoskeleton is thick and durable, providing good protection from predators. Scorpions have two eyes on the top of the cephalothorax, and usually two to five pairs of eyes along the front corners of the cephalothorax. While unable to form sharp images, their central eyes are amongst the most light sensitive in the animal kingdom, especially in dim light, and makes it possible for nocturnal species to use star light to navigate at night. Some species also have light receptions in their tail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wLiVDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22scorpions+perceive+the+environment+through+visual,+tactile+and+chemical%22&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy4KzW4IHSAhUEAsAKHVEAAd4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22scorpions%20perceive%20the%20environment%20through%20visual%2C%20tactile%20and%20chemical%22&amp;f=false Arthropod Diversity and Conservation in the Tropics and Sub-tropics]&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the eyes on the cephalothorax depends in part on the hardness or softness of the soil upon which they spend their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/l-1678.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990822042321/http://insects.tamu.edu/extension/bulletins/l-1678.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1999-08-22 |title=Department of Entomology |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |accessdate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pedipalp is a segmented, chelate (clawed) [[appendage]] used for prey immobilization, defense and sensory purposes. The segments of the pedipalp (from closest to the body outwards) are coxa, trochanter, femur (humerus), patella, tibia (including the fixed claw and the manus) and tarsus (moveable claw).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrbu.org/scorpions/sc_morphology/sc_glossary.html |title=WRBU Scorpion Identification |publisher=Wrbu.org |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scorpion has darkened or granular raised linear ridges, called "keels" or ''carinae'' on the pedipalp segments and on other parts of the body, which are useful taxonomically.&lt;ref name="Biology"/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Mesosoma===
The mesosoma is the broad part of the opisthosoma. Sometimes it is loosely called the ''[[abdomen]]''. It consists of the [[anterior]] seven [[somites]] (segments) of the opisthosoma, each covered [[dorsum (biology)|dorsally]] by a sclerotosed plate, its [[tergum|tergite]]. [[Ventral]]ly somites 3 to 7 are armoured with matching plates called [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]].

Ventrally somites 1 and 2 are more complex; the first abdominal sternite is modified into a pair of [[Wiktionary:genital|genital]] [[Operculum (animal)|opercula]] covering the [[gonopore]]. Sternite 2 forms the basal plate bearing the [[Pecten (biology)|pectines]].  [[Morphology (biology)|Morphologically]] the pectines are a pair of limbs that function as sensory organs.&lt;ref&gt;Knowlton ED, Gaffin DD (June, 2011) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647695 "Functionally redundant peg sensilla on the scorpion pecten"], ''NCBI''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next four somites, 3 to 6, each bears a pair of [[spiracles]]; they serve as openings for the scorpion's [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] organs, known as [[book lungs]]. The spiracle openings may be slits, circular, elliptical, or oval, according to the species of scorpion.&lt;ref name="Biology"/&gt;{{rp|13–15}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rxZcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22Scorpions+respire+through+four+pairs+of+book+lungs+found+on+abdominal+segments+three+to+six+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YvDf-skY2B&amp;sig=ckffBvdDZyqOy9dpcEL8ENfc4eA&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimr9rD6I3SAhWEhSwKHV2BA74Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Scorpions%20respire%20through%20four%20pairs%20of%20book%20lungs%20found%20on%20abdominal%20segments%20three%20to%20six%20%22&amp;f=false Evolutionary Developmental Biology of Invertebrates 3 Ecdysozoa I: Non-Tetraconata]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7th and last somite do not bear appendages or any other significant external structures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6OqeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Mesosomal+segment+7+(somite+XVI)&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSpdqIhpLSAhUBrRQKHcpeBeIQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mesosomal%20segment%207%20(somite%20XVI)&amp;f=false The Biology of Scorpions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metasoma===
The metasoma is commonly known as the scorpion's "[[tail (anatomy)|tail]]", though this is in some ways misleading because unlike most so-called tails it is not an appendage or limb; it is in fact part of the [[opisthosoma]]. It comprises five segments, of which the fifth segment bears the [[telson]]. In many species it superficially seems as though the metasoma has four segments only, because their first ([[anterior]]) metasomal segment gives the impression of being the [[Anterior|posterior]] segment of the mesosoma. The fifth segment of the metasoma is the caudal segment of the opisthosoma and accordingly bears the anus. The scorpion's telson is the part commonly called the stinger; it is attached to the end of the fifth segment just [[Anatomical terms of location#Other directional terms|dorsad]] from the anus, but as the distal end of the tail at rest normally is carried upside down with the sting pointing forward, the anus usually is above the base of the telson and facing upwards.&lt;ref name="Polis1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary A. Polis|title=The Biology of Scorpions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OqeAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1249-1|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scorpion's telson is the part commonly called the stinger; it includes the [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]], containing a symmetrical pair of [[venom]] glands. Externally it bears the curved [[sting (biology)|sting]], the hypodermic aculeus or venom-injecting barb. It is equipped with various sensory hairs, as the sting cannot be guided visually. Each of the venom glands has its own duct to convey its secretion internally along the aculeus from the bulb of the gland to immediately subterminal of the point of the aculeus, where each of the paired ducts has its own venom pore.&lt;ref name = "YNBM"&gt;Yigit, N.

On rare occasions, scorpions are born with two metasomata. Two-tailed scorpions are no more than examples of [[Adventitiousness|adventitious]] [[Ontogeny|ontogenic]]  [[Teratology|abnormality]]. Whether there ever is a [[Genetics|genetic]] component to the condition is uncertain, but such evidence as is available from offspring is negative so far as no two-tailed scorpions have been observed among the rarely-observed progeny of multiple-tailed scorpion specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm |title=Pepe the Two Tailed Scorpion |accessdate=2008-06-13 |author=Steve Prchal |publisher=Sonoran Arthropod Studies Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516113832/http://www.sasionline.org/pepe.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescence==
[[File:Sorpion Under Blacklight edit.jpg|thumb|This black scorpion appears light-blue under a [[black light]].]]
Scorpions are also known to glow a vibrant blue-green when exposed to certain wavelengths of [[ultraviolet]] light such as that produced by a [[black light]], due to the presence of fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle. One fluorescent component is now known to be [[beta-carboline]].&lt;ref name="Stachel 1999 531–539"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shawn J Stachel |author2=Scott A Stockwell |author3=David L Van Vranken |lastauthoramp=yes |date=August 1999 |title=The fluorescence of scorpions and cataractogenesis |journal=[[Chemistry and Biology (journal)|Chemistry &amp; Biology]] |volume=6 |pages=531–539 |doi=10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80085-4 |pmid=10421760 |issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hand-held UV lamp has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field surveys of these animals.

They are [[nocturnal]] and [[fossorial]], finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks, and emerging at night to hunt and feed. Scorpions exhibit [[photophobia (biology)|photophobic]] behavior, primarily to evade detection by predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, opossums, and rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302191244/http://amonline.net.au/factsheets/scorpions.htm |archivedate=2009-03-02 |title=Scorpions |accessdate=2008-06-13 |publisher=Australian Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods, although the larger kinds have been known to kill small lizards and mice. The large pincers are studded with highly sensitive tactile hair, and the moment an insect touches these, they use their chelae (pincers) to catch the prey. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with [[neurotoxic]] venom. This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it. Scorpions have an unusual style of eating using [[chelicerae]], small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the [[Chelicerata]] among arthropods. The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion into a ''pre-oral cavity'' below the chelicerae and carapace. Scorpions can ingest food only in a liquid form; they have external digestion. The digestive juices from the gut are egested onto the food and the digested food sucked in liquid form. Any solid indigestible matter (fur, [[exoskeleton]], etc.) is trapped by setae in the pre-oral cavity, which is ejected by the scorpion.&lt;ref name="Biology"/&gt;{{rp|296–297}}

Scorpions can consume huge amounts of food at one sitting. They have a very efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate combined with a relatively inactive lifestyle. This enables scorpions to survive long periods when deprived of food; some are able to survive 6 to 12 months of starvation.&lt;ref name="Biology"/&gt;{{rp|297–298}} Scorpions excrete very little; their waste consists mostly of insoluble nitrogenous compounds, such as [[xanthine]], [[guanine]] and [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name="Earthlife"/&gt;

===Reproduction===
Most scorpions reproduce sexually, and most species have male and female individuals. However, some species, such as ''[[Hottentotta hottentotta]]'', ''[[Hottentotta caboverdensis]]'', ''[[Liocheles australasiae]]'', ''[[Tityus columbianus]]'', ''[[Tityus metuendus]]'', ''[[Tityus serrulatus]]'', ''[[Tityus stigmurus]]'', ''[[Tityus trivittatus]]'' and ''[[Tityus urugayensis]]'', reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]], a process in which unfertilised eggs develop into living [[embryo]]s. Parthenogenic reproduction starts following the scorpion's final moult to maturity and continues thereafter.

[[File:Pregnant scorpion.jpg|thumb|Pregnant scorpion]]
Sexual reproduction is accomplished by the transfer of a [[spermatophore]] from the male to the female; scorpions possess a complex [[courtship]] and [[mating]] ritual to effect this transfer. Mating starts with the male and female locating and identifying each other using a mixture of [[pheromones]] and [[oscillation|vibrational]] communication. Once they have satisfied the other that they are of opposite sex and of the correct species, mating can commence.

The courtship starts with the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a "dance" called the "''promenade à deux''". In this "dance", the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his [[spermatophore]]. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours, such as [[juddering]] and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's [[chelicerae]] – pincers – grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps and in some cases injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on the edge of her cephalothorax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr. |author2=Larry S. Roberts |author3=Allan Larson |author4=Helen I'Anson |author5=David Eisenhour |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Integrated Principles of Zoology |edition=13 |date=2005-02-01 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0-07-310174-3 |page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably as a means of pacifying the female.

When the male has identified a suitable location, he deposits the spermatophore and then guides the female over it. This allows the spermatophore to enter her genital [[operculum (animal)|opercula]], which triggers release of the sperm, thus fertilising the female. The mating process can take from 1 to 25+ hours and depends on the ability of the male to find a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. If mating continues too long, the female may lose interest, ending the process.

Once the mating is complete, the male and female will separate. The male will generally retreat quickly, most likely to avoid being cannibalized by the female, although [[sexual cannibalism]] is infrequent with scorpions.

===Birth and development===
[[File:scorpionwithyoung.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Compsobuthus werneri]]'' female with [[Offspring|young]]]]
Unlike the majority of species in the class [[Arachnid]]a, which are [[oviparous]], scorpions seem to be universally [[ovoviviparous]]. The young are born one by one after hatching and expelling the embryonic membrane, if any, and the brood is carried about on its mother's back until the young have undergone at least one [[ecdysis|moult]]. Before the first moult, scorplings cannot survive naturally without the mother, since they depend on her for protection and to regulate their moisture levels. Especially in species that display more advanced sociability (e.g. ''[[Pandinus]]'' spp.), the young/mother association can continue for an extended period of time. The size of the litter depends on the species and environmental factors, and can range from two to over a hundred scorplings. The average litter however, consists of around eight scorplings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W. R. Lourenco |title=European Arachnology |chapter=Reproduction in scorpions, with special reference to parthenogenesis |year=2000 |editor1=S. Toft |editor2=N. Scharff |publisher=Aarhus University Press |isbn=978-877934-0015 |pages=71–85 |url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton ([[ecdysis]]). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in [[instars]] (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting commences with a split in the old [[exoskeleton]] just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the [[metasoma]]. When it emerges, the scorpion's new [[exoskeleton]] is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called [[sclerotisation]]. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.

==Relationship with humans==

===Sting and venom===
All known scorpion species possess venom and use it primarily to kill or paralyze their prey so that it can be eaten. The venom consists of a collection of [[peptide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides |editor=Abba J. Kastin |edition=2nd |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-12-385095-9 |chapter=Scorpion Peptides |author1=Ricardo C. Rodríguez de la Vega |author2=Nicolas Vidal |author3=Lourival D. Possani |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385095-9.00059-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the venom is fast-acting, allowing for effective prey capture. However, as a general rule, they will kill their prey with brute force if they can, as opposed to using venom. It is also used as a defense against predators. The venom is a mixture of compounds ([[neurotoxin]]s, [[enzyme inhibitor]]s, etc.) each not only causing a different effect but possibly also targeting a specific animal. Each compound is made and stored in a pair of glandular sacs and is released in a quantity regulated by the scorpion itself. Of the 1,000+ known species of scorpion, only 25 have venom that is deadly to humans; most of those belong to the family [[Buthidae]] (including ''[[Leiurus quinquestriatus]]'', ''[[Hottentotta]]'', ''[[Centruroides]]'' and ''[[Androctonus]]'').&lt;ref name="Earthlife"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ThinkQuest: Poisonous Animals: Scorpions| url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403212450/http://library.thinkquest.org/C007974/2_4sco.htm | archivedate=2005-04-03 |year=2000 |accessdate =December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
According to the United States [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), the following steps should be taken to prevent scorpion stings:&lt;ref name="niosh"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/scorpions.html | title=Insects and scorpions | publisher=[[NIOSH]] | date=1 July 2016 | accessdate=15 July 2016}} – ''text copied from this public-domain source: public domain, PD-USGov''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wearing long sleeves and trousers
*Wearing leather gloves
*Shaking out clothing, bedding, bathroom towels or shoes before using them on.
*Workers with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings should consider carrying an epinephrine auto injector (EpiPen) and should wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace stating their allergy.

====Treatment====
[[First aid]] for scorpion stings is generally [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]]. It includes strong [[Analgesic|analgesia]], either systemic ([[opioid]]s or [[paracetamol]]) or locally applied (such as a [[Cold compression therapy|cold compress]]). [[Hypertensive emergency|Cases of very high blood pressure]] are treated with [[anxiolytic|anxiety-relieving medications]] and [[Vasodilation|medications which lower the blood pressure by widening the diameter of blood vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Adriaan Hopperus Buma |author2=David G.

[[Antivenom]] is the specific treatment for scorpion envenomation combined with supportive measures including vasodilators in patients with cardiovascular toxic effects and [[benzodiazepine]]s when there is neuromuscular involvement. Although rare, severe [[hypersensitivity reaction]]s including [[anaphylaxis]] to scorpion antivenin (SAV) are possible.&lt;ref name="10.4103/0972-5229.164807"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bhoite RR |author2=Bhoite GR |author3=Bagdure DN |author4=Bawaskar HS |title=Anaphylaxis to scorpion antivenin and its management following envenomation by Indian red scorpion, Mesobuthus tamulus |journal=[[Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine]] |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=547–549 |year=2015 |doi=10.4103/0972-5229.164807 |pmc=4578200 |pmid=26430342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-chain scorpion toxins constitute the largest group of [[potassium]] (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel blocking peptides; an important physiological role of the [[KCNA3]] channel, also known as K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3, is to help maintain large electrical gradients for the sustained transport of ions such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that controls [[T lymphocyte]] (T cell) proliferation. Thus K&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.3 blockers could be potential [[immunosuppressant]]s for the treatment of autoimmune disorders (such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]]).&lt;ref name="pmid15120495"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K.

'''Shep''' was the name given to a [[herding dog]] that appeared at the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] station one day in 1936 in [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]], [[Montana]] and watched as his deceased master's casket was loaded onto the train and left. The dog remained at the station, waiting for his master to return for the next five and a half years, until he was killed by an incoming train in 1942.

==History==
The dog once belonged to an unknown sheep herder near Fort Benton, Montana. When his owner became ill in August 1936, he went into St. Clare Hospital at Fort Benton for treatment, and brought his herding dog with him. A few days later he died, and his relatives back east sent for his body. The dog followed his casket to the railroad station and watched while it was being loaded on a train heading to the eastern USA. He would greet every train that arrived each day after that, expecting his master to return.

It took station employees some time to realize that the body in the casket was probably the dog's master, and it was showing up for each incoming train to see if his master would be getting off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Miniclier, Kit |title=Faithful dog Shep honored in rites 50 years after death |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&amp;p_theme=dp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB1DA896D99ADF5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[The Denver Post]] |publisher=Newsbank |date=January 15, 1992 |pages=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog was later given the name ''Shep'' and the station employees took care of him and he lived in and around the station, becoming well known to everyone who passed through.

A few years into his time at the station, Shep and his story was featured in ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''.&lt;ref name=Shirley&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirley |first=Gayle C. |title=Amazing Animals of Montana |year= |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=0-7627-3855-3 |pages=43–44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxW7OBJqBh4C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Shep%22+%22Ripley%27s%22+%22Believe+it+or+not%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JzsPDwa0IR&amp;sig=6eCcGDGgFc_NLARC86ZFbaQyhU4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA44,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shep kept this daily vigil for almost six years until he was run over by a train on January 12, 1942. It is believed that his front paws were on one of the rails and he simply did not hear the train until it was too late, and he slipped off the rail. The train's engineer could not stop the train in time.&lt;ref name=Shirley /&gt;

A few days later, Shep's funeral was attended by nearly everyone in Fort Benton. "[[Eulogy on the Dog]]", though written for another dog, was read at the funeral. Boy Scout Troop 47, who were the pallbearers and honor guard for Shep, helped carry his coffin to the dog’s grave on a lonely bluff, a hillside overlooking the town. The Great Northern Railroad put up a simple obelisk, with a painted wooden cutout of Shep next to it. Just beneath, white stones spelled out SHEP. Lights illuminated the display at night.

The passenger line eventually stopped coming through Fort Benton, and the grave fell into disrepair. In 1988, the grave was repaired and refurbished. The Shep cutout is now painted steel, and lights are back up. The grave site is currently maintained by the Kiwanis Key Club and Fort Benton Community Improvement Society, and a small parking area and walking trail have been added behind the monument for easier access to the grave site.

Shep's collar and bowl were put on display at [[Museum of the Upper Missouri]], [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]], [[Montana]].

Shep's story is retold as historical fiction in ''Shep Forever Faithful'' by Stewart H. Beveridge and Lee Nelson.

The folk song "Ol Shep", sung by [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], is related but tells a different story.

'''Silverpit crater''' is a buried sub-sea structure under the [[North Sea]] off the coast of the island of [[Great Britain]]. The 20&amp;nbsp;km crater-like form,&lt;ref name="sa02"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stewart SA, Allen PJ |title=A 20-km-diameter multi-ringed impact structure in the North Sea|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=418 | issue=6897 | year=2002 | pages=520–3 | pmid=12152076|doi=10.1038/nature00914|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..520S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stentor Danielson (2002).

Its meteor impact origin was first proposed and widely reported in 2002.&lt;ref name="sa02"/&gt; If correct, it would be the first [[impact crater]] identified in or near [[Great Britain]]. Its age was proposed to lie somewhere in a 29-million year interval between 74 – 45 million years (Late [[Cretaceous]] – [[Eocene]]).&lt;ref name="sa05"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Stewart, S.

However, the interpretation is controversial and other authors have disputed its extraterrestrial origin. An alternative origin has been proposed in which the feature was created by withdrawal of rock support by salt mobility.&lt;ref name="u04"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Underhill J.R. | title=Earth science: an alternative origin for the 'Silverpit crater' | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=428 | issue=6980 | year=2004|pages=280|pmid=15029895 | doi=10.1038/nature02476|bibcode = 2004Natur.428.....U }}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

False colours indicate depth (red/yellow=shallow; blue/purple=deep). (Image credit:Phil Allen (Production Geoscience Ltd) and Simon Stewart (BP))]]

The crater-like structure was discovered by petroleum geoscientists Simon Stewart and Philip Allen. Analyzing [[reflection seismology|seismic]] data for a region 130&amp;nbsp;km off the [[Humber]] [[estuary]],  Allen noticed an unusual set of concentric rings. Thinking they resembled a meteor-strike but lacking experience in impact structures, he hung an image of them on the wall of his office, hoping someone else might be able to shed light on the mystery.  Stewart, who had long predicted that a crater would be found on 3D seismic data, saw the image and suggested it might be an impact feature.  The discovery of the crater and the impact hypothesis were reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="sa02"/&gt;

Silverpit crater is named after the [[Silver Pit]] fishing grounds in which it is located. The name is given by [[fishermen]] to a large elongated [[Depression (geology)|depression]]  in the bed of the North Sea, which is thought to be an old [[river valley]] formed while the sea level was lower during the [[Ice Age]]. The structure currently lies below a layer of [[sediment]] up to 1,500&amp;nbsp;m thick, which forms the bed of the North Sea at a depth of about 40&amp;nbsp;m.  Stewart and Allen's studies suggest that at the time of its formation, the area was under 50 to 300&amp;nbsp;m of water.&lt;ref name="sa02" /&gt;

Only three years before the announcement of the discovery of the Silverpit crater, it had been suggested that seismic data from the North Sea would have a good chance of containing evidence of an impact crater: given the rate of crater formation on the Earth and the size of the North Sea, the [[Expected value|expected number]] of impact craters would be one.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The origin of the crater is currently being hotly debated by the Geoscience community with alternate theories of salt withdrawal and pull-apart basin&lt;ref name="ks01"&gt;{{cite journal | author=K. Smith | title= The North Sea Silverpit Crater: impact structure or pull-apart basin? | journal=Journal of the Geological Society |year=2004|volume=161|pages=593–602 | doi= 10.1144/0016-764903-140 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed, raising doubts as to Silverpit's categorization as an impact structure.&lt;ref name="tos01"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K. Thomson |author2=P. Owen |author3=K. Smith | title= Discussion on the North Sea Silverpit Crater: impact structure or pull-apart basin? | journal=Journal of the Geological Society | year=2005|volume=162|pages=217–220 | doi= 10.1144/0016-764904-070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence in favour of impact origin===
Other mechanisms for producing a crater were considered and rejected by Allen and Stewart when they discovered the crater.  [[Volcanism]] was excluded because there were no [[magnetism|magnetic]] anomalies in the crater, which would be expected if eruptions had occurred there.  Withdrawal of salt deposits below the crater, known to be a mechanism for the formation of some craters, was ruled out because the [[Triassic]] and [[Permian]] layers of rock beneath the crater appeared to be undisturbed.  Another strong indication that an impact had created the crater was the presence of a central peak - something that Stewart &amp; Allen contend is difficult to form except through a meteorite impact.

===Evidence for alternative interpretations===
Analysis of regional 2D seismic lines and 3D seismic volumes by [[John R. Underhill|John Underhill]], a [[geologist]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], led to the counterproposal that withdrawal of Upper Permian (Zechstein Supergroup) salt at depth was in fact a better explanation.&lt;ref name="u04" /&gt; Underhill found that all layers of rock down to the [[Permian]] (with an age of about 250 million years) are [[syncline|synclinically]] folded, and that sediments of Tertiary age at the crater onlap its sides and thicken into its axis, suggesting that the salt was moving (a process called halokinesis) while Tertiary sediments were being laid down.&lt;ref name="u04" /&gt;

In 2007, Underhill continued to present evidence that he argues does not support the impact hypothesis. After analyzing seismic data over a wide region, he proposed that Silverpit was just one of many similar features related to the withdrawal of the Permian-age [[Zechstein]] salt. This result was presented at the April 2007 annual meeting of the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] &lt;ref name="fildes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6503543.stm|title=UK impact crater debate heats up|author=Fildes, Jonathan|date=2007-03-30|accessdate=2007-03-30|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underhill then focused his research attention upon understanding why the salt moves where it does when it does and why the so-called crater took the form that it did. This led him to publish a peer-review article in the journal, ''[[Petroleum Geoscience]]''&lt;ref name="Underhill"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Underhill J.R. | year = 2009 | title = Role of intrusion-induced salt mobility in controlling the formation of the enigmatic "Silverpit Crater", UK Southern North Sea | url = | journal = Petroleum Geoscience | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 197–216 | doi = 10.1144/1354-079309-843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 2009 in which he outlined the evidence for an intrusion-related salt withdrawal cause for the feature's formation.

In October 2009, an open debate of the notion that "the Silverpit Crater was formed by meteor impact" was held at the Geological Society of London. Simon Stewart gave the case for the motion and John Underhill presented the case against. The outcome was overwhelming support for Underhill's alternative genesis through melt-induced salt withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:Silverpit crater seismic map.jpg|thumb|Seismic data showing the crater and its concentric ring structure (Image credit:Phil Allen (PGL) and Simon Stewart (BP))]]

Silverpit crater is about 3&amp;nbsp;km wide at the top Cretaceous level.&lt;ref name="sa05" /&gt; Unusually for a terrestrial crater, it is surrounded by a set of concentric rings, which extend to about 10&amp;nbsp;km radius from the centre.  These rings give the crater a somewhat similar appearance to [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla]] crater on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], and other craters on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].&lt;ref name="as03"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allen P.J. |author2=Stewart S.A. | title=Silverpit: the morphology of a terrestrial multi-ringed impact structure | journal=Lunar and Planetary Science | year=2003|volume=XXXIV|pages=1351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally, multi-ringed craters tend to be much larger than Silverpit, and so, if the impact hypothesis is correct, the origin of Silverpit's rings is subject to debate.  A complicating factor is that almost all known impact craters are on land, despite the fact that two-thirds of impacting objects will land in [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s, so the results of impacts on [[water]] are much less well established than those of impacts on land. Compare the [[Chesapeake Bay impact crater]], probably the most thoroughly studied marine impact zone.

One possibility is that after the impact excavated a bowl-shaped depression, soft material surrounding it slumped towards the centre, leaving the concentric rings.  It is thought that for this to happen, the soft material would have to be quite a thin layer, with more brittle material on top.  A thin layer of mobile material beneath a solid crust is easy to understand in the context of icy moons, but is not a common occurrence on the rocky bodies of the solar system.  One suggestion is that overpressured [[chalk]] below the surface may have acted as the soft mobile layer.&lt;ref name="ctm03"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Collins G.S. |author2=Turtle E.P. |author3=Melosh H.J. | title=Numerical Simulations of Silverpit Crater Collapse | booktitle=Impact Cratering: Bridging the Gap Between Modeling and Observations | year=2003 | pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
If one assumes the meteor impact theory is right, the size of the crater can be combined with assumptions about the speed of an impacting object to estimate the size of the impactor itself.  Impacting objects are generally moving at speeds of the order of 20&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;[[kilometer per second|km/s]], and at these speeds an object about 120&amp;nbsp;m (393 feet) across and with a mass of 2.0&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (2 million tonnes) would be required to form a Silverpit-sized crater, if the object was rocky. If it had been a [[comet]], the crater would have been larger.

For comparison, the object which struck the Earth at [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] is estimated to have measured approximately 9.6&amp;nbsp;km (6 miles) across, while the object responsible for the [[Tunguska event]] in 1908 is thought to have been a comet or asteroid about 60&amp;nbsp;m (196 feet) across, with a mass of about 4&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="f99"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Foschini L.|title=A solution for the Tunguska event|journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] | year=1999 | volume=342 | pages=L1|arxiv = astro-ph/9808312 |bibcode = 1999A&amp;A...342L...1F }} [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808312 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

An object 120&amp;nbsp;m (393 feet) across smashing into the sea at many kilometers per second would generate enormous [[tsunami]]s. Scientists are currently searching for any evidence of large tsunamis in the surrounding areas dating from around that time, but no such evidence has been uncovered yet.

==Age==
The position of the crater within the layers of rock and sediment on the sea floor could in theory be used to constrain its age: sediments laid down before the crater's formation might conceivably be disturbed by the impact, while those laid down afterwards will not.  In their discovery paper, Allen and Stewart stated that Silverpit was formed in [[Cretaceous]] [[chalk]] and [[Jurassic]] [[shale]], but is covered by an undisturbed layer of [[Paleogene]] sediment.&lt;ref name="sa02" /&gt; The Cretaceous Period ended about 66 million years ago, but, on the evidence of nearby boreholes, the lowermost Paleogene sediments appear to be absent.  Thus the age of the Silverpit event was initially stated to lie somewhere between 66 and 60 million years before present. However, after a more detailed apprasial of the seismic data, Allen and Stewart gave a more cautious estimate of the age as between 74 – 45 million years (Late [[Cretaceous]] – [[Eocene]]).&lt;ref name="sa05" /&gt;

The [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] method of estimating the age of a crater is somewhat crude and imprecise, and the result is questioned by Underhill's non-impact hypothesis.&lt;ref name="u04" /&gt;  Assuming an impact origin, other possible ways of dating the event include looking for evidence of ejecta material such as [[tektite]]s, and deposits from the hypothesised tsunami, which might be found anywhere around the North Sea basin.&lt;ref name="fildes" /&gt;  As well as allowing a more accurate age determination, finding such evidence would also strengthen the impact hypothesis.  Two nearby oil exploration wells penetrate the ring system, yet cutting samples from these fail to provide any independent support for the meteor theory, thus weakening the case for it being due to an extraterrestrial body.

Analysis of samples taken directly from the central crater would also assist age determination as well as confirm one or other of the proposed theories; until this has occurred Silverpit cannot be confirmed as an impact structure.

==Multiple Impact Hypothesis==
[[Image:Valhalla crater on Callisto.jpg|thumb|Silverpit bears a stronger resemblance to [[Valhalla (crater)|Valhalla crater]] on [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] than it does to other terrestrial [[pit crater|craters]]]]

The early estimate of the age of the Silverpit event, stated as 66 – 60 million years before present, overlaps with the age of the Chicxulub impact near the northwest corner of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], which occurred 66 million years ago and probably played a major role in the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s. Several other large impact craters of around the same age have been discovered, all between [[latitude]]s 20°N and 70°N, leading to the speculative hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened all at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Double space strike 'caused dinosaur extinction' https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11112417&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with Jupiter in 1994 proved that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet fragments should collide with a [[planet]].  Comets frequently undergo gravitational interactions with the [[gas giant]]s, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past.

While this scenario may have occurred on Earth 66 million years ago, evidence for this hypothesis is not strong. In particular, the ages of some of the possibly related craters are only known to an accuracy of a few million years.&lt;ref&gt;What Really Killed the Dinosaurs?:“An asteroid 65 million years ago” is no longer enough. http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/animal_forecast/2013/02/dinosaur_extinction_was_an_asteroid_the_only_cause_of_the_cretaceous_mass.single.html#correction&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the now widely held previously stated belief that Silverpit was not formed by [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impact reduces the possibility of it being involved in this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;North Sea crater shows its scars http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4360815.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Even if it were formed by bolide impact, the increased uncertainty in the age estimate for Silverpit to 74 – 45 million years further weakens the hypothesis.

'''Stoning''', or '''lapidation''', is a method of [[capital punishment]] whereby a group throws [[stones]] at a person until the subject dies. No individual among the group can be identified as the one who kills the subject. This is in contrast to the case of a judicial [[executioner]]. Often slower than other forms of execution, stoning within the context of contemporary [[Western culture]] is considered a form of [[Torturous death|execution by torture]].

Stoning is called ''[[rajm]]'' (Arabic: {{large|رجم}}) in Islamic literature, and is a legal or customary punishment found in the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Yemen]], northern [[Nigeria]], [[Aceh|Aceh Province]] of [[Indonesia]], [[Afghanistan]], and tribal parts of [[Pakistan]], including northwest [[Kurram Valley]] and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region.&lt;ref name=ebtrf/&gt;&lt;ref name="cell phone stoning"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/special-report-the-punishment-was-death-by-stoning-the-crime-having-a-mobile-phone-8846585.html|author=Batha, Emma|title=Special report: The punishment was death by stoning.

{{Main|Religion and capital punishment#Judaism|Judaism and violence}}

====Torah====
The Jewish [[Torah]] (the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]]: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]) serves as a common religious reference for [[Judaism]]. Stoning is the method of execution mentioned most frequently in the Torah. (Murder is not mentioned as an offense punishable by stoning, but it seems that a member of the victim's family was allowed to kill the murderer; see [[avenger of blood]].) The crimes punishable by stoning were the following:

* Touching [[Mount Sinai]] while God was giving [[Moses]] the [[Ten Commandments]], {{bible|Exodus|19:13}}
* An ox that gores someone to death should be stoned, {{bible|Exodus|21:28}}
* Breaking [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], {{bible|Numbers|15:32}}–36
* Giving one's "seed" (presumably [[ child sacrifice]] of one's offspring) "[[Moloch|to Molech]]" {{Bible|Leviticus| 20:2}}-5
* Having a "[[familiar spirit]]" (or being a [[necromancy|necromancer]]) or being a "[[magician (paranormal)|wizard]]", {{bible|Leviticus|20:27}}
* Enticing others to polytheism, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–11
* [[Blasphemy|Cursing God]], {{bible|Leviticus|24:10}}–16
* Engaging in [[idolatry]], Deuteronomy 17:2–7; or seducing others to do so, {{bible|Deuteronomy|13:7}}–12
* "Rebellion" against parents, after repeated warnings, {{bible|Deuteronomy|21:18}}–21
* Getting married as though a virgin, when not a virgin, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:13}}–21
* Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a town, since she did not cry out, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:23}}–24; both parties should be stoned to death
* Forced sexual intercourse between a man and a woman engaged to another man in a field, where no one could hear her cries and save her, {{bible|Deuteronomy|22:25}}–27; the man should be stoned

Describing the stoning of those who entice others to [[Apostasy from Judaism|apostates from Judaism]], the [[Torah]] states:
{{quote|If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which [is] as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, ''Let us go and serve other gods'', which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; [Namely], of the gods of the people which [are] round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the [one] end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; ''neither shall thine eye pity him'', neither shalt thou spare, ''neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him''; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.|[[Deuteronomy]] 13:6–10&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.apostolic-churches.net/bible/search/list/?search_book=Deuteronomy&amp;search_chapter_verse=13&amp;varchapter_verse=13:6 13:6–10]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A case noted in the Bible, not falling into any of the above categories, was that of [[Achan (biblical figure)|Achan]], stoned to death [[Collective responsibility|together with]] his sheep, other livestock and his children for having pillaged valuables from [[Jericho]] during [[Joshua]]'s [[Conquest of Canaan]].

====Mishna====
The [[Talmud]] describes four methods of execution: stoning, pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned person, beheading, and strangulation (see [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]]). The [[Mishna]] gives the following list of persons who should be stoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] Chapter 7, p.&amp;nbsp;53a [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/sanhedrin7.html], in Hebrew: [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4407.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt;

"To the following sinners stoning applies – אלו הן הנסקלין
*one who has had [[Incest|relations with his mother]] – הבא על האם
*with his father's wife – ועל אשת האב
*with his daughter-in-law – ועל הכלה
*a human male [[homosexuality|with a human male]] – ועל הזכור
*or [[zoophilia|with cattle]] – ועל הבהמה
*and the same is the case with a woman who uncovers herself before cattle – והאשה המביאה את הבהמה
*with a blasphemer – והמגדף
*an idolater – והעובד עבודת כוכבים
*he who sacrifices one of his children to Molech – והנותן מזרעו למולך
*one that occupies himself with familiar spirits – ובעל אוב
*a wizard – וידעוני
*one who violates Sabbath – והמחלל את השבת
*one who curses his father or mother – והמקלל אביו ואמו
*one who has assaulted a betrothed damsel – והבא על נערה המאורסה
*a seducer who has seduced men to worship idols – והמסית
*and the one who misleads a whole town – והמדיח
*a witch (male or female) – והמכשף
*a stubborn and rebellious son – ובן סורר ומורה"

As God alone was deemed to be the only arbiter in the use of capital punishment, not fallible people, the [[Sanhedrin]] made stoning a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Sanhedrin 41 a)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Botticcelli, Sandro - The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron - 1481-82.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''[[The Punishment of Korah and the Stoning of Moses and Aaron]]'' (1480–1482), by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].]]

Prior to early Christianity, particularly in the [[Mishnah]], doubts were growing in Jewish society about the effectiveness of capital punishment in general (and stoning in particular) in acting as a useful deterrent. Subsequently, its use was dissuaded by the central legislators. The Mishnah states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says that this extends to a Sanhedrin that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel.&lt;ref name = "Tractate makkos"&gt;[[makkot]] 1:10 March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the following centuries the leading Jewish sages imposed so many restrictions on the implementation of capital punishment as to make it ''de facto'' illegal. The restrictions were to prevent execution of the innocent, and included many conditions for a testimony to be admissible that were difficult to fulfill.

Philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] wrote, "It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death."&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, Sefer Hamitzvot, Negative Commandment no. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; He was concerned that the law guard its public perception, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect. He saw errors of commission as much more threatening to the integrity of law than errors of omission.&lt;ref&gt;Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg. Comm. 290'', at 269–71 (Charles B. Chavel trans., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mode of Judgment====
In rabbinic law, capital punishment may only be inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony of at least two qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that the culprit had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=128&amp;letter=C&amp;search=stoning |title=Capital Punishment |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culprit must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of the culprit's free will and without the aid of others.

On the day the verdict is pronounced, the convict is led forth to execution. The [[Torah Laws|Torah law]] (Leviticus 19:18) prescribes, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"; and the Rabbis maintain that this love must be extended beyond the limits of social intercourse in life, and applied even to the convicted criminal who, "though a sinner, is still thy brother" (Mak. 3:15; Sanh. 44a): "The spirit of love must be manifested by according him a decent death" (Sanh. 45a, 52a). Torah law provides (Deut. 24:16), "The parents shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the parents; every man shall be put to death for his own sins", and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. A sentence is not attended by confiscation of the convict's goods; the person's possessions descend to their legal heirs.

The [[Talmud]] limits the use of the death penalty to Jewish criminals who:

* (A) while about to do the crime were warned not to commit the crime while in the presence of two witnesses (and only individuals who meet a strict list of standards are considered acceptable witnesses); and
* (B) having been warned, committed the crime in front of the same two witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/orthodoxfaqenkin/f/adultery_punish.htm |title=Ask the Orthodox Rabbi – Adultery in Judaism – Capital Punishment – Death Penalty |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the Talmudic method of how stoning is to be carried out differs from mob stoning. According to the Jewish [[oral law]], after the Jewish criminal has been determined as guilty before the Great [[Sanhedrin]], the two valid witnesses and the sentenced criminal go to the edge of a two-story building. From there the two witnesses are to push the criminal off the roof of a two-story building. The two-story height is chosen as this height is estimated by the Talmud to effect a quick and painless demise but is not so high that the body will become dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Babylon Talmud|page= Sanhedrin 45a}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the criminal has fallen, the two witnesses are to drop a large boulder onto the criminal – requiring both of the witnesses to lift the boulder together. If the criminal did not die from the fall or from the crushing of the large boulder, then any people in the surrounding area are to quickly cause him to die by stoning with whatever rocks they can find.

[[File:Amellie - Stoning of the devil 2006 Hajj.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Stoning of the Devil]], 2006 [[Hajj]]]]
Islamic [[sharia law]] is based on the [[Quran]] and the [[hadith]] as primary sources.

====Quran====
The Qur'an does not mention the act of [[Rajm|stoning (Rajm)]] for any crime.

Contrary to popular belief, the punishment for [[Zina|Adultery (Zina)]] in the Quran is not stoning to death but [[flogging]] with a 100 lashes (if the accuser can provide 4 witnesses to the act). If the accuser cannot produce 4 witnesses, he himself will be punished by flogging with 80 lashes. 
	 
{{quotation|"The woman and the man guilty of fornication/adultery,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment."| Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	 	
{{quotation|"And those who accuse chaste women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them, (giving) eighty stripes, and do not admit any evidence from them ever; and these it is that are the transgressors. Except those who repent after this and act aright, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." | Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 4-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|4|e=5|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Hadith====
[[Hadith]] refers to orally transmitted reports of statements or actions attributed to Muhammad. It was [[Hadith of Umar's ban on hadith|forbidden]] to record any Hadith on paper by Muhammad himself, [[Rashidun|the first 4 righteous Caliphs after the death of Muhammed]] and the later Caliphs. They believed the Quran was clear, fully detailed, complete, perfect and sufficient. There were fears that people would confuse hadith with the Qur'an, influence would seep in from other creeds, fear for fabrications by heretics,for personal or political gain. The first Hadith (that have survived) were recorded 200 years after the prophets death. There were tens of thousands [[Muhaddis|Muhaddiths]] who had each memorised at least 400,000 narrations along with the chain of narrators for each narration. Out of the hundreds of thousands of Hadith only a very, very small percentage were declared authentic (Sahih) by Hadith Scholars. Hadith Scholars used a number of methods of evaluation to determine the veracity of the recorded oral reports. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, the individual narrators involved in its transmission and cross-referincing the reports.

Muslims vary in degrees of acceptance of the Hadith. To many Sunnite and Shiite Muslims (different collections of) the hadith are almost on par with the Quran itself. To others the Quran is the word of Allah but the Hadith are the words and deeds of a human (the prophet Muhammed) transmitted down by the 200 years old fallible memory of men. Useful but not completely reliable. Some Muslims give little to no credence to the Hadith. Then there are also the different sets of Hadith accepted by different branches of Islam ([[Nikah mut'ah|Temporary Marriage]] or [[Female Genital Mutilation]]) who consider each other's Hadith fake.

Stoning in the [[Sunnah]] mainly follows on the Jewish stoning rules of the Torah. A few hadiths refer to Muhammad ordering the stoning of a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} Jewish man and a married{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}} woman committing an illegal sexual act after consulting the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|93|633}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|56|829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated Ibn 'Umar: A Jew and Jewess were brought to the Prophet on a charge of committing an illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet asked the Jews, "What do you (usually) do with them?" They said, "We blacken their faces and disgrace them." He said, "Bring here the Torah and recite it, if you are truthful." They (fetched it and) came and asked a one-eyed man to recite. He went on reciting till he reached a portion on which he put his hand. The Prophet said, "Lift up your hand!" He lifted his hand up and behold, there appeared the verse of Ar-Rajm (stoning of the adulterers to death). Then he said, "O Muhammad! They should be stoned to death but we conceal this Divine Law among ourselves." Then the Prophet ordered that the two sinners be stoned to death and, and they were stoned to death, and I saw the man protecting the woman from the stones.| ''Volume 9, Book 93, Number 633: (See Hadith No. 809, Vol. 8)''}}

{{quotation|Narrated by 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:The Jews came to Allah's Apostle and told him that a man and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah's Apostle said to them, "What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?" They replied, (But) we announce their crime and lash them." Abdullah bin Salam said, "You are telling a lie; Torah contains the order of Rajm." They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, "Lift your hand." When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written there. They said, "Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. ('Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the stones."|''Volume 4, Book 56, Number 829:''}}

In a few others, a Bedouin man is lashed, while a Jewish woman is stoned to death, for having sex outside marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|50|885}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|3|49|860}}, {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=no|8|82|821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is described as punishment in multiple hadiths.&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt;&lt;ref name=kalu/&gt; [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamah]]. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in [[Kitab al-Kafi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafed.net/books/hadith/wasael-20/v16.html Rafed.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-Arabic-Ask_Scholar/FatwaA/FatwaA&amp;cid=1122528602718 Islamonline.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people results in 100 lashes.

[[Hadith]]s describe stoning as punishment under [[sharia]].&lt;ref name=nisrine&gt;Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, {{ISBN|978-1905221417}}, pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kalu&gt;OU Kalu (2003), Safiyya and Adamah: Punishing adultery with sharia stones in twenty‐first‐century Nigeria, African Affairs, 102(408), pp. 389-408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KB Khan (2014), Versions and Subversions of Islamic Cultures in the Film The Stoning of Soraya, Journal of Literary Studies, 30(3), pp. 149-167&lt;/ref&gt; In others stoning is prescribed as punishment for illegal sex between man and woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|8|3435}}&lt;/ref&gt; illegal sex by a slave girl, as well as anyone involved in any homosexual relations.&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[sunnah]], the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4421}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=no|abudawud|38|4429}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z Maghen (2005), Virtues Of The Flesh: Passion and Purity In Early Islamic Jurisprudence, Studies in Islamic Law and Society, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004140707}}, pp 155&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Narrated by [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]] and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: A bedouin came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's apostle! I ask you by Allah to judge My case according to Allah's Laws." His opponent, who was more learned than he, said, "Yes, judge between us according to Allah's Laws, and allow me to speak." Allah's Apostle said, "Speak." He (i .e. the bedouin or the other man) said, "My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of this (man) must be stoned to death." Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled for one year.

====Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)====
Stoning (Arabic: رجم ''Rajm'', sometimes spelled as ''Rajam'') has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ismail Poonwala (2004), The Pillars of Islam: Laws pertaining to human intercourse, Oxford University Press, Oxford University Press, pp. 448-457&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Islamic concept of ''Li'an'', the testimony of a man who accuses his own wife without any other witnesses may be accepted if he swears by God four times that he is telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his wife counter swears, no punishment will be enforced.&lt;ref name="lian"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi|title=Tafhim al-Qur'an, Surah An Noor (The Light)|url=http://englishtafsir.com/Quran/24/index.html#sdfootnote7sym|website=englishtafsir.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran 24:6-9, Quote - "And for those who launch a charge against their spouses, and have (in support) no evidence but their own― their solitary evidence (can be received) if they bear witness four times (with an oath) by Allah that they are solemnly telling the truth; And the fifth (oath) (should be) that they solemnly invoke the curse of Allah on themselves if they tell a lie. But it would avert the punishment from the wife, if she bears witness four times (with an oath) by Allah, that (her husband) is telling a lie; And the fifth (oath) should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of Allah on herself if (her accuser) is telling the truth. "&lt;/ref&gt;
 
One of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]]'' by [[Malik ibn Anas]], state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Muwatta {{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=no|41|1|8|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanafi
[[Hanafi]] jurists have held that the accused must be a ''muhsan'' at the time of religiously disallowed sex, to be punished by ''Rajm'' (stoning).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A ''Muhsan'' is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists.&lt;ref name=osismuhsan&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1587 Muhsan] The Oxford Dictionary of Islam (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).&lt;ref name=es8&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

For evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witness is not acceptable).&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; One, when the punishment is based on ''bayyina'', or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest.&lt;ref name=es8b/&gt; The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] and other Hanafi scholars.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt; In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the [[qadi]] (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

Hanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for ''Rajm'', to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.&lt;ref name=es8/&gt;

[[Hanafi]]s have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the ''qadi'' must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.&lt;ref name=rp&gt;Rudolph Peters, Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521796705}}, pp. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

;Shafi'i
The [[Shafii]] school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.&lt;ref name=es8b&gt;Elyse Semerdjian (2008), "Off the Straight Path": Illicit Sex, Law, and Community in Ottoman Aleppo, Syracuse University Press, {{ISBN|978-0815631736}}, pp. 23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hanbali
[[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudamah]] states, "Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of [[Kharijite]]s."&lt;ref name="IslamOnline.net"&gt;{{cite web | author = IslamOnline.net | title = Stoning: Does It Have Any Basis in Shari`ah? | url = http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | accessdate = 2010-07-25 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616223242/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545902 | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanbali Islamic law sentences all forms of consensual but religiously illegal sex as punishable with ''Rajm''.&lt;ref&gt;Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, {{ISBN|978-1905221417}}, pp. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt;

;Maliki
[[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men.&lt;ref name=nisrine/&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]], founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of [[zina]]. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="osismuhsan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of "sleeping embryo", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McGarvey | first=Kathleen | title=Muslim and Christian women in dialogue : the case of northern Nigeria | publisher=Peter Lang | location=Oxford New York | year=2009 | isbn=978-3-03911-417-7 | pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Methods

In the 2008 version of the [[Hudud|Islamic Penal Code]] of Iran detailed how stoning punishments are to be carried out for adultery, and even hints in some contexts that the punishment may allow for its victims to avoid death:&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions&gt;Amnesty International (2008), [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE13/001/2008/en/ Iran - End executions by Stoning]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 102 – An adulterous man shall be buried in a ditch up to near his waist and an adulterous woman up to near her chest and then stoned to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 103 – In case the person sentenced to stoning escapes the ditch in which they are buried, then if the adultery is proven by testimony then they will be returned for the punishment but if it is proven by their own confession then they will not be returned.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 104 – The size of the stone used in stoning shall not be too large to kill the convict by one or two throws and at the same time shall not be too small to be called a stone.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Depending upon the details of the case, the stoning may be initiated by the judge overseeing the matter or by one of the original witnesses to the adultery.&lt;ref name=AmnestyEndExecutions /&gt; Certain religious procedures may also need to be followed both before and after the implementation of a stoning execution, such as wrapping the person being stoned in traditional burial dress before the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/11/20/graphic-anatomy-of-a-stoning/|title=Anatomy of a stoning – How the law is applied in Iran - National Post|author=Richard Johnson|date=20 November 2010|work=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Since the sharia legal system was introduced in the predominantly Muslim north of [[Nigeria]] in 2000, more than a dozen Nigerian Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning for sexual offences ranging from adultery to homosexuality.

As part of [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] measures, stoning to death (''[[rajm]]'') at a public place  was introduced into law via the 1979 [[Hudood Ordinances]] as punishment for adultery (''zina'') and rape (''zina-bil-jabr'') when committed by a married person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Martin|title=Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances- A Review|journal=Washington and Lee Law Review|date=1 September 2007|volume=64|issue=4|pages=1292, 1296 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=wlulr |accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=ML252007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, stoning has never been officially utilized since the law came into effect and all judicial executions occur by hanging.&lt;ref name=GallowPak&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow March to the Gallows: Death Penalty in Pakistan|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Pakistan464angconjointpdm.pdf|website=/www.fidh.org|publisher=Intl.

A conviction for adultery of Safia Bibi, a 13-year-old blind girl who alleged that she was raped by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism. Another conviction for adultery and sentence of stoning (of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar) in early 1988 sparked outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court. In this case the trial court took the view that notice of divorce by Shahida's former husband, Khushi Muhammad, should have been given to the Chairman of the local council, as stipulated under Section-7(3) of the ''Muslim Family Laws Ordinance'', 1961. This section states that any man who divorces his wife must register it with the Union Council. Otherwise, the court concluded that the divorce stood invalidated and the couple became liable to conviction under the Adultery ordinance. In 2006, the ordinances providing for stoning in the case of adultery or rape were legislatively demoted from overriding status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Protection of Women Act, 2006 (Pakistan)|url=http://af.org.pk/PDF/Newsletters/Issue%2024%20apr%20jun%2008.pdf|website=af.org.pk|publisher=Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2015|location=Islamabad|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in 2013 found varying support in the global Muslim population for stoning as a punishment for adultery (sex between people where at least one person is married; when both participants are unmarried they get 100 lashes). Highest support for stoning is found in Muslims of the Middle East-North Africa region and South-Asian countries while generally less support is found in Muslims living in the Mediterranean and Central Asian countries. Support is consistently higher  in Muslims who want [[Sharia]] to be the law of the land than in Muslims who do not want Sharia.&lt;ref name=Pewsharia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/|title=Muslim Beliefs About Sharia - Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project|date=30 April 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for stoning in various countries is as follows:

===Opposition===
Stoning has been condemned by several human rights organizations. Some groups, such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name = "amnstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Amina Lawal|year=2003|publisher=Amnesty International|url = http://www.amnesty-1312.de/Main/AminaLawal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Human Rights Watch]], oppose all capital punishment, including stoning. Other groups, such as RAWA ([[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]]), or the International Committee against Stoning (ICAS), oppose stoning ''per se'' as an especially cruel practice.

Specific sentences of stoning, such as the [[Amina Lawal]] case, have often generated international protest. Groups such as Human Rights Watch,&lt;ref name="hrwstoning"&gt;{{Cite news|first=|last=|pages=|title = Nigeria: Debunking Misconceptions on Stoning Case|year = 2003|publisher = Human Rights Watch|url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/26/nigeria-debunking-misconceptions-stoning-case}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in sympathy with these protests, have raised a concern that the Western focus on stoning as an especially "exotic" or "barbaric" act distracts from what they view as the larger problems of capital punishment. They argue that the "more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system."

In Iran, the [[Stop Stoning Forever Campaign]] was formed by various women's rights activists after a man and a woman were stoned to death in [[Mashhad]] in May 2006. The campaign's main goal is to legally abolish stoning as a form of punishment for adultery in Iran.&lt;ref name=meydaan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |author=Rochelle Terman |title=The Stop Stoning Forever Campaign: A Report |format=pdf |date=November 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128142135/http://stop-killing.org/files/Terman_stoning.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights==
Stoning is condemned by human rights groups as a form of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and [[torture]], and a serious violation of human rights.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/11/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punishments/|title=Amnesty International - Afghanistan: Reject stoning, flogging, amputation and other Taliban-era punishments|date=26 November 2013|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/31/sudan-ban-death-stoning|title=Sudan: Ban Death by Stoning - Human Rights Watch|work=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's rights===
Stoning has been condemned as a violation of [[women's rights]] and a form of [[discrimination]] against women. Although stoning is also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are reported to be women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#.Ux-4MM503IU|title=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center - Gender Inequality and Discrimination: The Case of Iranian Women|work=iranhrdc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313092405/http://www.stopstoning.net/IMG/article_PDF/article_20.pdf |date=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2idhp.eu/en/journee-internationale-de-la-femme-2012|title=2012 International Women’s Day «  Institut international des droits de l’homme et de la Paix (2IDHP)|work=2idhp.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the international group Women Living Under Muslim Laws stoning "is one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/media/activists-push-global-ban-stoning|title=Activists push for global ban on stoning|work=wluml.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International has argued that the reasons for which women suffer disproportionately from stoning include the fact that women are not treated equally and fairly by the courts; the fact that, being more likely to be [[illiterate]] than men, women are more likely to sign confessions to crimes which they did not commit; and the fact that general discrimination against women in other life aspects leaves them at higher risk of convictions for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|title=Amnesty International - Iran: Death by stoning, a grotesque and unacceptable penalty|date=15 January 2008|work=amnesty.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020184028/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/iran-death-stoning-grotesque-and-unacceptable-penalty-20080115|archive-date=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
Stoning also targets homosexuals and others who have same-sex relations in certain jurisdictions. In Mauritania,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; northern Nigeria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6940061.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gay Nigerians face Sharia death | date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; and Yemen,&lt;ref name=ebtrf /&gt; the legal punishment for [[sodomy]] is death by stoning.

===Right to private life===
Human rights organizations argue that many acts targeted by stoning should not be illegal in the first place, as outlawing them interferes with people's right to a private life. Amnesty International said that stoning deals with "acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults, and choosing one’s religion".&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

'''''The Emotion Machine: Commonsense Thinking, Artificial Intelligence, and the Future of the Human Mind '''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emotion Machine|first=Marvin|last=Minsky|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2006|isbn=0-7432-7663-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 2006 book by cognitive scientist [[Marvin Minsky]] that elaborates and expands on Minsky's ideas as presented in his earlier book ''[[Society of Mind]]''.

Minsky argues that emotions are different ways to think that our mind uses to increase our intelligence. He challenges the distinction between emotions and other kinds of thinking. His main argument is that emotions are "ways to think" for different "problem types" that exist in the world, and that the brain has rule-based mechanisms (selectors) that turn on emotions to deal with various problems. The book reviews the accomplishments of AI, why modelling an AI is difficult in terms of replicating the behaviors of humans, if and how AIs think, and in what manner they might experience struggles and pleasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2538 |title= ''The Emotion Machine'' |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Book review &amp; [http://bluerectangle.com/ textbook buyback site] BlueRectangle.com|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
In a review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[neurologist]] Richard Restak states that:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Restak, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401554.html "Mind Over Matter"], ''The Washington Post'', 17 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Minsky does a marvelous job parsing other complicated mental activities into simpler elements. ... But he is less effective in relating these emotional functions to what's going on in the brain.}}

==Outline==
Minsky outlines the book as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/Introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt;

# "''We are born with many mental resources.''"
# "''We learn from interacting with others.''"
#  "''Emotions are different Ways to Think.''"
#  "''We learn to think about our recent thoughts.''"
#  "''We learn to think on multiple levels.''"
#  "''We accumulate huge stores of commonsense knowledge.''"
#  "''We switch among different Ways to Think.''"
#  "''We find multiple ways to represent things.''"
# "''We build multiple models of ourselves.''"

'''Word2vec''' is a group of related models that are used to produce [[word embedding]]s. These models are shallow, two-layer [[neural network]]s that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large [[Text corpus|corpus of text]] and produces a [[vector space]], typically of several hundred [[dimensions]], with each unique word in the [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. [[Word vectors]] are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the space.&lt;ref name="mikolov"&gt;{{cite arXiv|first=Tomas |last=Mikolov |title=Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space|arxiv=1301.3781|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word2vec was created by a team of researchers led by Tomas Mikolov at [[Google]]. The algorithm has been subsequently analysed and explained by other researchers.&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;{{cite arXiv |first1=Yoav |last1=Goldberg |first2=Omer |last2=Levy |title=word2vec Explained: Deriving Mikolov et al.’s Negative-Sampling Word-Embedding Method|arxiv=1402.3722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extensions"&gt;{{cite AV media
|first=Radim|last=Řehůřek|title=Word2vec and friends|medium=Youtube video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTp3P2UnTfQ|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embedding vectors created using the Word2vec algorithm have many advantages compared to earlier algorithms&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt; such as [[latent semantic analysis]].

==CBOW and skip grams==
Word2vec can utilize either of two model architectures to produce a [[distributed representation]] of words: [[continuous bag-of-words]] (CBOW) or continuous [[skip-gram]]. In the continuous bag-of-words architecture, the model predicts the current word from a window of surrounding context words. The order of context words does not influence prediction ([[bag-of-words]] assumption). In the continuous skip-gram architecture, the model uses the current word to predict the surrounding window of context words.  The skip-gram architecture weighs nearby context words more heavily than more distant context words.&lt;ref name="mikolov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mikolov-nips"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Tomas |last1=Mikolov |first2=Ilya |last2=Sutskever |first3=Kai |last3=Chen |first4=Greg S. |last4=Corrado |first5=Jeff |last5=Dean |title=Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality |conference=[[Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems]] |year=2013|arxiv=1310.4546|bibcode=2013arXiv1310.4546M }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the authors' note,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/|title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting.|website=code.google.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBOW is faster while skip-gram is slower but does a better job for infrequent words.

== Parametrization ==
Results of word2vec training can be sensitive to [[parametrization]]. The following are some important parameters in word2vec training.

=== Training algorithm ===
A Word2vec model can be trained with hierarchical [[Softmax function|softmax]] and/or [[negative sampling]]. To approximate the [[conditional log-likelihood]] a model seeks to maximize, the hierarchical softmax method uses a [[Huffman coding|Huffman tree]] to reduce calculation. The negative sampling method, on the other hand, approaches the maximization problem by minimizing the [[log-likelihood]] of sampled negative instances. According to the authors, hierarchical softmax works better for infrequent words while negative sampling works better for frequent words and better with low dimensional vectors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As training epochs increase, hierarchical softmax stops being useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/word2vec-toolkit/WUWad9fL0jU/LdbWy1jQjUIJ|title=Parameter (hs &amp; negative)|last=|first=|date=|website=Google Groups|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sub-sampling ===
High frequency words often provide little information. Words with frequency above a certain threshold may be subsampled to increase training speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf|title=Visualizing Data using t-SNE|last=|first=|date=|website= Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2008. Vol. 9, pg. 2595|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensionality ===
Quality of word embedding increases with higher dimensionality. But after reaching some point, marginal gain will diminish.&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt; Typically, the dimensionality of the vectors is set to be between 100 and 1,000.

=== Context window ===
The size of the context window determines how many words before and after a given word would be included as context words of the given word. According to the authors' note, the recommended value is 10 for skip-gram and 5 for CBOW.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Extensions==
An extension of word2vec to construct embeddings from entire documents (rather than the individual words) has been proposed.&lt;ref name="doc2vec"&gt;{{cite arXiv
|first=Quoc|last=Le|title=Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents. |arxiv=1405.4053|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension is called paragraph2vec or doc2vec and has been implemented in the C, Python&lt;ref name="doc2vec_python"&gt;{{cite web

==Word vectors for bioinformatics: BioVectors==
An extension of word vectors for n-grams in [[biological]] sequences (e.g. [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[Protein]]s) for [[bioinformatic]]s applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asgari|first1=Ehsaneddin|last2=Mofrad|first2=Mohammad R.K.|title=Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences for Deep Proteomics and Genomics|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=11|page=e0141287|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141287|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141287|arxiv=1503.05140|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1041287A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of machine learning in proteomics and genomics. The results suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A similar variant, dna2vec, has shown that there is correlation between [[Needleman–Wunsch algorithm|Needleman-Wunsch]] similarity score and [[cosine similarity]] of dna2vec word vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1701.06279|first=Patrick|last=Ng|title=dna2vec: Consistent vector representations of variable-length k-mers|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word vectors for Radiology: Intelligent Word Embedding (IWE) ==
An extension of word vectors for creating a dense vector representation of unstructured radiology reports has been proposed by Banerjee et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Imon|last2=Chen|first2=Matthew C.|last3=Lungren|first3=Matthew P.|last4=Rubin|first4=Daniel L.|title=Radiology report annotation using intelligent word embeddings: Applied to multi-institutional chest CT cohort|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2017.11.012|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|volume=77|pages=11–20|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2017.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the biggest challenges with Word2Vec is how to handle unknown or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and morphologically similar words. This can particularly be an issue in domains like medicine where synonyms and related words can be used depending on the preferred style of radiologist, and words may have been used infrequently in a large corpus. If the word2vec model has not encountered a particular word before, it will be forced to use a random vector, which is generally far from its ideal representation.

IWE combines Word2vec with a semantic dictionary mapping technique to tackle the major challenges of information extraction from clinical texts, which include ambiguity of free text narrative style, lexical variations, use of ungrammatical and telegraphic phases, arbitrary ordering of words, and frequent appearance of abbreviations and acronyms.  Of particular interest, the IWE model (trained on the one institutional dataset) successfully translated to a different institutional dataset which demonstrates good generalizability of the approach across institutions.

==Analysis==
The reasons for successful [[word embedding]] learning in the word2vec framework are poorly understood. Goldberg and Levy point out that the word2vec objective function causes words that occur in similar contexts to have similar embeddings (as measured by [[cosine similarity]]) and note that this is in line with J. R. Firth's [[Distributional semantics|distributional hypothesis]]. However, they note that this explanation is "very hand-wavy" and argue that a more formal explanation would be preferable.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

Levy et al. (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Omer|last2=Goldberg|first2=Yoav|last3=Dagan|first3=Ido|title=Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings|date=2015|location=Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q15-1016}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that much of the superior performance of word2vec or similar embeddings in downstream tasks is not a result of the models per se, but of the choice of specific hyperparameters. Transferring these hyperparameters to more 'traditional' approaches yields similar performances in downstream tasks.

== Preservation of semantic and syntactic relationships ==
The word embedding approach is able to capture multiple different degrees of similarity between words. Mikolov et al. (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mikolov|first=Tomas|last2=Yih|first2=Wen-tau|last3=Zweig|first3=Geoffrey|date=2013|title=Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations.|url=|journal=HLT-NAACL|pages=746–751|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that semantic and syntactic patterns can be reproduced using vector arithmetic. Patterns such as “Man is to Woman as Brother is to Sister” can be generated through algebraic operations on the vector representations of these words such that the vector representation of “Brother” - ”Man” + ”Woman” produces a result which is closest to the vector representation of “Sister” in the model. Such relationships can be generated for a range of semantic relations (such as Country–Capital) as well as syntactic relations (e.g. present tense–past tense)

== Assessing the quality of a model ==
Mikolov et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt; develop an approach to assessing the quality of a word2vec model which draws on the semantic and syntactic patterns discussed above. They developed a set of 8,869 semantic relations and 10,675 syntactic relations which they use as a benchmark to test the accuracy of a model. When assessing the quality of a vector model, a user may draw on this accuracy test which is implemented in word2vec,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html|title=Gensim - Deep learning with word2vec|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or develop their own test set which is meaningful to the corpora which make up the model. This approach offers a more challenging test than simply arguing that the words most similar to a given test word are intuitively plausible.&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt;

=== Parameters and model quality ===
The use of different model parameters and different corpus sizes can greatly affect the quality of a word2vec model. Accuracy can be improved in a number of ways, including the choice of model architecture (CBOW or Skip-Gram), increasing the training data set, increasing the number of vector dimensions, and increasing the window size of words considered by the algorithm. Each of these improvements comes with the cost of increased computational complexity and therefore increased model generation time.&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt;

In models using large corpora and a high number of dimensions, the skip-gram model yields the highest overall accuracy, and consistently produces the highest accuracy on semantic relationships, as well as yielding the highest syntactic accuracy in most cases. However, the CBOW is less computationally expensive and yields similar accuracy results.&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt;

Accuracy increases overall as the number of words used increases, and as the number of dimensions increases. Mikolov et al.&lt;ref name="mikolov" /&gt; report that doubling the amount of training data results in an increase in computational complexity equivalent to doubling the number of vector dimensions.

Altszyler et al. (2017) &lt;ref name="Altszyler"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Altszyler, E. |author2=Ribeiro, S. | author3= Sigman, M.|author4=Fernández Slezak, D. |title=The interpretation of dream meaning: Resolving ambiguity using Latent Semantic Analysis in a small corpus of text|volume=56|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=2017|pages=178–187|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810017301034}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied Word2vec performance in two semantic tests for different corpus size. They found that Word2vec has a steep learning curve, outperforming another word-embedding technique (LSA) when it is trained with medium to large corpus size (more than 10 million words). However, with a small training corpus LSA showed better performance. Additionally they show that the best parameter setting depends on the task and the training corpus. Nevertheless, for skip-gram models trained in medium size corpora, with 50 dimensions, a window size of 15 and 10 negative samples seems to be a good parameter setting.

The term '''wrongful abortion''' refers to an [[abortion]] that a pregnant woman undergoes as a result of negligent or malicious conduct by a physician or health care provider.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Ronen &amp; Adar, Yehuda. [http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=876407 Wrongful Abortion: A Wrong in Search of a Remedy], Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law and Ethics 507 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of wrongful abortion==

There are at least two archetypal cases of wrongful abortion:

===Misinformation about pregnancy===
In a case of the first type, a pregnant woman seeks medical counseling regarding the possible perils related to the continuance of her [[pregnancy]]. The adviser mistakenly maintains that the pregnancy is fraught with substantial risks for the woman, and she consequently decides to undergo an abortion. Later it is found that the information given by the adviser was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Baker v. Gordon, 759 S.W.2d 87 (Mo. Ct. App. 1988) (available through [http://www.lexis.com LexisNexis] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110204034451/http%3A//www.lexis.com/research/checkBrowser?_m%3De8bf9563dd100577526e991462a1392b%26wchp%3DdGLbVzb%2DzSkAB%26_md5%3D00db4f6cb26ef87d538fdf7e2ef80760 |date=2011-02-04 }} and [http://www.westlaw.com Westlaw])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15031969 |year=2004 |last1=Appel |first1=J. M |title=Physicians, "wrongful life" and the Constitution |journal=Medicine and Health, Rhode Island |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=55–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misinformation about health of fetus===
In a case of the second type, the woman seeks advice concerning the health and bodily integrity of her [[fetus]] (''see'' [[genetic counseling]], [[prenatal diagnosis]]), and decides to undergo an abortion after being told that the fetus is deformed or disabled. Here, too, it is eventually realized that the information was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson v. United States, 810 F. Supp. 7 (D.D.C. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breyne v. Potter, 574 S.E.2d 916 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinez v. Long Island Jewish Hillside Med. Ctr., 512 N.E.2d 538, 538 (N.Y. 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogous terms==

===Wrongful pregnancy/conception===
"Wrongful abortion" is comparable to other types of birth-related malpractice. One category of birth-related malpractice consists of cases in which negligence by the defendant resulted in the birth of a healthy yet unwanted child. The negligence may manifest itself in the manufacture, provision, or installation of contraceptives;  in the performance of vasectomy  or tubal ligation;  or in the carrying out of an abortion.  These cases are usually labeled "wrongful pregnancy" (or "wrongful conception" in appropriate cases). In a way, they represent a mirror image of wrongful abortion cases, although they are not exact reflections. In cases of wrongful pregnancy, the doctor's negligence makes the fulfillment of the parents’ will impossible, while in wrongful abortion cases the doctor's negligence instigates, but does not necessitate, a decision that turns out to be inconsistent with such will.

===Wrongful birth/life===
Another category of birth-related malpractice, more closely related to wrongful abortion, consists of cases in which a woman seeks medical advice regarding the health of her fetus, and decides to conceive or to continue her pregnancy once the adviser maintains that the fetus will not be born with congenital disabilities, a statement that is later found to be incorrect. The parents’ cause of action for their resulting losses is labeled "wrongful birth," while the infant’s cause of action for their own losses is termed "[[wrongful life]]."  Wrongful birth is a more accurate mirror image of wrongful abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob. Physicians, Wrongful Life and the Constitution ''Medicine &amp; Health, Rhode Island'' Volume 87, Number 2.  February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The former deals with the non-prevention of the birth of an unwanted child, whereas the latter deals with the prevention of the birth of a wanted child. In both cases the defendant’s negligence does not make the fulfillment of the parent’s will physically impossible, but instigates a decision that turns out to be inconsistent with such will.
