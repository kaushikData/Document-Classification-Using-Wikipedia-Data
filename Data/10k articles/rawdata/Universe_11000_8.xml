'''10 Billion - What's on your plate?''' (Original german title: 10 Milliarden – Wie werden wir alle satt?) is a [[documentary film]] released in 2015 by [[Valentin Thurn]] about solutions to supply the future [[world population]] with food. It was the most viewed documentary film in 2015 in German cinemas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

== Content ==
In 2050 the Earth's population will most probably reach approximately 10 billion people. To look for an answer to the question of whether it is possible to supply food for the whole world population, Valentin Thurn travels to different spots in the world in search of ecologically and economically responsible alternatives to the mass means by which most of our food is currently produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/a1a27ef7-010a-4eb8-8b85-2743c3730982/10-billion-whats-on-your-plate|title=10 Billion - What's on Your Plate?|last=|first=|date=|website=International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He visits a seed farm in [[India]], an [[Insect farming|insect farm]] in [[Thailand]], food cooperatives in the [[United States]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], both small and large farming projects in Africa and industrial food producers in Japan.
He discovers the complexity of producing and transporting food and its dependence on vulnerable markets.

Small farmers, especially in [[Newly industrialized country|newly industrialized countries]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], stand in competition with the [[food industry|industrial food production]]. The message that arises from all these interactions is about the huge difference that small-scale agriculture and eating locally produced food as often as possible can make. According to Thurn, these are the only viable options in resolving the problems of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.com/news/2016/feb/01/10-billion-whats-your-plate/|title=‘10 Billion: What’s On Your Plate?’|last=Stewart|first=Ethan|date=1 February 2016|work=The Santa Barbara Independent|access-date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Academic Brandon West praised the film, mentioning that while it "could have easily used scare tactics to pique viewer interest, [...] Thurn presents an interesting and well-balanced perspective". He goes on to recommend it for academic purposes, claiming that the "narration of the events and concepts provide ample details, while respecting the intelligence of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emro.lib.buffalo.edu/emro/emroDetail.asp?Number=6509|title=10 Billion: What's on Your Plate?|last=|first=|date=|website=Educational Media Reviews Online (EMRO)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for Glam Adelaide, Jo Vabolis gave the film a 10/10 rating, while describing it as "equal parts enthralling and confronting" and "essential viewing" for all those being kept awake at night by the ramifications of population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glamadelaide.com.au/transitions-film-festival-review-10-billion-whats-on-your-plate/|title=Transitions Film Festival Review: 10 Billion – What’s On Your Plate|website=www.glamadelaide.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been used as academic material, with [[Planet in Focus]] even releasing a teacher's guide that provides "a brief social and scientific background on the issues covered in the film".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://planetinfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/A-Teachers-Guide-to-10-Billion-Whats-On-Your-Plate-.pdf|title=A Teacher's Guide to - 10 Billion: What's On Your Plate?|last=Richard|first=Erica|publisher=Planet in Focus|year=2017|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the alien race in [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s [[The Gap Cycle]], see [[Amnion (Gap Cycle)]].''
The '''amnion''' is a [[Biological membrane|membrane]] that closely covers the [[embryo]] when first formed. It fills with the [[amniotic fluid]] which causes the amnion to expand and become the [[amniotic sac]] which serves to provide a protective environment for the developing embryo or fetus. The amnion, along with the [[chorion]], the [[yolk sac]] and the [[allantois]] form a protective sac around the embryo. In [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[monotreme]]s, the protective sac is enclosed in a shell. In [[marsupial]]s and [[Placentalia|placental mammal]]s, it is enclosed in a uterus.

The term '''amnion''' is from Ancient Greek ἀμνίον 'little lamb', diminutive of ἀμνός 'lamb'. it is cognate with the English verb 'yean', bring forth young (usually lambs).

The amnion is a feature of the [[vertebrate]] clade [[amniote|Amniota]], which includes reptiles, birds, and [[mammal]]s. [[Amphibian]]s and [[fish]] are not amniotes and thus lack the amnion. The amnion stems from the extra-embryonic somatic [[mesoderm]] on the outer side and the extra-embryonic [[ectoderm]] or [[trophoblast]] on the inner side.&lt;ref name="Pigeon60"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pigeon | first1=J. | year=1960 | journal=Can Med Assoc J | volume=83 | issue=16 | pages=844–845 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1938392/pdf/canmedaj00861-0015.pdf | pmc=1938392 | pmid=13735672 | title=Treatment of second-degree burns with amniotic membranes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==
In the human embryo, the earliest stages of the formation of the amnion have not been observed; in the youngest embryo which has been studied the amnion was already present as a closed sac, and appears in the inner cell-mass as a cavity. This cavity is roofed in by a single stratum of flattened, ectodermal cells, the amniotic ectoderm, and its floor consists of the prismatic ectoderm of the embryonic disk—the continuity between the roof and floor being established at the margin of the embryonic disk. Outside the amniotic ectoderm is a thin layer of [[mesoderm]], which is continuous with that of the [[somatopleure]] and is connected by the body-stalk with the mesodermal lining of the chorion.

When first formed, the amnion is in contact with the body of the embryo, but about the fourth or fifth week [[amniotic fluid]] (also called ''liquor amnii'') begins to accumulate within it. This fluid increases in quantity and causes the amnion to expand and ultimately to adhere to the inner surface of the [[chorion]], so that the extra-embryonic part of the [[coelom]] is obliterated. The amniotic fluid increases in quantity up to the sixth or seventh month of pregnancy, after which it diminishes somewhat; at the end of pregnancy it amounts to about 1 liter.

The amniotic fluid allows the free movements of the fetus during the later stages of pregnancy, and also protects it by diminishing the risk of injury from without. It contains less than two percent solids, consisting of urea and other extractives, inorganic salts, a small amount of [[protein]], and frequently a trace of [[sugar]]. That some of the liquor amnii is swallowed by the fetus is proved by the fact that epidermal debris and hairs have been found among the contents of the fetal alimentary canal.

==Clinical significance==
'''Extra-amniotic pregnancy''' is a rare condition that result from a rupture of the amnion, leading to development of the fetus within the [[extraembryonic coelom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonoworld.com/Fetus/page.aspx?id=405 TheFetus.net &gt; Amniotic band syndrome] By Luís Flávio Gonçalves, MD, Philippe Jeanty, MD, PhD. 1999-09-26-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
In [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and many [[mammal]]s the amnion is developed in the following manner:

At the point of constriction where the primitive digestive tube of the embryo joins the [[yolk sac]] a reflection or folding upward of the somatopleure takes place.

This, the amniotic fold, first makes its appearance at the cephalic extremity, and subsequently at the caudal end and sides of the embryo, and gradually rising more and more, its different parts meet and fuse over the dorsal aspect of the embryo, and enclose a cavity, the [[amniotic cavity]]. This kind of amnion is known as pleuroamnion (formed by folding), as opposed to schyzoamnion (formed by delamination).

After the fusion of the edges of the amniotic fold, the two layers of the fold become completely separated, the inner forming the amnion, the outer the false amnion or serosa.

The space between the amnion and the serosa constitutes the extra-embryonic celom, and for a time communicates with the embryonic celom.

[[Kitten|Cats]] and [[puppy|dogs]] are born inside of the amnion; it is cut open by the mother and eaten.

In [[elephant]]s, "The amnios is continued from the base of the umbilical cord upon the [[allantois]], which is of considerable size, and is so interposed between the [[chorion]] and amnios, as to prevent any part of the amnios attaining the inner surface of the [[placenta]]. The amnios consists of two layers:one is the granular layer, continued upon the inner or foetal surface of the allantois, and thence upon the umbilical cord; the other is the smooth outer layer, continued upon the outer or chorional surface of the allantois, and thence upon the inner surface of the chorion."&lt;ref name="Owen57"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Owen | first1=R. | title=Description of the foetal membranes and placenta of the elephant (''Elephas Indicus'', Cuv.), with remarks on the value of placentary characters in the classification of the mammalia | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume=147 | year=1857 | pages=347–353 | jstor=108622 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1857.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|348}}

{{Infobox astatine}}
'''Astatine''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''At''' and [[atomic number]] 85. It is the rarest [[natural element|naturally occurring element]] in the [[Earth's crust]], occurring only as the [[Decay chain|decay product]] of various heavier elements. All of astatine's [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. A sample of the pure element has never been assembled, because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity.

The bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty. Many of them have been estimated based on the element's position on the [[periodic table]] as a heavier analog of [[iodine]], and a member of the [[halogen]]s (the group of elements including [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a [[semiconductor]] or possibly a [[metal]]; it probably has a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several [[anion]]ic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable [[monatomic cation]] in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).

The first synthesis of the element was in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio G. Segrè]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who named it from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''astatos'' (ἄστατος), meaning "unstable". Four [[isotopes of astatine]] were subsequently found to be naturally occurring, although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the Earth's crust. Neither the most stable isotope astatine-210, nor the medically useful astatine-211, occur naturally; they can only be produced synthetically, usually by bombarding [[bismuth]]-209 with [[alpha particle]]s.

== Characteristics ==
Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have short [[half-life|half-lives]] of 8.1 hours or less, decaying into other astatine isotopes, [[bismuth]], [[polonium]] or [[radon]]. Most of its isotopes are very unstable with half-lives of one second or less.

In 1869, when [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published his [[Periodic table#Mendeleev's table|periodic table]], the space under iodine was empty; after [[Niels Bohr]] established the physical basis of the classification of chemical elements, it was suggested that the fifth halogen belonged there. Before its officially recognized discovery, it was called "eka-iodine" (from [[Sanskrit]] ''eka''&amp;nbsp;– "one") to imply it was one space under iodine (in the same manner as [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-silicon, eka-boron, and others]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=P.|title=The Ingredients: A Guided Tour of the Elements|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|pages=100–102 | isbn = 978-0-19-284100-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists tried to find it in nature; given its extreme rarity, these attempts resulted in several false discoveries.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=227–228}}

The first claimed discovery of eka-iodine was made by [[Fred Allison]] and his associates at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (now [[Auburn University]]) in 1931.

In 1936, a team of Romanian physicist [[Horia Hulubei]] and French physicist [[Yvette Cauchois]] claimed to have discovered element 85 via X-ray analysis. In 1939, they published another paper which supported and extended previous data. In 1944, Hulubei published a summary of data he had obtained up to that time, claiming it was supported by the work of other researchers. He chose the name "dor", presumably from the Romanian for "longing" [for peace], as [[World War II]] had started five years earlier. As Hulubei was writing in French, a language which does not accommodate the "ine" suffix, dor would likely have been rendered in English as "dorine", had it been adopted. In 1947, Hulubei's claim was effectively rejected by the Austrian chemist [[Friedrich Paneth]], who would later chair the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] committee responsible for recognition of new elements. Even though Hulubei's samples did contain astatine, his means to detect it were too weak, by current standards, to enable correct identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Finding Eka-Iodine: Discovery Priority in Modern Times|first1=S.

In 1940, the Swiss chemist [[Walter Minder]] announced the discovery of element 85 as the beta [[decay product]] of radium A (polonium-218), choosing the name "helvetium" (from {{lang|la|[[Helvetia#Name of Switzerland|Helvetia]]}}, the Latin name of Switzerland).

Later in 1940, [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] isolated the element at the University of California, Berkeley. Instead of searching for the element in nature, the scientists created it by bombarding [[bismuth-209]] with [[alpha particle]]s in a [[cyclotron]] (particle accelerator) to produce, after emission of two neutrons, astatine-211.{{sfn|Corson|MacKenzie|Segrè|1940}} The discoverers, however, did not immediately suggest a name for the element.

There are 39 known [[isotope]]s of astatine, with atomic masses (mass numbers) of 191–229.

Astatine's [[alpha decay]] energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Lighter astatine isotopes have quite [[Alpha particle#Energy and absorption|high energies]] of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1&amp;nbsp;hours for astatine-210 and 7.2&amp;nbsp;hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%.&lt;ref name="Audi2003" /&gt;{{efn|This means that, if decay modes other than alpha are omitted, then astatine-210 has an alpha decay half-life of 4,628.6&amp;nbsp;hours (128.9&amp;nbsp;days) and astatine-211 has one of only 17.2 hours (0.7&amp;nbsp;days). Therefore, astatine-211 is very much less stable toward alpha decay than the previous isotope.}} The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of [[beta decay]] (electron emission).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=229}} This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isotope Geology|edition=2nd|publisher=Pergamon Press|page=403|year=1956 | isbn = 978-0-470-70800-2 |first=K.|last=Rankama}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m.&lt;ref name="Audi2003" /&gt; Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay ([[positron emission]]), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes [[electron capture]].&lt;ref name="Audi2003" /&gt;

The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1&amp;nbsp;hours. The primary decay mode is beta plus, to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter [[polonium-210]]. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (astatine-207 to -211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It undergoes alpha decay to the extremely long-lived [[bismuth-209]].&lt;ref name="Audi2003" /&gt;

Astatine has 24 known [[nuclear isomer]]s, which are nuclei with one or more [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s or [[neutron]]s) in an [[excited state]]. A nuclear isomer may also be called a "[[metastability|meta]]-state", meaning the system has more [[internal energy]] than the "[[ground state]]" (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1,{{efn|"m1" means that this state of the isotope is the next possible one above&amp;nbsp;– with an energy greater than&amp;nbsp;– the ground state. "m2" and similar designations refer to further higher energy states. The number may be dropped if there is only one well-established meta state, such as astatine-216m. Other designation techniques are sometimes used.}} which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all the ground states bar those of isotopes 203–211 and 220. The least stable is astatine-214m1; its half-life of 265 [[nanosecond]]s is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine-213.&lt;ref name="Audi2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fry" /&gt;

Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6&amp;nbsp;[[giga-|giga]] [[becquerel]]s{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}} (about 86&amp;nbsp;[[nanogram]]s or 2.47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; atoms). Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons and the prospect of melting the target.{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}}&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;{{efn|See however Nagatsu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K.|last1=Nagatsu|first2=K.

With cryogenic technology, [[microgram]] quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of [[thorium]] or [[uranium]] to yield radon-211, in turn decaying to astatine-211.

The most important isotope is astatine-211, the only one in commercial use. To produce the bismuth target, the metal is [[sputtering|sputtered]] onto a gold, copper, or aluminium surface at 50 to 100 milligrams per square centimeter. [[Bismuth oxide]] can be used instead; this is forcibly fused with a copper plate.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} The target is kept under a [[Nitrogen gas#Reactions|chemically neutral nitrogen]] atmosphere,&lt;ref name="BiN2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry for Undergraduates|first=R. |last=Gopalan |year=2009|page=547|publisher=Universities Press | isbn = 978-81-7371-660-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs4zQ-hNTz8C&amp;lpg=PA492}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is cooled with water to prevent premature astatine vaporization.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} In a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Targeted Radionuclide Tumor Therapy: Biological Aspects|first1=T.|last1=Stigbrand |first2=J. |last2=Carlsson |first3=G.

Even though only one bismuth isotope is used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211. In order to eliminate undesired nuclides, the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to a value (optimally 29.17&amp;nbsp;MeV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G.|last1=Gyehong |first2=K.|last2=Chun|first3=S.

=== Separation methods ===
Since astatine is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and any significant contaminants. Several methods are available, "but they generally follow one of two approaches—dry distillation or [wet] acid treatment of the target followed by solvent extraction." The methods summarized below are modern adaptations of older procedures, as reviewed by Kugler and Keller.{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|pp=95–106, 133–139}}{{efn|See also Lavrukhina and Pozdnyakov.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|pp=243–253}}}} Pre-1985 techniques more often addressed the elimination of co-produced toxic polonium; this requirement is now mitigated by capping the energy of the cyclotron irradiation beam.{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}}

==== Dry ====
The astatine-containing cyclotron target is heated to a temperature of around 650&amp;nbsp;°C. The astatine [[Volatilization|volatilizes]] and is condensed in (typically) a [[cold trap]]. Higher temperatures of up to around 850&amp;nbsp;°C may increase the yield, at the risk of bismuth contamination from concurrent volatilization. Redistilling the condensate may be required to minimize the presence of bismuth{{sfn|Kugler|Keller|1985|p=97}} (as bismuth can interfere with astatine [[radioactive tracer|labeling reactions]]). The astatine is recovered from the trap using one or more low concentration solvents such as [[sodium hydroxide]], [[methanol]] or [[chloroform]]. Astatine yields of up to around 80% may be achieved. Dry separation is the method most commonly used to produce a chemically useful form of astatine.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. H.|last1=Larsen|first2=B. W.|last2=Wieland|first3=M.

The bismuth (or sometimes [[bismuth trioxide]]) target is dissolved in, for example, concentrated nitric or perchloric acid. Astatine is extracted using an organic solvent such as [[dibutyl ether|butyl]] or [[isopropyl ether]], or [[thiosemicarbazide]]. A separation yield of 93% using nitric acid has been reported, falling to 72% by the time purification procedures were completed (distillation of nitric acid, purging residual [[nitrogen oxide]]s, and redissolving [[bismuth nitrate]] to enable [[liquid–liquid extraction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A.

Newly formed astatine-211 is the subject of ongoing research in [[nuclear medicine]].{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=337}} It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2&amp;nbsp;hours; this is long enough to permit [[radioactive tracer|multistep labeling strategies]]. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle [[radiotherapy]], since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalutsky|first1=Michael|last2=Vaidyanathan|first2=Ganesan|title=Astatine-211-Labeled Radiotherapeutics An Emerging Approach to Targeted Alpha-Particle Radiotherapy|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|date=1 September 2000|volume=6|issue=14|pages=1433–1455|doi=10.2174/1381612003399275}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay), very quickly reaching its stable granddaughter lead-207. Polonium X-rays emitted as a result of the electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]], enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients.{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=337}} Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilbur |first=D.

The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and [[iodine-131]] (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that iodine-131 emits high-energy beta particles, and astatine does not. Beta particles have much greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. An average alpha particle released by astatine-211 can travel up to 70&amp;nbsp;µm through surrounding tissues; an average-energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2&amp;nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1970|p=233}} The short half-life and limited penetrating power of alpha radiation through tissues offers advantages in situations where the "tumor burden is low and/or malignant cell populations are located in close proximity to essential normal tissues."{{sfn|Zalutsky|Pruszynski|2011}} Significant morbidity in cell culture models of human cancers has been achieved with from one to ten astatine-211 atoms bound per cell.{{sfn|Vértes|Nagy|Klencsár|2003|p=338}}

Several obstacles have been encountered in the development of astatine-based [[radiopharmaceuticals]] for [[cancer]] treatment. [[World War II]] delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to [[dehalogenation|dehalogenate]] from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at [[Orbital hybridisation#sp3|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon sites]]{{efn|In other words, where carbon's one s [[atomic orbital]] and three p orbitals [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridize]] to give four new orbitals shaped as intermediates between the original s and p orbitals.}} (less so from [[Orbital hybridisation#sp2|sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sites]]). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule. While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development. A practical application for astatine as a cancer treatment would potentially be suitable for a "staggering" number of patients; production of astatine in the quantities that would be required remains an issue.&lt;ref name="Wilbur" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Vaidyanathan |first2=M.

Animal studies show that astatine, similarly to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the [[thyroid gland]]. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows a tendency to be taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; to At&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Guerard /&gt; If administered in the form of a radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the [[liver]].

'''Bernard Howard Lavenda''' (born September 18, 1945) is a retired professor of [[chemical physics]] at the [[University of Camerino]] and expert on irreversible [[thermodynamics]]. He has contributed to many areas of physics, including that of [[Brownian motion]], and in the establishment of the statistical basis of [[thermodynamics]], and non-Euclidean geometrical theories of relativity. He was the scientific coordinator of the "European Thermodynamics Network" in the European Commission Program of Human Capital and Mobility. He was also a proponent for the establishment of, and scientific director of, a National (Italian) Centre for Thermodynamics, and has acted as scientific consultant to companies such as the [[Eni|ENI]] Group, where he helped to found TEMA, a consulting firm for SNAM Progetti, [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment), and the [[Solar Energy Research Institute]] in [[Golden, Colorado]]. He has had over 130 scientific papers published in international journals, some critical of the new fashions and modes in theoretical physics.

Professor Lavenda currently lives in [[Trevignano Romano]] near Rome, is married with two adult children and two grandchildren, for whom his textbook "A New Perspective on Thermodynamics" is dedicated.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bernard H. Lavenda was born in New York City. After completing secondary school in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]], he attended [[Clark University]] where he graduated ''cum laude'' in 1966 with a B.Sc in chemistry. Having passed the entrance examination for the doctoral program at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], he began experimental work on enzymes under the direction of [[Ephraim Katzir]], who was later to become the President of Israel. Realizing that he was not made out for experimental work, he came under the influence of Ephraim's brother, Aaron, after reading his book ''Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics'', coauthored with Peter Curran.

After the Six Days War, [[Aaron Katchalsky]] helped him secure a studentship for a doctoral degree in [[Ilya Prigogine]]'s group in Brussels.

===Doctoral thesis===
His doctoral thesis, "Kinetic analysis and thermodynamic interpretation of nonequilibrium unstable transitions in open systems", showed that when homogeneous nonlinear chemical reactions far from equilibrium on the thermodynamic branch, which is an extension of the law of mass action at equilibrium, become unstable they make transitions to kinetic branches with lower entropy production than the thermodynamic branch.
 
This result was initially contested by Prigogine who reasoned from hydrodynamic instabilities, like the Rayleigh-Benard instability, which show a larger entropy production beyond the critical point in order to maintain spatial structures.  Prigogine later considered these spatial structures to be produced by unstable chemically diffusing systems, based on [[Alan Turing]]'s morphological models, calling them 'dissipative structures' and for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.

Prigogine later acknowledged that such transitions to lower states of entropy reduction were possible since no  spatial structural changes were involved, and later incorporated Lavenda's work into a chapter  of his new book Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations, co-authored with [[Paul Glansdorff]]. 
After receiving his doctorate from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, with la plus grande distinction, he returned to Israel in 1970 to work as a post-doctoral student in the Physical Chemistry Department of the Hebrew University.
During that period he published a short note in the Italian physics journal, Lettere Al Nuovo Cimento [3 (1972) 385-390] criticizing the Glansdorff-Prigogine universal criteria of evolution which attributes an inequality to a potential which is a function only of intensive   variables, the forces. He pointed out that no such thermodynamic potential could exist for it would be devoid of all information regarding how large the system is,  or how many particles it contains.  The inequality would be a criterion of stability, but, on account of the assumption of local (stable) equilibrium of the components that the system is broken up into, the sum of stable components can hardly become unstable. The note would probably have gone unnoticed were it not for Peter Landsberg's citation of  it in his ''Nature'' review of the Glansdorff-Prigogine book  [P. T. Landsberg, "The fourth law of thermodynamics"&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'' 238 (1972) 229-231 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5361/abs/238229a0.html&lt;/ref&gt;], where he predicted "the occasional lack of lucidity in the book which may give rise to some discussion within the next few years".

=== Career ===

====Consultancies====
After the murder of [[Aharon Katzir]] in [[Lod Airport massacre]] in May 1972, Lavenda accepted a position of consultant at [[Nuovo Pignone]] in Florence Italy together with a teaching position at the University of Pisa.
Through  the vice President of Nuovo Pignone,  he came into contact with Vicenzo Gervasio who was later to become President of ENI Data, and the idea crystallized of setting up a company dedicated to the analysis and dynamic modeling of fouling processes in refineries and reactors. He established relations between ENI and Northwest Research, Boeing, and SERI (Solar Energy Research Institute). 
He helped form a new company within the ENI group, TEMA, which was supported by SNAM Progetti. While retaining an unpaid lectureship in Thermodynamics at the University of Naples, Lavenda published his critical appraisal of the then current theories of irreversible thermodynamics, Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, in 1978. It was originally published by the Macmillan Press and later became a Dover Classic of Science and Mathematics.

==== Camerino years ====

In 1980 he won a chair in Physical Chemistry. Transferring to Camerino, he was to spend more than three decades there.  
His first book during this period, "Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics", published by Wiley in 1985, developed the nonlinear generalization of the Onsager-Machlup formulation of nonequilibrium fluctuations which was restricted to linear (Gaussian) processes.  
Just as equilibrium is characterized by the state of maximum entropy, corresponding to maximum probability,  nonequlibrium states are characterized by the principle of least dissipation of energy, corresponding to the maximum probability of a transition between nonequilibrium states that are not well-separated in time. 
This principle can be generalized to non-Gaussian fluctuations in the limit of small thermal noise and constitutes a kinetic analog to Boltzmann's principle.

During a sabbatical year in 1986 in Porto Alegre, Lavenda had ample time to browse through the well-furnished library at the Universidade Federale di Rio Grande del Sud. 
He was impressed by the parallelism between statistical inference and statistical thermodynamics: two distinct and separate branches that are essentially working on the same problems but with no apparent connection. 
His work, summarized in Statistical Physics: A Probabilistic Approach, published by Wiley-Interscience in 1991, completes Boltzmann's principle, which expresses the entropy as the logarithm of a combinatorial factor, by showing that the entropy is the potential that determines Gauss’ law of error for which the average value is the most probable value.
Just as there are frequency and degree- of-belief ([[Bayes' theorem]]) interpretations of statistical inference, the same should apply to statistical thermodynamics.  The frequency interpretation applies to extensive variables, like energy and volume which can be sampled, while the degree-of-belief  interpretations applies to the intensive variables, like temperature and pressure, for which sampling has no meaning.  The connection between the two branches translates the Cramer-Rao inequality into thermodynamic uncertainty relations, analogous to quantum mechanical uncertainty relations, where the more knowledge we have about a thermodynamic variable the less we know about its conjugate. 
Since the lack of a probability distribution means the absence of its statistics, the possibility of an intermediate statistics, or what is referred to as parastatistics, between [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] is nonexistent.

Statistical thermodynamics is usually concerned with most probable behavior which becomes almost certainty if large enough samples are taken. 
But sometimes surprises are in store where extreme behavior becomes the prevalent one.
Turning his attention to such rare events Lavenda published Thermodynamics of Extremes in 1995, whose real interest lies in the formulation of a thermodynamics of earthquakes that was subsequently published in Annali di Geofisica (Extreme value statistics and thermodynamics of earthquakes: "Large earthquakes";&lt;ref&gt;Annali di geofisica 43 (2000) 469-484 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277&lt;/ref&gt; "aftershock sequences"&lt;ref&gt;Annali di geofisica43 (2000) 967-982 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277&lt;/ref&gt;), and which is gaining increasing attention.
By properly defining entropy and energy, a temperature can be associated to an aftershock sequence giving it an additional means of characterization. 
A new magnitude-frequency relation is predicted which applies to clustered after-shocks in contrast to the [Gutenberg-Richter law] which treats them as independent and identically distributed random events.

====Attempts at forming a centre for thermodynamics====
In the nineties, Lavenda saw thermodynamics as a cultural heritage that could have a place in Italian society, and would be pertinent to both industrial research and to the preservation of its artistic patrimony. 
He was a proponent for the establishment of a National Centre of Thermodynamics for which financial funding was unavailable.  Capturing the interest of the ENEA, or the Italian agency for alternative energy resources, he applied for funding in the European Commission of Human Capital and Mobility Programme. 
His project, "Thermodynamics of Complex Systems", came in sixth place in Chemistry section with maximum funding in 1992.
This led to the formation of a European Thermodynamics Network consisting of 16 partners in the EU and Switzerland.
It was later extended to the Eastern European Countries in the European Commission PECO Programme.  This eventually led to the establishment of a National Centre for Thermodynamics that was brought into existence by the ENEA, but lasted only several months, because European funds were absorbed by other projects&lt;ref name=Fondi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Storace|first1=Francesco|title=INTERROGAZIONE A RISPOSTA SCRITTA 4/19238|url=http://dati.camera.it/ocd/aic.rdf/aic4_19238_13|publisher=camera.it|date=29 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Later years ====
Often critical of new fashions and modes in thermodynamics, Lavenda wrote ''A New Perspective on Thermodynamics'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/mathematics/probability/book/978-1-4419-1429-3&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2009, by returning to Carnot's original conception that work can only be done when there is a difference in temperature, and the necessity of closing the cycle before that work can be assessed.
More recently Lavenda has directed his interests to relativity by providing it with a new foundation based on [[non-Euclidean geometries]]. 
Rather than measuring distances in terms of the usual Euclidean metric, distances are defined in terms of what is known as a cross-ratio, a perspective invariant of four points, which, for the space of velocities, just happens to be the compounding of longitudinal [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifts]].  Doppler shifts are fundamental to relativity: oblique Doppler shifts describe aberration, while second order ones describe length contraction, but rather than being in the direction of the motion are perpendicular to it.&lt;ref name=Doppler_shifts&gt;{{cite book |title=A New Perspective on Relativity: An Odyssey in Non-Euclidean Geometries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=70JEFMFNIOYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Doppler+shifts+are+fundamental+to+relativity+lavenda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jawlvBQEBq&amp;sig=EZ0zh1yfjd55z3-riAtJdyQY_Js&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V_BIVL3fDqLuyQOhp4KoBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Doppler%20shifts%20are%20fundamental%20to%20relativity&amp;f=false |chapter=Aberration and Radiation Pressure| isbn= 978-981-4340-48-9 |year=2009 |publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The uniformly rotating disc, which is considered by some to be the missing link in Einstein's formulation of general relativity, is exactly described by the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic]] metric in polar coordinates, named after the nineteenth century Italian geometer Eugenio Beltrami, which predicts the circumference of the disc to be greater when in motion than when it is at rest.
Thus a uniformly rotating disc belongs to hyperbolic, and not Euclidean, space and so, too, does relativity.

'''Bismuth antimonides''', '''Bismuth-antimonys''', or '''Bismuth-antimony alloys''', (Bi&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) are binary alloys of [[bismuth]] and [[antimony]] in various ratios.

'''Bismuth antimonide''' itself (see box to right) is sometimes described as Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6914523 Bismuth Antimonide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 制备 ==

Crystals of bismuth antimonides are synthesized by melting bismuth and antimony together under inert gas or vacuum. [[Zone melting]] is used to decrease the concentration of impurities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When synthesizing single crystals of bismuth antimonides, it is important that impurities are removed from the samples, as oxidation occurring at the impurities leads to polycrystalline growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== 性能 ==

=== 拓扑绝缘体 ===

Pure bismuth is a [[semimetal]], containing a small band gap, which leads to it having a relatively high conductivity (7.7*10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S/m at 20&amp;nbsp;°C). When the bismuth is doped with antimony, the conduction band decreases in energy and the valence band increases in energy. At an Sb concentration of 4%, the two bands intersect, forming a Dirac point&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (which is defined as a point where the conduction and valence bands intersect). Further increases in the concentration of antimony result in a band inversion, in which the energy of the valence band becomes greater than that of the conduction band at specific momenta.  Between Sb concentrations of 7 and 22%, the bands no longer intersect, and the Bi&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; becomes an inverted-band insulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =Phase transition between the quantum spin Hall and insulator phases in 3D: emergence of a topological gapless phase  |url = http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/9/9/356/pdf |doi = 10.1088/1367-2630/9/9/356 | volume=9 |journal=New Journal of Physics |page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at these higher concentrations of Sb that the band gap in the surface states vanishes, and the material thus conducts at its surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 超导体 ===

The highest temperatures at which Bi&lt;sub&gt;.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;.6&lt;/sub&gt; thin film of thicknesses 150-1350A superconduct, the critical temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, is approximately 2K.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Single crystal Bi&lt;sub&gt;.935&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;.065&lt;/sub&gt; can superconduct at slightly higher temperatures, and at 4.2K, its critical magnetic field B&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (the maximum magnetic field that the superconductor can expel) of 1.6T at 4.2K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Anomalous Proximity Effect in the Nb-BiSb-Nb Junctions|url = http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.3029|journal = Physical Review Letters|pages = 3029–3032|volume = 77|issue = 14|doi = 10.1103/physrevlett.77.3029|first = A.

[[Electron mobility]] is one important parameter describing semiconductors because it describes the rate at which electrons can travel through the semiconductor. At 40K, electron mobility ranged from 0.49*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs at an Sb concentration of 0 to .24*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs at a Sb concentration of 7.2%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is much greater than the electron mobility of other common semiconductors like Si, which is 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Electrical properties of Silicon (Si)|url = http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru/SVA/NSM/Semicond/Si/electric.html|website = www.ioffe.rssi.ru|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important parameter of Bi&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[effective electron mass]] (EEM), a measure of the ratio of the acceleration of an electron to the force applied to an electron. The effective electron mass is .002m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; for x=.11 and .0009m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; at x=.06.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is much less than the electron effective mass in many common semiconductors (1.09 in Si at 300K, .55 in Ge, and .067 in GaAs). A low EEM is good for [[Thermophotovoltaic]] applications.

=== 热电性 ===

Bismuth antimonides are used as the n-type legs in many [[thermoelectric]] devices below room temperature. The thermoelectric efficiency, given by its figure of merit zT = σS2T/λ, where S is the [[Seebeck coefficient]], λ is the thermal conductivity, and σ is the electrical conductivity, describes the ratio of the energy provided by the thermoelectric to the heat absorbed by the device. At 80K, the figure of merit (zT) for Bi&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; peaks at 6.5*10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;/K when x = 15%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also, The Seebeck coefficient (the ratio of the potential difference between ends of a material to the temperature difference between the sides) at 80K of Bi&lt;sub&gt;.9&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;.1&lt;/sub&gt; is -140μV/K, much smaller than the Seebeck coefficient of pure bismuth, -50μV/K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bismuth–antimony alloys|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pssa.19700010102/abstract|journal = Physica Status Solidi A|date = 1970-01-16|issn = 1521-396X|pages = 7–28|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/pssa.19700010102|first = H.

[[Image:Inserti widia.jpg|thumb|Circular saw blade with tungsten-carbide inserts]]

'''Cemented carbide''' is a hard material used extensively as [[cutting tool material]], as well as other industrial applications. It consists of fine particles of [[carbide]] cemented into a [[composite material|composite]] by a binder metal. Cemented carbides commonly use [[tungsten carbide]] (WC), [[titanium carbide]] (TiC), or [[tantalum carbide]] (TaC) as the aggregate. Mentions of "carbide" or "tungsten carbide" in industrial contexts usually refer to these cemented composites.

Most of the time, carbide cutters will leave a better [[surface finish]] on the part, and allow [[speeds and feeds|faster machining]] than [[high-speed steel]] or other [[tool steel]]s. Carbide tools can withstand higher temperatures at the cutter-workpiece interface than standard high-speed steel tools (which is a principal reason for the faster machining). Carbide is usually superior for the cutting of tough materials such as [[carbon steel]] or [[stainless steel]], as well as in situations where other cutting tools would wear away faster, such as high-quantity production runs.

==Composition==
Cemented carbides are [[metal matrix composite]]s where carbide particles act as the aggregate and a metallic binder serves as the matrix (like [[gravel]] aggregate in a matrix of cement makes concrete). Its structure is thus conceptually similar to that of a [[grinding wheel]], except that the abrasive particles are much smaller; macroscopically, the material of a carbide cutter looks homogeneous.

The process of combining the carbide particles with the binder is referred to as [[sintering]] or [[hot isostatic pressing]] (HIP). During this process, the binder eventually will be entering the liquid stage and carbide grains (much higher melting point) remain in the solid stage. As a result of this process, the binder is embedding/cementing the carbide grains and thereby creates the metal matrix composite with its distinct material properties. The naturally ductile metal binder serves to offset the characteristic brittle behavior of the carbide ceramic, thus raising its toughness and durability. By controlling various parameters, including grain size, cobalt content, dotation (e.g., alloy carbides) and carbon content, a carbide manufacturer can tailor the carbide's performance to specific applications.

The first cemented carbide developed was [[tungsten carbide]] (introduced in 1927) which uses tungsten carbide particles held together by a cobalt metal binder. Since then other cemented carbides have been developed, such as [[titanium carbide]], which is better suited for cutting steel, and [[tantalum carbide]], which is tougher than tungsten carbide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Childs |title=Metal Machining: Theory and Applications |chapter=A6.2 Cemented carbides and cermets |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZawJuCugpCgC&amp;pg=PA388 |year=2000 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0-340-69159-5 |pages=388–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
The [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of cemented tungsten carbide is found to vary with the amount of cobalt used as a metal binder. For 5.9% of cobalt a coefficient of 4.4&amp;nbsp;µm·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is found, whereas the coefficient is around 5.0&amp;nbsp;µm·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for a cobalt content of 13%. Both values are only valid from {{convert|20|°C}} to {{convert|60|°C}}, but more data is available from Hidnert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Applications==
===Inserts for metal cutting===&lt;!-- [[Carbide insert]] redirects here --&gt;
[[Image:Schneidplättchen aus Widia.jpg|thumb|Tungsten-carbide inserts]]

Carbide is [[unit cost|more expensive per unit]] than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide cutting tip itself is often in the form of a small '''insert''' for a larger [[tipped tool]] whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon [[tool steel]]. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many lathe tools and [[endmill]]s. In recent decades, though, solid-carbide endmills have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above).

====Insert coatings====
To increase the life of carbide tools, they are sometimes coated. Four such coatings are TiN ([[titanium nitride]]), TiC ([[titanium carbide]]), Ti(C)N ([[titanium carbide-nitride]]), and TiAlN ([[titanium aluminium nitride]]). (Newer coatings, known as DLC ([[diamond-like carbon]]) are beginning to surface, enabling the cutting power of diamond without the unwanted chemical reaction between real diamond and iron{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.) Most coatings generally increase a tool's hardness and/or lubricity. A coating allows the cutting edge of a tool to cleanly pass through the material without having the material [[galling|gall]] (stick) to it. The coating also helps to decrease the temperature associated with the cutting process and increase the life of the tool. The coating is usually deposited via thermal [[chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] and, for certain applications, with the mechanical [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]] method. However, if the deposition is performed at too high temperature, an ''eta phase'' of a Co&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;C tertiary carbide forms at the interface between the carbide and the cobalt phase, which may lead to adhesion failure of the coating.

Mining and tunneling cutting tools are most often fitted with Cemented Carbide tips, the so-called "button bits". Only artificial diamond can replace the cemented carbide buttons when conditions are ideal, but as rock drilling is a tough job the Cemented Carbide button bits remain the most used type throughout the world.

===Rolls for hot-roll and cold-roll applications===
Since the mid-1960s, steel mills around the world have applied cemented carbide to the rolls of their rolling mills for both hot and cold rolling of tubes, bars, and flats.

===Other industrial applications===
This category contains a countless number of applications, but can be split into three main areas:
* Engineered components
* Wear parts
* Tools and tool blanks

Some key areas where cemented carbide components are used:
* Automotive components
* Canning tools for [[deep drawing]] of two-piece [[tin can|cans]]
* Rotary cutters for high-speed cutting of artificial fibres
* Metal forming tools for [[wire drawing]] and [[die (manufacturing)|stamping]] applications
* Rings and bushings typically for bump and seal applications
* Woodworking, e.g., for sawing and [[plane (tool)|planing]] applications
* Pump pistons for high-performance pumps (e.g., in [[nuclear power|nuclear]] installations)
* Nozzles, e.g., high-performance nozzles for [[oil well|oil drilling]] applications
* Roof and tail tools and components for high wear resistance
* Balls for [[ball bearing]]s and [[ballpoint pen]]s

===Non-industrial uses===

====Jewellery====
[[Tungsten carbide]] has become a popular metal in the bridal jewellery industry, due to its extreme hardness and high resistance to scratching. Given its [[brittleness]], it is prone to chip, crack, or shatter in jewellery applications. Once fractured, it cannot be repaired.

==History==

The initial development of cemented and [[sintering|sintered]] carbides occurred in Germany in the 1920s.{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=744}} [[ThyssenKrupp]] says [in [[historical present]] tense], "Sintered [[tungsten carbide]] was developed by the "Osram study society for electrical lighting" to replace diamonds as a material for machining metal. Not having the equipment to exploit this material on an industrial scale, Osram sells the license to Krupp at the end of 1925. In 1926 Krupp brings sintered carbide onto the market under the name WIDIA ([[acronym and initialism|acronym]] for WIe DIAmant = like diamond)."&lt;ref name="thyssenkrupp.com_geschichte_chronik_k1926"&gt;{{Citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|d|i|ə}} [[Machinery's Handbook]]{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=744}} gives the date of carbide tools' commercial introduction as 1927. Burghardt and Axelrod&lt;ref name="Burghardt_Axelrod_1954_p453" &gt;{{Harvnb|Burghardt|Axelrod|1954|p=453}}.&lt;/ref&gt; give the date of their commercial introduction in the United States as 1928. Subsequent development occurred in various countries.{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=744}}

Although the marketing pitch was slightly [[wikt:hyperbole#Noun|hyperbolic]] (carbides being not entirely equal to diamond), carbide tooling offered an improvement in cutting [[speeds and feeds]] so remarkable that, like [[high-speed steel]] had done two decades earlier, it forced [[machine tool]] designers to rethink every aspect of existing designs, with an eye toward yet more rigidity and yet better [[spindle (tool)|spindle]] bearings.

During World War II there was a tungsten shortage in Germany. It was found that tungsten in carbide cuts metal more efficiently than tungsten in high-speed steel, so to economise on the use of tungsten, carbides were used for metal cutting as much as possible.

The Widia name became a [[genericized trademark]] in various countries and languages,&lt;ref name="thyssenkrupp.com_geschichte_chronik_k1926"/&gt; including English (widia, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|d|i|ə}}), although the genericized sense was never especially widespread in English ("carbide" is the normal generic term). Since 2009, the name has been [[Kennametal#Widia|revived as a brand name by Kennametal]],&lt;ref name="Widia_dot_com" &gt;{{Citation | title = Widia.com | url = http://www.widia.com | accessdate = 22 October 2010 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the brand [[consolidation (business)|subsumes]] numerous popular brands of cutting tools. For the sake of clear communication, the reviving of the Widia brand may naturally further discourage use of the generic sense..

Uncoated tips brazed to their shanks were the first form. Clamped indexable inserts and today's wide variety of coatings are advances made in the decades since.{{sfnp|Machinery's Handbook|1996|p=744}} With every passing decade, the use of carbide has become less "special" and more ubiquitous.

Regarding fine-grained hardmetal, an attempt has been made to follow the scientific and technological steps associated with its production; this task is not easy, though, because of the restrictions placed by commercial, and in some cases research, organisations, in not publicising relevant information until long after the date of the initial work. Thus, placing data in an historical, chronological order is somewhat difficult. However, it has been possible to establish that as far back as 1929, approximately 6 years after the first patent was granted, Krupp/Osram workers had identified the positive aspects of tungsten carbide grain refinement. By 1939, they had also discovered the beneficial effects of adding a small amount of vanadium and tantalum carbide. This effectively controlled [[discontinuous grain growth]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal
  |first=Geoffrey E. |last=Spriggs |title=A history of fine grained hardmetal
  |journal=[[International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials]]
  |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=241–255 |year=1995 |doi=10.1016/0263-4368(95)92671-6
  |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0263436895926716
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What was considered ‘fine’ in one decade was considered not so fine in the next. Thus, a grain size in the range 0.5–3.0 μm was considered fine in the early years, but by the 1990s, the era of the nano-crystalline material had arrived, with a grain size of 20–50&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Pobedit===
[[File:Table saw cutting wood at an angle, by BarelyFitz.jpg|thumb|250 px]]
''Pobedit'' ({{lang-rus|победи́т}}) is a [[sintering|sintered]] carbide alloy of about 90% [[tungsten carbide]] as a hard phase, and about 10%  [[cobalt]] (Co) as a binder phase, with a small amount of additional carbon. It was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1929, it is described as a material from which [[cutting tools]] are made. Later a number of similar alloys based on tungsten and cobalt were developed, and the name of 'pobedit' was retained for them as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Победит|year=1975|encyclopedia=Большая советская энциклопедия|edition=3|publisher=Советская энциклопедия|location=М.|url=http://encycl.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00060/22600.htm|language=ru}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Pobedit the free dictionary: pobedit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pobedit is usually produced by [[powder metallurgy]] in the form of plates of different shapes and sizes. The manufacturing process is as follows: a fine powder of tungsten carbide (or other refractory carbide) and a fine powder of binder material such as cobalt or nickel both get intermixed and then pressed into the appropriate forms. Pressed plates are sintered at a temperature close to the melting point of the binder metal, which yields a very tight and solid substance.

The plates of this superhard alloy are applied to manufacturing of metal-cutting and drilling tools; they are usually soldered on the cutting tool tips. Heat post-treatment is not required. The pobedit inserts at the tips of drill bits are still very widespread in Russia.

[[File:Buštěhrad (0047).jpg|thumb|Sorted waste container stand in [[Buštěhrad]], Central Bohemia, Czech Republic. Green containers are for glass, blue for paper, yellow for plastics and red for electrotechnical waste.]]
A '''civic amenity site''' ('''CA site''') or '''household waste recycling centre''' ('''HWRC''') (both terms are used in the United Kingdom) is a [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|facility]] where the public can dispose of [[household waste]] and also often containing [[recycling]] points. Civic amenity sites are run by the [[municipality|local authority]] in a given area. Collection points for [[recyclable waste]] such as [[green waste]], [[metal]]s, [[glass]] and other [[waste types]] (including [[Waste vegetable oil|WVO]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/123038.aspx Civic amenity site as collection point for WVO ref 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regbiopower.co.uk/wco|title=Renewable Energy Generation|website=regbiopower.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are available. Items that cannot be collected by local waste collection schemes such as [[bulky waste]] are also accepted.

In the United Kingdom, civic amenity sites are informally called "tips" or "dumps".

In continental Europe, there are usually several types of collection sites: 
* sorted waste container stands: a group of containers of the most common recyclable household waste, such as plastics, paper, glass, metal cans, [[liquid packaging board]], electrotechnical waste, recyclable clothing and so on. Such stands should be freely accessible by walking. They are often found near bus or tram stops, city squares, village commons, shops etc. A city or a country can have any colour convention to distinguish containers by type of waste. 
* waste collection courtyards: except for the mentioned household waste, they are specialized for large waste from citizens: furniture, construction waste, compostable gardening waste – or special types of waste (chemical or other hazardous waste etc.). The waste is usually delivered by cars, vans or trucks and the station has an overseeing staff and opening hours, but services are free of charge. Smaller towns have one such site, cities can have more such courtyards in various neighbourhoods. 
* waste purchase stations: especially for metal scrap (iron and other metals), but also for paper, glass etc. Such stations have been in existence longer than modern disposal stations. Coexistence of paid and free systems of collection can result in homeless, asocial or poor people picking waste from the free containers to sell at the waste purchase station.

[[File:CoffinCornerU2.png|300px|thumb|Graph of altitude/speed region envelope for [[Lockheed U-2]] depicting coffin corner]]

'''Coffin corner''' (also known as the '''aerodynamic ceiling'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Q corner''') is the region of flight where a fast [[fixed-wing aircraft]]'s [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed is near the [[critical Mach number]], at a given gross [[weight]] and [[G-force|G-force loading]]. In this region of flight, it is very difficult to keep the airplane in stable flight. Because the stall speed is the minimum speed required to maintain level flight, any reduction in speed will cause the airplane to stall and lose altitude. Because the critical Mach number is the maximum speed at which air can travel over the wings without losing lift due to flow separation and shock waves, any increase in speed will cause the airplane to lose lift, or to pitch heavily nose-down, and lose altitude. The "corner" refers to the triangular shape at the top of a [[flight envelope]] chart where the stall speed and critical Mach number are within a few knots of each other. The speed where they meet is the ceiling of the aircraft. This is distinct from the same term used for helicopters when outside the auto-rotation envelope as seen in the [[height-velocity diagram]]. 

==Aerodynamic basis==
Consideration of [[statics]] shows that when a fixed-wing aircraft is in straight, level flight at constant-[[airspeed]] the [[Lift (force)|lift]] on the main wing plus the force (in the negative sense if downward) on the [[horizontal stabilizer]] is equal to the aircraft's weight; and its [[thrust]] is equal to its [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. In most circumstances this equilibrium can occur at a range of airspeeds. The minimum such speed is the stall speed, or ''V&lt;sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;''. The [[indicated airspeed]] at which a fixed-wing aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft but does not vary significantly with altitude. At speeds close to the stall speed the aircraft's wings are at a high [[angle of attack]].

At higher [[altitude]]s, the [[Density of air|air density]] is lower than at sea level. Because of the progressive reduction in air density, as the aircraft’s altitude increases its [[true airspeed]] is progressively greater than its indicated airspeed. For example, the indicated airspeed at which an aircraft stalls can be considered constant, but the true airspeed at which it stalls increases with altitude.

Air conducts sound at a certain speed, the "[[speed of sound]]". This becomes slower as the air becomes cooler. Because the temperature of the atmosphere generally decreases with altitude (until the [[tropopause]]), the speed of sound also decreases with altitude. (See the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] for more on temperature as a function of altitude.)

A given airspeed, divided by the speed of sound in that air, gives a ratio known as the [[Mach number]]. A Mach number of 1.0 indicates an airspeed equal to the speed of sound in that air. Because the speed of sound increases with air temperature, and air temperature generally decreases with altitude, the true airspeed for a given Mach number generally decreases with altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 1.2, Pitman Publishing Limited, London, {{ISBN|0-273-01120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an airplane moves through the air faster, the airflow over parts of the wing will reach speeds that approach Mach 1.0.  At such speeds, [[shock waves]] form in the air passing over the wings, drastically increasing the drag due to [[Drag divergence Mach number|drag divergence]], causing Mach buffet, or drastically changing the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]], resulting in a nose-down [[Moment (physics)|moment]] called "[[mach tuck]]". The aircraft Mach number at which these effects appear is known as its [[critical Mach number]], or M&lt;sub&gt;CRIT&lt;/sub&gt;. The true airspeed corresponding to the critical Mach number generally decreases with altitude.

The [[flight envelope]] is a plot of various curves representing the limits of the aircraft's true airspeed and altitude. Generally, the top-left boundary of the envelope is the curve representing stall speed, which increases as altitude increases.  The top-right boundary of the envelope is the curve representing critical Mach number in true airspeed terms, which decreases as altitude increases. These curves typically intersect at some altitude. This intersection is the ''coffin corner'', or more formally the ''Q corner''.&lt;ref name="FAA AC 61-107B"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above explanation is based on level, constant speed, flight with a given gross [[weight]] and [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] of 1.0&amp;nbsp;G. The specific altitudes and speeds of the coffin corner will differ depending on weight, and the load factor increases caused by banking and pitching maneuvers. Similarly, the specific altitudes at which the stall speed meets the critical Mach number will differ depending on the actual atmospheric temperature.

==Consequences==
When an aircraft slows to below its stall speed, it is unable to generate enough lift in order to cancel out the forces that act on the aircraft (such as weight and centripetal force). This will cause the aircraft to drop in altitude. The drop in altitude may cause the pilot to increase the angle of attack by pulling up on the stick, because normally increasing the angle of attack puts the aircraft in a climb. However, when the wing exceeds its critical angle of attack, an increase in angle of attack will lead to a loss of lift and a further loss of airspeed - the wing [[stall (flight)|stalls]]. The reason why the wing stalls when it exceeds its critical angle of attack is that the airflow over the top of the wing [[Flow separation|separates]].

When the airplane exceeds its critical Mach number (such as during stall prevention or recovery), then drag increases or Mach tuck occurs, which can cause the aircraft to upset, lose control, and lose altitude.  In either case, as the airplane falls, it could gain speed and then [[structural failure]] could occur, typically due to excessive ''g'' forces during the pullout phase of the recovery.

As an airplane approaches its coffin corner, the margin between stall speed and critical Mach number becomes smaller and smaller. Small changes could put one wing or the other above or below the limits. For instance, a turn causes the inner wing to have a lower airspeed, and the outer wing, a higher airspeed. The aircraft could exceed both limits at once. Or, [[turbulence]] could cause the airspeed to change suddenly, to beyond the limits. Some aircraft, such as the [[Lockheed U-2]], routinely operate in the "coffin corner".  In the case of the U-2, the aircraft was equipped with an autopilot, though it was unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Gary Powers, Curt Gentry, Operation Overflight: A Memoir of the U-2 Incident. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1971 (hard cover) {{ISBN|978-0-340-14823-5}}. Potomac Book, 2004 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-1-57488-422-7}}, pages 18,60&lt;/ref&gt;  The U-2's speed margin, at high altitude, between 1-G stall and Mach buffet can be as small as 5 knots.&lt;ref&gt;Flight Manual, Models U-2C and U-2F Aircraft, AF(C)-1-1, 10 May 1967, revised 15 October 1968, pages 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aircraft capable of flying close to their critical Mach number usually carry a [[machmeter]], an instrument which indicates speed in Mach number terms. As part of certifying aircraft in the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) certifies a maximum Mach number for operation, or M&lt;sub&gt;MO&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Following a series of crashes of high performance aircraft operating at high altitudes to which no definite cause could be attributed, as the aircraft involved suffered near total destruction, the FAA published an Advisory Circular establishing guidelines for improved aircrew training in high altitude operations in high performance aircraft. The circular includes a comprehensive explanation of aerodynamic effects of, and operations near coffin corner.&lt;ref name="FAA AC 61-107B"/&gt;

In [[crystallography]], '''crystal structure''' is a description of the ordered arrangement of [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s in a [[crystal|crystalline material]].&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Solid State Physics |edition=2nd |first1=J.R. |last1=Hook |first2=H.E. |last2=Hall |series=Manchester Physics Series |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2010 |isbn=9780471928041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three-dimensional space]] in matter.

The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes the repeating pattern is the '''unit cell''' of the structure. The unit cell completely defines the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal lattice, which is built up by repetitive [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] of the unit cell along its principal axes.  The repeating patterns are said to be located at the points of the [[Bravais lattice]].

The lengths of the principal axes, or edges, of the unit cell and the angles between them are the [[lattice constant]]s, also called ''lattice parameters''. The [[symmetry]] properties of the crystal are described by the concept of [[space group]]s.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt; All possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space may be described by the 230 [[space groups]].

The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties, such as [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[electronic band structure]], and [[crystal optics|optical transparency]].

== Unit cell ==
Crystal structure is described in terms of the geometry of arrangement of particles in the unit cell. The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Solid State Chemistry |first=Anthony R. |last=West |publisher=Wiley |edition=2nd |date=1999 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-471-98756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a [[parallelepiped]], providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') and the angles between them (α, β, γ).  The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the [[fractional coordinates]] (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is only necessary to report the coordinates of a smallest asymmetric subset of particles. This group of particles may be chosen so that it occupies the smallest physical space, which means that not all particles need to be physically located inside the boundaries given by the lattice parameters. All other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the [[space group]] of the crystal structure.&lt;ref name="Space-group symmetry"&gt;International Tables for Crystallography (2006). Volume A, Space-group symmetry.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miller indices ===
[[File:Miller Indices Cubes.svg|thumb|250px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]
Vectors and planes in a crystal lattice are described by the three-value [[Miller index]] notation. This syntax uses the indices ''ℓ'', ''m'', and ''n'' as directional orthogonal parameters, which are separated by 90°.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the syntax (''ℓmn'') denotes a plane that intercepts the three points ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''ℓ'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''m'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'', or some multiple thereof. That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell (in the basis of the lattice vectors). If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (i.e., the intercept is "at infinity"). A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined. The Miller indices for a plane are [[integer]]s with no common factors. Negative indices are indicated with horizontal bars, as in (1{{overbar|2}}3). In an orthogonal coordinate system for a cubic cell, the Miller indices of a plane are the Cartesian components of a vector normal to the plane.

Considering only (''ℓmn'') planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the ''lattice planes''), the distance ''d'' between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) [[reciprocal lattice]] vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2\pi}  {|\mathbf{g}_{\ell m n}|}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Planes and directions ===
The crystallographic directions are geometric [[line (mathematics)|line]]s linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Likewise, the crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s are geometric ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes. These high density planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal as follows:&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt;

*[[optics|Optical properties]]: [[Refractive index]] is directly related to density (or periodic density fluctuations).
*[[Adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: Physical adsorption and chemical reactions occur at or near surface atoms or molecules. These phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes.
*[[Surface tension]]: The condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species. The surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface.

[[File:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|300px|Dense crystallographic planes]]

*Microstructural [[Crystallographic defect|defects]]: [[sintering|Pores]] and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following higher density planes.
*[[cleavage (crystal)|Cleavage]]: This typically occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes.
*[[Plastic deformation]]: [[Dislocation]] glide occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes. The perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction. The shift of one node in a more dense direction requires a lesser distortion of the crystal lattice.

Some directions and planes are defined by symmetry of the crystal system. In monoclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and trigonal/hexagonal systems there is one unique axis (sometimes called the '''principal axis''') which has higher [[rotational symmetry]] than the other two axes. The '''basal plane''' is the plane perpendicular to the principal axis in these crystal systems. For triclinic, orthorhombic, and cubic crystal systems the axis designation is arbitrary and there is no principal axis.

==== Cubic structures ====
For the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted ''a''); similarly for the reciprocal lattice. So, in this common case, the Miller indices (''ℓmn'') and [''ℓmn''] both simply denote normals/directions in [[Cartesian coordinates]]. For cubic crystals with [[lattice constant]] ''a'', the spacing ''d'' between adjacent (ℓmn) lattice planes is (from above):
:&lt;math&gt;d_{\ell mn}= \frac {a} { \sqrt{\ell ^2 + m^2 + n^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:

*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' such as {{angbr|100}} denote a ''family'' of directions that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.
*Coordinates in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as {100} denote a family of plane normals that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

For [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) and [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal. However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic [[supercell (crystal)|supercell]] and hence are again simply the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian directions]].

===Interplanar spacing===
The spacing '''''d''''' between adjacent (''hkl'') lattice planes is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4. Direct and reciprocal lattices |website=CSIC Dept de Cristalografia y Biologia Estructural |url= http://www.xtal.iqfr.csic.es/Cristalografia/parte_04-en.html |date=6 Apr 2017 |access-date=18 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cubic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2+l^2} {a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Tetragonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2} {a^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Hexagonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{h^2+hk+k^2}{a^2}\right)+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Rhombohedral:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\sin^2\alpha+2(hk+kl+hl)(\cos^2\alpha-\cos\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\cos^2\alpha+2\cos^3\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Orthorhombic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Monoclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}=\left(\frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2\sin^2\beta}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}-\frac{2hl\cos\beta}{ac}\right) \csc^2\beta&lt;/math&gt;
*Triclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{\frac{h^2}{a^2}\sin^2\alpha+\frac{k^2}{b^2}\sin^2\beta+\frac{l^2}{c^2}\sin^2\gamma+\frac{2kl}{bc}\cos\alpha+\frac{2hl}{ac}\cos\beta+\frac{2hk}{ab}\cos\gamma}{1-\cos^2\alpha-\cos^2\beta-\cos^2\gamma+2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

== Classification by symmetry ==
{{main|Crystal system}}
The defining property of a crystal is its inherent symmetry, by which we mean that under certain 'operations' the crystal remains unchanged. All crystals have translational symmetry in three directions, but some have other symmetry elements as well. For example, rotating the crystal 180° about a certain axis may result in an atomic configuration that is identical to the original configuration. The crystal is then said to have a twofold rotational symmetry about this axis. In addition to rotational symmetries like this, a crystal may have symmetries in the form of mirror planes and [[translational symmetries]], and also the so-called "compound symmetries," which are a combination of translation and rotation/mirror symmetries. A full classification of a crystal is achieved when all of these inherent symmetries of the crystal are identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N.|author-link1=Neil Ashcroft|last2=Mermin|first2=D.|authorlink2=David Mermin|date=1976|title=Solid State Physics|publisher=Brooks/Cole (Thomson Learning, Inc.)|chapter=Chapter 7|isbn=978-0030493461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lattice systems ===
These [[lattice system]]s are a grouping of crystal structures according to the axial system used to describe their lattice. Each lattice system consists of a set of three axes in a particular geometric arrangement. There are seven lattice systems. They are similar to but not quite the same as the seven [[crystal system]]s.

{{clear}}
The simplest and most symmetric, the [[cubic (crystal system)|cubic]] (or isometric) system, has the symmetry of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], that is, it exhibits four threefold rotational axes oriented at 109.5° (the [[tetrahedral angle]]) with respect to each other. These threefold axes lie along the body diagonals of the cube. The other six lattice systems, are [[Hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]], [[tetragonal]], [[rhombohedral lattice system|rhombohedral]] (often confused with the [[trigonal crystal system]]), [[orthorhombic]], [[monoclinic]] and [[triclinic]].

==== Bravais lattices ====
{{main|Bravais lattice}}
Bravais lattices, also referred to as ''space lattices'', describe the geometric arrangement of the lattice points,&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; and therefore the translational symmetry of the crystal. The three dimensions of space afford 14 distinct Bravais lattices describing the translational symmetry. All crystalline materials recognized today, not including [[quasicrystal]]s, fit in one of these arrangements. The fourteen three-dimensional lattices, classified by lattice system, are shown above.

The crystal structure consists of the same group of atoms, the ''basis'', positioned around each and every lattice point. This group of atoms therefore repeats indefinitely in three dimensions according to the arrangement of one of the Bravais lattices. The characteristic rotation and mirror symmetries of the unit cell is described by its [[crystallographic point group]].

===Crystal systems===
A crystal system is a set of point groups in which the point groups themselves and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case the crystal system and lattice system both have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both lattice systems exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system.

In total there are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

==== Point groups ====
{{main|Crystallographic point group}}
The crystallographic point group or ''crystal class'' is the mathematical group comprising the symmetry operations that leave at least one point unmoved and that leave the appearance of the crystal structure unchanged. These symmetry operations include

*''Reflection'', which reflects the structure across a ''reflection plane''
*''Rotation'', which rotates the structure a specified portion of a circle about a ''rotation axis''
*''Inversion'', which changes the sign of the coordinate of each point with respect to a ''center of symmetry'' or ''inversion point''
*''[[Improper rotation]]'', which consists of a rotation about an axis followed by an inversion.

Rotation axes (proper and improper), reflection planes, and centers of symmetry are collectively called ''symmetry elements''. There are 32 possible crystal classes. Each one can be classified into one of the seven crystal systems.

=== Space groups ===
{{main|Space group}}
In addition to the operations of the point group, the space group of the crystal structure contains translational symmetry operations. These include:
*Pure ''translations'', which move a point along a vector
*''Screw axes'', which rotate a point around an axis while translating parallel to the axis.&lt;ref name=Sands&gt;
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Crystallography |author=Donald E. Sands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_A5u5sczJoC&amp;pg=PA71 |chapter=§4-2 Screw axes and §4-3 Glide planes |pages= 70–71 |isbn=978-0486678399 |publisher=Courier-Dover |year=1994 |edition=Reprint of WA Benjamin corrected 1975}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Glide planes'', which reflect a point through a plane while translating it parallel to the plane.&lt;ref name=Sands/&gt;

There are 230 distinct space groups.

== Atomic coordination ==
By considering the arrangement of atoms relative to each other, their coordination numbers (or number of nearest neighbors), interatomic distances, types of bonding, etc., it is possible to form a general view of the structures and alternative ways of visualizing them.&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"&gt;{{cite book|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics |edition=2nd |editor1-first=C.B. |editor1-last=Parker |date=1994 |isbn=978-0070514003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close packing ===
[[File:close packing.svg|thumb|right|341px|The hcp lattice (left) and the fcc lattice (right)]]
The principles involved can be understood by considering the most efficient way of packing together equal-sized spheres and stacking [[close-packed]] atomic planes in three dimensions. For example, if plane A lies beneath plane B, there are two possible ways of placing an additional atom on top of layer B. If an additional layer was placed directly over plane A, this would give rise to the following series:
:...'''ABABABAB'''...
This arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure is known as '''hexagonal close packing (hcp)'''.

If, however, all three planes are staggered relative to each other and it is not until the fourth layer is positioned directly over plane A that the sequence is repeated, then the following sequence arises:
:...'''ABCABCABC'''...
This type of structural arrangement is known as '''cubic close packing (ccp)'''.

The unit cell of a ccp arrangement of atoms is the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. This is not immediately obvious as the closely packed layers are parallel to the {111} planes of the fcc unit cell. There are four different orientations of the close-packed layers.

The '''packing efficiency''' can be worked out by calculating the total volume of the spheres and dividing by the volume of the cell as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{16 \sqrt{2} r^3} = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}} = 0.7405...&lt;/math&gt;

The 74% packing efficiency is the maximum density possible in unit cells constructed of spheres of only one size. Most crystalline forms of metallic elements are hcp, fcc, or bcc (body-centered cubic). The [[coordination number]] of atoms in hcp and fcc structures is 12 and its [[atomic packing factor]] (APF) is the number mentioned above, 0.74. This can be compared to the APF of a bcc structure, which is 0.68.

== Grain boundaries ==
Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; A [[grain boundary]] is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term "crystallite boundary" is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, [[dislocations]], and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.

Treating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the [[Hall–Petch]] relationship. Since grain boundaries are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of the material. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of [[creep (deformation)|creep]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries are in general only a few nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as [[diffusion]] and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an [[amorphous solid]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

== Defects and impurities ==
Real crystals feature [[crystallographic defect|defects]] or irregularities in the ideal arrangements described above and it is these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes for one of the principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nikola |last=Kallay |date=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXsBk20WO1sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Interfacial Dynamics |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0824700065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] [[alloy]]s may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|title = Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|year = 1969|author = Hogan, C.

== Prediction of structure ==
{{Main| Crystal structure prediction}}
[[File:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|Crystal structure of sodium chloride (table salt)]]
The difficulty of predicting stable crystal structures based on the knowledge of only the chemical composition has long been a stumbling block on the way to fully computational materials design. Now, with more powerful algorithms and high-performance computing, structures of medium complexity can be predicted using such approaches as [[evolutionary algorithms]], random sampling, or metadynamics.

The crystal structures of simple ionic solids (e.g., NaCl or table salt) have long been rationalized in terms of [[Pauling's rules]], first set out in 1929 by [[Linus Pauling]], referred to by many since as the "father of the chemical bond".&lt;ref name="Paulingsrules"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Linus Pauling|L. Pauling]]|year = 1929|title = The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals|journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|volume = 51|issue = 4|pages= 1010–1026|doi= 10.1021/ja01379a006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauling also considered the nature of the interatomic forces in metals, and concluded that about half of the five d-orbitals in the transition metals are involved in bonding, with the remaining nonbonding d-orbitals being responsible for the magnetic properties. He, therefore, was able to correlate the number of d-orbitals in bond formation with the bond length as well as many of the physical properties of the substance. He subsequently introduced the metallic orbital, an extra orbital necessary to permit uninhibited resonance of valence bonds among various electronic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.54.899|title=The Nature of the Interatomic Forces in Metals|year=1938|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|journal=Physical Review|volume=54|issue=11|pages=899-904|bibcode = 1938PhRv...54..899P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[resonating valence bond theory]], the factors that determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability is associated with the simplest ratios or "bond numbers": {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|2|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, etc. The choice of structure and the value of the [[axial ratio]] (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01195a024|year=1947|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|title=Atomic Radii and Interatomic Distances in Metals|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=69|issue=3|pages=542-553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1949.0032|title=A Resonating-Valence-Bond Theory of Metals and Intermetallic Compounds|year=1949|last1=Pauling|first1=L.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=196|issue=1046|pages=343-362|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.196..343P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After postulating a direct correlation between electron concentration and crystal structure in beta-phase alloys, [[Hume-Rothery]] analyzed the trends in melting points, compressibilities and bond lengths as a function of group number in the periodic table in order to establish a system of valencies of the transition elements in the metallic state. This treatment thus emphasized the increasing bond strength as a function of group number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1951.0172|title=The Valencies of the Transition Elements in the Metallic State|year=1951|last1=Hume-rothery|first1=W.|first2=H. M.|first3=R. J. P.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=208|issue=1095|pages=431|last2=Irving|last3=Williams|bibcode = 1951RSPSA.208..431H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of directional forces were emphasized in one article on the relation between bond hybrids and the metallic structures. The resulting correlation between electronic and crystalline structures is summarized by a single parameter, the weight of the d-electrons per hybridized metallic orbital. The "d-weight" calculates out to 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for the fcc, hcp and bcc structures respectively. The relationship between d-electrons and crystal structure thus becomes apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1957.0073|title=On the Relation between Bond Hybrids and the Metallic Structures|year=1957|last1=Altmann|first1=S. L.|first2=C. A.|first3=W.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]| volume=240| issue=1221| pages=145| last2=Coulson| last3=Hume-Rothery| bibcode = 1957RSPSA.240..145A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In crystal structure predictions/simulations, the periodicity is usually applied, since the system is imagined as unlimited big in all directions. Starting from a triclinic structure with no further symmetry property assumed, the system may be driven to show some additional symmetry properties by applying Newton's Second Law on particles in the unit cell and a recently developed dynamical equation for the system period vectors
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/cjp-2014-0518|title=Dynamical equations for the period vectors in a periodic system under constant external stress|year=2015|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|journal=[[Can. J. Phys.]]| volume=93| issue=9| pages=974-978|bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..974L |arxiv=cond-mat/0209372}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lattice parameters including angles), even if the system is subject to external stress.

== Polymorphism ==
[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Quartz]] is one of the several [[crystalline]] forms of [[silica]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The most important forms of silica include: [[quartz|α-quartz]], [[quartz|β-quartz]], [[tridymite]], [[cristobalite]], [[coesite]], and [[stishovite]].]]
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the occurrence of multiple crystalline forms of a material. It is found in many crystalline materials including [[polymer]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s.  According to Gibbs' rules of phase equilibria, these unique crystalline phases are dependent on intensive variables such as pressure and temperature.  Polymorphism is related to [[allotropy]], which refers to [[chemical elements|elemental solids]]. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as [[crystal habit]], [[Amorphous solid|amorphous fraction]] or [[crystallographic defect]]s. Polymorphs have different stabilities and may spontaneously convert from a metastable form (or thermodynamically unstable form) to the [[stable]] form at a particular temperature. They also exhibit different [[melting points]], solubilities, and [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns.

One good example of this is the [[quartz]] form of [[silicon dioxide]], or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the vast majority of [[silicates]], the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. All but one of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of networking and polymerization. For example, they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these structures. In each of the 7 thermodynamically stable crystalline forms or polymorphs of crystalline quartz, only 2 out of 4 of each the edges of the {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula for silica: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another example is elemental [[tin]] (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is [[brittle]] when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence of its two major [[allotrope]]s, α- and β-tin. The two [[allotrope]]s that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as ''gray tin'' and ''white tin'' respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures above several GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = A. M.|last = Molodets|author2=Nabatov, S. S.|title = Thermodynamic Potentials, Diagram of State, and Phase Transitions of Tin on Shock Compression|journal = High Temperature|volume = 38|issue = 5|year = 2000|pages = 715–721|doi = 10.1007/BF02755923}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a [[diamond cubic]] crystal structure, similar to [[diamond]], [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized [[semiconductor]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|issue = |pages = 793–800|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman |author2=Wiberg, Egon |author3=Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Tin| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Mel|last = Schwartz |title = Encyclopedia of Materials, Parts and Finishes|edition = 2nd|chapter = Tin and Alloys, Properties|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2002|isbn= 978-1-56676-661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
Twenty of the 32 crystal classes are [[piezoelectric]], and crystals belonging to one of these classes (point groups) display [[piezoelectricity]]. All piezoelectric classes lack a center of symmetry. Any material develops a [[dielectric]] polarization when an electric field is applied, but a substance that has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are [[polar point group|polar]]. All polar crystals are [[pyroelectric]], so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.

There are a few crystal structures, notably the [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite structure]], which exhibit [[ferroelectric]] behavior. This is analogous to [[ferromagnetism]], in that, in the absence of an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).

[[Image:VAZ-2101-2103.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Curb feeler on a 1973 [[Lada|VAZ-2103 Ziguli]] (left).]]

'''Curb feelers''' or '''curb finders''' are [[spring (device)|springs]] or [[wire]]s installed on a vehicle which act as "[[whiskers]]" to alert drivers when they are at the right distance from the [[curb (road)|curb]] while parking. 

The devices are fitted low on the body, close to the wheels. As the vehicle approaches the curb, the protruding feelers scrape against the curb, making a noise and alerting the driver in time to avoid damaging the wheels or [[hubcap]]s. The feelers are manufactured to be flexible and do not break easily.

==Hotrods==
Curb feelers are still used on some [[hot rod]]s when a 1950s look is wanted. They are especially popular for cars with [[whitewall tire]]s, which easily lose their white coating when scraped against the curb. Sometimes curb feelers are found only on the passenger side of the car, since that is most commonly near the curb when parking. Sometimes they are added only next to the front wheels. Some curb feelers have a single wire or spring, while others have two to increase the area that can be protected. Any particular car may have just one curb feeler installed (as on the pictures) or more if attached near the front and rear, as well as on both sides of the vehicle.

==Recreational vehicles==
[[Recreational vehicle]]s sometimes have rubber feelers or metal, antenna-like rods mounted on the lower part of the body that act as feelers so that drivers are warned if they are approaching a curb or other obstruction, thus reducing the chances of gouging or even cutting the tire sidewalls and generally increasing the safety of vehicle operation.

==Buses==
[[Bus]]es are sometimes fitted with curb feelers, which can assist the driver in ensuring that the bus is close enough to the curb to allow passengers to step to and from the curb easily.

==Heavy equipment==
Today, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] Mine Safety and Health Administration mentions that users of [[heavy equipment]] can benefit from an [[Wiktionary:analogous|analogous]] accessory:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 In the 1950s, cars were often equipped with curb feelers 
...Using a piece of 48 inch [[conveyor belt]], 4 to 5 feet long by 4 to 6 inches wide and a couple of pieces of angle [[iron]], you can make a pinch-point feeler, a warning device for the corners of a continuous miner. This will give a warning nudge to anyone in the danger area, giving him or her about a two-foot running start to stop the machine or to yell at the operator to stop. The belting is stiff enough to hold its shape but flexible enough to give if it runs into a miner or vice versa. The flexibility also allows this "curb feeler" to drag against the rib or be smacked by a shuttle car with little or no damage. A little spray from a can of reflective [[paint]] will make the belt a visual warning device as well. One or two on each corner will help or put as many as you want.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msha.gov/Accident_Prevention/ideas/mechprox.htm U.S. Department of Labor]
Mine Safety and Health Administration&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Electronic sensors==
Curb feelers based on optical technology are designed to function the same way but work in the proximity of an obstruction rather than having to come into physical contact with it. As described by one [[United States patent law|United States patent]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
An electronic curb feeler system uses two pairs of optical sensor units to detect an object located near the front end of a vehicle during parking. One pair of optical sensor units detects an object directly in front of a left portion of the front end of the vehicle while another pair of optical sensors detects an object directly in front of a right portion of the front end of the vehicle. By supplying the operator of the vehicle with the location of the object as well as the exact distance the object is from the front end of the vehicle the operator can avoid hitting the object while parking very close to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=5701122|title=Electronic Curb Feeler|inventor=Thomas Canedy|y=1997|m=12|d=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Devices such as this, and simpler electronic devices similar to the original wire curb feelers used on cars, are used in the design of various mobile [[robotics|robotic]] devices. One robotics company that does work for the [[United States Department of Defense]] uses [[laser]]-assisted curb feeler technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/overview.html Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional [[power station]]s, such as [[coal]]-fired, [[combined cycle|gas]], and [[nuclear power]]ed plants, as well as [[hydroelectric]] dams and large-scale [[photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s, are centralized and often require electric energy to be [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]] over long distances. By contrast, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and more flexible technologies, that are located close to the load they serve, albeit having capacities of only 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) or less. These systems can comprise  multiple generation and storage components; in this instance they are referred to as [[hybrid power]] systems.

DER systems typically use [[renewable energy]] sources, including [[small hydro]], [[biomass]], [[biogas]], [[solar power]], [[wind power]], and [[geothermal power]], and increasingly play an important role for the [[electric power distribution]] system. A grid-connected device for [[Grid energy storage|electricity storage]] can also be classified as a DER system and is often called a '''distributed energy storage system''' ('''DESS'''). By means of an interface, DER systems can be managed and coordinated within a [[smart grid]]. Distributed generation and storage enables collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve security of supply.

[[Microgrid]]s are modern, localized, small-scale grids,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleh|first=M.|last2=Esa|first2=Y.|last3=Mhandi|first3=Y.|last4=Brandauer|first4=W.|last5=Mohamed|first5=A.|date=October 2016|title=Design and implementation of CCNY DC microgrid testbed|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7731870/|journal=2016 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting|pages=1–7|doi=10.1109/IAS.2016.7731870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saleh|first=M.

Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They are typically low-voltage AC grids, often use [[diesel generator]]s, and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids increasingly employ a mixture of different distributed energy resources, such as [[solar hybrid power systems]], which reduce the amount of emitted carbon significantly.

== Overview ==

Historically, central plants have been an integral part of the electric grid, in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers. These, in turn, supply the traditional transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers. These were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing T&amp;D facilities and tariffs. Central plants are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site-specific manner, and are built as "one-off," custom projects.

These [[economies of scale]] began to fail in the late 1960s and, by the start of the 21st century, Central Plants could arguably no longer deliver competitively cheap and reliable electricity to more remote customers through the grid, because the plants had come to cost less than the grid and had become so reliable that nearly all power failures originated in the grid. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Thus, the grid had become the main driver of remote customers’ power costs and power quality problems, which became more acute as digital equipment required extremely reliable electricity.&lt;ref name="DOE 2007"&gt;DOE; The Potential Benefits of Distributed Generation and Rate-Related Issues that May Impede Their Expansion; 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovins; Small Is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size; Rocky Mountain Institute, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency gains no longer come from increasing generating capacity, but from smaller units located closer to sites of demand.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, et al; Policy Options to Support Distributed Resources; U. of Del., Ctr. for Energy &amp; Env. Policy; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch; 1989; cited in DOE, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, coal power plants are built away from cities to prevent their heavy air pollution from affecting the populace. In addition, such plants are often built near [[Colliery|collieries]] to minimize the cost of transporting coal. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] plants are by their nature limited to operating at sites with sufficient water flow.

Low pollution is a crucial advantage of combined cycle plants that burn [[natural gas]]. The low pollution permits the plants to be near enough to a city to provide [[district heating]] and cooling.

Distributed energy resources are mass-produced, small, and less site-specific. Their development arose out of:
# concerns over perceived externalized costs of central plant generation, particularly environmental concerns;
# the increasing age, deterioration, and capacity constraints upon T&amp;D for bulk power;
# the increasing relative economy of mass production of smaller appliances over heavy manufacturing of larger units and on-site construction;
# Along with higher relative prices for energy, higher overall complexity and total costs for regulatory oversight, tariff administration, and metering and billing.

Capital markets have come to realize that right-sized resources, for individual customers, distribution substations, or microgrids, are able to offer important but little-known economic advantages over central plants. Smaller units offered greater economies from mass-production than big ones could gain through unit size. These increased value—due to improvements in financial risk, engineering flexibility, security, and environmental quality—of these resources can often more than offset their apparent cost disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;Lovins; Small Is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size; Rocky Mountain Institute; 2002&lt;/ref&gt; DG, vis-à-vis central plants, must be justified on a life-cycle basis.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan (Citation pending)&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many of the direct, and virtually all of the indirect, benefits of DG are not captured within traditional utility cash-flow accounting.&lt;ref name="DOE 2007"/&gt;

While the [[levelized cost of electricity|levelized cost]] of distributed generation (DG) is typically more expensive than conventional, centralized sources on a kilowatt-hour basis, this does not consider negative aspects of conventional fuels. The additional premium for DG is rapidly declining as demand increases and technology progresses,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and sufficient and reliable demand may bring economies of scale, innovation, competition, and more flexible financing, that could make DG clean energy part of a more diversified future.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} &lt;!-- O come on! POV, anyone? --&gt;

Distributed generation reduces the amount of energy lost in transmitting electricity because the electricity is generated very near where it is used, perhaps even in the same building. This also reduces the size and number of power lines that must be constructed.

Typical DER systems in a [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) scheme have low maintenance, low pollution and high efficiencies. In the past, these traits required dedicated operating engineers and large complex plants to reduce pollution. However, modern [[embedded system]]s can provide these traits with automated operation and [[renewable energy|renewables]], such as sunlight, wind and [[geothermal]]. This reduces the size of power plant that can show a profit.

=== Grid parity ===

[[Grid parity]] occurs when an [[alternative energy]] source can generate electricity at a levelized cost ([[LCOE]]) that is less than or equal to the end consumer's retail price. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without [[subsidy|subsidies]] or government support. Since the 2010s, grid parity for solar and wind has become a reality in a growing number of markets, including Australia, several European countries, and some states in the U.S.&lt;ref name=wp-grid-parity-2014&gt;{{cite web

== Technologies ==

Distributed energy resource ('''DER''') systems are small-scale power generation or storage technologies (typically in the range of 1&amp;nbsp;kW to 10,000&amp;nbsp;kW)&lt;ref name=nrel-using-der&gt;{{cite web

=== Cogeneration ===

Distributed [[cogeneration]] sources use steam turbines, natural gas-fired [[fuel cell]]s, [[microturbine]]s or [[reciprocating engine]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ Gas engine cogeneration], www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 9.12.2013&lt;/ref&gt; to turn generators.

In addition, [[molten carbonate fuel cell]] and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s using natural gas, such as the ones from [[FuelCell Energy]] and the [[Bloom energy server]], or waste-to-energy processes such as the Gate 5 Energy System are used as a distributed energy resource.

=== Solar power ===
{{further|Photovoltaic system}}

[[Photovoltaics]], by far the most important solar technology for distributed generation of [[solar power]], uses [[solar cell]]s assembled into [[solar panel]]s to convert sunlight into electricity. It is a [[growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years. [[PV system]]s range from distributed, residential, and commercial [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop]] or [[Building-integrated photovoltaics|building integrated]] installations, to large, centralized utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s.

The predominant PV technology is [[crystalline silicon]], while [[thin-film solar cell]] technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer-PR-2014"&gt;

As most [[renewable energy]] sources and unlike coal and nuclear, solar PV is variable and non-[[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]], but has no fuel costs, operating pollution, as well as greatly reduced mining-safety and operating-safety issues. It produces peak power around local noon each day and its [[capacity factor]] is around 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu, Janet Marsdon [https://www.academia.edu/446324/Distributed_Generation_Systems_A_New_Paradigm_for_Sustainable_Energy Distributed Generation Systems:A New Paradigm for Sustainable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wind power ===
{{main|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s can be distributed energy resources or they can be built at utility scale. These have low maintenance and low pollution, but distributed wind unlike utility-scale wind has much higher costs than other sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NREL: Energy Analysis - Distributed Generation Energy Technology Capital Costs|url = http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech_cost_dg.html|website = www.nrel.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with solar, wind energy is variable and non-dispatchable. Wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds, but good operating safety. Distributed generation from [[wind hybrid power systems]] combines wind power with other DER systems. One such example is the integration of wind turbines into [[solar hybrid power systems]], as wind tends to complement solar because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year.

=== Hydro power ===
{{main|Small hydro|Wave power}}

Hydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy and its potential has already been explored to a large extent or is compromised due to issues such as environmental impacts on fisheries, and increased demand for recreational access. However, using modern 21st century technology, such as [[wave power]], can make large amounts of new hydropower capacity available, with minor environmental impact.

Modular and scalable ''Next generation kinetic energy turbines'' can be deployed in arrays to serve the needs on a residential, commercial, industrial, municipal or even regional scale. ''Microhydro kinetic generators'' neither require dams nor impoundments, as they utilize the kinetic energy of water motion, either waves or flow. No construction is needed on the shoreline or sea bed, which minimizes environmental impacts to habitats and simplifies the permitting process. Such power generation also has minimal environmental impact and non-traditional microhydro applications can be tethered to existing construction such as docks, piers, bridge abutments, or similar structures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu, Janet Marsdon [https://www.academia.edu/446324/Distributed_Generation_Systems_A_New_Paradigm_for_Sustainable_Energy Distributed Generation Systems:A New Paradigm for Sustainable Energy], pp. 8, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waste-to-energy ===
{{main|Waste-to-energy|Waste-to-energy plant}}

Municipal solid waste (MSW) and natural waste, such as sewage sludge, food waste and animal manure will decompose and discharge methane-containing gas that can be collected and used as fuel in gas turbines or micro turbines to produce electricity as a distributed energy resource. Additionally, a California-based company, Gate 5 Energy Partners, Inc. has developed a process that transforms natural waste materials, such as sewage sludge, into biofuel that can be combusted to power a steam turbine that produces power. This power can be used in lieu of grid-power at the waste source (such as a treatment plant, farm or dairy).

=== Energy storage ===
{{main|Grid energy storage}}

A distributed energy resource is not limited to the generation of electricity but may also include a device to store distributed energy (DE).&lt;ref name="smartgrid-gov-lexicon"&gt;http://www.smartgrid.gov [https://www.smartgrid.gov/lexicon/6/letter_d Lexicon Distributed Energy Resource]&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed energy storage systems (DESS) applications include several types of battery, [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]], [[Compressed air energy storage|compressed air]], and [[thermal energy storage]].&lt;ref name="nrel-storage" /&gt;{{rp|42}} Access to energy storage  for commercial applications is easily accessible through programs such as [[Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS)]].

==== PV storage ====
: Common [[rechargeable battery]] technologies used in today's PV systems include, the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]] ([[lead–acid battery]]), [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[lithium-ion batteries]]. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low [[self-discharge]] (4–6% per year) as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as for [[electric vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ETH Zürich, Harvard University |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264239770_The_Economic_Viability_of_Battery_Storage_for_Residential_Solar_Photovoltaic_Systems_-_A_Review_and_a_Simulation_Model |title=The Economic Viability of Battery Storage for Residential Solar Photovoltaic Systems - A Review and a Simulation Model |author1=Joern Hoppmann |author2=Jonas Volland |author3=Tobias S. Schmidt |author4=Volker H. Hoffmann |date=July 2014 |access-date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4,9}}

: However, lithium-ion batteries, such as the [[Tesla Powerwall]], have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to [[economies of scale]] provided by large production facilities such as the [[Gigafactory 1]]. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in [[electric car]]s may serve as future storage devices, since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed PV systems include, [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard /&gt;{{rp|4}}

==== Flywheels ====

: An advanced [[flywheel energy storage]] (FES) stores the electricity generated from distributed resources in the form of angular [[kinetic energy]] by accelerating a rotor ([[flywheel]]) to a very high speed of about 20,000 to over 50,000 rpm in a vacuum enclosure. Flywheels can respond quickly as they store and feed back electricity into the grid in a matter of seconds.&lt;ref name="ScienceNews"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Integration with the grid ==

For reasons of reliability, distributed generation resources would be interconnected to the same transmission grid as central stations. Various technical and economic issues occur in the integration of these resources into a grid. Technical problems arise in the areas of [[power quality]], voltage stability, harmonics, reliability, protection, and control.&lt;ref&gt;Tomoiagă, B.; Chindriş, M.; Sumper, A.; Sudria-Andreu, A.; Villafafila-Robles, R.

Each distributed generation resource has its own integration issues. Solar PV and wind power both have intermittent and unpredictable generation, so they create many stability issues for voltage and frequency. These voltage issues affect mechanical grid equipment, such as load tap changers, which  respond too often and wear out much more quickly than utilities anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agalgaonkar|first1=Y.P.|last2=et. al|title=Distribution Voltage Control Considering the Impact of PV Generation on Tap Changers and Autonomous Regulators|journal=Power Systems, IEEE Transactions on|date=16 September 2013|volume=29|issue=1|pages=182–192|doi=10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279721|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6600912|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, without any form of energy storage during times of high solar generation, companies must rapidly increase generation around the time of sunset to compensate for the loss of solar generation. This high ramp rate produces what the industry terms the ''[[duck curve]]''  ([http://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/CAISO_DuckCurve_545_355.jpg example]) that is a major concern for grid operators in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What the Duck Curve Tells Us About Managing A Green Grid|url=https://www.caiso.com/Documents/FlexibleResourcesHelpRenewables_FastFacts.pdf|website=caiso.com|publisher=California ISO|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage can fix these issues if it can be implemented. Flywheels have shown to provide excellent frequency regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazarewicz|first1=Matthew|last2=Rojas|first2=Alex|title=Grid Frequency Regulation by Recycling Electrical Energy in Flywheels|journal=Power Engineering Society General Meeting|date=10 June 2004|pages=2038–2042|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1373235&amp;tag=1|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term use batteries, at a large enough scale of use, can help to flatten the duck curve and prevent generator use fluctuation and can help to maintain voltage profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lazar|first1=Jim|title=Teaching the "Duck" to Fly|url=http://www.ripuc.ri.gov/eventsactions/docket/4443-EERMC-Presentation2_5-8-14.pdf|publisher=RAP|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cost is a major limiting factor for energy storage as each technique is prohibitively expensive to produce at scale and comparatively not energy dense compared to liquid fossil fuels. Finally, another necessary method of aiding in integration of photovoltaics for proper distributed generation is in the use of [[intelligent hybrid inverter]]s.

Another approach does not demand grid integration: stand alone hybrid systems.

== Stand alone hybrid systems ==
It is now possible to combine technologies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[cogen]] to make stand alone distributed generation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = Kunal K. | last2 = Mundada | first2 = Aishwarya S. | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2015 | title = Performance of U.S. hybrid distributed energy systems: Solar photovoltaic, battery and combined heat and power | url = https://www.academia.edu/14674492/Performance_of_U.S._hybrid_distributed_energy_systems_Solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_combined_heat_and_power | journal = Energy Conversion and Management | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 71–80 | doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2015.07.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work has shown that such systems have a low [[levelized cost of electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mundada | first1 = Aishwarya | last2 = Shah | first2 = Kunal | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2016 | title = Levelized cost of electricity for solar photovoltaic, battery and cogen hybrid systems | url = https://www.academia.edu/20141118/Levelized_cost_of_electricity_for_solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_cogen_hybrid_systems | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 692–703 | doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors now think that these technologies may enable a mass-scale [[grid defection]] because consumers can produce electricity using [[off grid]] systems primarily made up of [[solar photovoltaic]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Kumagai, J., 2014. The rise of the personal power plant. IEEE Spectrum,51(6), pp.54-59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abhilash Kantamneni, Richelle Winkler, Lucia Gauchia, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/25363058/Emerging_Economic_Viability_of_Grid_Defection_in_a_Northern_Climate_Using_Solar_Hybrid_Systems free open access Emerging economic viability of grid defection in a northern climate using solar hybrid systems]. ''Energy Policy'' '''95''', 378–389 (2016). doi: 10.1016/j.enpol.2016.05.013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khalilpour, R. and Vassallo, A., 2015. Leaving the grid: An ambition or a real choice?. Energy Policy, 82, pp.207-221.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed that there may wide scale [[grid defection]].&lt;ref&gt;The Economics of Grid Defection - Rocky Mountain Institute
  http://www.rmi.org/electricity_grid_defection&lt;/ref&gt; This is backed up by studies in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Balaskovitz [http://midwestenergynews.com/2016/06/14/net-metering-changes-could-drive-people-off-grid-michigan-researchers-say/  Net metering changes could drive people off grid, Michigan researchers say] - MidWest Energy News&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost factors ==

Cogenerators are also more expensive per watt than central generators.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} They find favor because most buildings already burn fuels, and the cogeneration can extract more value from the fuel . Local production has no [[Losses in electrical systems|electricity transmission losses]] on long distance [[power line]]s or energy losses from the [[Joule effect]] in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.schneider-electric.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2013/03/25/how-big-are-power-line-losses/|title=How big are Power line losses?|work=Schneider Electric Blog|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[cost of electricity by source]]).

Some larger installations utilize combined cycle generation. Usually this consists of a [[gas turbine]] whose exhaust boils [[water]] for a [[steam turbine]] in a [[Rankine cycle]]. The condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive [[chiller]]. Combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies, often exceeding 85%.

In countries with high pressure gas distribution, small turbines can be used to bring the gas pressure to domestic levels whilst extracting useful energy. If the UK were to implement this countrywide an additional 2-4&amp;nbsp;GWe would become available. (Note that the energy is already being generated elsewhere to provide the high initial gas pressure - this method simply distributes the energy via a different route.)

== Microgrid ==

A ''microgrid'' is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid ([[electrical grid|macrogrid]]). This single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected. The microgrid can then function autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Mark Kaplan, Fred Sissine, (ed.) ''Smart grid: modernizing electric power transmission and distribution...'' The Capitol Net Inc, 2009, {{ISBN|1-58733-162-4}}, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage and it can operate in DC, AC, or the combination of both.  From the point of view of the grid operator, a connected microgrid can be controlled as if it were one entity.

Microgrid generation resources can include stationary batteries, fuel cells, solar, wind, or other energy sources. The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Produced heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating, allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power.

Micro-grids were proposed in the wake of the [[July 2012 India blackout]]:&lt;ref name="moneycontrol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/smementor/mentorade/starting-up/power-crisisgrid-collapse-is-it-time-to-think--739976.html|title=Power crisis and grid collapse: Is it time to think|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Small micro-grids covering 30–50&amp;nbsp;km radius&lt;ref name="moneycontrol"/&gt;
* Small power stations of 5–10&amp;nbsp;MW to serve the micro-grids
* Generate power locally to reduce dependence on long distance transmission lines and cut transmission losses.

GTM Research forecasts microgrid capacity in the United States will exceed 1.8 gigawatts by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/US-Microgrid-Capacity-Will-Exceed-1.8-GW-by-2018|title=US Microgrid Capacity Will Exceed 1.8GW by 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micro-grids have seen implementation in a number of communities over the world. For example, Tesla has implemented a solar micro-grid in the Samoan island of Ta'u, powering the entire island with solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/22/13712750/tesla-microgrid-tau-samoa|title=Tesla powers a whole island with solar to show off its energy chops|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This localized production system has helped save over 100,000 gallons of diesel fuel. It is also able to sustain the island for three whole days if the sun were not to shine at all during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/02/tau-american-samoa-solar-power-microgrid-tesla-solarcity/|title=How a Pacific Island Changed From Diesel to 100% Solar Power|date=2017-02-23|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a great example of how micro-grid systems can be implemented in communities to encourage renewable resource usage and localized production.

To plan and install Microgrids correctly, engineering modelling is needed. Multiple simulation tools and optimization tools exist to model the economic and electric effects of Microgrids. A widely used economic optimization tool is the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) from [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. Another frequently used commercial economic modelling tool is [https://www.homerenergy.com/ Homer Energy], originally designed by the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory|National Renewable Laboratory]]. There are also some power flow and electrical design tools guiding the Microgrid developers. The [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] designed the public available GridLAB-D tool and the [[Electric Power Research Institute|Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)]] designed OpenDSS to simulate the distribution system (for Microgrids). A professional integrated DER-CAM and OpenDSS version is available via [https://www.bankableenergy.com/ BankableEnergy]. A European tool that can be used for electrical, cooling, heating, and process heat demand simulation is EnergyPLAN from the [[Aalborg University|Aalborg University, Denmark]].

== Communication in DER systems ==

* [[IEC 61850]]-7-420 is published by IEC TC 57: Power systems management and associated information exchange. It is one of the IEC 61850 standards, some of which are core Standards required for implementing smart grids. It uses communication services mapped to [[Manufacturing Message Specification|MMS]] as per IEC 61850-8-1 standard.
* [[OLE for process control|OPC]] is also used for the communication between different entities of DER system.
*[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] IEEE 2030.7 microgrid controller standard. That concept relies on 4 blocks: a) Device Level control (e.g. Voltage and Frequency Control), b) Local Area Control (e.g. data communication), c) Supervisory (software) controller (e.g. forward looking dispatch optimization of generation and load resources), and d) Grid Layer (e.g. communication with utility).
*A wide variety of complex control algorithms exist, making it difficult for small and residential [[Distributed Energy Resource]] (DER) users to implement energy management and control systems. Especially, communication upgrades and data information systems can make it expensive. Thus, some projects try to simplify the control of DER via off-the shelf products and make it usable for the mainstream (e.g. using a Raspberry Pi).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fürst|first=Jonathan|last2=Gawinowski|first2=Nik|last3=Buettrich|first3=Sebastian|last4=Bonnet|first4=Philippe|date=2013-09-25|title=COSMGrid: Configurable, off-the-shelf micro grid|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259157235_COSMGrid_Configurable_off-the-shelf_micro_grid|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE Global Humanitarian Technology Conference, GHTC 2013|doi=10.1109/GHTC.2013.6713662}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cet.or.at/pdf_files/Paspberry%20Pi%20Microgrid%20Controller.pdf|title=A flexible low cost PV/EV microgrid controller concept based on a Raspberry Pi|last=Stadler|first=Michael|date=2018|website=Center for Energy and innovative Technologies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal requirements for distributed generation ==

In 2010 Colorado enacted a law requiring that by 2020 that 3% of the power generated in Colorado utilize distributed generation of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/us/04electricity.html "Going Solar Is Harder Than It Looks, a Valley Finds"] article by Kirk Johnson in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 3 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/colorado-to-boost-renewables-requirements/ "Colorado Increases Renewables Requirements"] blog by Kate Galbraith on NYTimes.Com 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill, SB 338, that makes utility companies plan "carbon-free alternatives to gas generation" in order to meet peak demand. The law requires utilities to evaluate issues such as energy storage, efficiency, and distributed energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-gov-brown-signs-bill-directing-utilities-to-plan-storage-ders/507116/|title=California Gov.

{{For|the musician|Eg White}}
'''Egg white''' is the clear liquid (also called the '''albumen''' or the '''glair'''/'''glaire''') contained within an [[Egg (biology)|egg]]. In [[chicken]]s it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen's [[oviduct]] during the passage of the egg.&lt;ref&gt;Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; It forms around [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in animals|fertilized]] or unfertilized [[egg yolk]]s. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition for the growth of the [[embryo]] (when fertilized).
Egg white consists primarily of about 90% water into which is dissolved about 10% [[protein]]s (including [[albumin]]s, [[mucoprotein]]s, and [[globulin]]s). Unlike the yolk, which is high in [[lipid]]s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat, and [[carbohydrate]] content is less than 1%. Egg whites contain about 56% of the protein in the egg. Egg white has many [[Egg (food)|uses in food]] (e.g. [[meringue]], [[mousse]]) and also many other uses (e.g. in the preparation of [[vaccine]]s such as [[Influenza vaccine|those for influenza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(98)70101-5 |pmid=9821418 |title=Safe administration of influenza vaccine to patients with egg allergy |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=5 |pages=624–8 |year=1998 |last1=James |first1=John M. |last2=Zeiger |first2=Robert S. |last3=Lester |first3=Mitchell R. |last4=Fasano |first4=Mary Beth |last5=Gern |first5=James E. |last6=Mansfield |first6=Lyndon E. |last7=Schwartz |first7=Howard J. |last8=Sampson |first8=Hugh A. |last9=Windom |first9=Hugh H. |last10=Machtinger |first10=Steven B. |last11=Lensing |first11=Shelly }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Composition==
Egg white makes up around two-thirds of a chicken egg by weight. Water constitutes about 90% of this, with protein, trace [[mineral]]s, fatty material, [[vitamin]]s, and [[glucose]] contributing the remainder.&lt;ref name="McGee, 77"&gt;McGee, Harold. ''On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen''. New York: Scribner, 2004, edited by Vinay.
&lt;/ref&gt;  A raw U.S. large egg contains around 33&amp;nbsp;grams of egg white with 3.6&amp;nbsp;grams of protein, 0.24&amp;nbsp;grams of [[carbohydrate]] and 55 milligrams of [[sodium]]. It contains no [[cholesterol]] and the energy content is about 17 [[Calories]].&lt;ref name="McGee, 77" /&gt; Egg white is an alkaline solution and contains around 148 proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Exploratorium&lt;/ref&gt; The table below lists the major proteins in egg whites by percentage and their natural functions.&lt;ref name="McGee, 77"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Takehiko_Yamamoto,_Mujo_Kim"&gt;{{citation |url=

Ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in albumen. Classed as phosphoglycoprotein, during storage, it converts into s-ovalbumin (5% at the time of laying) and can reach up to 80% after six months of cold storage. Ovalbumin in solution is heat-resistant. Denaturation temperature is around 84°C, but it can be easily denatured by physical stresses.
Conalbumin/ovotransferrin is a glycoprotein which has the capacity to bind the bi- and trivalent metal cations into a complex and is more heat sensitive than ovalbumin. At its isoelectric pH (6.5), it can bind two cations and assume a red or yellow color.  These metal complexes are more heat stable than the native state. Ovomucoid is the major allergen from egg white and is a heat-resistant glycoprotein found to be a trypsin inhibitor.  Lysozyme is a [[holoprotein]] which can lyse the wall of certain Gram-positive bacteria and is found at high levels in the chalaziferous layer and the chalazae which anchor the yolk towards the middle of the egg. Ovomucin is a glycoprotein which may contribute to the gel-like structure of thick albumen. The amount of ovomucin in the thick albumen is four times greater than in the thin albumen.

==Foam==
[[File:Diagram -2 denaturation.svg|thumb|Visual representation of protein denaturation. A globular protein becomes unfolded when exposed to heat. ]]
The physical stress of beating egg whites can create a foam.  Two types of physical stress are caused by beating them with a whisk, the first of which occurs as the whisk drags the liquid through itself, creating a force that unfolds the protein molecules. This process is called [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]. The second stress comes from the mixing of air into the whites, which causes the proteins to come out of their natural state.  These denatured proteins gather together where the air and water meet and create multiple bonds with the other unraveled proteins, and thus become a foam, holding the incorporated air in place, because the proteins consist of amino acids; some are hydrophilic (attracted to water) and some are hydrophobic (repelled by water). This process is called [[Flocculation|coagulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/icooks/11-03-03.html|title=Science of Cooking: Ask the Inquisitive Cooks!|work=exploratorium.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGee, 77" /&gt;

When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks.  Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and  eventually collapse. Egg whites do not beat up correctly if they are exposed to any form of fat, such as [[cooking oil]]s or the fats contained in [[egg yolk]].

===Stabilizing foam for culinary purposes===

====Copper bowl====
[[Copper]] bowls have been used in [[France]] since the 18th century to stabilize egg foams. The copper in the bowl assists in creating a tighter bond in reactive [[sulfur]] items such as egg whites.  The bond created is so tight that the sulfurs are prevented from reacting with any other material.  A silver-plated bowl has the same result as the copper bowl, as will a pinch of powdered copper supplement from a health store used in a glass bowl.  Drawbacks of the copper bowl include the expense of the bowl itself, and the bowls are difficult to keep clean.  Copper contamination from the bowl is minimal, as a cup of foam contains a tenth of a human's normal daily intake level.&lt;ref name="McGee, 77" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/308667a0 |title=Why whip egg whites in copper bowls? |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5960 |pages=667–8 |year=1984 |last1=McGee |first1=Harold J. |last2=Long |first2=Sharon R. |last3=Briggs |first3=Winslow R. |bibcode=1984Natur.308..667M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health issues==
Although egg whites are prized as a source of low-fat, high-protein nutrition, a small number of people cannot eat them.  [[Egg allergy]] is more common among infants than adults, and most children will outgrow it by the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafa.org/display.cfm?id=9&amp;sub=20&amp;cont=523 “Egg Allergy Facts”] Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Food allergy|Allergic reaction]]s against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks.&lt;ref name="isbn3-540-20768-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arnaldo Cantani |title=Pediatric Allergy, Asthma and Immunology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages=710–713 |isbn=978-3-540-20768-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a [[Egg white intolerance|food intolerance]] to egg whites.&lt;ref name="isbn3-540-20768-6" /&gt;

Eggs are susceptible to ''[[Salmonella]]'' contamination. Thorough cooking eliminates the direct threat (i.e. cooked egg whites that are solid and not runny), the threat of cross-contamination remains if people handle contaminated eggs and then touch other foods or items in the kitchen, thus spreading the bacteria. In August 2010, the FDA ordered the recall of 380 million eggs because of possible ''Salmonella'' contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/20/business/la-fi-eggs-qa-20100820 |title=Eggs and salmonella: What you need to know |author=Roan, Shari |date=August 20, 2010 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Chicken egg01 monovular.jpg|thumb|A raw [[egg yolk]] surrounded by the egg white]]

Egg white is a [[Finings|fining agent]] that can be used in the [[clarification and stabilization of wine]]. Egg white can also be added to shaken cocktails to create a delicate froth. Some protein powders also use egg whites as a primary source of protein.

In the 1750s, egg whites were believed to prevent swelling, and were used for that purpose. To help soothe areas of skin that were afflicted, egg white mixed with Armenic bole could help restore the fibers. Egg whites are also used in bookbinding during the [[gilding]] process, where it is referred to as 'glaire', and to give a book cover shine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urbain de Vandenesse|Vandenesse, Urbain de]], "Egg White."

[[File:World Globe Award D Osborn 1.JPG|thumb|Winner of 2001 World Energy Globe Award, Donald Osborn and SMUD]]

The International '''Energy Globe Awards''' (the '''''World Awards for Sustainability''''' or '''''Nature's Nobel Prize''''') have been awarded by the ''Energy Globe Foundation'' annually to recognise projects that 'make careful and economical use of resources and employ [[renewable energy|alternative energy]] sources.' The winners, in the categories of Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Youth, are selected by a panel including members from the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]], [[World Bank]] and the [[European Renewable Energy Council]]. In 2016, the category Sustainable Plastics was added to the over five categories. The awards were an initiative by Austrian engineer and environmentalist Wolfgang Neumann. The herculean status of the Award often equates it to [[Nobel Prize]].

It distinguishes projects regionally, nationally and globally every year since 2000.

The goal of the Energy Globe Award is to create the necessary awareness concerning solutions to our environmental problems and to demonstrate that each of us can make a positive contribution. The winning ENERGY GLOBE projects serve as examples, which are presented on the Energy Globe website and in the Energy Globe project database. The monetary prize for first place in the international award is 10,000 euro which is distributed among the six categories.

The (inter)national ENERGY GLOBE winner projects are honored at festive ceremonies and presented in the media and on television. Large-scale awards were held in 2007 and 2008 in the Plenary Hall of the European Parliament in Brussels with the support of prominent people from all over the world. 2009 the Energy Globe gala was the opening event of the informal meeting of the EU Environmental Ministers in Prague. 2010 Energy Globe together with UNEP has opened the UN World Environment Day
in Kigali/Rwanda. The 2014/2015 celebration took place in Tehran/Iran. More than 1000 projects from all over the world are submitted each year. In all some 7000 projects from 177 countries have been submitted for the Energy Globe Award.

The ENERGY GLOBE Jury is headed by [[Maneka Gandhi]] (Member of Parliament), incumbent Indian minister for [[Ministry of Women and Child Development (India) |Ministry of Women and Child Development ]] and former Indian Minister for Environment.

International personalities such as former Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan, former Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev, the President of the European Parliament and EU Commission, world stars like actor Martin Sheen, “Columbo” Peter Falk, Bollywood star Aamir Khan, musicians like Alanis Morissette, Dionne Warwick, Zucchero, Robin Gibb (Bee Gees), etc., offer their services for Energy Globe.

==Recipients==
[[Hridith Sudev]], a then ninth grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in [[Oman]] won the Energy Globe National Award 2014 for his initiative [[Project GreenOman]], setting record as the youngest ever to do so (at age 14). The project later grew into [[Project GreenWorld International]], the World's biggest children's environmental organization.
Other recipients include:
* [[Lino Guzzella]]
* [[Igrejinha]]
* [[Indian Solar Loan Programme]]
* [[Santa Cruz do Sul]]
* [[Unilever Indonesia]]
* [[Georges Zissis]]
* [[Coop (Switzerland)]]

Founded in 2002, '''First Wind''' was an independent [[renewable energy]] company that develops and operates utility-scale power projects in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wind Power Engineering and Development: Top Wind Developers in the US; http://www.windpowerengineering.com/top-wind-power-developers-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; It grew to employ more than 220 people across the country.

Headquartered in [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/11/24/first-wind-grows-aiming-low/VxCA0xilA28i9JuQ38COoN/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; the company develops or operates renewable energy projects in Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2014/06/first_wind_cuts_ribbon_on_warren_solar_p.html|title=First Wind cuts ribbon on Warren solar project|work=masslive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York, Utah, Idaho, Washington and Hawaii with a combined capacity of nearly 1,300 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstwind.com/projects/|title=Projects|work=First Wind}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to renewable energy projects, the company developed and operates two generator leads.

First Wind began as a utility-scale [[wind power]] developer and operator, but in 2014 the company brought its first [[solar energy]] projects online.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Business Journal. Boston-based First Wind has made smooth entry into solar power http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2014/06/boston-based-first-wind-has-made-smooth-transition.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 First Wind was purchased by [[SunEdison]] and its yieldco TerraForm Power for $2.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/sunedison-and-terraform-to-buy-first-wind-for-2-4-billion-in-renewable-energy-deal/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Mergers%20&amp;%20Acquisitions&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, as part of the merger integration, First Wind CEO Paul Gaynor, who led the company since 2004, was appointed EVP Of North America Utility And Global Wind at SunEdison.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunedison-appoints-paul-gaynor-as-evp-of-north-america-utility-and-global-wind-300030342.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8972">'''Forest integrated pest management''' or '''Forest IPM''' is the practice of monitoring and managing [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] information with [[pest control]] methods to prevent pest damage to [[forest]]s and forest habitats by the most economical means. Forest IPM practices vary from region to region and particularly by state, according to the habitat and forests present. Forest integrated pest management or Forest IPM combines cultural, biological and chemical technologies to reduce pest damage to levels below those that of economic damage. Forest IPM is utilized for the whole life of the tree, from site prep to harvest. An [[Integrated pest management|IPM]] treatment is utilized before the cost of the treatment is equal to the reduction in crop value due to past injury, which is called the economic injury level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=South|first1=D.B.|last2=Enebak|first2=S.A.|title=Integrated Pest Management Practices in Southern Pine Nurseries|journal=New Forests|date=2006|volume=31|issue=2|pages=253-271|doi=10.1007/s11056-005-6571-0|url=http://download.springer.com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/static/pdf/693/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11056-005-6571-0.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11056-005-6571-0&amp;token2=exp=1490834038~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F693%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11056-005-6571-0.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11056-005-6571-0*~hmac=5e124b62168e6bf1a5f27151677d1446c4d381f3a4a7fd5156648a45cd2cad8f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest integrated pest management has a strong emphasis on intensive forest management.&lt;ref name="integrated pest management handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=Integrated pest management in southern pine forests: integrated pest management handbook|date=1986|publisher=Department of Agriculture|location=Washington D.C.|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4532163;view=1up;seq=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main components of forest integrated pest management are how pest populations change over time, forest stand susceptibility and resistance to pests, pest impact on crop value, and control strategies. Forest IPM is designed to provide the information needed to deal with multiple pest problems in a way that promotes [[forest management]] objectives.


In the state of [[Vermont]], two common pests are of particular significance, the [[Hemlock Woolly Adelgid]] or HWA, and [[thrip]]s.

== Practices of IPM ==

=== Preventative ===
Preventative practices of forest integrated pest management include training, detection, diagnosis and evaluation and exclusion. These are actions that can be done to prevent pest infestations from reaching levels of concern. Training employees to find early signs of pest occurrence will help landowners find and remove infected trees before the infestation spreads. Cleaning equipment before moving to different stands and when first brought onto the property will remove any contaminates that could affect the forest.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/sites/default/files/Forest%20Nursery%20Pests-web.pdf|title=Forest Nursery pests|last=Hoffard|first=W.H.|last2=Anderson|first2=R.L.|last3=Cordell|first3=C.E.|publisher=United States Forest Service|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural ===
Intensive forest management can be described as the cultural practices in forest integrated pest management. Cultural practices are done during the growth of the crop trees and also in the form of site prep and harvest practices. These practices range from choosing a good site with adequate drainage to the having an appropriate tree per acer (TPA). [[Seedling]] density is very important in tree [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]. Having seedlings with a too high density promotes foliage disease fungi since airflow is reduced. The seedlings will also have more competition between themselves with a higher density, and this will reduce the quality of each seedling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The recommended density for [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pine]] is 50-90 per square meter and [[Pinus taeda|loblolly]] and [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]] at less than 215 seedlings per square meter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Biological ===
The act of releasing native or [[Introduced species|nonnative]] predators of pest species is uncommon in forest integrated pest management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It would not be economically feasible to utilize this method in a forestry scenario. Instead, the forest and its surrounding area is managed in a way to promote natural enemies of pest species. In a study of [[eucalyptus]] [[plantation]]s in [[Brazil]], the closer the plantation is to a "natural" more diverse forest, the more diverse and balanced the insect populations are. This more diverse environment is less likely for produce an outbreak of pest species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bragança|first=Marcos|last2=DeSouza|first2=Og|last3=Zanuncio|first3=JoséCola|title=Environmental heterogeneity as a strategy for pest management in Eucalyptus plantations|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378112797001151|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|language=en|volume=102|issue=1|pages=9–12|doi=10.1016/s0378-1127(97)00115-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] (Bt) is a bacterium that is used to kill [[larva]]e of many pest species. This can be applied aerially or on the ground over large surfaces.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laranjeiro|first=Alberto Jorge|title=Integrated pest management at Aracruz celulose|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378112794902569|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|language=en|volume=65|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(94)90256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bt is safe for humans and other wildlife since it only infects certain species of insects.

=== Chemical ===
Integrated pest management was designed after [[Rachel Carson|Rachael Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' as a way to manage for pests without overusing pesticides. Chemicals are still used but in a way that focuses on proper use of [[pesticide]] application so overuse does not occur. The fungicide [[triadimefon]] is applied to loblolly and slash pine seeds to prevent fusiform rust. If the seeds used are not treated for fusiform rust, the stand can lose 1-30% of their trees to the rust. Longleaf pine is naturally resistant to fusiform rust so their seeds are not treated with triadimefon. Southern pine nurseries [[Fumigation|fumigate]] the soil every four years and hardwood nurseries fumigate yearly. Fumigation promotes growth of beneficial fungus [[Trichoderma]] and less of the harmful [[Pythium|Phythium]] fungus. In forest integrated pest management, [[Insecticide|insecticides]] are not applied until an infestation is observed. [[Herbicide|Herbicides]] are used to control weeds in nurseries. Low rates and frequent application intervals of herbicide is what is recommended.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Eucalyptus Plantations in Brazil ==
Eucalyptus plantations provide a unique management challenge since they are commonly grown out of their native range and also in [[Monoculture|monocultures]] of [[Clones (plant)|clones]]. Large [[homogeneous]] areas of one species of tree are more susceptible of pest attacks. This is due to an abundant and predictable amount of food for the pest, and an absence of their natural enemies. There are less predator species in monocultures because the plants they need to forage, rest and lay eggs on are not there. This combination is why monoculture environments favor certain species and amplify their numbers to pest levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The biggest pest concern with eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are [[Leafcutter ant|leaf-cutting ants]] and [[Lepidoptera|Lepidopteran]] (moth and butterfly) defoliators. Leaf-cutting ants contribute the most amount of damage to these plantations. The insecticide [[Methyl Bromide|methyl bromide]] is needed to fight leaf-cutting ants, with application done within a month of planting. Periodic applications during the rest of the rotation may be necessary. Monitoring leaf-cutting ant activity is crucial in eucalyptus plantations. Keeping a vegetative [[understory]] can also lower leaf-cutting ant numbers. Lepidoptera larva can be controlled with Bt application. Using a tractor is a more efficient than aerially applying Bt since the canopy is so closed and the Bt needs to reach the ground where the larva are. Traps are used to monitor larva levels to help better manage for them.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Indium(III) sulfide''' (Indium sesquisulfide, Indium sulfide (2:3), Indium (3+) sulfide) is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] [[Indium|In]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

It has a "rotten egg" odor characteristic of sulfur compounds, and produces hydrogen sulfide gas when reacted with mineral acids.&lt;ref&gt;Indium Sulfide. indium.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Three different structures ("[[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s") are known: yellow, α-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a defect cubic structure, red β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a defect [[spinel]], tetragonal, structure, and γ-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a layered structure. The red, β, form is considered to be the most stable form at room temperature, although the yellow form may be present depending on the method of production.  In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is attacked by acids and by sulfide. It is slightly soluble in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name="indium"&gt;[http://www.indium.com/products/indiumcompounds.php#indiumsulfide Indium Sulfide]. indium.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Indium sulfide was the first indium compound ever described, being reported in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Reich, F.  |author2=Richter, Th. |title=Vorläufige Notiz über ein neues Metal |language=German |journal=[[J. Prakt. Chem.]] |volume=89 |pages=441–448| year=1863| doi=10.1002/prac.18630890156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reich and Richter determined the existence of indium as a new element from the sulfide precipitate.

==Structure and properties==
In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; features tetrahedral In(III) centers linked to four sulfido ligands.

α-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a defect cubic structure.  The polymorph undergoes a [[phase transition]] at 420&amp;nbsp;°C and converts to the spinel structure of β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Another phase transition at 740&amp;nbsp;°C produces the layered γ-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polymorph.&lt;ref&gt;Bahadur, D. ''Inorganic Materials: Recent Advances. '' Alpha Sciences International, Ltd., 2004.  106&lt;/ref&gt;

β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a defect spinel structure.  The sulfide anions are closely packed in layers, with octahedrally-coordinated In(III) cations present within the layers, and tetrahedrally-coordinated In(III) cations between them.  A portion of the tetrahedral interstices are vacant, which leads to the defects in the spinel.&lt;ref&gt;Steigmann, G.A.; Sutherland, H.H.; Goodyear, J. (1965).  “The Crystal Structure of -In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; “.  ''[[Acta Crystallogr.]]'', '''19''':  967-971.&lt;/ref&gt;

β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has two subtypes.  In the T-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; subtype, the tetragonally-coordinated vacancies are in an ordered arrangement, whereas the vacancies in C-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are disordered.  The disordered subtype of β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows activity for [[Photocatalytic water splitting|photocatalytic]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production with a noble metal cocatalyst, but the ordered subtype does not.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chai, B.; Peng, T.; Zeng, P.; Mao, J.  (2011.)  “Synthesis of Floriated In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Decorated With TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Under Visible Light.”  ''[[J. Mater. Chem.]]'', '''21''': 14587. {{doi|10.1039/c1jm11566a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[N-type semiconductor]] with an optical [[band gap]] of 2.1&amp;nbsp;eV. It has been proposed to replace the hazardous [[cadmium sulfide]], CdS, as a buffer layer in solar cells,&lt;ref&gt;Barreau, N.; Marsillac, S.; Albertini, D.; Bernede, J.C. (2002). "Structural, optical and electrical properties of β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3-3''x''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3''x''&lt;/sub&gt; thin films obtained by PVD". ''[[Thin Solid Films]]''. '''403''': 331–334.&lt;/ref&gt; and as an additional semiconductor to increase the performance of [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-based [[photovoltaics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The unstable γ-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polymorph has a layered structure.

==Production==
Indium sulfide is usually prepared by direct combination of the elements.

Production from volatile complexes of indium and sulfur, for example [[dithiocarbamate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (e.g. Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CNEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), has been explored for [[Chemical vapor deposition|vapor deposition]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Haggata, S. W.; Malik, M. Azad; Motevalli, M.; O'Brien, P.; Knowles, J. C. (1995). "Synthesis and Characterization of Some Mixed Alkyl Thiocarbamates of Gallium and Indium, Precursors for III/VI Materials: The X-ray Single-Crystal Structures of Dimethyl- and Diethylindium Diethyldithiocarbamate". ''[[Chem. Mater.]]'' '''7''' (4): 716–724. {{doi|10.1021/cm00052a017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin films of the beta complex can be grown by [[chemical spray pyrolysis]].  Solutions of In(III) salts and organic sulfur compounds (often [[thiourea]]) are sprayed onto preheated glass plates, where the chemicals react to form thin films of indium sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, K.; Katarski, A.; Mere, O.; Volobujeva, M. (2009).  “Spray Pyrolysis Deposition of Indium Sulphide Thin Films.”  ''[[Thin Solid Films]]'', '''519'''(10): 3055-3060.  {{doi|10.1016/j.tsf.2010.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changing the temperature at which the chemicals are deposited and the In:S ratio can affect the optical [[Band gap reference|band gap]] of the film.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Calixto-Rodriguez, M.; Tiburcio-Silver, A.; Ortiz, A.; Sanchez-Juarez, A.  (2004.)  “Optoelectronical Properties of Indium Sulfide Thin Films Prepared by Spray Pyrolysis for Photovoltaic Applications.”  ''[[Thin Solid Films]]'', '''480''':  133-137.  {{doi|10.1016/j/tsf.2004.11.046}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Single-walled indium sulfide [[nanotube]]s can be formed in the laboratory, by the use of two solvents (one in which the compound dissolves poorly and one in which it dissolves well).  There is partial replacement of the sulfido ligands with O&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the compound forms thin nanocoils, which [[Self-assembly of nanoparticles|self-assemble]] into arrays of nanotubes with diameters on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;nm, and walls approximately 0.6&amp;nbsp;nm thick. The process mimics [[protein crystallization]].&lt;ref name = Ni /&gt;

== Safety ==
The β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polymorph, in powdered form, can irritate eyes, skin and respiratory organs.  It is toxic if swallowed, but can be handled safely under conventional laboratory conditions.  It should be handled with gloves, and care should be taken to keep from inhaling the compound, and to keep it from contact with the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Sigma-Aldrich.

There is considerable interest in using In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to replace the semiconductor CdS (cadmium sulfide) in photoelectronic devices.  β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a tunable band gap, which makes it attractive for photovoltaic applications,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and it shows promise when used in conjunction with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in solar panels, indicating that it could replace CdS in that application as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cadmium sulfide is toxic and must be deposited with a [[Chemical bath deposition|chemical bath]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Karthikeyan, S.; Hill, A.E.; Pilkington, R.D. (2016).  “Low Temperature Pulsed Direct Current Magnetron Sputtering Technique for Single Phase -In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Buffer Layers for Solar Cell Applications.” ''[[Applied Surface Science|Appl. Surf. Sci.]]'' '''418''': 199-206. {{doi|10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.01.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but indium(III) sulfide shows few adverse biological effects and can be deposited as a thin film through less hazardous methods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Thin films β-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be grown with varying band gaps, which make them widely applicable as photovoltaic semiconductors, especially in [[Heterojunction|heterojunction solar cells]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plates coated with beta-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles can be used efficiently for PEC (photoelectrochemical) water splitting.&lt;ref&gt;Tian, Y.; Wang, L.; Tang, H.; Zhou, W. (2015). “Ultrathin Two-Dimensional -In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Nanocrystals:  Oriented-AttachmentGrowth Controlled By Metal Ions and Photoelectrochemical Properties.”  ''[[J. Mater. Chem. A]]'', '''3''': 11294, {{doi|10.1039/c5ta01958c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biomedical ===
A preparation of indium sulfide made with the radioactive &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;In can be used as a lung scanning agent for [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;Csetenyi, J.; Szamel, S.I.; Fyzy, M.; Karika, Z. (1974).  “Albumin Macroaggregates Containing &lt;sup&gt;113''m''&lt;/sup&gt;In-sulfide (&lt;sup&gt;113''m''&lt;/sup&gt;In SMAA): Technique for the Preparation of a New Lung Scanning Agent.” ''[[Proc. Int. Symp. Nucl. Med.]]'', '''3''': 293-301.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is taken up well by lung tissues, but does not accumulate there.

=== Other ===
In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles [[Luminescence|luminesce]] in the visible spectrum.  Preparing In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles in the presence of other heavy metal ions creates highly efficient blue, green, and red [[phosphor]]s, which can be used in projectors and instrument displays.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, W.; Bovin, J.; Joly, A.; Wang, S.; Su, F.; Li, G.  (2004). “Full-Color Emission from In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; Nanoparticles.”  ''[[J. Phys. Chem. B]]'', '''108''':  11927-11934. {{doi|10.1021/jp048107m}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2236">The '''Integral Urban House''' was a pioneering 1970s experiment in self-reliant [[urban homesteading]]. The house was located 1516 5th St. in [[Berkeley, California]]. The founders were California State Architect [[Sim Van der Ryn]] and [[Bill Olkowski|Bill]] &amp; [[Helga Olkowski]], authors of the ''City People's Guide to Raising Food'', and the project was run by the Farallones Institute (which Van der Ryn founded).

The [[Sierra Club]] published a book about the experiment in 1979. Elements of the home included a vegetable garden, chickens, rabbits, a fish pond, beehives, a [[composting toilet]], solar power and more.&lt;ref name="Olkowski Olkowski Javits Farallones Institute"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olkowski |first=Helga |last2=Olkowski |first2=William |last3=Javits |first3=Tom |author4=Farallones Institute |title=The integral urban house : self-reliant living in the city |publisher=Sierra Club Books |year=1979 |oclc=644281567 |url=https://archive.org/details/integralurbanhou00fara |access-date=2018-08-27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">'''Ketchikan Pulp Company''' was a [[pulp mill]] located on the north shore of [[Ward Cove]], {{convert|5|miles}} from [[Ketchikan]], in the [[U.S. state]] of Alaska. Owned by [[Louisiana-Pacific]], it operated between 1954 and 1997.&lt;ref name=dec.alaska.gov2004&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketchikan Pulp Corporation Mill Site|url=http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/csp/sites/kpc.htm|publisher=Division Address Department of Environmental Conservation|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last pulp mill to operate in the state.&lt;ref name=NYT1997&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Pulp Mill in Alaska Closes, And Ketchikan Braces for Impact|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/25/us/last-pulp-mill-in-alaska-closes-and-ketchikan-braces-for-impact.html|accessdate=1 June 2014|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the  [[Sitka pulp mill]], the mill was built as part of a [[U.S. Forest Service]] economic development program for Southeast Alaska. Feedstock for the mill was harvested from the [[Tongass National Forest]] under guaranteed 50-year supply contracts that enabled the private companies to commit the large development investments in an area with only one log supplier (the USFS). This became controversial in the late 1980s, due to environmental concerns with the scale of [[old-growth forest]] harvesting and uninformed criticism of the alleged multimillion-dollar subsidies. In 1990, the [[Tongass Timber Reform Act]] directed the agency to terminate the long-term timber contracts, and both mills closed shortly thereafter. The last bale of pulp paper to come off the mill is on display at the [[Southeast Alaska Discovery Center]] in Ketchikan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13339">{{short description|A list of rock types recognized by petrologists}}
The following is a list of [[rock (geology)|rock]] types recognized by [[geologist]]s. There is no agreed number of specific types of rocks. Any unique combination of chemical composition, mineralogy, grain size, texture, or other distinguishing characteristics can describe rock types. Additionally, different classification systems exist for each major type of rock.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} There are three major types of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. They are all identified by their texture, streak, and location, among other factors.

==Igneous==

[[File:Ecozone Neotropic.svg|thumb|500 px|The Neotropical realm]]

The '''Neotropical realm''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s constituting the Earth's land surface. Physically, it includes the [[tropics|tropical]] [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s of the [[Americas]] and the entire [[South America]]n [[temperate]] zone.

==Definition== 
In [[biogeography]], the Neotropic or Neotropical realm is one of the eight [[terrestrial realm]]s. This realm includes [[South America|South]] and the [[North America|North American]] regions of [[Central America]]; in [[Mexico]], the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] and southern lowlands, and most of the east and west coastlines, including the southern tip of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]; the [[Caribbean islands]], [[southern Florida]], and the coastal portion of the [[Río Grande Valley]] in [[South Texas]], because these regions share a large number of plant and animal groups.

The realm also includes temperate southern South America. In contrast, the '''Neotropical [[Phytochorion|Floristic Kingdom]]''' excludes southernmost South America, which instead is placed in the [[Antarctic Floristic Kingdom|Antarctic kingdom]].

The Neotropic is delimited by similarities in [[fauna]] or [[flora]]. Its fauna and flora are distinct from the [[Nearctic]] (which includes most of North America) because of the long separation of the two continents. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] joined the two continents two to three million years ago, precipitating the [[Great American Interchange]], an important [[biogeography|biogeographical]] event.

The Neotropic includes more [[tropical rainforest]] ([[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]]) than any other realm, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast [[Amazon Rainforest]]. These rainforest ecoregions are one of the most important reserves of [[biodiversity]] on Earth. These rainforests are also home to a diverse array of [[indigenous peoples]], who to varying degrees persist in their autonomous and traditional [[culture]]s and [[list of subsistence techniques|subsistence]] within this environment. The number of these peoples who are as yet relatively untouched by external influences continues to decline significantly, however, along with the near-exponential expansion of [[urbanization]], [[highway|roads]], [[pastoralism]] and [[forest industry|forest industries]] which encroach on their customary lands and environment. Nevertheless, amidst these declining circumstances this vast "reservoir" of human diversity continues to survive, albeit much depleted. In South America alone, some 350–400 [[indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages and dialects]] are still living (down from an estimated 1,500 at the time of [[European colonization of the Americas|first European contact]]), in about 37 distinct [[Language family|language families]] and a further number of [[unclassified languages|unclassified]] and [[language isolate|isolate languages]]. Many of these languages and their cultures are also endangered. Accordingly, [[conservation ethic|conservation]] in the Neotropical realm is a hot political concern, and raises many arguments about development versus indigenous versus ecological rights and access to or ownership of [[natural resources]].

== Major ecological regions ==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] subdivides the realm into ''[[bioregion]]s'', defined as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)."

[[Laurel forest]] and other [[cloud forest]] are subtropical and mild temperate [[forest]], found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures. [[Tropical rainforest]], [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] are highlight{{clarify|date=March 2013}} in Southern North America, Amazonia, Caribbean, Central America, Northern Andes and Central Andes.

=== Amazonia ===
The [[Amazonia bioregion]] is mostly covered by [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]], including the vast [[Amazon rainforest]], which stretches from the Andes mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and the lowland forests of the [[The Guyanas|Guianas]]. The bioregion also includes [[tropical savanna]] and [[tropical dry forest]] ecoregions.

=== Caribbean ===
{{main article|Caribbean bioregion}}

===Central America===
{{main article|Central America bioregion}}

=== Central Andes ===
{{Empty section|date=April 2012}}

===Eastern South America===
Eastern South America includes the [[Caatinga]] [[deserts and xeric shrublands|xeric shrublands]] of northeastern Brazil, the broad [[Cerrado]] grasslands and savannas of the [[Brazilian Plateau]], and the [[Pantanal]] and [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] grasslands. The diverse [[Atlantic forests]] of eastern Brazil are separated from the forests of Amazonia by the Caatinga and Cerrado, and are home to a distinct flora and fauna.

=== Northern Andes ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Orinoco===
The Orinoco is a region of humid forested broadleaf forest and wetland primarily comprising the drainage basin for the [[Orinoco]] River and other adjacent lowland forested areas. This region includes most of Venezuela and parts of Colombia.

=== Southern South America ===
The temperate forest ecoregions of southwestern South America, including the [[temperate rain forest]]s of the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions, and the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] and [[Desventuradas Islands]], are a refuge for the ancient [[Antarctic flora]], which includes trees like the [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]], the [[Fitzroya|alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), and [[Araucaria]] pines like the monkey-puzzle tree (''Araucaria araucana''). These magnificent rainforests are endangered by extensive logging and their replacement by fast-growing non-native pines and [[eucalyptus]].

== History ==
South America was originally part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which included Africa, Australia, India, New Zealand, and Antarctica, and the Neotropic shares many plant and animal lineages with these other continents, including [[marsupial]] mammals and the [[Antarctic flora]].

After the final breakup of the Gondwana about 110 million years ago, South America was separated from Africa and drifted north and west. Much later, about two to three million years ago, South America was joined with North America by the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], which allowed a biotic exchange between the two continents, the [[Great American Interchange]]. South American species like the ancestors of the [[Virginia opossum]] (''Didelphis virginiana'') and the [[armadillo]] moved into North America, and North Americans like the ancestors of South America's [[camelid]]s, including the [[llama]] (''Lama glama''), moved south. The long-term effect of the exchange was the extinction of many South American species, mostly by outcompetition by northern species.

== Endemic animals and plants ==

=== Animals ===
There are 31 bird families that are endemic to the Neotropical realm, over twice the number of any other realm. They include [[tanager]]s, [[rhea (bird)|rheas]], [[tinamou]]s, [[curassow]]s, [[antbird]]s, [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbirds]], and [[toucan]]s. Bird families originally unique to the Neotropics include [[hummingbird]]s (family Trochilidae) and [[wren]]s (family Troglodytidae).

[[Mammal]] groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:
* Order ''[[Xenarthra]]'': [[anteater]]s, [[sloth]]s, and [[armadillo]]s
* [[New World monkey]]s
* [[Caviomorpha]] [[rodent]]s, including [[capybara]]s and [[guinea pig]]s, and [[chinchilla]]s
* American opossums (order ''[[Didelphimorphia]]'') and shrew opossums (order ''[[Paucituberculata]]'')

There are 63 [[fish]] families and subfamilies are endemic to the Neotropical realm, more than any other realm (van der Sleen and Albert, 2018 [van der Sleen, Peter, and James S. Albert, eds. Field Guide to the Fishes of the Amazon, Orinoco, and Guianas. Princeton University Press, 2017]). [[Neotropical fishes]] include more than 5,700 species, and represent at least 66 distinct lineages in continental freshwaters (Albert and Reis, 2011). The well-known [[red-bellied piranha]] is endemic to the Neotropic realm, occupying a larger geographic area than any other piranha species. Some [[fish]] groups originally unique to the Neotropics include:

* Order [[Gymnotiformes]]: Neotropical electric fishes
* Family [[Characidae]]: tetras and allies
* Family [[Loricariidae]]: armoured catfishes
* Subfamily [[Cichlinae]]: Neotropical cichlids
* Subfamily [[Poeciliinae]]: guppies and relatives

Examples of other animal groups that are entirely or mainly restricted to the Neotropical region include:

* [[Caiman]]s

'''Nord Pool AS''' runs the largest market for electrical energy in Europe, measured in volume traded (TWh) and in market share.  It operates in [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Germany]] and [[the UK]] and is a Nominated Electricity Market Operator (NEMO) in 15 European countries, while also servicing power markets in Croatia and Bulgaria. More than 80% of the total consumption of electrical energy in the [[Nordic and Baltic energy market|Nordic market]] is traded through Nord Pool.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nordpoolspot.com/About-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Nord Pool AS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the world's first multinational exchange for trading [[electric power]].

Nord Pool offers both day-ahead and intraday markets.

==History==
Nord Pool traces its origin to ''{{lang|no|Foreningen Samkjøringen}}'', a [[Electricity market|power exchange]] formed by [[Eastern Norway|eastern Norwegian]] electricity companies in 1932 on the initiative of [[Augustin Paus]], and which soon encompassed all the electricity companies of eastern Norway. In 1971 the exchange merged with the regional exchanges in other parts of Norway, and became ''{{lang|no|Samkjøringen av kraftverkene i Norge}}'', with 118 power companies as members as of 1988.

Nord Pool Spot AS was established in 2002, when the derivatives and energy markets were separated from Nord Pool ASA (now [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]]). All Nord Pool's physical energy market activities were transferred into Nord Pool Spot AS. In 2005, Nord Pool Spot expanded its activities to [[Germany]] by opening the [[KONTEK]] bidding area. 

On 12 January 2010, Nord Pool Spot in cooperation with NASDAQ OMX Commodities launched the N2EX power market in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=reuters120110&gt;

An '''ohmic plasma''' is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that is maintained and/or replenished by the heat produced when a plasma current flows through its resistance as in the induced poloidal magnetic field of a tokamak. Efficiency decreases as the plasma temperature increases. The mechanism is similar to the heat created with an electric current flowing through a resistance (ohmic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nunes|first1=I|title=Plasma Confinement at JET|journal=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion|date=2015|volume=58.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plutonium-242''' is one of the [[isotopes of plutonium]], the second longest-lived, with a [[half-life]] of 373,300 years.
&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu's halflife is about 15 times as long as Pu-239's halflife; therefore, it is one-fifteenth as radioactive and not one of the larger contributors to [[nuclear waste]] radioactivity.
&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu's [[gamma ray]] emissions are also weaker than those of the other isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmsym.org/archives/2001/21B/21B-18.pdf|format=PDF|title=PLUTONIUM ISOTOPIC RESULTS OF KNOWN SAMPLES USING THE SNAP GAMMA SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS CODE AND THE ROBWIN SPECTRUM FITTING ROUTINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not [[fissile]] (though it is [[fissionable]] by [[fast neutron]]s) and its [[neutron capture]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] is also low.

==In the nuclear fuel cycle==

[[Image:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|400px|Transmutation flow in LWR]]
Plutonium-242 is produced by successive [[neutron capture]] on [[Pu-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]], [[Pu-240|&lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]], and [[Pu-241|&lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]]. The odd-mass isotopes &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Pu have about a 3/4 chance of undergoing [[Nuclear fission|fission]] on capture of a [[thermal neutron]] and about a 1/4 chance of retaining the [[neutron]] and becoming the following isotope. The proportion of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu is low at low [[burnup]] but increases nonlinearly.

Plutonium-242 has a particularly low [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[thermal neutron]] capture; and it takes four neutron absorptions to become another [[fissile]] isotope (either [[curium]]-245 or plutonium-241) and undergo [[nuclear fission|fission]]. Even then, there is a chance either of those two fissile isotopes will fail to fission but instead absorb the fourth neutron, becoming curium-246 (on the way to even heavier [[actinide]]s like [[californium]], which is a neutron emitter by spontaneous fission and difficult to handle) or becoming &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu again; so the mean number of neutrons absorbed before fission is even higher than 4. Therefore, Pu-242 is particularly unsuited to recycling in a [[thermal reactor]] and would be better used in a [[fast reactor]] where it can be fissioned directly. However, &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Pu's low cross section means that relatively little of it will be transmuted during one cycle in a thermal reactor.

==Decay==
Plutonium-242 primarily decays into [[uranium-238]] via [[alpha decay]], before continuing along the [[Uranium series]]. Plutonium-242 will occasionally decay via [[spontaneous fission]] with a rate of 5.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817205239/http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/nucleardata/toi/pdf/chart.pdf Chart of all nuclei which includes half life and mode of decay]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19894">'''Stabilizers''' are a class of chemical [[Plastic#Additives|additives]] commonly added to polymeric materials, such as [[plastic]]s, to inhibit or retard their degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zweifel|first1=Hans|last2=Maier|first2=Ralph D.|last3=Schiller|first3=Michael|title=Plastics additives handbook|date=2009|publisher=Hanser|location=Munich|isbn=978-3-446-40801-2|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers can be subject to various [[Polymer degradation|degradation processes]], including [[oxidation]], UV-damage, [[thermal degradation]], [[ozonolysis]], or combinations thereof like [[photo-oxidation of polymers|photo-oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singh |first1=Baljit |last2=Sharma |first2=Nisha |title=Mechanistic implications of plastic degradation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=March 2008 |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=561–584 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2007.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes all degrade the polymer on a chemical level, leading to [[chain scission]] that can adversely affect its mechanical properties such as strength and [[malleability]], as well as its appearance and colour.

A vast number of chemically distinct polymers exist, with their degradation pathways varying according to their chemical structure, as such an equally wide range of stabilizers exists. The market for antioxidant stabilisers alone was estimated at US$1.69 billion for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plastic antioxidants market projected to reach US$2.11 billion by 2022 |journal=Additives for Polymers |date=February 2018 |volume=2018 |issue=2 |pages=10 |doi=10.1016/S0306-3747(18)30046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Stabilizers for polymers are used directly or by combinations to prevent the various effects such as [[oxidation]], chain [[Bond cleavage|scission]] and uncontrolled recombinations and [[cross-link]]ing reactions that are caused by [[photo-oxidation of polymers]]. [[Polymer]]s are considered to get [[Weather testing of polymers|weathered]] due to the direct or indirect impact of [[heat]] and [[ultraviolet]] light.  The effectiveness of the [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] against weathering depends on solubility, ability to stabilize in different polymer matrix, the distribution in matrix, evaporation loss during processing and use. The effect on the [[viscosity]] is also an important concern for processing.

Heat stabilizers are mainly used for construction products made of [[polyvinyl chloride]], for instance window profiles, pipes and cable ducts. Light stabilizers, for instance HALS, are especially needed for [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The environmental impact of stabilizers for polymers can be problematic because of heavy metal content. In Europe lead stabilizers are increasingly replaced by other types, for example calcium-zinc stabilizers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/stabilizers/ Market Study: Stabilizers by Ceresana Research, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antioxidants ==
Antioxidants inhibit [[autoxidation]] that occurs when polymers reacts with atmospheric oxygen. For some compounds this can happen gradually at room temperature but almost all polymers are at risk of thermal-oxidation when they are processed at high temperatures. The molding or casting of plastics (e.g. [[injection molding]]) require them to be above their melting point or [[glass transition temperature]] (~200-300&amp;nbsp;°C) and under these conditions reactions with oxygen occur much more rapidly. Once initiated, autoxidation proceeds via a free radical chain reaction which can be [[Autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. As such, even though efforts are usually made to reduce oxygen levels, total exclusion is often not achievable and even exceedingly low concentrations of oxygen can be sufficient to initiate degradation. Sensitivity to oxidation varies significantly depending on the polymer in question; without stabilizers [[polypropylene]] and unsaturated polymers such as [[rubber]] will slowly degrade at room temperature where as [[polystyrene]] can be stable even at high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geuskens|first1=G.|last2=Bastin|first2=P.|last3=Lu Vinh|first3=Q.|last4=Rens|first4=M.|title=Photo-oxidation of polymers: Part IV—Influence of the processing conditions on the photo-oxidative stability of polystyrene|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|date=July 1981|volume=3|issue=4|pages=295–306|doi=10.1016/0141-3910(81)90025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidants are of great importance during the process stage, with long-term stability at ambient temperature increasingly being supplied by hindered amine light stabiizers (HALs). Antioxidants are often referred to as being primary or secondary depending on their mechanism of action.

===Primary antioxidants (radical scavengers)===
[[File:PAO-2 100.svg|thumb|right|[[Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]]: A primary antioxidant consisting of sterically hindered phenols with para-[[propionate]] groups.]]

Primary antioxidants act as [[radical scavenger]]s and remove peroxy radicals (ROO•), as well as to a lesser extent alkoxy radicals (RO•), [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO•) and alkyl radials (R•). Oxidation begins with the formation of alkyl radials, which react very rapidly with molecular oxygen (rate constants ≈ {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} to give peroxy radicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingold|first1=Keith U.|title=Peroxy radicals|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=May 2002|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1021/ar50013a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; these in turn [[Hydrogen atom abstraction|abstract hydrogen]] from a fresh section of polymer in a [[chain propagation]] step to give new alkyl radials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lucarini |first1=Marco |last2=Pedulli |first2=Gian Franco |title=Free radical intermediates in the inhibition of the autoxidation reaction |journal=Chemical Society Reviews |date=2010 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=2106 |doi=10.1039/B901838G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall process is exceedingly complex and will vary between polymers but the first few steps are shown below in general:

:R → R•
:R• + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ROO•
:ROO• +  RH  →  ROOH  +  R•

Due to its rapid reaction with oxygen the scavenging of the initial alkyl radical (R•) is exceedingly difficult and can only be achieved using specialised antioxidants baring reactive groups, such as [[acryloyl group|acryloyls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yachigo |first1=Shin'ichi |last2=Sasaki |first2=Manji |last3=Ida |first3=Kanako |last4=Inoue |first4=Kikumitsu |last5=Tanaka |first5=Shin'ya |last6=Yoshiaki |first6=Honda |last7=Emiko |first7=Fukuyo |last8=Kazunori |first8=Yanagi |title=Studies on polymer stabilizers: Part VI—Relationship between performance and molecular conformation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 1993 |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=329–343 |doi=10.1016/0141-3910(93)90009-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of primary antioxidants react instead with the longer lasting peroxy radicals (ROO•). Hydrogen abstraction is usually the [[rate determining step]] in the polymer degradation and the peroxy radicals can be scavenged by hydrogen donation from an alternative source, which converts them into organic [[hydroperoxides]] (ROOH). The most important commercial stabilzers for this are hindered phenols such as [[Butylated hydroxytoluene|BHT]] or [[Irganox 1098|analogues thereof]] and secondary aromatic amines such as alkylated-[[diphenylamine]]. Amines are typically more effective, but tend to cause discoloration, which is often undesirable (i.e., in food packaging, clothing). The overall reaction with phenols is shown below:

:ROO• + ArOH  → ROOH + ArO•    
:ArO•  →  nonradical products

The end products of these reactions are typically [[quinone]]s, which may also impart unwanted colour. Modern phenolic antioxidants often have a propionate-group at the para position of the phenol (i.e. they are ortho-alkylated analogues of [[phloretic acid]]) as the quinones of these can
rearrange once to give a [[hydroxycinnamate]], regenerating the phenolic antioxidant group and allowing further radicals to be scavenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gijsman |first1=Pieter |title=Handbook of Environmental Degradation of Materials |date=2018 |publisher=William Andrew Publishing |isbn=9780323524728 |page=375 |edition= Third |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323524728000186 |chapter=Chapter 18 - Polymer Stabilization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately however, primary antioxidants are sacrificial and once they are fully consumed the polymer will being to degrade.

===Secondary antioxidants (hydroperoxides scavengers)===
[[File:BigPhosphite31570-04-4.png |thumb|right|[[Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite]], a [[Phosphite ester|phosphite]] widely used as a secondary antioxidant in polymers.]]

Secondary antioxidants act to remove [[organic hydroperoxide]]s (ROOH) formed by the action of primary antioxidants. Hydroperoxides are less reactive than radical species but can undergo [[Homolysis (chemistry)|hemolytic]] bond breaking to form new radicals. As they are less chemically active they require a more reactive antioxidant. The most commonly employed class are [[phosphite]] esters, often of hindered phenols e.g. [[Tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite]]. These will convert polymer hydroperoxides to alcohols, becoming oxidized to [[organophosphate]]s in the process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwetlick|first1=K.|title=Mechanisms of antioxidant action of organic phosphorus compounds|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1983|volume=55|issue=10|doi=10.1351/pac198355101629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwetlick|first1=K.|last2=König|first2=T.|last3=Rüger|first3=C.|last4=Pionteck|first4=J.|last5=Habicher|first5=W.D.|title=Chain-breaking antioxidant activity of phosphite esters|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|date=January 1986|volume=15|issue=2|pages=97–108|doi=10.1016/0141-3910(86)90065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:ROOH  +  P(OR')&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →   OP(OR')&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  ROH

Transesterification can then take place, in which the hydroxylated polymer is exchanged for a phenol:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwetlick|first1=Klaus|last2=Habicher|first2=Wolf D.|title=Organophosphorus antioxidants action mechanisms and new trends|journal=Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie|date=October 1995|volume=232|issue=1|pages=239–246|doi=10.1002/apmc.1995.052320115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:ROH + OP(OR')&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  →   R'OH + OP(OR')&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OR

This exchange further stabilizes the polymer by releasing a primary antioxidant, because of this phosphites are sometimes considered multi-functional antioxidants as they can combine both types of activity.
[[Organosulfur compounds]] are also efficient [[hydroperoxide]] decomposers, with [[thioether]]s being particularly effective against long-term thermal aging, they are ultimately oxidise up to [[sulfoxide]]s and [[sulfone]]s.&lt;ref name="Kröhnke2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kröhnke|first1=C.|title=Polymer Stabilization|journal=Materials Science and Materials Engineering|year=2016|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128035818014879 |isbn=9780128035818|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-803581-8.01487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiozonant ===

{{main|Antiozonant}}

Antiozonants prevent or slow down the degradation of material caused by [[ozone]]. This is naturally present in the air at very low concentrations but is exceedingly reactive, particularly towards unsaturated polymers such as rubber, where it causes [[ozone cracking]]. The mechanism of [[ozonolysis]] is different from other forms of oxidation and hence requires its own class of antioxidant stabilizers.
These are primarily based on [[p-phenylenediamine]] and work by reacting with [[ozone]] faster than it can react with vulnerable functional groups in the polymer (typically [[alkene]] groups). They achieve this by having a low [[ionization energy]] which allows them to react with ozone via electron transfer, this converts them into radical cations that are stabilized by [[aromaticity]]. Such species remain reactive and will react further, giving products such as [[1,4-benzoquinone]], phenylenediamine-dimers and [[nitroxyl]] radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cataldo |first1=Franco |last2=Faucette |first2=Brad |last3=Huang |first3=Semone |last4=Ebenezer |first4=Warren |title=On the early reaction stages of ozone with N,N′-substituted p-phenylenediamines (6PPD, 77PD) and N,N′,N"-substituted-1,3,5-triazine "Durazone®": An electron spin resonance (ESR) and electronic absorption spectroscopy study |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2015 |volume=111 |pages=223–231 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2014.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reaction&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cataldo |first1=Franco |title=Early stages of p-phenylenediamine antiozonants reaction with ozone: Radical cation and nitroxyl radical formation |journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability |date=January 2018 |volume=147 |pages=132–141 |doi=10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.11.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these products can then be scavenged by antioxidants.

==Light stabilizers==
[[File:Bisoctrizole.svg|thumb|right|[[Bisoctrizole]]: A [[benzotriazole]]-phenol based UV absorber]]

Light stabilizer are used to inhibit polymer [[photo-oxidation of polymers|photo-oxidation]], which is the combined result of the action of light and oxygen. Like [[autoxidation]] this is a free radical process, hence the antioxidants described above are effective inhibiting agents, however additional classes of additives are also beneficial, such as UV absorbers, quenchers of excited states and HALS.

=== UV absorbers ===
{{main|UV stabilizers in plastics}}
The [[UV]] absorbers dissipate the absorbed light energy from UV rays as heat by reversible intramolecular proton transfer. This reduces the absorption of UV rays by the polymer matrix and hence reduces the rate of weathering. Typical UV-absorbers are oxanilides for [[polyamide]]s, [[benzophenone]]s for [[PVC]], [[benzotriazole]]s and hydroxyphenyltriazines for [[polycarbonate]].

Strongly light-absorbing [[Poly(p-phenylene sulfide)|PPS]] is difficult to stabilize. Even antioxidants fail in this electron-rich polymer. The acids or bases in the PPS matrix can disrupt the performance of the conventional UV absorbers such as HPBT. PTHPBT, which is a modification of HPBT are shown to be effective, even in these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Das|first1=P.K.|last2=DesLauriers|first2=P.J.|last3=Fahey|first3=Darryl R.|last4=Wood|first4=F.K.|last5=Cornforth|first5=F.J.|title=Photostabilization of poly (p-phenylene sulfide)|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|date=January 1995|volume=48|issue=1|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/0141-3910(95)00032-H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quenchers===
[[File:UV-1084 100.svg|thumb|right|A nickle-phenoxide quencher. CAS No 014516-71-3]]

Photo-oxidation can begin with the absorption of light by a [[chromophore]] within the polymer (which may be a dye or impurity) causing it to enter an [[excited state]]. This can then react with ambient oxygen, converting it into highly reactive [[singlet oxygen]]. [[Quenching (fluorescence)|Quenchers]] are able to absorb energy from excited molecules via a [[Förster resonance energy transfer|Förster]] mechanism and then dissipate it harmlessly as either heat or lower frequency fluorescent light. Singlet oxygen can be quenched by metal chelates, with nickel phenolates being a common example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zweig|first1=A.|last2=Henderson|first2=W. A.|title=Singlet oxygen and polymer photooxidations. I. Sensitizers, quenchers, and reactants|journal=Journal of Polymer Science: Polymer Chemistry Edition|date=March 1975|volume=13|issue=3|pages=717–736|doi=10.1002/pol.1975.170130314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindered amine light stabilizers ===
{{Main|hindered amine light stabilizers}}
[[File:LMW-HA(L)S-1 100.svg|thumb|Example structure of a HAL]]

The ability of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS or HAS) to scavenge radicals produced by weathering, may be explained by the formation of [[aminoxyl radical]]s through a process known as the Denisov Cycle. The aminoxyl radical (N-O•) combines with free radicals in polymers:

N-O• + R• → N-O-R

Although they are traditionally considered as light stabilizers, they can also stabilize thermal degradation.

Even though HALS are extremely effective in [[polyolefin]]s, [[polyethylene]] and [[polyurethane]], they are ineffective in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC). It is thought that their ability to form nitroxyl radicals is disrupted. HALS act as a base and become neutralized by [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) that is released by photooxidation of PVC. The exception is the recently developed NOR HALS, which is not a strong base and is not deactivated by HCl.&lt;ref&gt;Cappoci, G and Hubbard, M, 2005, A Radically New UV Stabilizer for Flexible PVC Roofing Membranes, JOURNAL OF VINYL &amp; ADDITIVE TECHNOLOGY, 11, pp 91–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Classes==
In addition to the effects of light and oxygen polymers may also be degraded by various other environmental factors

===Acid Scavengers===
Acid scavengers, also referred to as antacids, neutralize acidic impurities, especially those that can act as a source of [[HCl]]. They are important stabilizers in many types of polymer, particularly [[PVC]], as well as those produced using [[Ziegler–Natta catalyst]]s, or that use brominated or chlorinated flame retardants. Common examples include metallic soaps, such as [[calcium stearate]], mineral agents like [[hydrotalcite]] and [[hydrocalumite]], and basic metal oxides such as [[zinc oxide]].

===Heat stabilizers===
{{See also|Thermal degradation of polymers}}
Heat (or thermal) stabilizers are mostly used for [[PVC]], as unstabilized material is particularly prone to thermal degradation.  These agents minimize [[dehydrochlorination|loss of HCl]], a degradation process that starts above 70&amp;nbsp;°C.  Once dehydrochlorination starts, it is [[autocatalytic]].  Many diverse agents have been used including, traditionally, derivatives of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s (lead, cadmium).  Increasingly, metallic soaps (metal "salts" of [[fatty acid]]s) are favored, species such as [[calcium stearate]].&lt;ref name=ullmannPVC&gt;M. W. Allsopp, G. Vianello, "Poly(Vinyl Chloride)" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_717}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Addition levels vary typically from 2% to 4%.
The choice of the best heat stabilizer depends on its cost effectiveness in the end use application, performance specification requirements, processing technology and regulatory approvals.

===Flame retardants===
{{main|Flame retardant}}
Flame retardants are a broad range of compounds added to polymers to improve fire resistance.

===Biocides===
Degradation resulting from microorganisms ([[biodegradation]]) involves its own class of special bio-stabilizers and [[biocide]]s (e.g. [[isothiazolinone]]s).

[[File:Shiva star.jpg|thumb|The [[Shiva Star]] device at [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], USA, which generates [[pulsed power]] for high energy [[fusion power]] experiments.  Each of the 6 radial arms is a pulse forming line delivering a pulse of energy to the center, whose capacitors store a total of 10 MJ of energy and can create microsecond pulses of 120 kV and 6 million amperes.  ]]

A '''pulse forming network''' ('''PFN''') is an [[electric circuit]] that accumulates [[electrical energy]] over a comparatively long time, then releases the stored energy in the form of a relatively [[square wave|square pulse]] of comparatively brief duration for various [[pulsed power]] applications. In a PFN, energy storage components such as [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s or [[transmission line]]s are charged by means of a [[high voltage]] power source, then rapidly discharged into a [[External electric load|load]] via a high voltage [[switch]], such as a [[spark gap]] or hydrogen [[thyratron]].  Repetition rates range from single pulses to about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; per second.   PFNs are used to produce precise nanosecond-length pulses of electricity to power devices such as [[klystron]] or [[magnetron]] tube [[electronic oscillator|oscillators]] in [[radar]] sets, pulsed [[laser]]s, [[particle accelerator]]s, [[flashtube]]s, and high voltage utility test equipment.

Much high energy research equipment is operated in a pulsed mode, both to keep heat dissipation down and because high energy physics often occurs at short time scales, so large PFNs are widely used in high energy research.  They have been used to produce nanosecond length pulses with voltages of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; volts and currents up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; amps, with peak power in the terawatt range, similar to lightning bolts.

== Implementation ==

A PFN consists of a series of high voltage energy storage [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s. These components are interconnected as a "''ladder [[Electrical network|network]]''" that behaves similarly to a length of [[transmission line]]. For this reason, a PFN is sometimes called an "''artificial, or synthetic, transmission line''". Electrical energy is initially stored within the charged capacitors of the PFN by a high voltage DC power supply. When the PFN is discharged the capacitors discharge in sequence, producing an approximately rectangular pulse.  The pulse is conducted to the load through a [[transmission line]].  The PFN must be [[impedance matching|impedance matched]] to the load impedance to prevent the energy reflecting back toward the PFN.

== Transmission line PFNs ==
[[File:Charge line animation.gif|thumb|Simple charged transmission line pulse generator]]

A length of transmission line can be used as a pulse forming network.&lt;ref name="Haddad"&gt;{{cite book

In a simple charged transmission line pulse generator ''(animation, right)'' a length of transmission line such as a [[coaxial cable]] is connected through a switch to a matched load ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; at one end, and at the other end to a DC voltage source ''V'' through a resistor ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; which is large compared to the [[characteristic impedance]] ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the line.&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;  When the power supply is connected it slowly charges up the capacitance of the line through ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;.   When the switch is closed, a voltage equal to ''V''/2 is applied to the load, the charge stored in the line begins to discharge through the load a current of ''V''/2''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;   and a voltage step travels up the line toward the source.&lt;ref name="Mesyats" /&gt;  The source end of the line is approximately an open circuit due to the high ''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt; so the step is reflected uninverted and travels back down the line toward the load.  The result is that a pulse of voltage is applied to the load with a duration equal to 2''D''/''c'' where ''D'' is the length of the line and ''c'' is the propagation velocity of the pulse in the line.&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;    The propagation velocity in typical transmission lines is within 50% of the [[speed of light]].  For example, in most types of [[coaxial cable]] the propagation velocity is approximately 2/3 the speed of light, or 20&amp;nbsp;cm per nanosecond.

High power PFNs generally use specialized transmission lines consisting of pipes filled with oil or deionized water as a dielectric to handle the high power dissipation.&lt;ref name="Mesyats" /&gt;

A disadvantage of simple PFN pulse generators is that because the transmission line must be matched to the load resistance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; to prevent reflections, the voltage stored on the line is divided equally between the load resistance and the [[characteristic impedance]] of the line, so the voltage pulse applied to the load is only one-half the power supply voltage.&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mesyats" /&gt;

=== Blumlein transmission line ===
{{anchor|blumlein}}
[[File:Blumlein transmission line animation.gif|thumb|Blumlein generator has advantage that it can generate a pulse equal to the charging voltage ''V'']]

A transmission line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse equal to the power supply voltage ''V'',  was invented in 1937 by British engineer [[Alan Blumlein]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;II=3&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19470612&amp;CC=GB&amp;NR=589127A&amp;KC=A    UK Patent 589127, ''Improvements in or relating to apparatus for generating electrical impulses''],   Alan Dower Blumlein, filed October 10, 1941, granted June 12, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely used today in PFNs.&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;  In the Blumlein generator ''(animation, right)'', the load is connected in series between two equal length transmission lines, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the righthand line is charged through the impedance of the load).&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;  To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits the line at the power supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load.  Since the characteristic impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the line is made equal to half the load impedance ''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage step is half reflected and half transmitted,&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt; resulting in two symmetrical opposite polarity voltage steps which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of ''V''/2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(−''V''/2) = ''V'' across the load.  The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse.   As in other charge line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2''D''/''c'', where ''D'' is the length of the individual transmission lines.&lt;ref name="Haddad" /&gt;  A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics.

== Uses of PFNs ==
Upon command, a high voltage switch transfers the energy stored within the PFN into the load. When the switch "''fires''" (closes), the network of capacitors and inductors within the PFN creates an approximately [[Square wave|square output pulse]] of short duration and high power. This high power pulse becomes a brief source of high power to the load.

Sometimes a specially designed [[Transformer#Pulse transformers|pulse transformer]] is connected between the PFN and load. This technique improves the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] match between the PFN and the load so as to improve power transfer [[electrical efficiency|efficiency]]. A pulse transformer is typically required when driving higher impedance devices such as klystrons or magnetrons from a PFN. Because the PFN is charged over a relatively long time and then discharged over a very short time, the output pulse may have a peak power of megawatts or even terawatts.

The combination of high voltage source, PFN, HV switch, and pulse transformer (when required) is sometimes called a "''power modulator''" or "''pulser''".

'''Recycled fuel''' is [[fuel]] made of residues as [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] produced by using a primary fuel.

For example, CO2 [[pollution]] in the [[atmosphere]], produced by [[petrol]] burning or other sources, can be extracted to produce fuel through an [[artificial photosynthesis]] based in [[nanotechnology]], which helps to mitigate pollution, [[climate change]] and energy issues.

In [[molecular geometry]], '''square pyramidal geometry''' describes the shape of certain compounds with the formula ML&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; where L is a [[ligand]].  If the ligand atoms were connected, the resulting shape would be that of a pyramid with a square base. The point group symmetry involved is of type C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt;.  The geometry is common for certain main group compounds that have a stereochemically active lone pair, as described by [[VSEPR theory]].

As a [[trigonal bipyramidal]] molecule undergoes [[Berry pseudorotation]], it proceeds via an intermediary stage with the square planar geometry.  Thus even though the geometry is rarely seen as the ground state, it is accessed by a low energy distortion from a trigonal bipyramid.

Pseudorotation also occurs in square pyramidal molecules. Molecules with this geometry, as opposed to trigonal bipyramidal, exhibit heavier vibration. The mechanism used is similar to the Berry mechanism.

==Examples==
Some molecular compounds that adopt square pyramidal geometry are XeOF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Square Pyramidal Molecular Geometry.

[[File:Stabilized soil mixing plant.jpg|400px|thumbnail|Stabilized soil mixing plant]]
A '''stabilized soil mixing plant''' is a combination of kinds of [[machine]]s used for mixing [[Compressed_earth_block|stabilized soil]], which is used for [[highway construction]], municipal road projects, and fertile [[airport]] areas. The [[process manufacturing|plant]] produces stabilized soil with different gradings in a continuous way. Such a plant usually contains a cement [[silo]], measuring and [[conveyor system|conveying system]], and mixing devices.

== Stabilized soil ==
Stabilized soil is a mixture of [[lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], [[coal ash]], [[soil]], [[sand]], and other [[aggregate (composite)|aggregates]].

== Classification ==
Stabilized soil mixing plants are of two kinds: the portable stabilized soil mixing plant and the stationary stabilized soil mixing plant. The portable stabilized soil mixing plant has wheels on each part and can be driven by a trailer, but has low productivity. The stationary plant has larger [[productivity]] but is less flexible, and needs a firm groundwork.

== Operating principle ==
All aggregates like lime, sand, soil, coal ash, and other materials are loaded into [[Batching &amp; mixing plants|batching]] hoppers by a loading machine. After measuring, the belt feeder transports the aggregates into a mixing device. Meanwhile, stabilizing powders like lime or cement are transferred from a powder material [[warehouse]] to the batch hopper by a spiral [[Conveyor system|conveyor]], and then moved to the belt feeder by a powder material feeder. All ingredients then go into the mixing device for final processing. Finally, the feeding belt conveyor takes the final product and delivers it to the storage warehouse.

'''Subcoal''' technology is used to process paper plastic waste fractions into a substitute for [[coal]] or [[lignite]]. The fuel pellets can be used as secondary energy source in industrial furnaces, such as [[lime kiln]]s and [[cement kiln]]s, coal-fired [[power station]]s and [[blast furnace]]s. Subcoal has a caloric value comparable with lignite.&lt;ref name="CE-DELFT"&gt;[https://www.ce.nl/publicatie/climate_analysis_subcoal®/1158 Climate analysis Subcoal®] CE Delft, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was developed by the Dutch chemical company [[DSM (company)|DSM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20141209042232/https://www.np-recycling.nl/en/projects/227-subcoal-technology Subcoal technology] N+P Recycling Group (archived version of 9 Dec 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; A study by CE Delft revealed that for the paper-plastic fraction of household waste, the Subcoal route has a better climate and overall environmental score as compared to the [[incineration]] in a waste incineration plant.&lt;ref name="CE-DELFT" /&gt;

== Production ==
Currently, a lot of waste ends up in [[incineration plant]]s or is dumped to [[landfill]]. Depending on the region, [[waste collection]] systems have advanced to separate collections for [[recycling]], which allows easier production of [[refuse-derived fuel]]. 
The technology consists of a number of different treatment stages, depending on the input waste streams. The waste streams are typically purified, with [[recyclables]] being collected and sorted out of the waste streams. The waste is dried if necessary. The material is shredded to the required size and turned into [[wikt:pellets|pellets]], with a [[diameter]] of approximately 8mm. Terms of [[calorific value]], ash content, [[chlorine]] contact and [[moisture content]] are important to rate the quality of the pellets. The calorific value is comparable with (and sometimes higher than) a few types of coal. The percentage of biomass is fairly high as well; it is more than 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20170124134608/http://www.afvalsamenwerkinglimburg.nl/downloads/website/rapportarthurdlittlenascheiden20beoordeling20over20nascheiding.pdf Beoordeling van nascheiding voor afvalverwerking] Arthur D. Little Benelux NV, 7 Dec 2005 (archived version of 24 Jan 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is in pellets, Subcoal shows [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] behaviour and does not dissolve when the moisture content is increased, which is important when considering external storage. Subcoal is mostly dosed as a ground (pulverized) fuel. Subcoal is commercially used via various grinding media (direct firing); via a [[hammer mill]] (12 tonnes per hour), air-rotor mill (6 tonnes per hour) and via a bowl mill (4 tonnes per hour).&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;[https://www.np-recycling.nl/en/ N+P Group]&lt;/ref&gt; Cement manufacturers, lime producers and energy providers spray the Subcoal powder with coal powder into their kilns.&lt;ref name="NP" /&gt;

Currently, there are two Subcoal producing facilities in the Netherlands, with have a combined output capacity of 80 to 90 thousand tonnes per year. One is implemented at a cardboard mill in the southern part of the Netherlands, with an annual output of about 15.000 tonnes. The biggest is a standalone production facility located in the northern part of the Netherlands, with an annual output of about 70.000 tonnes per year.

== Co-grinding with coal ==
Other alternative fuels tend to have greater quality fluctuations due to seasonal influences. Subcoal is [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and can thus be stored outside. This allows Subcoal to be mixed with the primary fuel in uncovered areas e.g. in the external coal storage area. The existing dosing equipment and grinding media can be used to transport the Subcoal into the [[power station]].

== Costs and savings ==
The [[gate fee]] for the waste streams and the costs for [[logistics]] have to be taken into account. Typically, in Europe, the price for Subcoal (CIF) fluctuates between €1 and €2.50 per gigajoule. The fluctuation is dependent on the input prices for the waste streams which are used and the production steps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">{{short description|a water quality parameter}}
'''Total suspended solids (TSS)''' is the [[Dry matter|dry-weight]] of suspended particles, that are not dissolved, in a sample of water that can be trapped by a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] that is analyzed using a filtration apparatus. It is a [[water quality]] parameter used to assess the quality of a specimen of any type of water or water body, ocean water for example, or [[wastewater]] after treatment in a [[wastewater treatment plant]]. It is listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 304(a)(4), {{USCSub|33|1314|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total dissolved solids]] is another parameter acquired through a separate analysis which is also used to determine water quality based on the total substances that are fully dissolved within the water, rather than undissolved suspended particles.

TSS was previously called non-filterable residue ('''NFR'''), but was changed to TSS because of ambiguity in other scientific disciplines.

== Measurement ==
TSS of a water or [[wastewater]] sample is determined by pouring a carefully measured volume of water (typically one [[litre]]; but less if the particulate density is high, or as much as two or three litres for very clean water) through a pre-weighed filter of a specified pore size, then weighing the filter again after the drying process that removes all water on the filter. Filters for TSS measurements are typically composed of [[glass fibre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Joy P. (1994). [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/joysmanual/4tss.html "Measuring Total Suspended Solids and Turbidity in lakes and streams."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730171415/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/joysmanual/4tss.html |date=2010-07-30 }} ''A Citizen's Guide to Understanding and Monitoring Lakes and Streams.'' State of Washington, Department of Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; The gain in weight is a dry weight measure of the particulates present in the water sample expressed in units derived or calculated from the volume of water filtered (typically milligrams per litre or mg/L).

If the water contains an appreciable amount of dissolved substances (as certainly would be the case when measuring TSS in [[seawater]]), these will add to the weight of the filter as it is dried.  Therefore it is necessary to "wash" the filter and sample with [[deionized water]] after filtering the sample and before drying the filter.  Failure to add this step is a fairly common mistake made by inexperienced laboratory technicians working with sea water samples, and will completely invalidate the results as the weight of salts left on the filter during drying can easily exceed that of the suspended particulate matter.

Although [[turbidity]] purports to measure approximately the same water quality property as TSS, the latter is more useful because it provides an actual weight of the particulate material present in the sample. In water quality monitoring situations, a series of more labor-intensive TSS measurements will be paired with relatively quick and easy turbidity measurements to develop a site-specific correlation.  Once satisfactorily established, the correlation can be used to estimate TSS from more frequently made turbidity measurements, saving time and effort. Because turbidity readings are somewhat dependent on particle size, shape, and color, this approach requires calculating a correlation equation for each location.  Further, situations or conditions that tend to suspend larger particles through water motion (e.g., increase in a [[current (stream)|stream current]] or wave action) can produce higher values of TSS not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding increase in turbidity. This is because particles above a certain size (essentially anything larger than silt) are not measured by a bench turbidity meter (they settle out before the reading is taken), but contribute substantially to the TSS value.

== Definition problems ==
Although TSS appears to be a straightforward measure of particulate weight obtained by separating particles from a water sample using a filter, it suffers as a defined quantity from the fact that particles occur in nature in essentially a continuum of sizes. At the lower end, TSS relies on a cut-off established by properties of the filter being used. At the upper end, the cut-off should be the exclusion of all particulates too large to be "[[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]]" in water.  However, this is not a fixed particle size but is dependent upon the energetics of the situation at the time of sampling: moving water suspends larger particles than does still water. Usually it is the case that the additional suspended material caused by the movement of the water is of interest.

These problems in no way invalidate the use of TSS; consistency in method and technique can overcome short-comings in most cases.  But comparisons between studies may require a careful review of the methodologies used to establish that the studies are in fact measuring the same thing.

TSS in mg/L can be calculated as:
: (dry weight of residue and filter - dry weight of filter alone, in grams)/ mL of sample * 1,000,000

The '''Windstar [[vertical-axis wind turbine|vertical-axis]] [[wind turbine|turbine]]''' is a [[Lift (force)|lift]]-type device with straight blades attached at each end to a central rotating shaft. Windstar turbines were invented by Robert Nason Thomas and developed by Wind Harvest International, Inc., formerly the Wind Harvest Company, based in Point Reyes, California. Windstar turbines are operated as Linear Array Vortex Turbine Systems (LAVTS). Each rotor unit has a dual braking system of pneumatic disc brakes and [[blade pitch]]. All Windstar models use off-the-shelf generators, gearboxes, bearings and other components.

==History==
In 2001 and 2002, three guyed prototype versions of the Windstar Model 530G were installed in [[Palm Springs, California]]. The Model 530G prototype used extruded aluminum blades, was supported by a guyed cable system and was rated at 25&amp;nbsp;kW. The three 530G turbines were placed in close proximity, creating the first Linear Array Vortex Turbine System (LAVTS).  The 530G LAVTS was rated at 75 KW and was run continuously for five years to collect performance data.

In 2006, Wind Harvest International began design work on a series of Windstar turbine models to take advantage of the properties demonstrated in the 530G LAVTS prototype: Model 636, 1500 and 3000 turbines. The Model 636 is a direct evolution of the 530G, with an increase in blade length, in order to increase swept area, and including a modified bearing design.  The 1500 and 3000 turbine models stand {{convert|50|ft}} high with a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} rotor and 50-75&amp;nbsp;kW generators. The Windstar 1500 is {{convert|37.5|ft}} wide and is designed for higher wind speed locations. The Windstar 3000 will be {{convert|75|ft}} wide to operate better in lower wind speed locations (14-16&amp;nbsp;mph). Model 636 continues to use extruded aluminum blades, similar to the 530G.  Models 1500 and 3000 use pultruded fiberglass blades.

By 2010, Windstar Model 636 turbines were placed on the transitional list for approved wind energy generation systems qualifying for the FIT (Feed-in-Tariff) energy pricing in the UK.  In 2011, Wind Harvest International, Inc. began the process for MCS certification of the Model 636 LAVTS.

==Linear Array Vortex Turbine Systems==
The Linear Array Vortex Turbine System (LAVTS) consists of three or more Windstar vertical-axis rotors, each with their own 25-75&amp;nbsp;kW generator, placed in a linear array with each rotor's blades passing within two feet of its neighbor.  In this configuration, the center rotors gain an increase in energy output and efficiency.  Observation of this effect (the coupled vortex effect) on Windstar turbines in field tests led to the issuance of US patent 6784566.

==Coupled Vortex Effect==
Windstar turbines are built in arrays of three or more turbines in order to take advantage of the "coupled vortex effect."  The coupled vortex effect was identified through field tests of Windstar 530G turbines and is made possible by the fact that straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine blades passing in close proximity to one another in opposite directions create lift and torque on their neighboring blades, boosting the energy production of an array in comparison with a single turbine's performance. See patent {{US patent|6784566|US6784566}}. A mathematical model of the phenomenon and its effect on Windstar turbine performance was made possible by grant funds from the California Energy Commission in 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.ca.gov/.../2010-07-28_research_awards_main-release.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Vries, Eize. "Array type vertical-axis wind turbine performance breakthrough," WindStats, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on similar vertical axis turbine configurations have independently confirmed the effect, linking the phenomenon's boost of performance to the fluid efficiency observed in schools of fish.&lt;ref&gt;Whittlesey RW, Liska SC, Dabiri JO (2010) "Fish schooling as a basis for vertical-axis wind turbine farm design," Bioninspiration and Biomimetics 5:035005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Windstar Model 636==
Windstar Model 636 is a commercial model of the Windstar turbine offered by Wind Harvest International, Inc.  It is a direct evolution of their earlier guyed model the 530G.  It uses similar components with some modifications geared toward the commercial market.  Modifications of the design include longer blades and a new bearing assembly.

==Windstar Models 1500 and 3000==
These two models were designed based on field data from the 530G prototype field testing in the LAVTS configuration. Mathematical modeling of these turbines was conducted by IOPARA, Inc., made possible by a grant from the California Energy Commission in 2010. Model 3000 will stand 50&amp;nbsp;ft high with a 40&amp;nbsp;ft tall rotor.  The Windstar Model 3000 will be 75&amp;nbsp;ft wide and used for lower wind speed locations (14-16&amp;nbsp;mph).  The Windstar Model 1500 will have a similar rotor height and will be 37.5&amp;nbsp;ft wide.  The Model 1500 is designed for higher wind speed locations.
