'''Aboriginal child protection''' describes services designed specifically for protection of the children of "aboriginal" or [[indigenous peoples]], particularly where these peoples are a [[minority group|minority]] within a country.  They may differ at international, national, legal, cultural, social, professional and program levels from general or mainstream [[child protection]] services. Fundamental [[human rights]] are a source of many of the differences.  Aboriginal child protection may be an integral or a distinct aspect of [[mainstream]] services or it may be exercised formally or informally by an aboriginal people itself.  There has been controversy about systemic genocide in child protection systems enforced with aboriginal children in post-colonial societies.

== International ==
"In the second half of the twentieth century, removing children from their parents in order to change a people and a culture came to be recognized as an act of [[oppression]], formally considered by the [[United Nations]] to be a form of [[genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Armitage, ''Comparing the Policy of Aboriginal Assimilation: Australia, Canada and New Zealand'', UBC Press, Vancouver (1995), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many distinct aspects of aboriginal child protection are thus related to [[international human rights law]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Domestic laws]] of [[nation-state]]s may incorporate international norms; see next section.&lt;/ref&gt; including the 1951 ''[[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 provides: "In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: … (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group." {{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000408162107/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm |archivedate=2000-04-08 }}, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1976 ''[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx|website=www.ohchr.org|accessdate=24 March 2017|date=16 December 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1986 ''Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with special reference to foster placement and adoption nationally and internationally|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r085.htm|website=www.un.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213171120/http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/41/a41r085.htm/|archivedate=13 February 2017|date=3 December 1986|deadurl=no|id=A/RES/41/85}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1989 ''[[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx|website=www.ohchr.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 March 2017|date=20 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2007 ''[[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/61/295|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 March 2017|language=en|id=A/RES/61/295}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|Declaration]] provides: "Indigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples and shall not be subjected to any act of genocide or any other act of violence, including forcibly removing children of the group to another group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/61/295|website=undocs.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 March 2017|language=en|id=A/RES/61/295|at=Article 7(2) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is non-binding but may be persuasive even for those states that voted against it.&lt;ref&gt;Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States; see http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10612.doc.htm, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Within countries, the expression of aboriginal child protection may be seen to be entangled with issues relating to the right of [[self-determination]] of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights'', Art. 1: "All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development."  In Canada, this right may be constitutionally recognized, see: ''Reference re Secession of Quebec'', [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1998/1998rcs2-217/1998rcs2-217.html, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National ==
The domestic law of a country does not generally recognize an international law unless it is specifically introduced by the domestic law of that country.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Harold Hongju Koh, "Why Do Nations Obey International Law?", 106 Yale L.J. 2599 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
This may occur by express statutory provision or by a domestic court having regard to an international norm as reflecting social progress.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Mabo v Queensland [No2]'', (1992) 175 C.L.R. 1 (Aus.).&lt;/ref&gt;
Even without being specifically introduced into domestic law, international norms may have political effects especially in countries that actively espouse human rights.&lt;ref&gt;See: Ryan Goodman &amp; Derek Jinks, "Toward an Institutional Theory of Sovereignty", 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1749, 1750 (2003), reviewed in Harold Hongju Koh, "Internalization through Socialization", 54 Duke L. J. 975, http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?54+Duke+L.+J.+975#H1N0, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aboriginal child protection issues tend to be prominent in countries colonized by a new majority population within the last few centuries.
Assimilative policies arose, regardless of whether colonization proceeded mainly by force as in the United States of America and Australia or by treaty as in Canada and New Zealand.
By the end of the twentieth century, assimilative policies were generally replaced in legislation, policy or practice by the Aboriginal Child Placement Principle which "outlines a preference for the placement of Aboriginal children with Aboriginal people when they are placed outside their families.
The order of preference is generally that an Aboriginal child be placed: within the child’s extended family; or, if this is not possible, within the child’s Aboriginal community; and, failing that, with other Aboriginal people."&lt;ref&gt;Law Reform Commission, New South Wales, Research Report 7 (1997) - The Aboriginal Child Placement Principle, http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/RR7CHP1, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Versions of this principle refashioned aboriginal child protection in Western post-colonial democracies along lines shaped by constitutional responsibilities: state in Australia, federal in the United States, federal/provincial in Canada and national in New Zealand, with constitutionalized Treaties playing a pivotal role in New Zealand and an emerging role in Canada.

===Australia===
{{see also|Stolen Generations}}

In [[Australia]], “Traditionally, the Aboriginal family was a collaboration of clans composed of mothers, fathers, uncles, aunties, brothers, sisters, cousins and so on. This size of family was the norm but is recognised in today's terms as an 'extended family'.”&lt;ref&gt;Yolanda Walker, “Aboriginal family issues”, Family Matters, Aug. 1993, p.51; http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/pubs/fm1/fm35yw.html, accessed 20 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1983, a [[Family Court of Western Australia|Family Court]] worker noted: "[T]he strength of family affiliation goes a long way to explain the preservation of a distinct culture that has defied assimilation despite aggressive government policies for over a century."&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Eversley, "The south-west aboriginal and family law", in Proc. Australian Family Research Conference, Canberra, 1983, v. 2: ''Family law'', Inst. Family Studies, Melbourne (1984), p. 135; http://www.popline.org/docs/0715/199030.html, accessed 20 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constitutionally, "The responsibility for legislating for children's welfare lies with each State and Territory Government in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;The Aboriginal Child Placement Principle, New South Wales Law Reform Commission Research Report 7 (1997), [1998] AILR 13, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AILR/1998/13.html#Heading9, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aboriginal Child Placement Principle was formulated in Australia in the late 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Law Reform Commission"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Lock, Jennifer Ann |author2=New South Wales.

This distrust of the system is one of the reasons for the shortage of Indigenous carers in most jurisdictions in Australia."&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Higgins, Leah Bromfield &amp; Nick Richardson, "Enhancing Out-of-Home Care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Young People", Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2005. {{ISBN|0-642-39535-7}}, http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/pubs/reports/empirical/empirical.html, accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

[[Child protection]] for [[aboriginal peoples of Canada]] has tended from [[Confederation]] in 1867 to fall between the chairs.
Constitutional arrangements in [[Canada]] assigned "[[First Nations|Indians]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Indians" here includes Inuit; ''In Re Eskimos'', [1939] S.C.R. 104 (Can.).&lt;/ref&gt; to federal and [[child protection]] to provincial authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[British North America Act]], 1867'', 30 &amp; 31 Vic., (U.K.), c. 3, ss. 91(24) &amp; 92(16); http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Several generations of family life for many aboriginal peoples were devastated by a policy designed to "kill the Indian in the child" effectuated through a compulsory [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential school program]].&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized for this policy: Hansard, Wednesday, June 11, 2008, "Apology to Former Students of Indian Residential Schools", http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3568890&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=2, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, many aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families and adopted by non-aboriginal parents, in a process known as [[Sixties Scoop]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lyons, Stolen Nation, http://www.wrcfs.org/repat/stolennation.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085106/http://www.wrcfs.org/repat/stolennation.htm |date=9 May 2008 }}, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, a [[Edwin Kimelman|Judge]] found that "[[Cultural genocide]] has been taking place in a systematic routine manner."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Kimelman|Edwin C. Kimelman]], ''No Quiet Place'', Report of the Review Committee on Indian and Métis Adoptions and Placements (1985), aka the [[Kimelman Report]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, "First Nations peoples [took initiatives] in developing proposals of their own and in negotiating agreements with governments. ... First Nations peoples [developed] service models which reflect[ed] the experiences of their communities, cultures and histories."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Armitage, ''Comparing the Policy of Aboriginal Assimilation: Australia, Canada and New Zealand'', UBC Press, Vancouver (1995), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[aboriginal rights]] were protected in the [[Canadian Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution Act, 1982'', (Can.), s. 35(1): "The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed." {{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204043456/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |archivedate=2005-12-04 }}, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Developments in [[case law]] suggest that since 1982 aboriginal peoples' rights to cultural integrity have been constitutionally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Slattery, "Generic and Specific Aboriginal Rights", p. 6, http://www.law.uvic.ca/calder/Papers/Brian%20Slattery.pdf, accessed 21 August 2008; and see: Brian Slattery, in ''Let Right Be Done: Aboriginal Title, the Calder Case, and the Future of Indigenous Rights'', Hamar Foster, Heather Raven and Jeremy Webber (eds.), UBC Press, Vancouver (2007);  http://www.bsos.umd.edu/gvpt/lpbr/subpages/reviews/foster0708.htm, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, some provinces enacted provisions and established policies for aboriginal child welfare agencies to provide services for aboriginal families on reserves under provincial law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Ontario, Child and Family Services Act'', (1984), Part X; R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; They depend upon federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;Auditor General of Canada &amp; Auditor general of British Columbia, Foreword in ''Management of Aboriginal Child Protection Services'', Ministry of Children and family Development (2008/2009), p. 2: "Funding for the services needs to match the requirements of the policies and also support the delivery of services that are culturally appropriate - which is known to take more time and resources.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Native agencies are bound by the same provincial child-welfare laws as their mainstream counterparts, but must survive on far tighter budgets under a strict federal funding formula that takes little account of provincial legislation."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Philp, "The land of lost children", [[The Globe and Mail]], Saturday, December 21, 2002, p. F4; http://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0212/gm021221a.htm, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Assembly of First Nations]] announced that it was filing a complaint with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] that discriminatory services violated human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Media release, 23 February 2007, http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=3374, accessed 11 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Canada's Auditor General found that "Current funding practices do not lead to equitable funding among Aboriginal and First Nations communities."&lt;ref&gt;2008 May Report of the Auditor General of Canada, ch. 4; http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200805_04_e_30700.html, accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, "The [[First Nations]] are engaged in a struggle to gain control of [[child welfare]] in their own communities, and this issue has a significant place in the First Nations movement towards [[self-determination]]."&lt;ref&gt;Deena Marshall, [[Cindy Blackstock]], Joyce Clouston Carlson &amp; Marshall Fine, “From Child Welfare to Child, Family and Community Welfare: The Agenda of Canada’s Aboriginal Peoples”, in ''Towards Positive Systems of Child And Family Welfare: International Comparisons of Child Protection, Family Service, and Community Caring Systems'', Gary Cameron &amp; Nancy Freymond, eds., [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto (2006), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples]] exercising the right of self-determination&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[Pimicikamak]] and the [[Grand Council of Treaty 3|Anishinaabe Nation in Treaty #3]].&lt;/ref&gt; have yet to make it fully effective in respect of aboriginal child protection.

===China===

[[China]] has numerous indigenous peoples{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} that are designated national [[Ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]].
China is undergoing extraordinarily rapid economic growth and [[Urbanization in China|urbanization]] from a recent baseline of extreme [[Poverty in China|poverty]].
Provincial, county and township governments have difficulty financing social services.&lt;ref&gt;"Local governments still have many expenditure duties, but do not have the revenues to meet them. ... In some extreme cases, the tax collected is not even enough to cover the running costs of the local tax bureau. This makes it extremely difficult to maintain local infrastructure and sustain social services.  See: China Development Brief, (25 January 2007), "Fiscal reform: Disentangling the public purse strings".  http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/node/969, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In these circumstances, "The majority of protective children are [those who are] abandoned and disabled. ... It is almost unimaginable that [a] child will be moved from the birthfamily due to child abuse and neglect by his or her birthparent(s)."&lt;ref&gt;Huang Lihua, Chinese Adoption: Practices and Challenges", in Nick Frost (ed.), ''Child Welfare: Major Themes in Health and Social Welfare'', (2004), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2005 study sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation, UNICEF and Peking University and supported by the government of China found that child abuse is widespread in China.&lt;ref&gt;''China Daily'', May 17, 2005, http://www.china.org.cn/english/2005/May/129038.htm, accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the absence of state intervention to protect children within their families, aboriginal child protection tends to not be an issue.
Ethnic minority families are exempted from the [[one-child policy]],&lt;ref&gt;"By 1979, with the national population close to 1 billion, the Chinese government imposed a policy to limit each family to a single child.
Exceptions have been allowed only if a parent belongs to an ethnic minority or both parents are only children."  See: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ipng/mecon/cases/Adoption.pdf, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; removing for ethnic minority populations one of the main reasons for child abandonment.
In China, “Every ethnic group has the freedom to use its own spoken and written languages, and to retain or change its customs. ... [N]ational minorities exercise regional autonomy.
Where national minorities live in compact communities autonomous organs of self-government are established….  The minority people … exercise autonomous rights, [are] masters in their own areas and administer the internal affairs of their ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;Regional Autonomy for Minority Peoples, http://id.china-embassy.org/eng/zggk/ssmz/t87302.htm, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Recent reform efforts in China's child welfare practices have focused on the importance of providing safe, permanent families for children in lieu of long-term institutional care. Although challenges still exist, adoption and foster care are increasingly being seen as viable alternatives for these children."&lt;ref&gt;Huang Lihua, Chinese Adoption: Practices and Challenges", (2001) 80 Child Welfare, p. 529, http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-85404983.html, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of autonomous rights and absence of intrusive mainstream child protection services in China tends to defuse the principal driving forces underlying aboriginal child protection in other countries.

===New Zealand===

In [[New Zealand]], social services established with the ''Child Welfare Act'' in 1925 "displayed little regard for the extended kin networks of [[Māori people|Māori]] children."&lt;ref&gt;Joy Swanson Ernst, "''[[Whanau]]'' Knows Best: Kinship Care in New Zealand", in ''Kinship Foster Care: Policy, Practice and Research'', Rebecca L. Hegar &amp; Maria Scannapieco, eds., [[Oxford University Press]], USA (1996), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, New Zealand law retroactively abolished Māori customary adoptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Adoption Act 1955'', (NZ), s. 19, http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/latest/DLM292661.html?search=ts_act_adoption+act&amp;sr=1, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1982, a report recommended changes to the Department of Social Welfare to meet Māori needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Government of New Zealand]], ''The Report of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on a Maori Perspective for the Department of Social Welfare'' ([[List_of_acronyms_and_initialisms:_A#AK|aka]] [[Puao-te-Ata-tu]] or Day Break), Wellington (1988), http://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/publications/msd/puaoteatatu.pdf, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  "The report's recommendations, all accepted by the then Minister, focus[ed] upon the need for the department to function in a bicultural manner and to share responsibility and authority for decisions with appropriate Māori people."&lt;ref&gt;Waitangi Tribunal,   http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/scripts/reports/reports/414/83C6BC23-2BFB-4ED9-B165-7D1CD282AEA3.pdf, accessed 20 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1980s, "notions of social work accountability, along with the pivotal role accorded family and [[whanau]], had tipped the balance of care and protection work away from professionals.  'Family solutions to family problems', an important philosophy of child welfare work for many years, became more significant as family decision-making assumed importance."&lt;ref&gt;Bronwyn Dalley, ''Family Matters'', [[Auckland University Press]] (1998), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, New Zealand passed ground-breaking new legislation,&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989]]'', (N.Z.).&lt;/ref&gt; based on a philosophy of kinship care, that recognized "the importance of [[cultural identity]] in [[child protection]] policy."  "[K]inship care in New Zealand is ... an effort to redress past practices that harmed and alienated [[Māori people|Māori]] children and families."&lt;ref&gt;Joy Swanson Ernst, "''Whanau'' Knows Best: Kinship Care in New Zealand", in ''Kinship Foster Care: Policy, Practice and Research'', Oxford University Press, New York (1999), Rebecca L. Hegar &amp; Maria Scannapieco, eds., pp. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

Historically, in the United States "Indian tribes ... struggled against the [[assimilationist]] policies instituted by the United States which sought to destroy tribal cultures by removing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] children from their tribes and families. In a stark example of such policies, the purpose articulated in the charter of the first boarding school in the 1890s on the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] reservation was 'to remove the Navajo child from the influence of his savage parents.'"&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the online edition of 'A Practical Guide to the Indian Child Welfare Act', http://www.narf.org/icwa/ch1.htm, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, the federal government embarked on a new federal Indian policy of tribal [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;"This new policy fosters tribal existence and self governance by allowing tribes to operate programs once operated solely by the federal government."  See: http://www.narf.org/icwa/ch1.htm, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  "In view of this new policy and the problems facing tribes as a result of the loss of their children, the ''[[Indian Child Welfare Act]]'' was enacted in 1978."&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Indian Child Welfare Act]]'' was "the first U.S. policy document to state and explicit preference for kinship placement." Rebecca L. Hegar, "The Cultural Roots of Kinship Care", in ''Kinship Foster Care: Policy, Practice and Research'', Oxford University Press, New York (1999), Rebecca L. Hegar &amp; Maria Scannapieco, eds., p. 17 at p. 22, citing L. Matheson, "The Politics of the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]]", 41 ''Social Work'' 232.  "[The Act] established minimum federal jurisdictional, procedural and substantive standards aimed to achieve the dual purposes of protecting the right of an Indian child to live with an Indian family and to stabilize and foster continued tribal existence."  See: "Introduction to the online edition of 'A Practical Guide to the [[Indian Child Welfare Act]]'", http://www.narf.org/icwa/ch1.htm, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aboriginal child protection is now the subject of a body of federal law and programs.  Through the [[Indian Health Service]] (IHS), the U.S. government provides "health services to more than 1.8 million Federally-recognized [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] and [[Alaska Natives]] through a system of IHS, tribal, and urban ... operated facilities and programs based on treaties, judicial determinations, and Acts of Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. McSwain, testimony to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, (2006), https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t060315.html, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IHS is "the principal Federal health care provider and advocate for the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives".&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Grim, letter dated November 24, 2004, accompanying the IHS/BIA Child Protection Handbook; http://devbehavpeds.ouhsc.edu/assets/pdf/CPT/Dr.%20Grim%20Letter.pdf, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its services, the IHS administers the ''Indian Child Abuse and Family Violence Prevention Act''&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 101 630, Title IV (1990)(U.S.).&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] offers model [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal laws]] for child protection codes on reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook for Indian Health Service &amp; Bureau of Indian Affairs (U.S.), ''Child Protection in Indian Country'', http://devbehavpeds.ouhsc.edu/CPT.htm, accessed 19 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  These services, programs and codes may be culturally and linguistically as well as legally and politically differentiated from those of State-based [[Child Protective Services]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} but, more generally, "Kinship care has become an integral program option along the continuum of service options in the child welfare system."&lt;ref&gt;Maria Scannapieco, "Formal Kinship Care Practice Models", in ''Kinship Foster Care: Policy, Practice and Research'', Oxford University Press, New York (1999), Rebecca L. Hegar &amp; Maria Scannapieco, eds., p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws ==
In a [[Liberal democracy|democracy]] child protection is subject to the [[rule of law]].
Many countries have written laws governing the exercise of state power for [[child protection]].  [[Indigenous peoples]] had organized societies and customary laws.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he fact is that when the settlers came, the Indians were there, organized in societies..." per Judson, J., in ''Calder v. Attorney-General of British Columbia'', [1973] S.C.R. 313 (Can.).&lt;/ref&gt;
Indigenous peoples' customary laws are recognized and enforceable as part of the laws of [[post-colonial]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;In ''R. v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', [1982] 2 All E.R. 118 (U.K.), [[Lord Denning]] said, "These customary laws are not written down. They are handed down by tradition from one generation to another. Yet beyond doubt they are well established and have the force of law within the community."&lt;/ref&gt;
In the U.S.A., "Customary law still appears in many of the decisions of American state and federal courts. Customary law, part and parcel of the English common law adopted and adapted by the Founders of the United States, recurs less often given that statutory and administrative law dominate the field.  In contrast, the importance of customary law in American Indian tribal courts cannot be [over]stated."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L.M. Fletcher, "Rethinking Customary Law in Tribal Court Jurisprudence", http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=matthew_fletcher, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Canada, a court noted that "such rules, whether they result from custom, tradition, agreement, or some other decision making process, are '[[laws]]' in the [[A. V. Dicey|Dicey]] [[constitutional]] sense."&lt;ref&gt;''Campbell v. British Columbia'', 2000 BCSC 1123 (Can.) per Williamson J., http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/00/11/s00-1123.htm, accessed 21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Inevitably, political tensions over the exercise of self-determination by aboriginal peoples find expression in legal tensions between indigenous, customary laws and post-colonial statutes respecting child protection for aboriginal children.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Deena Marshall, Cindy Blackstock, Joyce Clouston Carlson &amp; Marshall Fine, “From Child Welfare to Child, Family and Community Welfare: The Agenda of Canada’s Aboriginal Peoples”, in ''Towards Positive Systems of Child And Family Welfare: International Comparisons of Child Protection, Family Service, and Community Caring Systems'', Gary Cameron &amp; Nancy Freymond, eds., [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
Indigenous legal principles that reflect a more holistic [[World view|worldview]], and so give relatively greater emphasis to spiritual, cultural and relational needs in addition to physical needs of the child, may add to the legal differences.

===Defining "Aboriginal"===

As aboriginal child protection returns to its roots among aboriginal peoples, the question of who is aboriginal becomes increasingly pertinent.
Aboriginal customs and colonial statutes were the two main sources of legal definitions of aboriginality.  Aboriginal peoples were typically cohesive, numbering only hundreds or perhaps thousands, and collectively knew who they were.
Their customary self-definitions may have been cultural rather than racial because some interbreeding was important for healthy genetic diversity.
Colonial statutes were generally based on race or place.
Today, the challenges of definition span a range from New Zealand's with one officially recognized ethnic minority to China's with 55.
In Australia and Canada, where for jurisdictional reasons child protection laws affecting aboriginal families vary across states and provinces, availability of aboriginal child protection services tends to be defined by place.&lt;ref&gt;I.e., by residence on Aboriginal or Indian reserves.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, "In his analysis of over 700 pieces of legislation, the legal historian John McCorquodale found no less than 67 different definitions of Aboriginal people."&lt;ref&gt;John McCorquodale, "The Legal Classification of Race in Australia", (1986) 10 Aboriginal History p. 7; cited in John Gardiner-Garden,  "The Definition of Aboriginality", Parliament of Australia, Research Note 18 2000-01, {{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RN/2000-01/01RN18.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420084418/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RN/2000-01/01RN18.htm |archivedate=2010-04-20 |df= }}, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Three constitutionally undefined groups of aboriginal peoples&lt;ref&gt;The Indian, [[Inuit]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] peoples of Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; have constitutional rights in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution Act, 1982'', s. 35(2), {{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204043456/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/annex_e.html |archivedate=2005-12-04 }}, accessed 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these, only "[[First Nations|Indians]]" are statutorily defined for administrative purposes&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Act'', R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5, http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-5, accessed 3 September 2008; it is a basic principle of law that the statutory definition cannot affect the constitutional meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; and the statutory Band scheme does not correspond with Indian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;''Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia'', 2007 BCSC 1700, http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/07/17/2007BCSC1700.pdf, accessed 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
From its inception in 1876, the ''[[Indian Act]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Act'', R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5, http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/I-5, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; established convoluted but essentially [[patrilineal]] definitions of "Indian", an exercise in gender discrimination that was eroded and finally eliminated by court decisions and statutory amendments in the 25 years following the 1982 [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].
In general, aboriginal peoples in Canada continue to have the right to define themselves for their own purposes and such definitions may have wider application.
In 1999, [[Pimicikamak]], a Canadian [[aboriginal people]], enacted a [[citizenship]] law&lt;ref&gt;''The Pimicikamak Citizenship Law, 1999'', http://www.pimicikamak.ca/law/LAWoCITf.DOC {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706193318/http://www.pimicikamak.ca/law/LAWoCITf.DOC |date=6 July 2011 }}, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; based on self-identification, acceptance by the people, and objective verifiability.&lt;ref&gt;The government of Canada objected to, but subsequently accepted, this law.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada prescribed three similar criteria for determining who is a member of a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] people,&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. [[Powley ruling|Powley]]'', [2003] 2 S.C.R. 207, http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2003/2003scc43/2003scc43.html, accessed 22 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the customary aboriginal definition (with the addition of objective verifiability, which was not an issue in the pre-colonial context).

===China===

In China, distinct ethnic groups have been officially defined since 1949.  The criteria for recognition of an ethnic group are: a territory in China from which it originated, a distinct language, distinctive customs and a sense of collective identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Ethnic Minorities in China"; http://www.c-c-c.org/chineseculture/minority/minority.html#ethnic, accessed 20 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
"The [[Waitangi Tribunal]] was established in 1975 by the ''Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975''. The Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry charged with making recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to actions or omissions of the Crown that breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125020711/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/ |date=25 November 2010 }}, accessed 20 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bicultural Services ==

Except where mandated and provided distinctly from mainstream child protection, aboriginal child protection is necessarily provided through some form of bicultural services.  This gives rise to issues of [[cultural competence]].

== Standards ==

While constitutional arrangements, legal definitions and statutory schemata vary among those Western post-colonial countries where aboriginal child protection issues have most notably emerged, standards for aboriginal child protection tend to converge.  Whether mainstream or aboriginal, [[child protection]] agencies tend to be professional and to aim for [[best practice]] standards.  Best practice is implicit in identifying the [[best interests of the child]], the almost universal mantra of modern [[child welfare]] statutory mandates and professional practice.  Best practice is [[evidence based]]; knowledge of the evidence accepts no borders.

'''Baboom''' is a music service based in Portugal. The service was founded by [[Kim Dotcom]], although Baboom and Dotcom severed ties almost a year before the service's launch.&lt;ref name="Dotcom sells out of Baboom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dotcom sells out of Baboom|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/10571753/Dotcom-sells-out-of-Baboom|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baboom was launched on 17 August 2015. Baboom described the service as a "Music marketplace that combines Fair Trade Streaming with a music store".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=https://baboom.com/about |website=Baboom |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930192528/https://baboom.com/about |archivedate=30 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The service however was quickly put on hold "until further notice", as stated on Baboom's website, even before it could celebrate its first year.

== Model ==
Baboom's website states that fans (users) can play the music they want on any device, own the music forever, support artist and be part of the "inner circle", Upload their own music, which include Lossless format.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

It also states the service gives artists 90% of the revenue, fair trade streaming, premium following, a right management system and a career analytics system.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Russel Brown of the ''Public Address'' blog said in a review that:
{{quote|the most interesting thing about Baboom is the way it addresses some of the problems with the streaming market we've discussed here in recent weeks. Its "fair trade streaming" model works in a fundamentally different way to Spotify et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/baboom-its-serious/ | title=Baboom: it's serious | work=Public Address | accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Apps == 
The service supports both [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The apps at the time has limited functionality, with only allowing to listen to music, as well as to download, but at the time of writing have no search function.

[[File:PuciatoWeinman1.jpg|thumb|Weinman and [[Greg Puciato]] of The Dillinger Escape Plan]]
Weinman played in some bands from New Jersey and in 1996 he founded the [[hardcore punk]] act Arcane along with [[Chris Pennie]] on drums, [[Dimitri Minakakis]] on vocals, Bruce Fulton on bass and Brad McMannand on second vocals. He describes the group as a "lost cause" due to their lack of innovation. After a few months, they turned around its style, with [[Adam Doll]] replacing McMann and Derek Brantley taking the place of Fulton. Eventually, Arcane morphed into [[the Dillinger Escape Plan]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="hazard"/&gt; Weinman gradually shifted his focus on being a full-time musician and eventually quit his corporate job.{{sfn|Hartmann|2016|loc=1:17}}

He was born in [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], [[Ontario]] and competed in the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]] [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinidiabet.com/en/infodiabetes/news/2006/02.htm|title=Chris Jarvis, Time to the Olympics|publisher=clinidiabet.com|accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of a Canada-based charity known as "I Challenge Diabetes" and provides significant grass roots support to the Canadian Public.

==Overview==
Jarvis was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus type 1]] at age 13.&lt;ref name=starkman&gt;Starkman, Randy. "[https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/237111 Rower rises to the top - Diagnosed with diabetes at 13, Chris Jarvis battles the odds to claim gold in Pan Am pairs]", The Toronto Star, July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He wears a [[Meditronic]] [[insulin pump]] while competing, in order to mitigate the effects of his condition.&lt;ref name=starkman /&gt; When he was rowing in college at [[Northeastern University]], his coach told him that the diabetes would prevent him from ever rowing for the varsity team.&lt;ref name=starkman /&gt; Despite this, Jarvis not only made the team, but was also selected as its captain in his senior year.&lt;ref name=starkman /&gt; He went on to race for Canada for eight years including racing at the Olympics, winning gold medals and podium finishes for many world stage events and is a reputable leader of non-profit work in diabetes.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail"&gt;{{cite web|last=Christie|first=James|title=Golden rowers mesh quickly|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article771855.ece|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of I Challenge Diabetes==
Jarvis has taken his passion for sports, coaching principles and his knowledge of the science behind diabetes and built a charity the Globe and Mail says "helps people take control of their diabetes while challenging themselves physically" - [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015213/http://www.randallanthony.com/files/JuvenilleDiabetesNov.18.11.pdf Inspire, Globe and Mail, Nov 18th, 2011 by Marjo Johne.] Jarvis and a team of community leaders take on activities from basic community programs to the most extreme races Canada has to offer. Director of a diabetes youth expedition, in 2006, Jarvis took teens to Peru to find "diabetes maturity".&lt;ref name="Reference Needed"&gt;Reference Needed&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Jarvis' team ran over 40 not-for profit programs with over 1500 participants.&lt;ref name="Reference Needed"/&gt; A direct focus still remains on teens in transition with diabetes however I Challenge Diabetes is running programs for all ages. Jarvis feels there is an extreme gap in the system that leaves these teens overburdened and in need of support. A similar position he found himself in and feels grateful for the sport that forced his growth and the luck he had to find stability on his own. As such, Jarvis' team continues to strive forward as leaders of social and educational support for all peoples, building community and sharing insight with a particular focus on teens with diabetes. Programs currently span the provinces of BC, AB, ON and QC however participants have been known to travel from other provinces and even other countries.

'''''Rowing and not-for-profit back ground'''''

Despite challenges from University coach, Jarvis determined to reach his potential pushed hard to succeed. Leaping beyond the boundaries of University rowing he quickly realized his potential on Canada's national rowing team. Bringing home Silver in 2002 from the under 23 world rowing championships he returned to University to make a difference. While studying chemical engineering and practicing the maximum number of hours in NCAA legislature, Jarvis found the time to join the universities [https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/NCAA/Academics+and+Athletes/SAAC/index+-+SAAC "Student Athlete Advisory Committee" (SAAC)] and over his four year career spent two years as the university co-chair of SAAC bringing in new initiatives for athletes to engage in the community{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Jarvis was quickly recruited to represent the Universities Conference as the America East Chair of SAAC where he learned and developed as a leader in sport in the community.
 
Returning to train in 2003 Jarvis began training for Athens and supported his team mates to an undefeated rowing streak that was 17 races long for Canada{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. The final World Cup circuit before Athens Greece Jarvis was in the eight and concluded the final six race circuit with an impressive win in Lucerne Switzerland against the entire field that would be racing in Athens. With five weeks remaining before the Olympics a shift in the team moved Jarvis and Barber out of the eight, Jarvis joining Dave Calder in the pair who showed promise for Athens. With little time to train and synchronize, there was an unprecedented amount of speed out of the gates and down the course{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} with Jarvis and Calder moving straight on to the Semi-final from the opening heats in the Olympics and taking down a serious medal contender, the Skelin brothers who had been training together for 17+ years.

Both Jarvis and rower Dave Calder were disqualified during the Semi-final after a near flawless race just after qualifying the pair for the grand final in striking distance of a podium finish. The pair was accused of striking the South African team after crossing over the line of buoys in the final 60m of their 2000m race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowers appeal denied. Disqualification stands.|url=http://swo.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20040818/rowing_athens_040818?hub=TorontoNewHome|work=Canadian Press|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair appealed the disqualification to FISA, the governing body, the officials refused to look at any evidence and their appeal was not successful. After this disappointment, the pair continued to dispute this to the court of Arbitration of Sport, where a video was finally brought forward from the Olympic Committee showing no such evidence of Canada touching the South African pair. The Canadian Pair also had a signed petition from the other athletes qualified for the Grand Final stating their acceptance to the appeal and asking for Canada to be included in the race. The only pair of the six who did not sign the petition was strangely not the South African pair, but the Australians who had beaten all other crews but the Canadians in previous races. The Court saw that Canada had not struck the South African pair and the Canadians were permitted to return to racing however the decision was made too late and the Canadians were ranked 12th overall without a final race.

Jarvis has teamed up with other athletes to race the pair since. In the following year after Athens, 2005 Jarvis raced with partner [[Malcolm Howard (rower)|Malcolm Howard]] to claim the highest percentage in Canada while qualifying for the World Rowing Championships in Gifu Japan. An irritation in Jarvis' lower back emerged to two bulging discs during the travel to Japan and left Jarvis and Howard with little time to for rehabilitation. Howard decided to remain with his partner Jarvis and the pair managed to pull off a 4th-place finish despite the setback. Nearly edging in for a bronze in the closing meters of the race but ran out of room. Since 2004, Jarvis realized his impact on the community of people living with diabetes. A disease he had lived with since 1994 and had served as an extra challenge mentally, physically and financially throughout every day of his training career. Jarvis became an advocate for others with the disease and began building a community in both Canada and the US as a spokesperson, educator and inspiration. Jarvis partnered with fellow diabetic athlete Peter Nerothin,  co-founding [http://www.Insulindependence.org Insulindependence]. This was done in 2005 while competing on the Canadian team and finishing his degree at Northeastern University in Boston.&lt;ref name=Inspiration&gt;{{cite web|last=Johne |first=Marjo |title=Olympian challenges others to take on type 1 diabetes |url=http://www.randallanthony.com/files/JuvenilleDiabetesNov.18.11.pdf |publisher=Globe and Mail |accessdate=Nov 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426015213/http://www.randallanthony.com/files/JuvenilleDiabetesNov.18.11.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once completing his degree in Chemical Engineering, 2006, Jarvis returned to Canada causing Nerothin and Jarvis to separate paths to start anew in Canada. Jarvis started another organization in Canada called [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112171735/http://www.ichallengediabetes.org/I_Challenge/Welcome.html "I Challenge Diabetes"] while he continued training. Earning immediate recognition in Canada, Jarvis was given a first time award by the [http://www.diabetes.ca Canadian DIabetes Association] with they called the "National Inspiration Award" given to someone effecting the whole countries community with diabetes. Jarvis paired up with [[Dan Casaca]] in 2007 to lead the Canadian team to its first gold medal in [[coxless pair]]s while [[Rowing at the 2007 Pan American Games|2007 Pan American Games]].&lt;ref name=starkman /&gt; This was Canada's only gold in the 2007 games for Canada's Rowing Team and the first Gold for Canada of the games. Globe and Mail

Jarvis split commitment to the not-for-profit world of both rowing and diabetes ended up costing him big. On top of the 6–8 hours of training per day, 18 training sessions per week (with growing intensity as Beijing drew near), he also poured his passion into the diabetes community in Canada and tried to remain connected to the US community he had built. Emails came in from parents of children with diabetes and diabetic athletes from around the world, plus squeezing in over 75 speaking events in 2007 alone{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} - Jarvis was stretched thin. In the peak of the racing season, Jarvis was pulled from a team meeting by the team manager to inform him of a "whereabouts failure". As Jarvis was one of the five members of the Olympic rowing team selected for a new focused initiative to track the whereabouts of the worlds top athletes, to insure at any time a spot check on banned substance abuse could be possible, he needed to submit proper documentation to the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport - a task he neglected to comply with.  Jarvis was required to submit daily activities, time and locations 30–120 days in advance to comply with this legislation. This was something that all Canadian elite athletes were required to do. Jarvis was unable to manage his email stream and had missed two emails from the CCES who had faulted him with inadequate information and given 2 warnings{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Jarvis now aware of the problem wrote to the CCES and asked if there was any other means, a simple request for the use of the phone, to deal with such important information as emails can easily be lost in the shuffle of an athlete who burns 7000 Calories a day in training{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. This is a part of the legislation that insists all efforts are made to insure the athlete is aware of their responsibility to report, regardless, the CCES again decided to use email for another important update request while Jarvis was inaccessible to the internet. Upon returning home and shuffling through emails to find he was one day after the deadline, Jarvis placed an urgent call to the CCES, asking for assistance and for mercy.

Claiming that he had been found easily each time he was sought by CCES officers for testing and tested more often than any other team mate in 2007{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}, the accusations were simply blind siding. Regardless Jarvis was suspended for three months from the Canadian rowing team as a result of repeatedly neglecting to report his whereabouts to the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport.  Although a tribunal found that there was significant neglect of obligations by the CCES case manager and the team manager{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}, the tribunal could not overturn the decision of the CCES who maintained their position. Within the current system there were no repercussions or adjustments for failure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Jarvis returned to row and fought for a spot with the Canadian Olympic Team. While politics played a part as the team needed to be narrowed significantly before Beijing, the nation's best petitioned the coaches to include him and Jarvis was brought overseas to train with the team right up to the games. Jarvis' hope in racing in the Olympic Games was satisfied in part by seeing his team mates win Gold and Silver in the men's eight and pair respectively.

He has since retired from rowing and continues to pursue his not-for-profit initiatives which keep him plenty active.

[[File:Conrad Haas.jpg|thumb|Description of a rocket by Conrad Haas]]

'''Conrad Haas''' (1509&amp;ndash;1576) was an Austrian or [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]] [[military engineer]] for the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and Principality of [[Transilvania]].

He is a pioneer of [[rocket propulsion]]. His designs include a   [[multistage rocket|three-stage rocket]] and a manned rocket.

Haas was perhaps born in Dornbach (now part of [[Hernals]], [[Vienna]]). 
He held the post of the ''Zeugwart'' (arsenal master) of the Imperial Austrian army under [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. 
In 1551, [[Stephen Báthory]], the grand prince of [[Transylvania]] invited Haas to [[Hermannstadt]], [[Siebenbürgen]] (now [[Sibiu]], [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]]), where he acted as weapons engineer and also he started to teach at [[Klausenburg]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]).

He wrote  a German-language treatise on rocket technology, involving the combination of [[fireworks]] and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the Sibiu public records (Sibiu public records ''Varia II 374'').
His work also dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using [[liquid fuel]], and introduced [[Delta (letter)|delta]]-shape [[fin]]s and bell-shaped [[nozzle]]s.

In the last paragraph of his chapter on the military use of rockets, he wrote (translated):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But my advice is for more peace and no war, leaving the rifles calmly in storage, so the bullet is not fired, the gunpowder is not burned or wet, so the prince keeps his money, the arsenal master his life; that is the advice Conrad Haas gives."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Johann Schmidlap]], a German fireworks maker, is believed to have experimented with staging in 1590, using a design he called "step rockets."
Before discovery of Haas' manuscript, the first description of the three-stage rocket was in Poland credited to the [[Poland|Polish]] artillery specialist [[Kazimierz Siemienowicz]] in his 1650 work, ''Artis Magnae Artilleriae Pars Prima'' ("Great Art of Artillery, Part One").

Gibson released her debut album ''[[Out of the Blue (Debbie Gibson album)|Out of the Blue]]'' in 1987, which spawned several international hits, later being certified triple Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref name="RIAA"&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)| title=Searchable Database: Debbie Gibson|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=Debbie+Gibson#search_section|format=|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those singles, "[[Foolish Beat]]", made Gibson the youngest female artist to write, produce and perform a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-one single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/956574/deborah-gibson-celebrates-40th-birthday|title=Deborah Gibson|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her double-platinum second album&lt;ref name="RIAA"/&gt; ''[[Electric Youth (album)|Electric Youth]]'' (1989), gave Gibson another U.S. number-one hit with "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]". Gibson is the sole songwriter on all of her singles to reach the [[Top 20]] of the Hot 100 charts. She was recognized by [[ASCAP]] as Songwriter of the Year, along with [[Bruce Springsteen]], in 1989. She continued to record and release music throughout the 1990s and 2000s. In 2006, Gibson reached No. 24 on the U.S. [[adult contemporary]] chart with "Say Goodbye", a [[Duet (music)|duet]] with [[Jordan Knight]] and in 2017 achieved her highest-charting hit in more than 25 years&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7841807/clean-bandit-first-dance-club-songs-number-one-symphony|title=Clean Bandit Earns First Dance Club Songs No. 1 With 'Symphony'|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; in her duet with [[Ivan Wilzig|Sir Ivan]], 'I Am Peaceman'.

==Early life==
Debbie Gibson was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the third daughter of four of Joseph Gibson and Diane Gibson ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Pustizzi).&lt;ref name=old-official-bio&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deborah-gibson.com/bio/ | title=Biography | publisher= Debbie Gibson official site | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20021117113947/http://www.deborah-gibson.com/bio/ | archivedate=November 17, 2002}} Former official site; successor site, as of at least April 20, 2014, gives no birthdate or birthplace.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say [[Merrick, New York]], including {{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/6/Deborah-Gibson.html | title=Deborah Gibson Biography (1970–) | accessdate= 2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1990/12/21/debbie-gibson-regular-girl|title=Debbie Gibson, Glamorous at Last, Wants You to Know She's Still, Like, a Regular Girl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, who enjoyed singing, was originally named Joseph Schultz and was orphaned as a boy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk4f_yk9j-U|title=Debbie Sings with Dad|first=|last=HooplaHa - Only Good News|date=December 11, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; his [[biological]] mother married a man with the surname Gibson before putting Joseph into an [[orphanage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|first=Debbie|last=Gibson (verified account)|user=DebbieGibson |number= 723941814848249856 |date=April 26, 2016 |title=Not his real name.... |accessdate= September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie Gibson grew up in suburban [[Merrick, New York]], on [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=nytimes-merrick&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/nyregion/one-of-merrick-s-most-loyal-daughters.html| title=One of Merrick's Most Loyal Daughters|first=Diane|last=Ketcham|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 13, 1997| accessdate= September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes herself as of "[[Italians|Italian]]/[[Sicilians|Sicilian]] and part [[Germans|German]] and possibly some [[Russians|Russian]]" descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|first=Debbie|last=Gibson (verified account)|user=DebbieGibson |number= 722196414541864961 |date=April 18, 2016 |title=Italian/Sicilian and...|accessdate= September 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied piano under American pianist [[Morton Estrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mortonestrin.com/alumni.php |title= Some of My Past Students| publisher= Morton Estrin official site| archivedate= June 29, 2012 |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120629090703/http://www.mortonestrin.com/alumni.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2014}}

===1986–1989===
After years of writing and producing her own material, Gibson finally found her demo in the hands of a radio personality who eventually shared it with an executive at Atlantic Records. Based solely on Gibson's original song, "Only in My Dreams", she was signed to a development deal and began a promotional tour of club venues throughout the United States.

Gibson spent much of 1986 and the beginning of 1987 building her songwriting catalog while continuing to play club dates. Continuing her promotional tour, Gibson also continued attending classes at Calhoun High School in Merrick, New York, whence she later graduated as an honor student. Diane Gibson, Debbie's mother and manager, accompanied her daughter on many of these track dates. "We played dance clubs, straight clubs and gay clubs", Diane has said.

The promotional pressing of "[[Only in My Dreams]]" landed the song within the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/513524/summer-songs-1985-present-top-10-tunes-each-summer-listen|title=Summer Songs 1985–2014: Top 10 Tunes of Each Summer – Billboard|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/610cwp.htm|title=Song artist 569 – Debbie Gibson|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic Records signed Gibson to a recording contract and thus began the process of completing the first record.

Gibson, along with producer Fred Zarr, wrote, recorded and produced her first album ''Out of the Blue'' in only 4 weeks. Now having something to market, "Only in My Dreams" was selected as Debbie's first single. This time, "Dreams" found traction on Top 40 radio and reached a peak of No. 4 on the Hot 100 chart.

Following the success of "Dreams", "[[Shake Your Love]]" was released as the follow-up single and reached the ''Billboard'' Top 5. The "Shake Your Love" video was choreographed by [[Paula Abdul]] and was the first time [[MTV]] had visited Debbie on a video shoot.

In 1987, while performing around the United States at nightclub venues, Gibson was recording her debut album, ''[[Out of the Blue (Debbie Gibson album)|Out of the Blue]]''. It was recorded in four weeks. Four singles from the album reached the Top 5 of the Hot 100 chart: "Only in My Dreams", "Shake Your Love", "Out of the Blue", and the number-one hit "Foolish Beat", followed by "Staying Together", which performed more modestly, reaching No. 22. "Foolish Beat" set a record for Gibson, making her (at 17) the youngest artist ever to have written, produced, and performed a ''Billboard'' number-one single, as entered in the 1988 Guinness Book of World Records. She remains the youngest female artist to have done so. ''Out of the Blue'' was established as a hit album and she had success in the UK and southeast Asia, filling stadiums with her ''Out of the Blue'' tour. By the end of 1988, ''Out of the Blue'' had gone triple platinum.

The ''Out of the Blue'' music video compilation was certified platinum by the RIAA; the concert tour video was certified 2x platinum. In October 1988, Gibson sang the national anthem for [[1988 World Series|Game 1]] of the [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]].

''[[Electric Youth (album)|Electric Youth]]'' was released in early 1989, and spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Top 200 Album chart. The first single released, "[[Lost in Your Eyes]]", was No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] for three weeks, garnering her another achievement as the first female to have both an album and single simultaneously at No. 1. (She shared the 1989 [[ASCAP]] Songwriter of the Year Award with [[Bruce Springsteen]].) Subsequent singles from the album were "Electric Youth" (No. 11), "No More Rhyme" (No. 17), and "We Could Be Together" (No. 71). The ''Electric Youth'' album was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. The successful ''Electric Youth'' world tour and ''Live Around the World'' VHS (2x platinum) followed. In 1988, Debbie sang "Don't Flirt with Me".

===Style and influence===
In tandem with the second album, she created a perfume called [[Electric Youth (fragrance)|Electric Youth]] that was distributed by [[Revlon]], and other makeup essentials for young girls that were distributed nationwide through Natural Wonder Cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/business/what-s-new-fragrances-signing-up-celebrity-promoters-give-perfumes-star-appealz.html |title= What's New In Fragrances – Signing Up Celebrity Promoters to Give Perfume Star Appealz|publisher= New York Times|accessdate= August 7, 2010|author= Debora Toth|date= September 24, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie's trademark was her hats, usually a black pork pie style. She also made popular wearing tight, rolled-up jeans, vests over a T-shirt, friendship bracelets and two [[Swatch]] watches as on the back cover of her popular ''[[Electric Youth (album)|Electric Youth]]'' album and in her "[[Staying Together (song)|Staying Together]]" music video. Her influences were Madonna and Olivia Newton-John, though she has often stated she admires Elton John and Billy Joel as favorite artists and was asked and did sing and perform live with Billy Joel and John at Elton John's Madison Square Garden show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19900224&amp;id=fc80AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VDIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4027,6837879|title=Lodi News-Sentinel – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared on the covers of numerous [[teen magazine]]s such as ''[[Tiger Beat]]''.

===1990–1998===
She recorded two more albums for [[Atlantic Records]]: ''[[Anything Is Possible (Debbie Gibson album)|Anything Is Possible]]'' (1990) and ''[[Body, Mind, Soul|Body Mind Soul]]'' (1993). "[[Anything Is Possible (Debbie Gibson album)|Anything Is Possible]]", co-written with [[Motown]] mainstay [[Lamont Dozier]], peaked at No. 26 on ''Billboard'''s Hot 100 in 1991. Subsequent singles from ''[[Anything Is Possible (Debbie Gibson album)|Anything Is Possible]]'' failed to chart on the Hot 100, although "[[One Step Ahead (Debbie Gibson song)|One Step Ahead]]" scored on the Hot Maxi Singles and Hot Dance charts, peaking at No. 21 and No. 18 respectively. ''[[Body, Mind, Soul|Body Mind Soul]]'' spawned another minor hit in "[[Losin' Myself]]", which was accompanied by a controversial video clip, which [[Matthew Rolston]] directed, that featured Gibson as a stripper. The second single from the album, "[[Shock Your Mama]]", became a minor hit in Europe and the UK, however "Losin' Myself" was Debbie Gibson's last appearance on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

[[File:Debbie Gibson 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gibson on the set of the video for "No More Rhyme"]]
During this time, Gibson was part of the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] that recorded the charity single "[[Voices That Care]]" which peaked at No. 11 on the Hot 100 chart.

In 1995, she signed with EMI's [[SBK Records]] division and recorded her only album for the label, ''[[Think With Your Heart]].'' It was an [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]]-heavy album consisting of piano and keyboard ballads recorded predominantly with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The album's producer, [[Niko Bolas]], who was usually [[Neil Young]]'s co-producer, was producing the reunion album for veteran punk band [[Circle Jerks]], and invited Gibson to a recording session for that band's album. She sang background vocals on the song "I Wanna Destroy You", as well as appearing at and participating in the Circle Jerks' performance at punk venue [[CBGB]], wearing one of the band's T-shirts and sharing a microphone with frontman [[Keith Morris]].

In 1998, she sang the song, "I Do", which is featured on the soundtrack to the film, ''[[The Naked Man (film)|The Naked Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olson|first1=Olson, Catherine Applelfeld|title=Soundtrack and Film Score News|agency=Billboard|issue=Vol. 110, No. 35|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=Aug 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics to the song were composed by the co-writer of the film, [[Coen brothers|Ethan Coen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olson|first1=Catherine Applefeld|title=Soundtrack and Film Score News|agency=Billboard|issue=Vol. 110, No. 35|publisher=Nielson Business Media|date=Aug 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack has never been released.

===Independent releases===
After parting company with EMI, Gibson formed her own record label, Espiritu, to release her original material. Her sixth album, ''[[Deborah (Deborah Gibson album)|Deborah]]'' (1996), marked her full return to pop. ''Deborah'' includes the lead single "Only Words". "Only Words" (Dance Edit) became a Top 40 [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] hit. The album's other single was the ballad, "Naturally". Though it only sold 20,000 in the US, ''[[Deborah (Deborah Gibson album)|Deborah]]'' remains well-respected. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2001, she released her seventh album on her new record label, Golden Egg, titled ''[[M.Y.O.B. (album)|M.Y.O.B.]]''---i.e. Mind Your Own Business. It featured three singles: the sensual pop song "What You Want", the Latin-infused [[Dance-pop]] song "Your Secret", and the bass heavy "M.Y.O.B." Highlights from the album include the sultry Latin-flavored smooth jazz song "In Blue", a vintage style ballad "Wishing You Were Here", "Jaded", and a remix of "M.Y.O.B." with the background vocals of her two nieces.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 2005, Gibson co-wrote and recorded a song titled "Someone You Love" with the O'Neill Brothers. With the O'Neill Brothers, she released an updated, acoustic version of her number-one hit "Lost in Your Eyes". There was an Emmy-nominated PBS special in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20081113/SHE04/811130429/1097] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227155222/http://www.sheboyganpress.com/article/20081113/SHE04/811130429/1097 |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pianobrothers.com/news/EmmyAward.asp|title=Piano Music Wedding Music Holiday Music Piano Wedding Music|publisher=|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a resurgence of popularity in niche markets. Her single "Your Secret" came back from its dormant state and became popular on some radio stations including Super 91.7 WMPH in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. "Your Secret" has been on their request show, ''Total Control Radio'', for 12 months; it reached No. 1 on its third week on that station's chart in May 2006. It charted along with a few of her other singles, "M.Y.O.B." and "Only Words" (Dance Edit), the Eurodance mix. They all have become recurrent hits on WMPH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmph.org/Shows/TotalControlRadio/index.aspx Total Control Radio schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513164341/http://www.wmph.org/Shows/TotalControlRadio/index.aspx |date=May 13, 2008 }} from WMPH's website&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005–2009===
The March 2005 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' featured a nude pictorial of Gibson, coinciding with the release of her single, "Naked". She has said that the magazine had asked her five times to pose for them since she turned 18.&lt;ref name=MalayStar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/13/music/20899468&amp;sec=music |title=Down-to-earth Deborah |publisher=[[Malaysia Star]] |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |author=Tiffany Fumiko Tay |date=April 13, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030050046/http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F4%2F13%2Fmusic%2F20899468&amp;sec=music |archivedate=October 30, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She agreed to pose in an effort to revamp her image, describing how one casting call called her agent, not realizing that Gibson had long since outgrown her teenage image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,148164,00.html |title=Deborah Gibson Poses Nude, Talks to FOX|publisher= [[Fox News]]|accessdate= August 7, 2010|date= February 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single peaked at No. 35 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Single Sales chart in March 2005.&lt;ref name=Tube&gt;{{cite web|last=Tubelyrics.org|title=Debbie Gibson|url=http://www.tubelyrics.org/artist_debbie_gibson-about-2068.html|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, it was announced that Debbie would go on tour with The O'Neill Brothers for "Someone You Love Tour" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-C03kHl7NU |title="Someone You Love" Exclusive Debut KARE Channel 11 (NBC) |publisher=YouTube |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006. "Lost in Your Eyes" was revamped with an acoustic sound and a song "Someone You Love" was written and performed by Debbie and The O'Neill Brothers. These two songs also appeared on The O'Neill Brothers album ''Someone You Love''.

The 2006 single, "Say Goodbye", featuring dance-pop artist [[Jordan Knight]], made an impression in the [[Soft AC]] and [[Hot AC]] radio formats, becoming the third-most added single during summer, 2006. It debuted at No. 35 on the Hot Contemporary chart, peaking at No. 24 in early September.&lt;ref name=WN&gt;{{cite web|last=WN.com|title=Electric Youth Debbie Gibson|url=http://wn.com/Electric_Youth__Debbie_Gibson|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Gibson appeared in the independent film ''[[Coffee Date]]'' with [[Wilson Cruz]] and [[Jonathan Silverman]] and provided a soundtrack song called "Sounds Like Love".

On November 14, 2006, Gibson released the song "Famous" on her official website. The song was written by Gibson and Tiziano Lugli, and was produced by Lugli.

In May 2007, the world premiere of ''Electric Youth: The Musical'' was unveiled at The Starlight Theatre in Orlando, Florida. The musical featured 14 of Gibson's songs and was directed by Dean Parker.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricyouthmusical.com/ |title=Electricyouthmusical.com |publisher=Electricyouthmusical.com |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529152123/http://electricyouthmusical.com/ |archivedate=May 29, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 2007, Gibson and [[Frankie Avalon]] hosted ''Time Life Presents Dick Clark's American Bandstand 50th Anniversary Collection''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timelife.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=1001&amp;langId=-1&amp;top_category=90000&amp;productId=10506|title=Classic Music Hits from the '50s through Today - Time Life|website=www.timelife.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Debbie Gibson LA Pride 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Debbie Gibson at LA Pride 2007]]
In September 2007, Gibson considered creating a camp on the West Coast. She is the founder and creator of Camp Electric Youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deborahgibsonselectricyouth.com/ |title=Deborah Gibson's Electric Youth |publisher=Deborahgibsonselectricyouth.com |date= |accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a children's summer day camp which ran from July 7–18, 2008. It claims to be the first camp of its kind in the Los Angeles area. The camp was reportedly attended by "over 120 talented singers, actors and dancers" from around the world.

Gibson was a judge for the online talent competition, Total Pop Star,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpopstar.com/|title=Totalpopstar.com|website=www.totalpopstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Andrew Van Slee]] (producer and judge), and Joey Lawrence (from ''Blossom'').

And, unfortunately, 90 percent of the entertainment community can relate. I remember being on the road at, like, 25, touring with theater and doing my own cocktail of [[Tylenol PM]] and [[Xanax]]. It's like, "Oh, I found a way to make the Xanax last longer with the Tylenol PM. I mean, it's as simple as that, and that is how performers get in so much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extratv.com/2016/05/13/debbie-gibson-comes-clean-about-her-own-drug-past-says-she-can-relate-to-prince/|title=Debbie Gibson Comes Clean About Her Own Drug Past, Says She Can Relate to Prince|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Dennis Liotta''' is a [[Chemistry]] professor at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], [[United States]].

Liotta's fields of research are [[organic synthesis]] and [[medicinal chemistry]]. Along with Dr. [[Raymond F. Schinazi]] and Dr. Woo-Baeg Choi of Emory, he invented [[Emtricitabine]], which is a breakthrough [[HIV]] drug. [[Emory University]] sold its royalties on the drug to Royalty Pharma and [[Gilead Sciences]] in July 2005 for [[USD|$]]525 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emory.edu/news/Releases/emtri/|title=GILEAD SCIENCES AND ROYALTY PHARMA ANNOUNCE $525 MILLION AGREEMENT WITH EMORY UNIVERSITY TO PURCHASE ROYALTY INTEREST FOR EMTRICITABINE|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is currently marketed under the name [[Emtriva]]. Emtriva is a component of a number of combination therapies used to treat HIV, including Truvada, Atripla, Complera, Stribild, Genvoya, Odefesey, Biktarvy and Descovy. Truvada is the only combination therapy approved for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Liotta, Choi and Schinazi also co-invented Epivir (lamivudine), which is a component of multiple combination therapies such as Combivir, Trizivir, Epzicom, Triumeq, Dutrebis and Destrigo. It is estimated that &gt;90% of HIV infected patients in the US take or have taken drug combinations that include either Emtriva or Epivir. In addition, he was a one of the inventors of Epivir-HBV, the first drug approved to treat hepatitis B infections.

Liotta has also co-invented other clinical agents for treating HIV (elvucitabine) and hot flashes in post-menopausal women and women with breast cancer (Q-122) as well as a CDK4 inhibitor for treating various cancers (CT7001). He is one of the founders of Pharmasset, Inc., which developed the breakthrough anti-hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).

Liotta obtained his PhD. degree at [[City University of New York]] and carried out [[postdoctoral research]] at [[Ohio State University]], after which he joined the Emory faculty in 1976. He was promoted to full professor in 1988 and currently holds the Samuel Candler Dobbs professorship at Emory. To date, he has supervised over 150 graduate and post-graduate students. In 2011 he was honored with the Thomas Jefferson Award, Emory University’s highest service award. He is also the director of the Emory Institute for Drug Development and co-founder of DRIVE (Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory). Earlier he served as the chair of the chemistry department and as Emory's Vice President for Research. Liotta has published approximately 290 peer-reviewed research publications and holds 89 issued US patents as of December 2018. Currently, he is the founding Editor-In-Chief of the American Chemical Society journal, ''ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters''. He has been the recipient of many distinguished awards, such as the Alfred Burger Award in Medicinal Chemistry, the Wallace H. Carothers Award, the American Chemical Society-Bristol Myers Squibb Smissman Award and the Herty Medal. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the National Academy of Inventors and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering.

Liotta has been involved in outreach efforts in Africa for over twenty years and co-founded AHIA (Advancing Health Innovations in Africa), which is aimed at providing the next generation of African scientists with the business and legal skills needed to address their own healthcare issues.

'''Doink the Clown''' is a [[professional wrestling]] character who first appeared in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1992. He is a [[clown]] (or [[evil clown]]) wearing traditional clown makeup (or a mask decorated to resemble such) and brightly colored clothes. Originally portrayed by [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] [[Matt Osborne]], Doink has since been portrayed by many other wrestlers both in the WWF (now [[WWE]]) and on the [[independent circuit]].&lt;ref name=WWEBio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/doink|title=Doink the Clown|publisher=[[WWE]]|website=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==

===World Wrestling Federation===
[[File:Doinktheclown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Original Doink]]
[[File:JarrettvsDoink.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Doink wrestling [[Jeff Jarrett]] in 1994]]
Former WWE producer [[Bruce Prichard]] said in an interview on ''The Steve Austin Show'' that [[Road Warrior Hawk|Michael Hegstrand]] had originally conceived the idea of a miserable clown character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://podcastone.com/Steve-Austin-Show ''The Steve Austin Show'', Episode 60]&lt;/ref&gt;

After making appearances in late 1992 in the crowd and at ringside, playing tricks on the fans and wrestlers, the Doink character made his in-ring debut in the WWF in 1993, originally wrestling as a technically sound [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]. Doink played cruel jokes on both fans and wrestlers in order to amuse himself and put them off guard.&lt;ref name=WWEBio/&gt; Some of his villainous pranks included tripping [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] with a tripwire, dumping water on [[Marty Jannetty]] and attacking [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] with a loaded prosthetic arm. He clashed with Crush at [[WrestleMania IX]], a match which he won after the appearance of an identical Doink (played by [[Steve Keirn]]) from underneath the ring. Doink also wrestled [[Randy Savage]] on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', and substituted for [[Jerry Lawler]], who faked an injury, against [[Bret Hart]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]] in 1993.

Doink then [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] on Lawler on the September 4 episode of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in Lawler's The King's Court segment, making [[Burger King]] jokes to amuse the crowd and eventually emptied a bucket of water over Lawler. [[Matt Osborne]], the original man behind Doink, was fired for re-occurring drug abuses, eventually leaving the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] (after bouncing through a few others) to Ray Licameli (also known as Ray Apollo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/school-hard-knocks-daily-news-reporter-serious-education-learning-professional-wrestling-ropes-article-1.741017 |publisher=New York Daily News |last=Rubin |first=Roger |title=School of Hard Knocks: A Daily News Reporter Gets a Serious Education Learning the Professional Wrestling Ropes |date=1996-07-07 |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newjerseyhills.com/professional-wrestler-licameli-enjoys-life-as-doink-the-clown/article_9c3b1f1b-d4f6-5108-854f-0a3a3c1b0aac.html |title=Professional wrestler Licameli enjoys life as Doink the Clown |publisher=New Jersey Hills Media Group |date=2001-11-15 |accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now as a fan favorite and with a new [[midget]] sidekick [[Claude Giroux (wrestler)|Dink]], Doink was more of a [[comic relief]] character, but continued to pull pranks on other wrestlers (albeit more harmless and silly than outright cruel), mostly on heels like Lawler and [[Bobby Heenan]]. Doink and Dink also battled with [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[Luna Vachon]] in a feud that culminated at [[WrestleMania X]]. Doink would later encounter Jerry Lawler again in a match at [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]]. In this match, Doink and Dink teamed with Wink and Pink to meet Lawler's dwarf team of 'little kings' Queazy, Cheezy, and Sleazy. Eventually, Doink became a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], regularly losing to wrestlers like [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]], [[Dan Spivey|Waylon Mercy]] and, in his final televised match in September 1995, to [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/95.htm 1995 WWF results, from ''The History of WWE'']&lt;/ref&gt; Doink reemerged one last time in 1997 at the [[Slammy Awards]] and was attacked by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], amidst crowd chants of "kill the clown".&lt;ref name=WWEBio/&gt;

===Midwest Territorial Wrestling ===
Doink (Matt Osborne) also had a few matches in 1994 in southeast Michigan.  He faced off against [[Bastion Booger]] on July 14, 1994, in Port Huron, Michigan. He also wrestled alongside some other now known names such as [[Al Snow]] and [[Terry Funk]] when wrestling for MTW.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling===

Following his departure from the WWF, Osborne appeared (as Matt Borne) in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) for several matches as Doink in a blue and green clown suit, setting up an angle where ECW champion [[Shane Douglas]] criticized Vince McMahon for turning a talented wrestler like Borne into a comic relief character, and claimed that he knew how to bring out Borne's full potential. Borne then made a few appearances with Douglas as "himself", sporting his face half-painted with the Doink makeup. His attitude insinuated that he had developed [[borderline personality disorder]] from having been forced to wrestle as a clown; after winning matches he would dress his opponent in clown accessories to humiliate them. His ring name under this gimmick was "Borne Again".

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
Since 1997, Doink has appeared sporadically in WWE. Ray Apollo returned to play him in the Gimmick Battle Royal at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=642&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7&amp;liga=3&amp;jahr=2001 Matt Osbone's 2001 WWF match, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2007, Doink played by [[Matt Borne]] participated in a battle royal of 15 WWE alumni for the ''Raw'' 15th anniversary special episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=bios&amp;wrestler=642&amp;bild=1&amp;details=7&amp;liga=3&amp;jahr=2007 Matt Osborne's 2007 WWE match, from WrestlingData.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Played by [[Nick Dinsmore]], he showed up in the A.P.A. Bar Room Brawl at [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/vengeance.htm "WWF/E Vengeance results, from TheHistoryOfWWWE.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected by Rhino to face [[Chris Benoit]] on the July 31, 2003 ''[[Smackdown!]]''.&lt;ref name=oww/&gt;

Played by [[Steve Lombardi]], he wrestled [[Rob Conway]] on an October 2005 episode of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/brooklyn-brawler.html|title=Brooklyn Brawler's OWW Profile|publisher=OWW|author=Brad Dykens|accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2007, Doink, [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] and [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] defeated [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]], [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]] and [[Kevin Fertig|Kevin Thorn]] on the 34th edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIV|Saturday Night's Main Event]]''.  On the July 12, 2010 ''Raw'', Doink teamed with [[William Regal]], [[Primo Colón|Primo]] and [[Zack Ryder]] to lose to [[Santino Marella]], [[Goldust]], [[Vladimir Kozlov]] and [[The Great Khali]], when he was pinned by Khali. On the July 2, 2012 ''Raw'', he made a surprise return and lost to [[Heath Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/pruetteditorials/article10026035.shtml|title=Pruett's Pause: WWE Raw SuperShow - A.J.

===Independent circuit===
In early 2010, Osborne reinvented the Doink character to resemble [[Heath Ledger]]'s portrayal of the [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]] in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', nicknaming the incarnation 'Reborne Again'.&lt;ref name=rebourne&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2010/04/10/13537671.html|title=Doink the Clown 'Reborne Again'|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM!

This caused them to lose the Wrecking Ball Wrestling tag titles. In retaliation Akbar called on the original Doink [[Matt Osborne|Matt Borne]]. Wolfe and Borne were scheduled to meet on August 15,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/newswire/8341-wrecking-ball-wrestling-results-from-523-in-dallas-tx-featuring-skandar-akbar.html|title=Wrecking Ball Wrestling results from 5/23 featuring Skandar Akbar|author=Martin, William|publisher=Indy Wrestling News|accessdate=2010-04-13|date=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe would later no show the event.

On March 23, 2012, he announced his retirement from refereeing  due to disagreements with the Spanish Technical Committee, although it was already time for him to retire at the end of the 2011–12 season. His last game was Real Betis vs Real Madrid (2–3) on March 10, 2012. He could not finish this game due to a muscle injury, being substituted by the fourth referee, Gorka Sagués Oscoz, during half time.

'''Edwin Carewe''' (March 3, 1883 – January 22, 1940) was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] motion picture director, actor, producer, and screenwriter. His birth name was Jay John Fox; he was born in [[Gainesville, Texas]]. His father, Frank Fox, was white; his mother Sallie (Priddy) Fox was [[Chickasaw]]. Edwin and his two brothers, F. Finis and Wallace Carewe were enrolled members of the [[Chickasaw Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native American Data for Jay J Fox|url=http://userdb.rootsweb.ancestry.com/nativeamerican/cgi-bin/search.cgi?main_id=150567&amp;database=Native%20American%20Data&amp;return_to=http://userdb.rootsweb.ancestry.com/nativeamerican/&amp;submitter_id=|website=RootsWeb|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was likely the most prolific of Native American directors of feature films in Hollywood history.

==Career==
After brief studies at the Universities of [[Texas]] and [[Missouri]] and a period of work with regional theatrical groups, Carewe moved to [[New York City]] in 1910, where he became a member of the Dearborn Stock Company. Although Jay Fox was his given name, Carewe chose Edwin (from stage actor [[Edwin Booth]]) and Carewe from a character he was playing.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', January 23, 1940, p. 21; ''Variety'' January 24, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carewe was on stage as an actor before he worked for [[Lubin]] studios. Later, he directed films for [[MGM]], [[First National Pictures|First National]], [[Universal Studios]], [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[United Artists]]. During his career, he provided early screen exposure to many actors such as [[Dolores del Río]], [[Warner Baxter]], [[Francis X. Bushman]] and [[Gary Cooper]]. He directed 58 films including the acclaimed 1928 version of ''[[Ramona (1928 film)|Ramona]]'' starring [[Dolores del Río]] and [[Warner Baxter]], which was rediscovered and restored by the [[Library of Congress]] and had its world premiere at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 2014.

Carewe and his two brothers, Wallace Fox (a director/producer) and Finis Fox (a scenario writer), were all registered Chickasaw according to the 1907 [[Chickasaw]] Rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/27/recovered-and-restored-ramona-silent-movie-chickasaw-filmmaker-154207?page=0%2C1 |title=Recovered and Restored: ''Ramona'', Silent Movie by Chickasaw Filmmaker |first1=Angela |last1=Aleiss |work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Carewe's notable films was ''[[Evangeline (1929 film)|Evangeline]]'' in 1929 also with [[Dolores del Río]] and written by his brother Finis Fox. ''Evangeline'' was based upon the [[Evangeline|poem]] by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] and earned praise for its exceptional lighting and camera work.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 20, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Carewe directed and produced a number of critically and financially successful pictures during the silent era, he was not fully able to make the transition to sound. After resorting to sound remakes of his earlier successes, and later to low-budget and religious films, he made his last feature ''[[Are We Civilized?]]'' in 1934. 

Carewe was married three times, twice to actress Mary Akin.  By his first wife, Mary Jane Croft (married 9 January 1909 in Toronto, Ontario)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9Q97-Y399-9PM4?i=33&amp;cc=1784216|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, he had two daughters, [[Rita Carewe|Violette]] and Mary Jane.  During his first marriage to his second wife, Mary Akin, he had two children, Sally Ann and William (born Edwin Gilbert).  During his second marriage to Mary Akin, they had one more child, Carol Lee.

==Death==
Carewe died from a [[cardiovascular disease|heart ailment]] in his Hollywood apartment, and is buried at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]].

'''Elfriede Blauensteiner''' (22 January 1931 – 18 November 2003), dubbed the "Black Widow",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Austrian 'Black Widow' may face another trial for murder | date=1998-01-24 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/50291.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Austria]]n [[serial killer]] who murdered at least three victims by [[poison]]. In each case, she inherited the victim's possessions.

== Crimes ==

On 7 March 1997, Blauensteiner was found guilty of murdering 77-year-old Alois Pichler and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Her former lawyer Harald Schmidt was jailed for seven years for being an accomplice to grievous bodily harm and for forging the will of Alois Pichler. She was a gambling addict and it is believed that she would deliberately date rich elderly men and poison them before gambling away the money which had been left to her in their fabricated wills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/black-widow-gets-life-term-1271641.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, she was found guilty of murdering her 64-year-old husband Friedrick Doecker and 84-year-old female neighbour Franziska Koeberl.

Sergeant '''François Bertrand''' (1823 – 1878), known as the '''Vampire of Montparnasse''', was a sergeant in the [[French Army]]. He was arrested in 1841 for [[necrophilia]] and jailed for one year. In 1856, he moved to [[Le Havre]]. In his later life, he worked as clerk, mailman, and lighthouse keeper. He died on 25 February 1878.&lt;ref name="immateriel1"/&gt;

==Biography==

According to his birth certificate, Bertrand was born on 29 October 1823 in [[Voisey, Haute-Marne]].&lt;ref name="immateriel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://librairie.immateriel.fr/fr/read_book/9791092100082/Section0004 |title=Lire en ligne le Saccage de la Chair - 4. Le sexe comme objet de savoir (Prévisualisation) - immatériel·fr |publisher=Librairie.immateriel.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertrand began dissecting dead cats and dogs early in life. He stated that his necrophilic impulses began in 1846, and were accompanied by headaches and heart palpitations. He progressed to exhuming the corpses of both women and men from graveyards, whereupon he would eviscerate and dismember them before masturbating. Bertrand would later describe his experience with the corpse of a 16-year-old girl:&lt;ref name=Psychology&gt;{{cite book|title=Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects|pages=12-13|first=Anil|last=Aggrawal|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=9781420089134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I covered it with kisses and pressed it wildly to my heart. All that one could enjoy with a living woman is nothing in comparison with the pleasure I experienced. After I had enjoyed it for about a quarter of an hour, I cut the body up, as usual, and tore out the entrails. Then I buried the cadaver again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Between summer 1848 and March 1849, a series of bodies were exhumed and found severely mutilated in cemeteries of [[Paris]].&lt;!-- uncited --&gt; On 15 March 1849 Bertrand admitted himself to the [[Val-de-Grâce]] with gunshot wounds. A gravedigger at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]] overheard the news about Bertrand's injury, and realized that he must be the same person hit by his colleague's [[booby trap]].&lt;ref name="goodwin" /&gt; (A different source states that Bertrand was wounded by a police bullet at the cemetery.&lt;ref name="Psychology" /&gt;) One of Bertrand's surgeons obtained a full confession. Bertrand was arrested and sentenced to one year in jail.&lt;ref name="Psychology" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Bertrand's case prompted [[Joseph Guislain]] to coin the term 'necrophilia'.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt;&lt;ref name="goodwin"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Robin|last1=Goodwin|first2=Duncan|last2=Cramer|title=Inappropriate Relationships: The Unconventional, the Disapproved, and the Forbidden|publisher=Psychology Press|location=London, England|date=2002|ISBN= 978-0805837421|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also discussed extensively by other early theorists of necrophilia, including [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and [[Havelock Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=B.R.|last=Burg | date = 1982 | title = The sick and the dead: The development of psychological theory on necrophilia from Krafft‐Ebing to the present | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|location=London, England| volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 242–254 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198207)18:3&lt;242::aid-jhbs2300180305&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:An die Unsterbliche Geliebte 01.png|right|thumb|[[Facsimile]] of the first page of the letter addressed to "Immortal Beloved".]]

The '''Immortal Beloved''' (German "'''Unsterbliche Geliebte'''") is the mysterious addressee&lt;ref&gt;There was no address on the letter, and no envelope was found (thus suggesting it was probably never sent). The letter was addressed to "My Angel...", but as the term "Immortal Beloved" (appearing only once towards the end of the letter) was unique in Beethoven's vocabulary, it has been used ever since.&lt;/ref&gt; of a love letter which composer [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] wrote on 6–7 July 1812 in [[Teplitz]]. The entire letter is written on 10 small pages, in Beethoven's rather inconsistent handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;For a facsimile, see Brandenburg (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a transcription of the German original, an English translation and helpful historical context, see Brandenburg (2001). The letter was also published by Brandenburg (1996), Letter #582, and Goldschmidt (1980), pp. 21-23; facsimile p. 240 f. An early English translation, with several errors, was offered by Anderson (1961), Letter #373; a much better translation is in Beahrs (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The apparently unsent letter was found in the composer's estate after his death, after which it remained in the hands of [[Anton Schindler]] until his death, was subsequently willed to his sister, and was sold by her in 1880 to the [[Berlin State Library]], where it remains today.&lt;ref&gt;The letter's signature is "Mus. ep. autogr. Beethoven 127."&lt;/ref&gt; The letter is written in pencil and consists of three parts.

Since Beethoven did not specify a year, or a location, an exact dating of the letter and identification of the addressee was speculative until the 1950s, when an analysis of the paper's [[watermark]] yielded the year, and by extension the place. Scholars have since this time been divided on the intended recipient of the Immortal Beloved letter. The two candidates favored by most contemporary scholars are [[Antonie Brentano]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]] (1972, 1998), supported by Cooper (2000, 2008), Kopitz (2001) and Lockwood (2003), contested by Goldschmidt (1980), Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1993/1994, 1998), Beahrs (1972, 1986, 1988, 1993), Dahlhaus (1991), Pichler (1994), Altman (1996), Meredith (2000), [[Rita Steblin|Steblin]] (2007), and Walden (2011); numerous refutations in ''The Beethoven Journal'' 16/1 (Summer 2001), pp. 42-50.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephine Brunsvik]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Marie Lipsius|La Mara]] (1920); Kaznelson (1954); Riezler (1962); Massin (1955, 1970); Goldschmidt (1980); Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1999); Beahrs (1986, 1988, 1993); Dahlhaus (1991); Pichler (1994); Noering (1995); Steblin (2002, 2007, 2009a).&lt;/ref&gt; Other candidates who have been conjectured, with various degrees of mainstream scholarly support, are [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie ("Giulietta") Guicciardi]],&lt;ref&gt;Schindler (1840). Her first name was in fact "Julie", as she was always called (Steblin 2009); in Beethoven's dedication of his [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 14]] ([[Piano Sonatas Nos. 13 and 14 (Beethoven)|Op. 27]], No. 2), which was written in Italian, he referred to her as "Giulietta". For some reason this name has stuck ever since (one of many myths about her, like her incorrect age and wedding date, see Steblin 2009, p. 145).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teréz Brunszvik|Therese Brunsvik]],&lt;ref&gt;Thayer (rev. Forbes, 1967), Thomas-San-Galli (1909, 1910), La Mara (1920), Rolland (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; {{ill|Amalie Sebald|de}},&lt;ref&gt;Thomas-San-Galli (1909, 1910); see: Goldschmidt (1977), pp. 182-185, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothea von Ertmann]],&lt;ref&gt;Marek (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Therese Malfatti]],&lt;ref&gt;Tenger (1890), La Mara (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; {{ill|Marie von Erdödy|de|Marie von Erdődy}},&lt;ref&gt;Steichen (1959), Altman (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bettina von Arnim]],&lt;ref&gt;Walden (2002, 2011). According to Varnhagen’s diary, 15 February 1856: "Bettina ... claims Beethoven had been in love with her and wanted to marry her! ... Nothing but bubbles and dreams! (''Schaum und Traum'')" (Tellenbach 1983, p. 101). Being happily married to [[Achim von Arnim]] since 1811, she is usually considered one of the less likely candidates for the title of "Immortal Beloved".&lt;/ref&gt; and several others.&lt;ref&gt;The [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Immortal Beloved (1994 film)|Immortal Beloved]]'', written by Bernard Rose, has a fictional plot centered on the mystery of who the letter was addressed to, ultimately declaring Beethoven's lover to be his sister-in-law [[Johanna van Beethoven]]. The story follows Beethoven's secretary and first biographer [[Anton Schindler]] ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]) as he attempts to ascertain the true identity of the ''Unsterbliche Geliebte'' (Immortal Beloved). Schindler journeys throughout the [[Austrian Empire]] interviewing women who might be potential candidates as well as examining Beethoven's own tumultuous life. In the final scenes of the film, after Schindler is unsuccessful at discovering the truth, it is revealed that Johanna van Beethoven, Beethoven's hated sister-in-law, was supposedly the Immortal Beloved, and that Karl was their love child. (This, of course, is pure speculation.) See also Lockwood (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text analysis==
After Schmidt-Görg (1957) published 13 then-unknown love letters by Beethoven to [[Josephine Brunsvik]], it became clear that the one to the "Immortal Beloved" was not the only love letter authored by him. That Josephine could have been the unknown woman was subsequently suggested by analyses of similarities in wordings and phrases between earlier letters (from 1804 to 1809) and this mysterious one from 1812, mainly in the monographs by Massin (1955, 1970), Goldschmidt (1980) and Tellenbach (1983, p.&amp;nbsp;103 f.):&lt;ref&gt;Letters in the following quoted from Brandenburg (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

*''My angel'' (used again towards the end of this letter): see "farewell angel – of my heart – of my life." (#219, April 1805) – this also uses the intimate German "Du" ("Leb wohl Engel"); "farewell angel of my heart" (#220, April/May 1805).
*''My everything'', ''you - you - my life – my everything'': see "'''you''' – you - my everything, my happiness ... my solace – my everything" (#214, 1st quarter 1805); "dear J. everything – everything for you" (#297, after 20 September 1807).
*''Esterhazy'': This Hungarian Prince was well-known to the Hungarian Brunsviks.
*''remain my faithful only'', ''your faithful ludwig'', ''since you know my faithfulness to you, never can another own my heart, never – never'', ''never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved L.'', ''forever thine, forever mine, forever us'': see "Long – Long – may our love last – it is so noble – so much founded on mutual respect and friendship – even great similarity in so many things, in thoughts and feelings – oh let me hope that your heart – will continue to beat for me for a long time – mine can only – stop – to beat for you – if – it does not beat any more – beloved J" (#216, March/April 1805); "your faithful Bethwn" (#279, May 1807); "your faithful Bthwn, eternally devoted to you" (#294, 20 September 1807). Clearly refers to a pre-existing long-term relationship.
*''You are suffering you my dearest ... you are suffering - Oh, wherever I am, you are with me'': Josephine was not only frequently ill, but especially desperate around that time because her husband had left her.
*''but – but never hide yourself from me'': During 1807, Josephine began to withdraw from Beethoven due to family pressure; she was not home when Beethoven came to see her (see #294 and #307).
*''I must go to bed &lt;o go with me go with me –&gt;'': the heavily crossed-out words are probably the strongest indication that their love had been consummated (and may explain the birth of Minona, Josephine’s seventh child, exactly nine months later).

==The period of speculation (1827 to 1969)==
In his biography of Beethoven, Schindler (1840) named Julie ("Giulietta") Guicciardi as the "Immortal Beloved".&lt;ref&gt;Beethoven was briefly infatuated with her in 1801-2 (when she was his piano pupil, and dedicated his renowned "Moonlight" Sonata [in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2] to her), but was aware that without a title of nobility he couldn't hope to marry a countess (see Steblin 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But research by Tellenbach (1983) indicated that her cousin Franz von Brunsvik may have suggested Giulietta to Schindler, to distract any suspicion away from his sister [[Josephine Brunsvik]], with whom Beethoven had been hopelessly in love from 1799 to ca. 1809/1810.&lt;ref&gt;"… da Giulietta ihre Affären nicht verheimlichte…" [… since Giulietta did not cover up her affairs…] (Tellenbach 1983, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ida Marie Lipsius|La Mara]] (1909) published [[Teréz Brunszvik]]'s memoirs, which show her full of admiration and adoration of Beethoven. This, together with interviews of some of the Brunsvik descendants, led her to the conclusion that Therese must have been the "Immortal Beloved."&lt;ref&gt;La Mara (1909) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first most researchers, including [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]],&lt;ref&gt;(rev. Forbes, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; also thought Therese was the "Immortal Beloved". Thayer thought the letter must have been written around 1806-07. Thomas-San-Galli (1909, 1910) checked out the official listings of guests in [[Bohemia]], and at first (in 1909) concluded that Amalie Sebald was the "Immortal Beloved". Sebald was definitely not in [[Prague]] at the beginning of July 1812, and Cooper (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;416) consequently ruled her out as a candidate. Thomas-San-Galli then speculated (in 1910) that it might instead have been Teréz Brunszvik, who he thought could have (secretly) traveled to Prague.

Doubts were raised by de Hevesy (1910), who ruled out Teréz Brunszvik,&lt;ref&gt;(the "Louis" mentioned by Therese in her diary was in fact Count Louis Migazzi)&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Max Unger (musicologist)|Unger]] (1910) against Amalie Sebald.&lt;ref&gt;"The tone of the notes to Amalie Sebald in September, 1812, is incompatible with that of the letter to the 'Immortal Beloved'." (Forbes 1967, p. 1090)&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the older literature can be found in [[Elliot Forbes|Forbes]] (1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;1088–1092).

There was also a forged Beethoven letter by [[Paul Bekker]] in ''Die Musik'',&lt;ref&gt;reprinted in Goldschmidt (1980). This forgery fooled many scholars at the time: "The editors of 'Die Musik' submitted this Beethoven manuscript to many well-known experts, all of whom independently declared it to be genuine." [Die Redaktion der "Musik" legte dieses Beethoven-Manuskript vielen bekannten Fachleuten vor, welche alle unabhängig voneinander das Stück für echt erklärten.] (Goldschmidt 1980). Not enough: "Bekker made it then public that his Beethoven letter was a forgery. [But] many Beethoven scholars did not want to believe this, and in many newspapers and journals ... expressed their conviction that this was undoubtedly a valuable genuine document." [... veröffentlichte Bekker, der von ihm publizierte Beethoven-Brief sei eine Fälschung. Viele Beethoven-Forscher wollten dies aber nicht glauben und gaben in Tages- und Fachzeitschriften ihrer Überzeugung Ausdruck, daß es sich zweifellos um ein wertvolles echtes Stück handelt.] (Goldschmidt 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; But it was already shown to be a hoax by Newman (1911) –- a last-ditch effort to salvage the discredited Guicciardi hypothesis.

The date of the "Immortal Beloved" letter –- 6/7 July 1812 -– has meanwhile been firmly established, not only by watermarks and references,&lt;ref&gt;(Beethoven’s mention in the letter of Prince Esterházy's presence at Teplitz confirms that the year must have been 1812) (Goldschmidt 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; but also by a later letter by Beethoven to [[Rahel Varnhagen]], which suggests he must have met his "Immortal Beloved" on 3 July 1812: "I am sorry, dear V., that I could not spend the last evening in Prague with you, and I myself found it impolite, but a circumstance I could not foresee prevented me."&lt;ref&gt;"… es war mir leid, lieber V. den letzten Abend in Prag nicht mit ihnen zubringen zu können, und ich fand es selbst für unanständig, allein ein Umstand den ich nicht vorhersehen könnte, hielt mich davon ab." (Beethoven to Varnhagen, 14 July 1812, in Brandenburg 1996, #583.)&lt;/ref&gt;

La Mara (1920), after discovering more letters and notes in the Brunsvik estates, was now convinced "that ... Josephine widowed Countess Deym was Beethoven's 'Immortal Beloved'".&lt;ref&gt;"… drängte sich mir die Überzeugung auf, daß ... Josephine verwitwete Gräfin Deym die 'unsterbliche Geliebte' Beethovens ... sei." (La Mara 1920, p. 1.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Czeke (1938), for the first time, published Therese's diary notes ending in 1813; some were known already to Rolland (1928).&lt;ref&gt;Rolland was in contact with Marianne Czeke, who seemed to have known quite a lot more about the relationship between Beethoven and the Brunsviks&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that Beethoven was in love with Josephine, but nonetheless he tended towards Therese as the "Immortal Beloved".

Kaznelson (1954) evaluated more of the documents in the Brunsvik estates, and even though he thought that Rahel Varnhagen was behind the "Distant Beloved" he concluded that the "Immortal Beloved" must have been Josephine mainly because her daughter Minona was born exactly nine months after the encounter with Beethoven and her husband Baron Stackelberg was away. Kaznelson arrived at his conclusion even though H C Bodmer in [[Zürich]], owner of the "13 Letters" after World War II (see following), would not allow him access to them.&lt;ref&gt;Goldschmidt (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Editha and Richard Sterba (1954), using psychoanalysis, argued for Beethoven's nephew Karl as the "Immortal Beloved".&lt;ref&gt;Refuted by Goldschmidt (1980), p. 325 f. Astonishingly, this book was published in 1964 in German translation even though the "13 Letters" (translated by Anderson, 1961) had meanwhile been published, clearly indicating a very heterosexual drive in the composer!&lt;/ref&gt;

Steichen (1959) identified Marie Erdödy to have been a lifelong beloved of Beethoven, and thus could also be the "Immortal Beloved".&lt;ref&gt;Refuted by Goldschmidt (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Richard Marek|Marek]] (1969) argued the case for Dorothea Ertmann.&lt;ref&gt;Refuted by Tellenbach (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt-Görg (1957) published 13 heretofore unknown love letters by Beethoven to [[Josephine Brunsvik]] (and a draft letter by him that survived as a copy by Josephine), that could be dated to the  period from 1804 to 1809/10 when she was a widow after the early death of her first husband Count Deym.&lt;ref&gt;More love letters (also by Josephine to Beethoven) were published by Schmidt-Görg (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt-Görg dismissed Kaznelson’s discoveries as "sensational".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Görg (1957, p. 35).&lt;/ref&gt; Goldschmidt (1980) explains why the German Beethoven scholarship was so reluctant to accept Kaznelson’s theory (already published before these "13 letters"): "The fact that, as a result of this meeting, they had to take a natural daughter into account, appeared so venturesome to the professional world that the resistance to the Josephine hypothesis stiffened noticeably."&lt;ref&gt;"Der Umstand, daß man … als Folge dieser Begegnung eine natürliche Tochter in Kauf zu nehmen hatte, erschien der professionellen Welt als so abenteuerlich, daß die Widerstände gegen die Josephinen-Hypothese sich merklich versteiften." Goldschmidt (1980, p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt-Görg (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;31) believed that with the last letter (which he still thought to have been written in 1807 – not 1809) and with Josephine's marriage to Baron Stackelberg (in 1810) the love relationship was terminated.

Ley (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;78) saw it differently: "Only on the negative side has one been able to arrive at certain conclusions: neither Giulietta Guicciardi, nor Amalie Sebald, nor Bettina Brentano can be considered any longer, and not even [[Teréz Brunszvik|Therese Brunsvik]], who for a long time was seriously regarded as the recipient of the famous love letter. But curiously enough, it is precisely the same documents which shed a definitive light, in the negative sense, on Therese which bear witness to Beethoven's passionate love for her sister Josephine."&lt;ref&gt;"Nur im Negieren ist man in der Lage, zu eindeutigen Schlüssen zu gelangen: weder Giulietta Guicciardi noch Amalie Sebald oder Bettina Brentano können in Frage kommen, und nicht einmal Therese Brunsvik, die für eine lange Zeit ernsthaft als die Empfängerin des berühmten Liebesbriefess galt. Aber merkwürdigerweise sind es genau die gleichen Dokumente, die definitiv, im negativen Sinne, auf Therese hinweisen, Zeugnis von leidenschaftlicher Liebe Beethovens für ihre Schwester Josephine."&lt;/ref&gt;

Riezler (1962, p.&amp;nbsp;46), still very much a "standard" German biography of Beethoven, followed Kaznelson regarding Josephine being his "only love", likewise [[Carl Dahlhaus|Dahlhaus]] (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;247) who concluded that "internal evidence" points to Josephine.&lt;ref&gt;In a review of Tellenbach (1983) in the leading German newspaper F.A.Z. (on 24 February 1984), Dahlhaus stated: "Daß Beethovens berühmter 'Brief an die unsterbliche Geliebte' ... an Josephine von Brunswick gerichtet war, steht inzwischen fest." [That Beethoven's famous "Letter to the Immortal Beloved" ... was addressed to Josephine von Brunsvik, is now a well established fact.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French authors [[Jean Massin|Jean]] and [[Brigitte Massin]] (1955) identified Josephine as the "Immortal Beloved", mainly based on comparisons of the "Letter to the Immortal Beloved" with the earlier 14 (15) love letters: "The letter to the ‘Immortal Beloved’ … not only uses similar wording, but also emphasizes his long-time faithfulness to his one and only Beloved."&lt;ref&gt;Steblin (2007), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with regard to traces in Beethoven’s compositions, the "Massins argue that ... the presence of Josephine in Beethoven's life left traces in his music. ... From the standpoint of music theory, the connections make eminent sense."&lt;ref&gt;Meredith (2011), p. xv. Elaborated by Goldschmidt (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

After Massin &amp; Massin (1955) and Goldschmidt (1980), Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1999) argued extensively the case for Josephine, based on many newly discovered documents, like Therese's later diary notes, e.g., on the discovery of the "Three letters by Beethoven … they must have been to Josephine whom he loved passionately.”&lt;ref&gt;”3 Briefe von Beethoven ... sie werden wohl an Josephine sein, die er leidenschaftlich geliebt hat." (Therese’s Diary, 15 January 1847, in Tellenbach 1983, p. 16.) This was then also in response to the biography by Schindler (1840), refuting his hypothesis that Julie Guicciardi was the "immortal Beloved".&lt;/ref&gt;

"Beethoven! It is like a dream, that he was the friend, the confidant of our house – a beautiful mind! Why did not my sister Josephine, as widow Deym, take him as her husband? Josephine's soul-mate! They were born for each other. She would have been happier with him than with Stackelberg. Maternal affection made her forgo her own happiness."&lt;ref&gt;
"Beethoven! ist es doch wie ein Traum, [daß] er der Freund, der Vertraute unseres Hauses war – ein herrlicher Geist – warum nahm ihn meine Schwester J. nicht zu ihrem Gemahl als Witwe Deym? Josephines Herzensfreund! Sie waren für einander geboren. Sie wäre glücklicher gewesen als mit St[ackelberg]. Mutterliebe bestimmte sie – – auf eigenes Glück zu verzichten." (Therese’s Diary, 4 February 1846, in Schmidt-Görg 1957, p. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt; She could not contemplate marrying Beethoven, a commoner, for the simple reason that she would have lost the guardianship of her aristocratic children.&lt;ref&gt;"I would have to violate sacred bonds if I gave in to your request – Believe me – that I, by doing what is my duty, suffer the most – and that surely noble motives were guiding my actions." [Ich müßte heilige Bande verletzen, gäbe ich Ihrem Verlangen Gehör –  Glauben Sie – daß ich, durch Erfüllung meiner Pflichten, am meisten leide – und daß gewiß, edle Beweggründe meine Handlungen leiteten.] (Josephine to Beethoven, Winter 1806/7, in Schmidt-Görg 1957, p. 21.) See also Tellenbach (1988) for the effect of guardianship laws.&lt;/ref&gt;

Again Therese on Beethoven: "How unhappy, with such intellectual talent. At the same time Josephine was unhappy! ''Le mieux est l'ennemi du bien'' – both together they would have been happy (perhaps). What he needed was a wife, that’s for sure."&lt;ref&gt;"Wie unglüklich bei so grossen Geistesgaben. Zu gleicher Zeit war Josephine unglüklich! ''Le mieux est l'enemi du bien'' – sie beide zusammen wären glüklich gewesen (vielleicht). Ihm hat eine Frau gefehlt[,] das ist gewiß." (Therese's Diary, 22 December 1846, in Goldschmidt 1980, p. 296.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"I was so lucky to have been acquainted with Beethoven, intimately and intellectually, for so many years! Josephine's intimate friend, her soul mate! They were born for each other, and if both were still alive, they would be united."&lt;ref&gt;"Ich Glückliche hatte Beethovens intimen, geistigen Umgang so viele Jahre! Josephinens Haus- und Herzensfreund! Sie waren für einander geboren[,] und lebten beide noch, hätten sie sich vereint." (Therese's Diary, March 1848, in Goldschmidt 1980, p. 296.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Goldschmidt's evaluation of the ''Josephine hypothesis'': "Without conclusive proofs of the opposite one should no longer want to part prematurely with the increasingly justified assumption that the 'Immortal Beloved' could hardly be anyone else but the 'Only Beloved'."&lt;ref&gt;"Ohne schlüssige Beweise des Gegenteils wird man sich nicht mehr voreilig von der zunehmend begründeten Annahme trennen wollen, daß die 'Unsterbliche Geliebte' schwerlich eine andere als die 'Einzig Geliebte' war." (Goldschmidt 1980, p. 296.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephine's candidacy as the "Immortal Beloved" was contested by [[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]] (1988), mainly in response to Massin (1955, 1970), Goldschmidt (1980) and Tellenbach (1983).

==Antonie Brentano and other alternatives (1955 to 2011)==
[[image:Antonie Brentano3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Antonie Brentano]], portrait by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]], 1808]]
In 1955 the French scholars Jean and Brigitte Massin noted that [[Antonie Brentano]] was present in Prague and [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]] at the time and proposed her as a possible candidate for the "Immortal Beloved":

"The assumption that it could have been Antonie Brentano, is both tantalizing and absurd."&lt;ref&gt;"L’hypothèse d’Antonia Brentano est à la fois séduisante et absurde." ([[Jean Massin|Jean]] and [[Brigitte Massin]] 1955, p. 240.)&lt;/ref&gt; They then argue:&lt;br&gt;
Tantalizing is the assumption, because
* Beethoven and Antonia since her return to Vienna were "on friendly terms",
* In the summer of 1812 he lived in the same hotel in Franzensbad as the Brentanos, and
* He had dedicated in the same year to her daughter Maxe a one-movement trio.
Absurd, they argue, is the assumption because of
* Beethoven's lasting friendship with Antonie's husband, Franz,
* He borrowed money from him, and
* "The many letters he wrote Antonie prove that a true and deep but - due to mutual restraint - nevertheless only formal friendship existed between them and Beethoven always seems to perceive Franz, Antonia and their children as an inseparable unity."&lt;ref&gt;"... les nombreuses lettres qu'il écrira à Antonina marquent une amitié profonde mais presque cérémonieuse à force d'être réservée, et Beethoven semble toujours considérer Franz, Antonia et leurs enfants comme un ensemble undivisible." (Jean and Brigitte Massin 1955, p. 240.)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was four years later also a claim by a Japanese author (Aoki 1959, 1968) who had "discovered" Antonie. However, this had not been noticed outside Japan. She also published her findings again in a recent book in German (Aoki 2008).

Once again and more detailed [[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]] (1972, 1998) suggested Antonie Brentano to have been the "Immortal Beloved".&lt;ref&gt;He used documents about Beethoven's and the Brentanos' whereabouts discovered by Marek (1969); see Goldschmidt (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; His hypothesis was founded on two major assumptions (or prerequisites):
*1. the woman must have been in Prague and Karlsbad around the time in question (like Beethoven);&lt;ref&gt;"The ''sine qua non'' for identification of the Immortal Beloved is that she must have been in Karlsbad during the week of July 6, 1812." (Solomon 1998, p. 219)&lt;/ref&gt;
*2. she must have been closely acquainted (at least on very friendly terms) with Beethoven, at the time immediately before this event.&lt;ref&gt;"… requirements …, that the Immortal Beloved be a woman closely acquainted with Beethoven during the period in question." (Solomon 1998, p. 218)&lt;/ref&gt;
ad 1: Antonie arrived in Prague on 3 July 1812 after an arduous journey with husband, child and servant (and was registered there); she left at dawn the following morning: "Where did she have time that night for a tryst with Beethoven?" (Steblin 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;148) Solomon (1972, p.&amp;nbsp;577) admits: "There is no proof that Beethoven and Antonie met in Prague." And regarding Karlsbad: "It is possible that the letter arose from a ... meeting with a woman who informed Beethoven that she was going to Karlsbad and then failed to carry out her declared intention." (Solomon 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;219 f.) Goldschmidt showed that "for short stays, residents [as opposed to foreigners] were exempt from reporting requirements".&lt;ref&gt;"Von der Meldepflicht bei Kurzaufenthalten waren ... Inländer befreit." Goldschmidt (1980), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

ad 2: There are no love letters from or to Antonie, and no other documents supporting the possibility of a love relationship with Beethoven, there is only a letter by Antonie to her brother-in-law Clemens, where she expressed her "admiration" of Beethoven:&lt;ref&gt;"Beethovens heilige Hände …[,] den ich tief verehre, er wandelt göttlich under den Sterblichen, sein höheren Standpunkt gegen die niedere Welt." [Beethoven’s sacred hands, whom I deeply admire, he is walking divinely among mortals, his elevated stature opposed to the world beneath.] (Antonie to Clemens, 26 January 1811, in Goldschmidt 1980, p. 524)&lt;/ref&gt; "At what point this worship was transformed into love is not yet known. My estimate is ... in the fall of 1811. … The love affair was under way by late 1811."&lt;ref&gt;Solomon (1998), p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;229) quotes as supporting his case the Song "An die Geliebte" [To the Beloved] WoO 140, an autograph of which contains in Antonie’s handwriting the remark: "Requested by me from the author on 2 March 1812."&lt;ref&gt;"Den 2tn März, 1812 mir vom Author erbethen."&lt;/ref&gt; The background to this: "In November 1811, we see Beethoven writing a newly composed song with the heading ‘An die Geliebte’ [To the Beloved] into the album of the Bavarian Court singer Regina Lang. … Dilettante verses … by a clumsy author, a real dilettante, a coffeehouse poet."&lt;ref&gt;"November 1811 sehen wir Beethoven ein neuverfaßtes Lied mit der Überschrift ‘An die Geliebte’ der bayerischen Hofsängerin Regina Lang ins Stammbuch schreiben. … Die dilettantischen Verse haben ebenfalls Stammbuchcharakter. Als den linkischen Verfasser … von einem wirklichen Dilettanten, dem Kaffeehaus-Literaten Joseph Ludwig Stoll." (Goldschmidt 1980, p. 138 f.) Goldschmidt's judgement about Stoll (1777-1815) is far too negative however. Stoll was a very successful playwright, who from 1809 on even received an honorary pension from Napoleon.&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon (1972, p. 572) declares that Beethoven’s separation from his "Only Beloved" [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine]] two years before (due to her second marriage) does not rule out that she could have been the "Immortal Beloved": “There is no certainty that the affair was not momentarily rekindled a half-decade later. ... There is still room for a reasonable doubt." (Solomon 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;461, n. 48.)

Solomon's hypothesis was contested by Goldschmidt (1980), Tellenbach (1983, 1987, 1988, 1993/1994, 1998), Beahrs (1972, 1986, 1988, 1993), Dahlhaus (1991), Pichler (1994), Altman (1996), Meredith (2000), [[Rita Steblin|Steblin]] (2007), Walden (2011), Caeyers (2012, and Swaffort (2014).&lt;ref&gt;"The flaw in this [Solomon’s] methodology [in Support of Antonie] was that he established requirements that he knew only his candidate could meet. They were therefore not independent objective requirements at all." (Walden 2011, p. 104)&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldschmidt (1980) summarizes: "The Antonia hypothesis … is not so fully convincing that it excludes all others."&lt;ref&gt;… die Antonia-Hypothese … nicht so restlos überzeugend ist, daß sie jede andere ausschließt. (Goldschmidt 1980, p. 165 f.)&lt;/ref&gt; and: "In order to possibly verify the Antonia-Hypothesis with its inherent factual contradictions once and forever, it is necessary to falsify the other hypotheses that have been offered."&lt;ref&gt;"Um die Antonia–Hypothese möglicherweise mit den ihr sachlich innewaltenden Widersprüchen endgültig zu verifizieren, bedarf es der Falsifizierung anderer sich anbietender Hypothesen." (Goldschmidt 1980, p. 166.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Altman (1996) "demonstrates, as indeed Tellenbach has done, that much of the basis for the claims of Antonie's supporters consists of distortions, suppositions, opinions, and even plain inaccuracies." (Cooper 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref&gt;See also Meredith (2011, p. xxii).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Altman's suggestion that the "Immortal Beloved" was Marie Erdödy was shown to be "impossible" by Cooper (1996).&lt;ref&gt;It had already been refuted by Goldschmidt (1980) with regard to Steichen (1959). Cooper's statement however that "To get to Jedlersee from Klosterneuburg, you have to cross the Kahlenberg." left a lot to be desired, as far as basic expertise in Viennese topography is concerned.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lund (1988) made a claim that Antonie’s son Karl, born exactly eight  months after the alleged encounter with Beethoven, should have been his son; even [[Maynard Solomon|Solomon]] did not endorse this, as he thought "it was 'sensationalistic'." (Meredith 2011, p. x)

Beahrs (1993, p.&amp;nbsp;183 f.) supported [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine]]: "Was there for him in fact … one deep and lasting passion for a certain dear one, marriage to whom was precluded, not by psychological inhibitions of the inner man, but by prohibitive heart-breaking externals? … Where is any evidence whatsoever of true romantic love for even such dear ones as Marie Erdödy or Dorothea von Ertmann, Therese Malfatti or Antonie Brentano? Although all have been advanced as Beethoven's unknown Immortal Beloved, the assessment is unsupported by the record or by any known correspondence. Intimate friends of Beethoven, true, one and all; but loves? There is one, however, and only one, to whom Beethoven did pour his heart out in impassioned declarations of undying love remarkably similar to the phraseology of the anguished letter to his Immortal Beloved… That one is his 'BELOVED AND ONLY J' – Josephine."

Pulkert’s (2000) claim about one Almerie Esterházy, whom Beethoven did not even know, was refuted by Steblin (2001). Meredith (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;47) summarily comments: "… we lack evidence of a connection between Almerie and Beethoven... I must reiterate that we have no such evidence of a passionate love relationship between Antonie and Beethoven either, just of a close friendship; for Josephine, … we know he was indeed passionately in love with her in 1805-1807 at least."

Finally, Kopitz’ (2001) "valiant effort … show[ed] that Antonie cannot have been the ‘Immortal Beloved’. She was a happily married wife and mother … her candidacy, which includes the improbable scenario of a ‘ménage à trois’ in Karlsbad, makes no psychological sense." (Steblin 2007, p. 148)&lt;br&gt;
Walden (2011, p.&amp;nbsp;5)&lt;ref&gt;See also Walden (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that [[Bettina von Arnim|Bettina Brentano]] was Beethoven’s "Immortal Beloved", based on the assumption that one of the two spurious letters by Beethoven to her is true: "If that letter to Bettina was genuine, it would prove conclusively that Bettina was the Immortal Beloved, but the original has not survived, and the authenticity is strongly doubted today. ... her reliability and truthfulness are today under a cloud."&lt;ref&gt;Two of three letters by Beethoven to Bettina (and published by her) are generally considered forgeries (like similar letters by Goethe she published), although Walden devotes an entire Chapter setting out evidence in support of the letter's authenticity. Walden's book is also summarized and reviewed by Patricia Stroh in the ''Beethoven Journal'' 26 (2011), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Meredith (2011, p. xxii), in his ''Introduction'', has reviewed the debate over the major candidates and he believes that "Walden’s proposal merits unbiased consideration".&lt;br&gt;
Meredith (2011), reviewing the history of the debate so far, deplores the fact that French and German authors (like Massin &amp; Massin and - until then - Goldschmidt) were never translated into English, thus depriving especially the US-based Beethoven scholarship of the most valuable resources in this field of study: "Unfortunately, several of the most important and controversial studies about the Immortal Beloved have never appeared in English translation, which has substantially restricted their impact." (p. xv) "Tellenbach ... too has unfortunately never appeared in English translation." (p. xvii)

==Josephine re-discovered (2002 to date)==
Significant new discoveries in European archives were made and published by [[Rita Steblin|Steblin]] (2002, 2007, 2009, 2009a) and Skwara/Steblin (2007). These can be summarized into two important items:

# [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine]]'s estranged husband Baron Stackelberg was most likely away from home at the beginning of July 1812 (probably from the end of June for ca. two months), as noted in her diary: "Today has been a difficult day for me. – The hand of fate is resting ominously on me – I saw besides my own deep sorrows also the degeneration of my children, and – almost – all courage deserted me –!!! ... Stackelberg wants to leave me on my own. He is callous to supplicants in need."&lt;ref&gt;"Ich habe heute einen schweren Tag. – Die Hand des Schicksals ruht düster auf mir – Ich sah nebst meinem tiefen Kummer auch noch die Entartung meiner Kinder und – fast – aller Muth wich von mir –!!! ... St. will daß ich mir selbst sitzen soll. er ist gefühllos für bittende in der Noth." (Josephine's Diary, 8 June 1812, in Steblin 2007, p. 159.)&lt;/ref&gt; Steblin (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;169) also discovered a document headed "Table of Rules" and dated 5–11 July with a list of ethical categories in the handwriting of Christoph von Stackelberg: "Thus this whole document, dated at the time when ... he ... was deliberating about his future, is surely further proof that Josephine was left alone ... in June and July 1812."
# Josephine expressed her clear intention to go to [[Prague]] (in June 1812): "I want to see Liebert in Prague. I will never let the children be taken from me. ... On account of Stackelberg I have ruined myself physically, in that I have incurred so much distress and illness through him."&lt;ref&gt;"Ich will Liebert in Prag prechen. ich will die Kinder nie von mir lassen. ... Ich habe Stackb zu liebe [mich] physisch zugrunde gerichtet indem ich ... noch so viele Kummer und Krankheit durch ihn zugezogen habe." (Josephine’s Diary, June 1812, in Steblin 2007, p. 162.)&lt;/ref&gt;
"A new way of looking at old evidence confirms that Josephine was Beethoven's one and only 'Immortal Beloved'. ... All of the puzzling aspects about Beethoven's affair with the 'Immortal Beloved'. including his various cryptic comments, can be explained in terms of his one known beloved – Josephine. Why do we doubt his word that there was only one woman who had captured his heart?" (Steblin 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;180).

==The ''Immortal Beloved'' 1994 film==
In the film ''[[Immortal Beloved (1994 film)|Immortal Beloved]]'', written and directed by [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]], the Immortal Beloved is Beethoven's sister-in-law [[Johanna van Beethoven|Johanna Reiss]], with whom he had a long and frustrating legal battle over the custody of his nephew Karl van Beethoven.

==The Immortal Beloved in music==
A song cycle "Briefe an die unsterbliche Geliebte" for mezzo-soprano (or baritone) and piano trio has been written by Canadian composer James K. Wright.  The cycle sets excerpts from Beethoven’s letter of 6–7 July 1812. A recording of the work by mezzo-soprano Julie Nesrallah and the Gryphon Trio is available.

'''Iris Rideau''' (born c. 1937) is a French Creole winemaker, businesswoman and activist.&lt;ref name="Dame"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.damemagazine.com/2013/03/21/iris-rideau-wine-pioneer|title=Iris Rideau, Wine Pioneer|last=Sager|first=Rebekah|date=2013-03-21|website=Dame Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first Creole-American winemaker to own and operate a winery in the United States.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1190119|title=A Tour of Rideau Vineyards|publisher=NPR|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rideau was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], a paternal descendent of Frenchman [[Armand Allard Gabriel Duplantier]] who sailed to America in 1777 on [[Marquis de Lafayette]]'s ship ''[[La Victoire (ship)|La Victoire]]'' and established a plantation in [[Point Coupee, Louisiana|Point Coupee]], and later the [[Magnolia Mound Plantation House|Magnolia Mound]] plantation in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].&lt;ref name="Etling2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etling|first=William|title=Sideways in Neverland: Life in the Santa Ynez Valley, California|url=http://wobooks.google.com/books?id=qOnB_9IjCRwC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=April 10, 2013|date=30 July 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-36190-8|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She grew up in the Creole 7th Ward of the city, where her mother and uncles operated the Creole Bar and Grille. She has said, "There was not a great emphasis placed on education in my community, especially with Creole. Both my father and my mother attended high school, but neither graduated. Her father left the family and departed to California after her parents divorced when she was two-years old."&lt;ref name="Ehrhart-Morrison1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrhart-Morrison|first=Dorothy|title=No mountain high enough: secrets of successful African American women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utiqvRo0oZAC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=10 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=978-0-943233-98-7|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially aspired to become a Broadway dancer.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rideauvineyard.com/index.php?p=iris_rideau|title=Iris Rideau profile at|publisher=Rideauvineyard.com|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandmother moved in and taught Rideau to speak French. In the summer months she visited her father and worked at his ranch in [[Corona, California]], and after several years of insistence that she wanted to live closer to her father, they moved into a one-room flat in eastern Los Angeles when she was 12.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt;

Her mother found work at a nearby sewing factory. At 16, Iris she became pregnant and married, only to divorce the father of her daughter, Renee, a year later.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; She found employment at her mother's factory and enrolled in night classes at a junior college. Rideau has said of her employment at the factory and decision to take night classes, ''"The line of mostly Black and Hispanic women would wrap around the corner in the mornings. We made about $15 a week. I knew I'd need an education or I'd never escape."'' She graduated after a year and began working as a receptionist for an insurance agency, passing as a white woman to keep her job.&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt;

Rideau married Jimmy Rideau in 1957,&lt;ref name="Ehrhart-Morrison1997" /&gt; and they divorced in 1978. She has since remained single and is a great grandmother.&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt;

Rideau has said that her drive to succeed as a businesswoman was a result of her natural self-motivating will and the environment that she grew up in. She has said ''"I never want to experience poverty again. That is what drives me. Also, when my daughter was growing up, I wanted to provide her with the security that I did not have as a child."''&lt;ref name="Ehrhart-Morrison1997" /&gt;

==Career==
===Investment banking===
Rideau began her entrepreneurial career in 1967 when she opened the Rideau &amp; Associates Insurance Agency, and followed with Rideau Retirement Planning Consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/rideau-iris-1940|title=Rideau, Iris 1940(?)– - Dictionary definition of Rideau, Iris 1940(?)– {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an involved investment and securities broker in Los Angeles, and became actively involved in seeking better rights for ethnic minorities. Rideau gained much respect in Los Angeles for her activism in the 1960s, and from 1973 to 1976, she was appointed as Chairman to the Mayor’s Affirmative Action Committee, under then-[[Mayor of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], a job which involved securing employment for hundreds of ethnic minority women in the city. She managed the Rideau Insurance Agency from 1967 to 1999, and in 1982, she established Rideau Securities Firm, and set up two offices with 50 employees.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt;

===Wine===
Rideau had long been passionate about food and drink when she decided to enter a career as a vintner in 1989. She bought a 6-acre plot of land in [[Solvang, California]] in the [[Santa Ynez Valley]] that year, and added 24 more acres six years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Iris+Rideau+ebony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzjcD541At&amp;sig=Hi-YEtFCgRo2jLTVQzUSDKKg8zs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3qp-Ris7VAhVM5yYKHeOdD5QQ6AEIUzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Iris%20Rideau%20ebony&amp;f=false|title=Ebony|last=Lyons|first=Charlotte|date=February 2003|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|isbn=|location=|pages=118|ref=ebony 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This land became [[Rideau Vineyard]] two years later.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; Rideau employed an architect and winemaker to transform an adobe house into a wine tasting centre, with bathroom and kitchen facilities.&lt;ref name="Company2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=April 10, 2013|date=February 2003|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=116|issn=0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rideau sold her insurance agency and brokerage company in 1997.&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt; She said of her decision, ''"You know when you get close to retirement you say, 'What am I going to do?' And I said, 'There's nothing to do out in this country other than raise horses or develop a vineyard. And I don't ride horses, so the next thing to do was start a vineyard."''&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Rideau is interested in the production of [[Rhone]] wines, and produces [[Syrah]], [[Mourvedre]], [[Marsanne]], [[Roussanne]] and [[Viognier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BHJlxKHl0YC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=Iris+Rideau+essence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CiGxv5j8Te&amp;sig=hcLphwP8JPrLYhAUbkOKPNXcZ8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-zKLojM7VAhWGJCYKHe9TDPk4ChDoAQhGMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Iris%20Rideau%20essence&amp;f=false|title=Wines and Wineries of California’s Central Coast: A Complete Guide from Monterey to Santa Barbara|last=Ausmus|first=William A.|date=2008-06-30|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520931831}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine has said that she "effortlessly combines delectable grapes from the Rhone Valley of France with the savory taste of [[Creole cuisine]] in her winery."&lt;ref name="Black Enterprise"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1ERAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 10, 2013|year=2004|publisher=E.G. Graves Publishing Company|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sold 300 cases in her first year and now produces some 7,500 cases annually and has worked with winemakers [[Ariel Levee|Ariel Lavie]] (2002-2005) and Andres Ibarra (2005-2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cholamevineyard.com/vineyard/|title=The Vineyard|work=Cholame Vineyard|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making around $3.5 million a year.&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lompocrecord.com/lifestyles/adventures-in-grape-harvesting-part-one/article_8b55b213-b613-5bdc-b04e-dab7adb2f0a9.html|title=Adventures in grape harvesting, part one|last=Country|first=Laurie Jervis/Wine|work=Lompoc Record|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her wines have won the Best in Show in the [[Los Angeles International Wine Competition]].&lt;ref name="Dame" /&gt;

Pamela M. Kalte has stated that her "success in the competitive world of vines and vineyards seems surprising, given that she knew nothing about wines before setting up Rideau."&lt;ref name="Kalte2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalte|first=Pamela M.|title=Contemporary Black Biography: Profiles from the International Black Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuF1AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=30 November 2004|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|isbn=978-0-7876-6734-4|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Nikitich Nikitin''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Иван Никитич Никитин}} c. 1690–1741) was a [[Russia]]n painter, an author of portraits and battle paintings.

==Biography==
[[File:Nikitin Getman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Hetman]]'' ([[Pavlo Polubotok]]?), 1720s ]]
Ivan Nikitin was born in Moscow to a family of an [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priest. He received his first artistic lessons from a Dutch artist Schwonbek at the engraving shop of the [[Kremlin Armoury]]. In 1711 the Armory together with Ivan Nikitin was moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. In 1716–1720 he and his brother Roman Nikitin were sent to [[Italy]] by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The brothers learnt the art of painting at [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. After returning to [[Russia]] Nikitin became the favorite court painter of Peter the Great. He worked in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

After Peter's death in 1725 Nikitin continued to work at the court until 1732, when he and his brothers Roman and Rodion (the dean of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in [[Moscow Kremlin]]) were arrested for the distribution of pamphlets against vice-Procurator of [[Synod]] [[Feofan Prokopovich]]. Ivan was tortured, for five years imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], then whipped and exiled to [[Tobolsk]].

In 1740 [[Anna of Russia]] signed an amnesty for the brothers. The amnesty came into force in 1741. By request of the new Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]], Nikitin travelled back from [[Tobolsk]] to Saint Petersburg and died somewhere on the road either in late 1741 or in early 1742.

==Works==

The early portraits by Nikitin had a strong influence of the traditional 17th century [[parsuna]] style: no [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], rigid local colors, dark backgrounds. The later portraits are typical [[Baroque]] paintings. Most art historians consider the Nikitin's best portraits to be [[:File:Chancelor G.I.Golovkin by I.Nikitin (1720s, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|''Chancellor G. I. Golovkin'']] and [[:File:Nikitin Getman.jpg|A Malorossian Hetman]]. There are problems with attributing of the subject of the portrait, with different historians arguing that he is [[Ivan Mazepa]] or [[Ivan Skoropadsky]] or Kazimir Ian Sapega, or [[Pavlo Polubotok]], but they all are equal in emphasising the psychological depth of the portrait.

Besides portraits, Ivan Nikitin is also considered to be the first notable Russian battle painter due to his paintings of the [[Battle of Poltava]] and [[Battle of Kulikovo]].

He held down a number of jobs after high school, including a stint in the [[United States Navy|Navy]], in [[construction]] and as a [[bicycle messenger]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He returned to illustration when he first worked with an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer in 1990 while attending [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. He currently resides in [[Morro Bay, California]].&lt;ref name="Morro Bay man realizes dream of publishing children's book"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2013/05/06/2497506/morro-bay-resident-james-horvath.html |publisher= The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)| title= Morro Bay man realizes dream of publishing children's book |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James Horvath"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://caitymccardell.com/2014/01/james-horvath/ |publisher= caitymccardell.com| title= James Horvath |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Hovath established Jamestoons Studios, and worked with [[Google]], [[Nestlé]], ''[[Reader’s Digest]]'', [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], [[Tyco Toys|Tyco]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba International]]. His work appeared in advertising, computer games for children and other books. His influences include [[Shag (artist)|Josh “Shag” Agle]], [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor “Dr. Seuss” Geisel]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons.&lt;ref name="Morro Bay man realizes dream of publishing children's book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dig into “Dig, Dogs, Dig!” by James Horvath"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.thechildrensbookreview.com/weblog/2013/07/dig-into-dig-dogs-dig-by-james-horvath.html |publisher= The Children’s Book Review| title= Dig into "Dig, Dogs, Dig!" by James Horvath |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Horvath said his inspiration for his series of stores about dogs in construction came from his own sons’ interest in stopping to watch building job sites.&lt;ref name="Morro Bay man realizes dream of publishing children's book"/&gt;

[[HarperCollins]] accepted his first book, ''Dig, Dogs, Dig: A Construction Tail'', which tells the story of a construction crew of canines who are building a park, shortly after Horvath attended the [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]]' [[Los Angeles]] summer conference in August 2011. The publisher extended a three-book contract to the writer/illustrator.&lt;ref name="James Horvath"/&gt;

''Dig, Dogs, Dig: A Construction Tail'' was published on April 23, 2013; its followup, ''Build, Dogs, Build: A Tall Tail'' (a story about the crew taking down and constructing a building) was released on December 30, 2013.''Work, Dogs, Work: A Highway Tail'' will be released on September 23, 2014.

His series of books have been well received by reviewers, with [[Kirkus Reviews]] noting that it is engaging and solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-horvath/work-dogs-work/ |publisher= Kirkus Reviews| title= WORK, DOGS, WORK |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-horvath/dig-dogs-dig/ |publisher= Kirkus Reviews| title= DIG, DOGS, DIG |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/james-horvath/build-dogs-build/ |publisher= Kirkus Reviews| title= BUILD, DOGS, BUILD |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times also described the illustrations as reflecting Horvath’s influences in comics and cartoons as well as featuring "Hanna-Barbera panoramas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/books/construction-kitties-and-dig-dogs-dig.html?_r=1&amp;&amp;pagewanted=all |publisher= The New York Times| title= Building a Playground |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta Parent also named ''Dig, Dogs, Dig'' as one of its Best Books of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.atlantaparent.com/article/detail/best_books_of_20131 |publisher= atlantaparent.com| title= Best Books of 2013 |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is also praised for its inclusiveness of female characters in construction and being the favorite of a reviewer’s child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thepicturebookreview.com/2014/04/04/dogs-construction-new-favorite-construction-picture-book-build-dogs-build-by-james-horvath/ |publisher= The Picturebook Review| title= dogs + construction = new favorite construction picture book: build, dogs, build by james horvath |accessdate=August 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Joseph DeLuca''' (March 17, 1893 – March 20, 1952) was an Italian-American mobster who controlled the smuggling and distribution of [[narcotics]] with his brother [[Frank DeLuca]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] for almost four decades.

Born '''Giuseppe DeLuca''', DeLuca emigrated with his brother Frank from their native [[Sicily]] and eventually found his way to Kansas City, where they became major figures in Kansas City's underworld. Although having several arrests for federal narcotics violations since the 1930s, DeLuca ran a major drug ring operation for mobster [[Joseph DiGiovanni]] until his arrest and eventually conviction in 1942, along with seven other members (his girlfriend would be convicted of [[jury tampering]] the following year). In 1952, DeLuca and his brother were named two of the "Five Iron Men" of Kansas City by the [[US Senate]] [[Kefauver Committee]].

'''Keith Russell Judd''' (born May 23, 1958) is an [[United States|American]] [[perennial candidate]] for political office. His nicknames include "Dark Priest"&lt;ref name = "DMilbank"&gt;Dana Milbank, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mourdock-and-judd-vs-washington/2012/05/11/gIQA3EKGIU_story.html Richard Mourdock and Keith Judd vs. Washington], ''The Washington Post'', May 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Mtr. President".&lt;ref name = "VoteSmart"&gt;[http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/15574 Biography, Keith Judd], Project Vote Smart; accessed 2012.06.27.&lt;/ref&gt;  He claims to have run for [[President of the United States]] in every election since 1996.

==Early life==
Judd was born May 23, 1958, in [[Pasadena, California]].  He is married, and professes to be a [[Rastafari movement|Rasta]]-[[Christian]].&lt;ref name = "VoteSmart" /&gt;  He claims to have run in every [[United States presidential election]] since 1996 and for mayor of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and [[Governor of New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=15574 Project Vote Smart - Keith Russell Judd]&lt;/ref&gt;  He further claims to be a former member of the Federation of Super Heroes.&lt;ref&gt;http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/15574/keith-judd#.Vylo9hUrKRs&lt;/ref&gt; Judd has one child, born on September 3, 1990, a son named Marcus Miciah Robertson.&lt;ref name = "DMilbank" /&gt;

==Crime==
In 1999 Judd was convicted of two counts of "mailing a threatening communication with intent to extort money or something of value"&lt;ref&gt;[http://skeptisys.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/texas-prisoner-keith-russell-judd-gets-his-name-listed-on-idaho-democratic-primary-ballot-with-obama-clinton/ Texas Prisoner Keith Russell Judd Gets His Name Listed On Idaho Democratic Primary Ballot With Obama, Clinton]&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 210 months (17½ years) in federal prison. The conviction has been falsely connected to litigation involving the [[University of New Mexico]]&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; which was a civil rights complaint he initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52 F3d 337 Judd v.

He also sent letters to jurors after his trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = United States v. Judd,  - CourtListener.com|url = https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/23819/usa-v-judd/|website = CourtListener|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has appealed his conviction no fewer than 36 times, but each appeal has been dismissed for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2000/02/99-2008a.htm 99-2008a -- Judd v. University of New Mexico -- 29 February 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Judd was released in June 2013 on a supervised release program. In October, his probation office sought a warrant for his arrest for violating the terms of his supervision. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, with another 24 months of supervised release. He has since been released a second time under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cunpub%5C13/13-51152.0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-ex-convict-whos-running-against-bernie-sanders-and-hillary-clinton-in-wv/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential candidacies==
As a perennial candidate, Judd has thrice run for president in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries. Judd first did this in the 2008 election cycle, and has continued to run in both cycles since. Each of the times he has run, Judd has managed to qualify to be included on the ballots of at least one Democratic Party's [[Primary election|primary]] or [[caucus]].

===2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign===
In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]] he filed to run as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 14 states but only appeared on the ballot in [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-04-16-texas-inmate_N.htm|title=Texas inmate cons way onto Idaho ballot|date=April 16, 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/a-con-for-america/Content?oid=936202|title=A Con For America|date=April 9, 2008|work=[[Boise Weekly]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/04/17/third-choice-on-idaho-democratic-presidential-primary-is-a-prisoner/|title=Third Choice on Idaho Democratic Presidential Primary is a Prisoner|date=April 17, 2008|work=[[Ballot Access News]]|author=[[Richard Winger|Winger, Richard]]|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judd finished third in the May 27, 2008, non-binding Idaho Democratic presidential preference primary with 1.7 percent of the vote, behind [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/RESULTS/2008/Primary/tot_stwd.htm May 27, 2008 Primary Election Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416030919/http://www.sos.idaho.gov/elect/RESULTS/2008/Primary/tot_stwd.htm |date=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No delegates to the [[Democratic National Convention]] were at stake in the primary as Idaho's delegation was determined at the February 5 [[Idaho Democratic caucuses, 2008|Democratic caucus]], which Judd unsuccessfully contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/inmate-candidate-sues-dems/Content?oid=937055|title=Inmate candidate sues Dems|last=Hoffman|first=Nathaniel|date=June 18, 2008|work=Boise Weekly|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kieran Martin West''' {{post-nominals|MBE}} (born 18 September 1977&lt;ref name="SportsReference" /&gt;) is a retired [[English people|English]] [[Rowing (sport)|rower]] and [[Olympic champion]] who represented [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].

==Education==

Born in [[Kingston upon Thames]],&lt;ref name="christs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kieran West MBE|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/college-life/kieran-west-mbe|website=Christ's College Cambridge|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; West was educated at [[Dulwich College]], in south-east [[London]], before going to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1995, to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[Economics]] and [[Land Economy]], followed by a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|PGCE]] in [[Mathematics]] three years later.&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; On graduating from his second degree he taught [[Mathematics]] at [[King's College School, Wimbledon]] for two years, before returning to his studies in 2004.&lt;ref name="getSurrey" /&gt; Changing discipline, he first read for an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in [[War Studies]] at [[King's College London]], and then a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[World War I|First World War]] [[Military Strategy|Strategy]] and [[Military Intelligence]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="SportsReference" /&gt;&lt;ref name="getSurrey" /&gt;

==Sporting career==

===Early career===
West was introduced to rowing by his father, Richard, and began [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxing]] at [[Kingston Rowing Club]] aged 10. When he quickly outgrew this role he started [[sculling]], and entered his first race in November 1989, going unbeaten for over 2 years.&lt;ref name="clapa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview with Kieran West – 2001|url=https://www.clapa.com/news-item/exclusive-interview-with-kieran-west-2001/|website=Cleft Lip &amp; Palate Association|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[National Rowing Championships]] in a [[single scull]] at his age category when 15,&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; then trialled for the British under-18 rowing team. Although initially successful, he suffered a severe lower back injury and was forced to retire from sport for three years to undergo intensive physiotherapy.&lt;ref name="SportsReference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kieran West|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/we/kieran-west-1.html|website=Sports Reference|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Boat Race===
For his first two years at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] West rehabilitated himself back into a boat, finally rowing again in spring 1997. After a term of rowing for his [[Christ's College Boat Club|college]] in the [[May Bumps]] he rowed in the [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge]] Goldie crew in the 1998 [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]], losing to Isis after an equipment failure two-thirds of the way down the course.&lt;ref name="clapa" /&gt;

West represented Great Britain for the first time in 1998, and made the Cambridge [[Blue Boat]] in 1999,&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; rowing in the six seat, a position he would take in all his Cambridge crews. Considered by many to have been one of the fastest crews the Club had produced, Cambridge went on to win comfortably in the second fastest time in [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] history.

Selected to represent Great Britain again that summer, and with the opportunity to go to his first [[Olympic Games]], West took a year out of his studies to concentrate on his rowing. While away he was elected President of the [[Cambridge University Boat Club]] for the 2001 [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] campaign.&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; Despite having lost both the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] and the Isis-Goldie Race in 2000, Cambridge comfortably beat Oxford exactly six months after West's [[Rowing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney final]]. Goldie also beat Isis that year, giving Cambridge the clean sweep, the last time this would happen for six years. West was subsequently voted 'Cambridge Sports Personality of the Year, 2000/2001'.

Although he initially finished at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 2001, West returned in 2005 and rowed in the 2006 [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]]. Cambridge were favourites for the 2006 Race but rough conditions on the day led to Cambridge taking on a significant amount of water and coming close to sinking, leaving Oxford to pull away to victory.&lt;ref name="getSurrey" /&gt;

The following year, Cambridge were even stronger favourites and, with five returning members of the 2006 crew, were keen to put the record straight. After a tighter than expected early section of the race, Cambridge pulled away after twelve minutes to win.&lt;ref name="getSurrey" /&gt; As the rules of the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] state that no athlete can participate in more than four races as an undergraduate and four races as a graduate (the "Rankov Rule"), this was West's last for Cambridge. Throughout the season, the crew had been accompanied by an ethnographer, Mark De Rond, who subsequently wrote a book on the season's experiences, ''The Last Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew''.

West joined the British rowing team after the [[The Boat Race 2007|2007 Boat Race]], but retired from international rowing two months later to concentrate on his academic studies.

West's three wins from four [[The Boat Race|Boat Races]] makes him one of the most successful Cambridge rowing [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]], after [[Chris Baillieu]] who won four from four, while the eight years between his first and last Cambridge appearances is the longest span in [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] history. West was also the first member of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to win the [[Olympic Games]] while still a student.

===International rowing===
West's international rowing career began in 1998,&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; when he competed for Great Britain with [[Mark Hunter (rower)|Mark Hunter]] in the Double Scull at the under-23 World Rowing Championships in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]]. The following year he was selected to row in the Men's Eight at the [[World Rowing Championships]].

In 1999 he was selected as part of an eight, coached by [[Martin McElroy]] and [[Harry Mahon]]. It was second at all three regattas in the 1999 [[Rowing World Cup]], broke the British record on two occasions and came close to breaking the world record. At the [[World Rowing Championships]] it briefly led the final, the first British eight ever to do so, before taking a silver medal behind the 1997 and 1998 World Champions, USA, the highest finish position of a British Eight at a [[World Rowing Championships]].

West took a year out of his studies to concentrate on preparing for the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]]. The crew had two changes from the previous year and was even more successful in the early season, taking two gold medals and one silver from the [[Rowing World Cup]] and becoming the first British Eight to win the event outright.

At the [[2000 Sydney Olympics|Olympic Games]] Britain were the joint favourites for the gold medal, alongside the USA, who had not raced internationally that season. A poor row in the first round, West's 23rd birthday, saw them lose to a strong Australian crew, but they won the [[repechage]]. In the [[Rowing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|final]] Britain led from start to finish to win the Gold medal for the first time since the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Stockholm Olympic Games]], with West being the youngest member of the crew, and the first member of Cambridge University to win at the Olympics while still a student.&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt; Australia took the silver. The crew of [[Andrew Lindsay]], [[Ben Hunt-Davis]], [[Simon Dennis]], [[Louis Attrill]], [[Luka Grubor]], Kieran West, [[Fred Scarlett]], [[Steve Trapmore]] and [[Rowley Douglas]] were all subsequently awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for "services to rowing" in the [[2001 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt;

Though selected for the British Eight in 2001, West was unable to compete at the [[World Rowing Championships]] due to a rib injury followed by a shoulder injury sustained earlier that season. The following year West stroked the British Coxed Four to a gold medal at the 2002 [[World Rowing Championships]] in [[Seville]]. The crew also contained two of the 2000 British Eight, [[Luka Grubor]] and [[Steve Trapmore]], and two members of the 2001 Cambridge [[Blue Boat]], [[Tom Stallard]] and [[Christian Cormack]]. The following year West and [[Tom Stallard|Stallard]] were again in the Coxed Four and took a silver medal at the [[2003 World Rowing Championships|World Championships]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="getSurrey" /&gt;

West continued rowing internationally for the next three years, in the Men's Eight at the [[2004 Athens Olympics]], stroking the Eight to fourth place at the [[2005 World Rowing Championships|2005 World Championships]] in [[Kaizu, Gifu|Gifu]], and back in the six seat of the Eight at the [[2006 World Rowing Championships|2006 World Championships]] in [[Dorney Lake|Eton]]. He retired from international rowing in March 2008.&lt;ref name="getSurrey"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowing: Golden boy West quits the sport|url=http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/sport/other-sport/rowing-golden-boy-west-quits-4830269|accessdate=13 December 2017|work=getSurrey|date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sporting achievements===
In the course of his rowing career West won every major international and domestic rowing event: the [[Rowing at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], the [[World Rowing Championships]], the [[Rowing World Cup]], the [[The Boat Race|Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race]], the [[Head of the River Race]], the [[Head of the River Fours]], and he came out of retirement in 2008 to win the [[Visitors' Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]], in a composite crew representing [[Imperial College London]] and [[Kingston Rowing Club]].&lt;ref name="christs" /&gt;

West remains a member of [[Kingston Rowing Club]]. His last race was for [[Pembroke College Boat Club (Cambridge)|Pembroke College Boat Club]] first men's eight, in the 6 seat, who were one of only two crews in the Mays first division to receive blades in 2009, the other being [[Magdalene College]] Boat Club.

West's older brother, Damian, is also an international oarsman,&lt;ref name="clapa" /&gt; who rowed for [[Oxford University Boat Club]] in the 1996 [[Boat Race]] and for Great Britain from 1993 to 1997.

[[City of Cambridge Rowing Club]] owns a men's eight named in West's honour: ''Kieran West, MBE''. The boat was originally owned by Christ's College, Cambridge, where West was studying during his first period at Cambridge.

==Personal life==
West was born with a [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip and palate]].&lt;ref name="clapa" /&gt; On 8 August 2009, West married Lourina Pretorius&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr K.M. West and Miss C.L.H. Pretorius|url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/engagements/58843/mr-k.m.-west-and-miss-c.l.h.-pretorius|accessdate=13 December 2017|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former student at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] from South Africa. The following month, he started work at [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]] in London, where he remains employed. The couple has a daughter.

In Minnesota, "Democratic-Farmer-Labor" is not a third party, but the Minnesota equivalent of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  In Minnesota, "Independent-Republican" was once used for the Minnesota equivalent of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (see [[Republican Party of Minnesota]]).

In North Dakota, "Democratic-NPL" is not a third party, but the North Dakota equivalent of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].  The full name for the party is the [[North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party]].

Third parties are linked only if they refer to specific third parties, and not just "independent" in general.

Otto Ege's greatest fame, however, came as a result of his book-breaking. Over a period of decades in the early 20th century, Ege systematically removed the pages of some 50 [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[medieval]] manuscripts,&lt;ref name="uscleaves"/&gt; and divided them into 40 unique compilation boxes,&lt;ref name="scatteredleaves"&gt;"[http://library2.usask.ca/ege/exhibit/1.htm Scattered Leaves: the Otto Ege Medieval Manuscript Collection]", University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as "[[Otto Ege Portfolios]]". These portfolios were in turn sold and distributed world wide.&lt;ref name="scatteredleaves"/&gt; Although strong profits were made from each sale, Ege defended his actions by stating, "Surely to allow a thousand people 'to have and to hold' an original manuscript leaf, and to get a thrill and understanding that comes only from actual and frequent contact with these art heritages, is justification enough for the scattering of fragments."&lt;ref name="porcheddu"&gt;Fred Porcheddu, "[http://www.arlisna.org/news/conferences/2006/proceedings/ses_12-porcheddu-handout2.pdf Otto F. Ege: Teacher, Collector, Biblioclast]", Art Libraries Society of North American, 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last several years, Prof. [[Peter Stoicheff]] of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] has been working to locate all existing Ege Portfolios, and to foster co-operation from their respective owners in creating an "Ege Medieval Manuscript Database" with the ultimate goal being the digital reconstruction of the complete books.&lt;ref name="symposium"&gt;"[http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/05-apr-29/news10.shtml Symposium to look at ancient pages]", University of Saskatchewan On Campus News, Volume 12, Number 17, April 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ege's personal collection, including 50 unbroken manuscript books, was in 2015 acquired by the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] (part of [[Yale University Library]]).&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;Mike Cummings, "[http://news.yale.edu/2015/11/15/beinecke-library-acquires-treasure-trove-medieval-manuscripts-famed-book-breaker  Beinecke Library acquires ‘treasure trove’ of medieval manuscripts from a famed ‘book breaker’]", YaleNews, November 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6521">'''Peer Peersson of Erlesunda''', also known as '''Per Erlesund''' and by his Latinized [[pen name]] '''Peter Petreius''' ([[Uppsala]], 1570 &amp;ndash; October 28, 1622, [[Stockholm]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomat, envoy to [[Muscovy]] and author of the ''History of the Grand Duchy of Muscovy'' (1615) that attempted to present a complete history of Russia from the foundation of [[Kievan Rus]] to the end of the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Biography==

Peer Peersson was born in the family of [[Uppsala Cathedral]] priest; his father, Per-Benedict Persson, later became the [[Diocese of Västerås|Bishop of Västerås]] and [[Diocese of Linköping|Linköping]]. Per Persson junior graduated from the King Johann School and joined the [[Magdeburg University]]. After a short period of dedicated studies Peersson slipped into a lifestyle of a [[Rake (character)|rake]], indulging in drinking and duels; in 1593 he was expelled from the university and ended up in jail for debts. He managed to return to Sweden and joined the office of Duke Charles, [[Sigismund of Sweden|King Sigismund's]] uncle, who ascended to the throne in 1604 as [[Charles IX of Sweden]].

In 1601 Peersson left Sweden for a four-year reconnaissance tour of Muscovy in the guise of a doctor. His dispatches to the court were reproduced by [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]] in his ''[[Historiarum sui temporis]]''. Back in Sweden, Peersson compiled his dispatches into a ''Fair and true relation'' on recent Russian past from [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan Grozny]] to the ascension of [[Vasili IV of Russia|Vasily Shuysky]]. The book was based exclusively on Peersson's own experience and on the oral narratives by contemporary Russians (Vasily Shuysky, [[Maria Nagaya]] and the [[retinue]] of [[False Dmitriy I]]) and Western witnesses ([[Caspar Fiedler]], [[Conrad Bussow]]). Peersson in real life tracked Bussow's activity with suspicion and recovered evidence of Bussow's treason that resulted in the defection of Swedish garrison in [[Narva]] (his allegations are contested by modern authors, e.g. Orchard&lt;ref&gt;Orchard, p.xxx&lt;/ref&gt;). Persson obtained the manuscript of Bussow's ''[[The Disturbed State of the Russian Realm]]'' (the first, 1614, version)&lt;ref&gt;Orchard, p.xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; and reused it in his own later works. Historians of the first half of 19th century incorrectly considered Peersson the primary source for Bussow's book until [[Arist Kunik]] (1849) and [[Sergey Solovyov]] (1858) restored Bussow in his own rights.&lt;ref&gt;Orchard, p. xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1607–1608 Peersson returned to Moscow as the king's envoy, seeking a military alliance between Sweden and Muscovy. When the treaty was signed, Peersson joined the Swedish corps of [[Jacob De la Gardie]] that was hired by tsar Vasily; he left Russia upon the completion of [[De la Gardie Campaign]] and returned in 1612, to [[Novgorod]]. In 1615 he was spotted in Denmark and Poland, collecting intelligence for the upcoming [[Polish–Swedish War (1617–1618)|War of 1617-1618]]. In the same year he published his ''[[masterpiece|opus magnum]]'', the  ''History of the Grand Duchy of Moscow''. In 1617 Persson was involved in signing the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] which was incorporated in the 1620 German edition of the ''History''. His death in [[Stockholm]] was, presumably, caused by [[Black Death#Recurrence|plague]].

==Critical assessment==

Modern Russian historians agree that the ''facts'' that occurred during Peersson's stay in Moscow were, generally, retold reliably although sometimes exaggerated (e. g. scenes of [[cannibalism]] on the streets of Moscow presented as eyewitness report). Peersson-Petreius was confident that [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Tsarevich Dimitri]] was indeed killed in [[Uglich]] in 1591; like [[Isaac Massa]], he condemned [[Boris Godunov]] for arranging the murder, yet Persson's story contains an unrealistic scene of an [[arson]] in Uglich and [[Moscow]], set up simultaneously to cover up the crime. [[False Dmitriy I]], according to Peersson, was indeed Grigory Otrepyev. Peersson's understanding of the general sequence of the [[Time of Troubles]] and their causes is very close to modern mainstream theory, but his description of contemporary events outside his own and his direct sources' reach is regarded as only partially credible.&lt;ref name=S471/&gt; Even the late 18th – early 19th century ''fiction'' authors criticized Peersonn for indiscriminate retelling of anecdotes of the [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Vegetable Lamb]] sort and his apparent pro-Swedish bias: "...should we even allow that Petreius was not influenced in his judgement by the politics of his own court, yet, as an author, he is liable to great exception: for the numberless fictions and gross misrepresentations which he retails in his Chronicle, prove extreme proneness to credulity."&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton, p. 744&lt;/ref&gt; His retelling of [[Kievan Rus]] chronicles, acquired through oral narrative, is loaded with extreme [[Rus' (people)#Normanist theory|normanist]] attitude, and not reliable at all.&lt;ref name=S471&gt;Shokarev, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

Peersson's account of social life in Russia, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], popular culture and traditions was harsh and unforgiving. It is nevertheless corroborated by independent, equally unforgiving memoirs by [[Giles Fletcher, the Elder]] (1591) and [[Samuel Collins (physician)|Samuel Collins]] (1671) and is representative of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] view of contemporary Muscovy.&lt;ref&gt;Shokarev, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prahlad Jani''' ({{lang-gu|પ્રહલાદ જાની}}), also known as '''Mataji''' or '''Chunriwala Mataji''', (born 13 August 1929) is an Indian [[breatharian]] [[sadhu|monk]] who claims to have [[Inedia|lived without food and water]] since 1940. He says that the goddess [[Durga|Amba]] sustains him.

==Early life==
Born Chunriwala Mataji, Jani grew up in Charada village in [[Mehsana]] district.&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"/&gt; According to Jani, he left his home in [[Rajasthan]] at the age of seven, and went to live in the jungle.&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt;

At the age of 12, Jani underwent a religious experience and became a follower of the Hindu goddess [[Durga|Amba]]. From that time, he chose to dress as a female devotee of Amba, wearing a red [[sari]]-like garment, jewellery and crimson flowers in his shoulder-length hair.&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt; Jani is commonly known as ''[[Mataji]]'' ("[a manifestation of] [[Durga|The Great Mother]]"). Jani believes that the goddess provides him a liquid sustenance&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt; or water which drops down through a hole in his [[palate]], allowing him to live without food or drink.&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"/&gt;

Since the 1970s, Jani has lived as a [[hermit]] in a cave in the rainforest near the [[Gujarat]]i temple of [[Durga|Ambaji]], awakening at 4am each day and spending most of his time [[meditation|meditating]].&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt;

==Investigations==
Two observational studies of Jani have been conducted, one in 2003 and one in 2010, both involving Dr Sudhir Shah, a neurologist at the [[Sterling Hospitals]] in [[Ahmedabad]], India, who had studied people claiming to have exceptional abilities, including other fasters such as Hira Ratan Manek. In both cases the investigators confirmed Jani's ability to survive healthily without food and water during the testing periods, although neither study was submitted to a scientific journal.&lt;ref name="guardian_2010-05-18"/&gt; When questioned six days into the 2010 experiment, the [[DRDO]] spokesperson announced that the study's findings would be "confidential" until results were established,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/drdo-watching-man-who-hasnt-eaten-in-70-yrs/612181/1 |title=DRDO watching man who hasn’t eaten 'in 70 yrs’ |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further official press release by the team stated that any inside analysis information may be disclosed only at the discretion of the principal investigator, DIPAS.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Uninvolved doctors and other critics have questioned the validity of the studies&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; and stated their belief that, although people can survive for days without food or water, it is not possible to survive for years,&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/yogi-beaten-by-bear-necessities-of-life-without-food-20100514-v3fd.html "Yogi beaten by bear necessities of life without food"] Glenda Kwek, 14 May 2010, Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; especially since [[glucose]], a substrate critical to brain function, isn't provided.&lt;ref&gt;Magistretti, Pierre et al.

===2003 tests===
In 2003, Dr Sudhir Shah and other physicians at [[Sterling Hospitals]], Ahmedabad, India observed Jani for 10 days. He stayed in a sealed room. Doctors say that he passed no [[urine]] or [[feces|stool]] during the observation, but that urine appeared to form in the bladder.&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |title = Fasting fakir flummoxes physicians |accessdate = 2008-06-07 |author = Rajeev Khanna | date=25 November 2003 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hospital spokesperson said that Jani was physically normal, but noted that a hole in the palate was an abnormal condition.&lt;ref name="Khanna-bbc"/&gt; The fact that Jani's weight dropped slightly during the 10 days has cast some doubt on his claim to go indefinitely without food.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Dean|title=Man claims to have had no food or drink for 70 years |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7645857/Man-claims-to-have-had-no-food-or-drink-for-70-years.html|accessdate=11 November 2010|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=28 April 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 tests===
From 22 April until 6 May 2010, Prahlad Jani was again observed and tested by Dr Sudhir Shah and a team of 35 researchers from the Indian [[Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences]] (DIPAS), as well as other organizations.&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mirror |first=Ahmedabad |url=http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=3&amp;contentid=201004272010042703191596a47ffb68 |title=Man who lives on air undergoes defence tests |publisher=Ahmedabadmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501001050/http://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/index.aspx?page=article&amp;sectid=3&amp;contentid=201004272010042703191596a47ffb68 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wusa9.com/news/watercooler/story.aspx?storyid=100671&amp;catid=148 |title=Hermit Claims 70 Years Survival Without Food |publisher=Wusa9.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/defence-study-on-ascetics-claim-of-surviving-on-air_100354820.html |title=Defence study on ascetic’s claim of surviving on air |publisher=Thaindian.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of [[DIPAS]] said that the results of the observations could "tremendously benefit mankind", as well as "soldiers, victims of calamities and astronauts", all of whom may have to survive without food or water for long durations.&lt;ref name="dnaindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_yogi-sans-food-gives-medical-fraternity-food-for-thought_1376062 |title=Yogi sans food gives medical fraternity food for thought |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests were again conducted at [[Sterling Hospitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerala365.com/political-news-events/prahlad-jani-breaks-a-recordno-food-water-for-74-years-prahlad-janiabout-prahlad-jani/ |title=Prahlad Jani Breaks a Record,No Food &amp; Water for 74 years |publisher=Kerala365.com |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Anil Gupta of SRISTI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SRISTI |url=http://www.sristi.org/cms/ |title=SRISTI official site |publisher=Sristi.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved in monitoring the tests, described the team as being "intrigued" by Jani's [[kriya]]s apparently allowing him to control his body's physiological functions.&lt;ref name="ibn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/man-survives-without-food-water-for-65-yrs/114188-3.html |title=Man survives without food, water for 65 yrs - India News - IBNLive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team studied Jani with daily clinical examinations, blood tests, and scans. Round-the-clock surveillance was reportedly followed using multiple [[CCTV]] cameras and personal observation. The researchers say that Jani was taken out of the sealed room for tests and exposure to sun under continuous video recording.&lt;ref name="dna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 |title=Experts baffled as Mataji's medical reports are normal |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the researchers, Jani's only contact with any form of fluid was said to be during gargling and occasional bathing starting from the 5th day of observation, and the toilet in Jani's room was sealed to test his claim that he did not need to urinate or defecate.&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt;

After fifteen days of observation during which he reportedly did not eat, drink or go to the toilet, all medical tests on Jani were reported as normal&lt;ref name="dna"/&gt; and researchers described him as being in better health than someone half his age.&lt;ref name="Rawstorne"/&gt; The doctors reported that although the amount of liquid in Jani's bladder fluctuated and that Jani appeared "able to generate urine in his bladder",&lt;ref name="ibn"/&gt; he did not pass urine. Based on Jani's reported levels of [[leptin]] and [[ghrelin]], two appetite-related hormones, DRDO researchers posited that Jani may be demonstrating an extreme form of adaptation to starvation and water restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Radha Sharma, TNN, 17 Jul 2010, 05.41am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-17/ahmedabad/28293767_1_medical-team-leptin-claims |title=Fast-hungry Mataji's claim endorsed |publisher=The Times of India |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; DIPAS stated in 2010 that further studies were planned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manas Dasgupta |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |title=DIPAS concludes observational study on ‘Mataji' |publisher=Thehindu.com |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deshgujarat.com/2010/05/06/15-day-test-on-gujarats-miracle-yogi-concludes-researchers-amazed/ |title=Tests on Gujarat’s miracle Yogi concludes,researchers amazed! |publisher=Deshgujarat.com |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; including investigations into how metabolic waste material is eliminated from Jani's body, from where he gets his energy for sustenance, and how he maintains his hydration status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_study-proves-gujarat-man-s-claim-of-living-without-food-water_1411144 |title=Study proves Gujarat man's claim of living without food, water |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=17 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reactions====
Dr. Michael Van Rooyen, director of the [[Harvard Humanitarian Initiative]], dismissed the observation results as "impossible", observing that the bodies of profoundly malnourished people quickly consume their own body's resources, resulting in [[liver failure]], [[tachycardia]] and [[heart strain]]. A spokeswoman for the [[American Dietetic Association]] stated that, "The bottom line is that even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous. You need food to function."&lt;ref name="Abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |title=Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani, Man Who Doesn't Eat or Drink |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition researcher Peter Clifton also disagreed with study results, accusing the research team of "cheating" by allowing Jani to gargle and bathe, and stating that a human of average weight would die after "15 to 20 days" without water.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; People who avoid food and water to emulate mystical figures often die.&lt;ref name=SMH/&gt; [[Sanal Edamaruku]] characterized the experiment as a farce for allowing Jani to move out of the CCTV cameras' field of view, claiming that video footage showed Jani was allowed to receive devotees and to leave the sealed test room for sunbathing. Edamaruku also said that the gargling and bathing activities were insufficiently monitored. Edamaruku was denied access to the site where the tests were conducted in both 2003 and 2010,&lt;ref name="guardian_2010-05-18"&gt;

'''Ramón García Hernando''' (November 28, 1961, [[Bilbao]], [[Biscay]], [[Spain]]) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[radio]] and [[television presenter]]. He is also known as '''Ramontxu''' or '''Ramonchu''' in Spain, which in [[euskera]] is a [[colloquial]] form of calling a person named "Ramón".

==Professional career==
His long professional career and his versatility have made Ramon García an indisputable standard in the Spanish media. 
 
His career started in the radio, after entering a DJ contest in [[Biscay]] in 1983 and being proclaimed the winner by the [[Cadena SER]] managers. He also worked for other famous stations, such as [[Los 40 Principales]] and Radio Euskadi.

He then jumped into the TV scene in 1989, having a small role in [[Euskal Telebista]]. Finally, he emerged as a TV star in 1991 when signing for [[Televisión Española]].

Hosting very popular TV shows and presenting various radio programmes, his role in the ''Campanadas'' from [[Puerta del Sol]] every 31 December midnight for more than a decade made him a well known star. He has won several prizes in Spain, including 5 ''[[TP de Oro]]''.

In 2007 and after 15 years working for TVE, he signed for [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] to host the Spanish version of [[Are you smarter than a 5th grader?]]. The announcement of his presence on the ''Campanadas night'' for Antena 3 has been a nationwide shock in Spain, as his role on TVE was seen as a [[Christmas]] tradition.

Rebecca was eight years old. [[Eunice Kanenstenhawi Williams|Eunice Williams]] was captured in this same raid, as was her father, the [[John Williams (Reverend)|Rev.

Unlike Eunice, Rebecca Kellogg returned to British colonial territory as an older woman. She married Ben Ashley and she translated for several Congregational missionaries in Indian missions, including the [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Rev. Jonathan Edwards]] at the Stockbridge Indian Mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Howard|first=Joy A.

Rebecca Kellogg Ashley died in 1757 with the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] Haudenosaunee in [[Oquaga]], New York. She did not leave any writings that are known but her life is visible in the writings of the missionaries with whom she worked. The [[Gideon Hawley|Rev.

'''Riane Tennenhaus Eisler''' (born 22 July 1931) is a [[cultural historian]], [[Systems scientists|systems scientist]], educator, attorney, speaker, and author whose work on cultural transformation has inspired scholars and social activists. Her research has impacted many fields, including history, literature, philosophy, art, economics, psychology, sociology, education, organizational development, political science, and healthcare.

==Early life==
Eisler was born in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]], fled from the [[Nazi seizure of power|Nazis]] with her parents to [[Cuba]] as a small child, and later emigrated to the United States. She obtained degrees in sociology and law from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

==Career==
Eisler taught pioneering classes on women and the law at UCLA; and now teaches in the graduate Transformative Leadership Program at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]. She is Editor-in-Chief of the ''Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies'' at the [[University of Minnesota]] and President of the [[Center for Partnership Studies]], dedicated to research and education on the partnership model introduced by Eisler's research. She is also a member of the [[World Future Council]].

==Partnership and domination models==
Eisler proposes that new social paradigms are needed that transcend the limitations of conventional social categories such as religious vs. secular, right vs. left, capitalist vs. communist, East vs. West, and [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] vs. [[Industrialisation|industrial]] or [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]]. She notes that societies in all these categories have been repressive and violent, and that none answer the question of what kinds of institutions and beliefs support more equitable and peaceful relations.  In addressing this question, Eisler's multidisciplinary, cross-cultural research resulted in a new conceptual framework for understanding and improving social systems: ''the partnership-domination continuum.'' The identification of the ''partnership model'' and the ''domination model'' as two underlying social configurations requires a new analytical approach that includes social features that are currently ignored or marginalized, such as the social construction of human/nature connections, parent/child relations, gender roles and relations, and the way we assess the value of the work of caring for people and nature.

=== Domination culture ===
She introduced the term ''[[Dominator culture|domination culture]]'' to describe a system of top-down rankings ultimately backed up by fear or force - man over man, man over woman, race over race, religion over religion, and man over nature. The configuration of the domination system has four mutually supporting core components: Top-down control in both families and states or tribes, and all institutions in between; Rigid male dominance—and with this, the devaluation by both men and women of anything stereotypically considered "feminine," including care and caregiving; The acceptance, even idealization, of violence as a means of imposing one's will on others; A system of beliefs that presents relations of dominating or being dominated as inevitable and desirable. Examples of societies that orient closely to the domination model include [[Nazi Germany]], [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]'s [[Iran]], and earlier cultures where chronic violence and despotic rule were the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = First|title = The Chalice and the Blade: Our History, Our Future|url = https://www.amazon.com/Chalice-Blade-Our-History-Future/dp/0062502891/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1445824741&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Chalice+and+the+Blade|publisher = HarperOne|date = 1988-09-21|location = New York, NY|isbn = 9780062502896|first = Riane|last = Eisler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership society ===
By contrast, the configuration of the partnership system consists of the following four mutually supporting core components: A more democratic and egalitarian structure in both the family and state or tribe; equal partnership between women and men, and with this a high valuing in women and men, as well as in social and economic policy, of traits and activities stereotypically considered feminine, such as care and caregiving; a low degree of abuse and violence, because they are not needed to maintain rigid rankings of domination; A system of beliefs that presents relations of partnership and mutual respect as normal and desirable.

Examples of partnership-oriented societies include the Teduray, a tribal society studied by the University of California anthropologist Stuart Schlegel;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Wisdom From A Rainforest|last = Schlegel|first = S.|publisher = University of Georgia Press|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; agrarian societies such as the Minangkabau, studied by the University of Pennsylvania anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women at the Center|last = Sanda|first = P.R.|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and technologically advanced ones like Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where there is a more democratic and egalitarian structure in both the family and the state, more equal partnership between men and women (for example, women are 40-50 percent of national legislators), and more caring social policies such as universal health care, paid parental leave, and high quality early childhood education, as well as the rejection of violence in both intimate and international relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|last = Eisler|first = Riane|publisher = Berrett-Koehler|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership/domination continuum ===
In comparing partnership and domination systems, Eisler analyzes the androcracy (governance of social organization dominated by males) of Indo-European and other societies, versus greater orientation to the partnership model (as distinct from matriarchy) for the social organization of Neolithic Europe and the later Minoan civilization that flourished in prehistoric Bronze Age Crete.

To support the idea that neither men nor women dominated one another, Eisler cites archeological evidence from southeast Europe, especially Crete, drawing much from the research of archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[James Mellaart]], [[Nikolaos Platon]], [[V. Gordon Childe|Vere Gordon Childe]], and Nanno Marinatos. She also draws heavily from cross-cultural studies, such as [[Douglas P. Fry]]'s work on foraging cultures that orient to the partnership model, noting that for most of our history humans lived in foraging groups.

Her work has allowed many other scholars to apply partnership/domination and cultural transformation conceptual frameworks to fields ranging from politics and economics to religion, business, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pubs.lib.umn.edu/ijps/vol1/iss1/3/|title = Human Possibilities: The Interaction of Biology and Culture |date = June 4, 2015 |accessdate = |website = Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies |publisher = University of Minnesota |last = Eisler |first = Raine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No society orients completely to a domination system or a partnership system. It is always a matter of degree in what Eisler calls a partnership-domination continuum. But with these configurations in mind, much that otherwise seems random and disconnected begins to fall into place – including how economic systems have been developed, as Eisler documents in ''The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics'' , as well as in many articles and book chapters, including "Economics as If Caring Matters" in Challenge.

==Books==
Eisler's international bestseller ''The Chalice and The Blade: Our History, Our Future'' (Harper Collins San Francisco, 1987) was hailed by anthropologist [[Ashley Montagu]] as "the most important book since Darwin's Origin of Species [sic]". The book has sold 500,000 copies. It has been translated into 26 languages, including most European languages and Chinese, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Hebrew, Japanese, and Arabic.

Her 2007 book, ''The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics'', proposes a new approach to economics that gives visibility and value to the essential human work of caring for people and the planet. It has been hailed by [[Desmond Tutu|Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] as "a template for the better world we have been so urgently seeking," [[Peter Senge]] as "desperately needed," and by [[Gloria Steinem]] as "revolutionary."

In 2014, Eisler co-authored ''Transforming Interprofessional Partnerships: A New Framework for Nursing and Partnership-Based Health Care'' with University of Minnesota professor Teddie Potter, which provides healthcare professionals with the tools to re-examine current healthcare systems and build a more caring, sustainable system. *The book was the winner of the 2015 Capstone International Book Award and a 2014 American Journal of Nursing Book Award.

Eisler's other books include the award-winning ''The Power of Partnership'' and ''Tomorrow's Children'', as well as ''Sacred Pleasure: Sex, Myth, and the Politics of the Body – New Paths to Power and Love'', an exploration of the origins of human violence, and ''Women, Men, and the Global Quality of Life'', which statistically documents the key role of the status of women in a nation's general quality of life.

==Documentaries==
In 2011, Tiroir A Films (TAF) based their documentary, ''Mother, Caring for 7 Billion'' on the theories of Riane Eisler.

==Activities==
Riane Eisler keynotes conferences worldwide, and is a consultant to business and government on applications of the partnership model introduced in her work. International venues have included [[Germany]] at the invitation of Prof. [[Rita Süssmuth]], [[President of the Bundestag]] (the German Parliament) and [[Daniel Goeudevert]] (Chair of Volkswagen International); [[Colombia]], invited by the [[Mayor of Bogota]]; and the [[Czech Republic]], invited by [[Václav Havel]] (President of the Czech Republic). In 2013, Eisler was invited to speak during a Congressional Briefing on "The Economic Return from Investing in Care Work and Early Childhood Education"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHPgcDBNTf4&lt;/ref&gt; and to speak for the United States State Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.lib.umn.edu/ijps/&lt;/ref&gt;

Riane Eisler is a founding member of the [[General Evolution Research Group]] (GERG), a fellow of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] and [[World Business Academy]], a member of the [[Club of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubofrome.org/?p=5916 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217182315/http://www.clubofrome.org/?p=5916 |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Councilor of the World Future Council in Europe (link) She is a member of the [[World Commission on Global Consciousness and Spirituality]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalspirit.org/councils.html{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and other spiritual leaders. She is also co-founder of the Spiritual Alliance to Stop Intimate Violence (SAIV). She is the president of the [[Center for Partnership Studies]], dedicated to research and education. In 2003 she was one of the signers of the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]], an initiative of the Center for Partnership Studies, dedicated to research and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisler was one of the founders of the ''[[Women's Rights Law Reporter]]'', the first [[legal periodical]] to focus exclusively on [[women's rights]]. She is also an active Global Council Member at the [[International Museum of Women]].&lt;ref&gt;International Museum of Women Global Council, {{cite web |url=http://imow.org/about/globalcouncil/index |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521084638/http://www.imow.org/about/globalcouncil/index |archivedate=2010-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Eisler became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}  The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Riane Eisler inspired Professor [[Min Jiayin]] of the Institute of Philosophy of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] to publish and edit ''The Chalice and the Blade in Chinese Culture'' (published in 1995 by China Social Sciences Publishing House).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/The-chalice-blade-Chinese-culture/dp/7500417411&lt;/ref&gt; Min Jiayin's book tested Eisler's [[cultural transformation theory]] in Chinese culture, and found that there was also a shift from partnership to domination in Asian prehistory.

In her 2008 book, ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership'', Mary Kirk uses Eisler's cultural transformation theory to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology.&lt;ref name="kirkma"&gt;Kirk, Mary. (2008). ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership''. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. {{ISBN|978-1-59904-786-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gender and Information Technology'' explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems—as reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business)--might help us move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide.&lt;ref name="kirkma" /&gt;

Riane Eisler inspired Professor Antonella Riem and a group of scholars based at the University of Udine, [http://all.uniud.it/?page_id=195 the Partnership Studies Group (PSG)], to develop significant multi- and inter-disciplinary research, which investigates the presence and meaning of partnership/dominator configurations within World Literatures in English, Language, Education and Arts.

==Honors==
Eisler has received many honors, including the [[Humanist Pioneer Award]] and the first Alice Paul ERA award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-10-film-review-mother-caring-for-7-billion |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429185204/http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-10-film-review-mother-caring-for-7-billion |archive-date=2014-04-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]]'s Distinguished Peace Leadership Award for "demonstrating courageous leadership in the cause of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Peace Leadership Award|url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/awards-&amp;-contests/dpl-award/index.htm|publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation|accessdate=24 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101135445/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/awards-%26-contests/dpl-award/index.htm|archivedate=1 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only woman selected for inclusion in ''Macrohistory and Macrohistorians'' for her work as a cultural historian and evolutionary theorist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metafuture.org/Books/MacrohistoryandMacrohistorians.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Eisler also serves on the Advisory Council of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]].

==Center for Partnership Studies==
The [[Center for Partnership Studies]] (CPS), located in [[Pacific Grove, CA]]., was established in 1987 for the purpose of researching, developing, and disseminating education on the partnership model as developed by Riane Eisler.

==Caring Economy Campaign==
The Caring Economy Campaign is a project of the Center for Partnership studies that is focused on building a partnership system with clear measures of the economic benefits of the work of caring for people and nature. To that end, the Caring Economy Campaign has developed Social Wealth Economic Indicators (SWEIs) to help guide policy-makers in developing an economic system that takes into account unpaid or underpaid labor, overall health and wellbeing, and the general welfare of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://caringeconomy.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAIV: The Spiritual Alliance to Stop Intimate Violence==
The mission of The Spiritual Alliance to Stop Intimate Violence (SAIV) is to stop intimate violence — the training ground for the violence of war, terrorism, political repression, and crime. SAIV was founded by Riane Eisler with Nobel Peace Laureate [[Betty Williams (Northern Ireland)|Betty Williams]] and is a project of the Center for Partnership Studies, a not-for-profit 501(C)(3) organization recognized as a Non-Governmental Organization by the United Nations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">'''Samuel Glasstone''' (May 3, 1897 &amp;ndash; Nov 16, 1986) authored over 40 popular [[textbook]]s on [[physical chemistry]], [[reaction rate]]s, [[nuclear weapon]]s [[Effects of nuclear explosions|effects]], [[nuclear reactor]] engineering, [[Mars]], [[outer space|space]] sciences, the environmental effects of nuclear energy and [[nuclear testing]]. One reviewer describe Glasstone as "perhaps one of the best technical writers of the last century."&lt;ref&gt;http://united_states.vacationbookreview.com/Kansas/Ellsworth/&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel Glasstone was born on May 3, 1897.&lt;ref&gt;http://glasstone.blogspot.com/2006/03/samuel-glasstone-and-philip-j-dolan.html&lt;/ref&gt; He received two doctorates, in 1922 and 1926 (PhD and DSc), in chemistry at London University.
Glasstone discovered the [[C–H···O interaction]] in 1937.

Perhaps his best known book, co-authored with [[Philip J. Dolan]], was ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', which came out in three editions between 1950 and 1977 (originally titled ''The Effects of Atomic Weapons''). The book, published by the US government, is considered one of the most authoritative texts on the effects of nuclear explosions. One of his other popular books was ''The Sourcebook on Atomic Energy'', published in 1950, and translated in many countries.

==Biography==
Tompkins was born in [[Leighton Buzzard]] in 1971. She studied painting at the [[Glasgow School of Art]], and graduated in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sue Tompkins|url=http://pica.org/artists/sue-tompkins/|publisher=Portland Institute for Contemporary Art|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 she has worked collaboratively with the collective Elizabeth Go (Victoria Morton, Sarah Tripp, Hayley Tompkins and Cathy Wilkes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buonpadre|first1=Silvia|title=10 Female Artists from Scotland You Should Know About|url=http://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/scotland/articles/10-female-artists-from-scotland-you-should-know-about/|publisher=The Culture Trip|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has held multiple exhibitions at The Modern Institute.&lt;ref name="frieze"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgie|first1=Jennifer|title=In Other Words|journal=[[frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]]|date=April 2006|issue=98|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/in_other_words/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sue Tompkins and STANDARD (Oslo) at The Modern Institute, Glasgow|url=http://moussemagazine.it/tompkins-standard-moderninstitute/|work=Mousse Contemporary Art Magazine|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sue Tompkins uses the spoken and written word delivered in a deceptively simple and direct fashion. The written word comes first: she accumulates copious notes over a period of time then edits and refines them to create disjointed yet succinct texts that combine repeated words with constructed phrases to evoke imagery, emotion and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/sound/tompkins.html|title=ubuweb|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tompkins had an interesting way of coming to her unique style of work in art school:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I studied painting. And then by the fourth year at Glasgow School of Art, I remember really thinking, I really don’t know what to paint. I really have no idea. I just don’t know what I’m doing. There was a patch where I remember thinking, god, I just want to go and sit in the library and look at stuff. I was really into looking at art. I really liked looking at art books. So my degree show ended up being this big tissue paper installation, really quite big on the wall. I used to go the library and they had these little rooms that you could book. And I used to just book a room and take a massive stack of books off the shelves, really random, but everything I liked – it could be ''Frieze'' magazine or ''Artforum'' or it could be Picasso’s greatest hits. I would go into this little room and I had a dictaphone and I used to just record myself looking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/24437-sue-tompkins-interview-borealis-festival-glasgow-international|title=The Quietus|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tompkins also provided the vocals for indie rock band [[Life Without Buildings]], along with other students of the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine described Tompkins' vocals as "nervously chirped evocative phrases" and credited her as the band's central attraction. Following their debut album ''Any Other City'' in 2001, the band split up.&lt;ref name="frieze" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unsung: The 100 Greatests Bands You've (probably) Never Heard|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=August 2009|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGaz0_gZPzIC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Sue%20Tompkins%22%20artist&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzanne Segal''' (1955–1997) was a writer and teacher about [[spiritual enlightenment]], known for her sudden experience of [[Self-Realization]] which she wrote about in her book ''Collision With the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self''.

In addition to gaining note in the spiritual community, Segal became a model case of the [[dissociative disorder|dissociative]] condition known as [[depersonalization disorder]] (DPD).  Along her journey some therapists formally diagnosed her with DPD, while others did not have clear explanations.

Two years after her shift into a "sense of unity", Segal relapsed into the uncomfortable state of constant anxiety she had first experienced.  At this point she returned to exploring psychological themes from her childhood which included [[recovered memories]] of abuse and persistent [[migraines]].  Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Segal's health began rapidly deteriorating, and she was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor.  She died two months later that year&lt;!--Feeling Unreal has 1997, Strangers to Ourselves has 1998)--&gt;, leaving many questions about the root cause of her experience unanswered.

==Early life==
Segal's childhood was filled with attempts to evoke a state of psychological detachment from her identity.  She experienced moments which she described as "vastness" after repeating her name as a mantra. She started studying [[Transcendental Meditation]] and found the experience similarly awakening, but left the organization when she began to dislike the rigidity of the format.  Segal moved to California and received a degree in English from the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].  She then moved to Paris, where she had a daughter, and where her marked depersonalization experience began.&lt;ref name = Stranger&gt;{{cite book |author=Abugel J|title=Stranger To My Self: Inside Depersonalization: The Hidden Epidemic |publisher=Johns Road Publishing |location= |year=2011 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=nvlS79wsfy0C&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 256–60]|isbn=0-615-38523-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1986 she enrolled in the [[John F. Kennedy University]] in their clinical psychology masters program&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; transferring to the [[Wright Institute]]'s PhD program in the fall of 1987.  She completed her dissertation and received her doctorate in Psychology in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;ProQuest, Dissertation Database, ref# AAT9127791&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment experience==
One day in 1982, while boarding a bus in Paris, the 27-year-old Segal experienced a sudden shift in her consciousness.  She described the experience in her book, ''Collisions With the Infinite'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I lifted my right foot to step up into the bus and collided head-on with an invisible force that entered my awareness like a silently exploding stick of dynamite, blowing the door of my usual consciousness open and off its hinges, splitting me in two. In the gaping space that appeared, what I had previously called 'me' was forcefully pushed out of its usual location inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to the left of my head. 'I' was now behind my body looking out at the world without using the body's eyes."&lt;ref name = Collisions49&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Segal described this first period of her experience as "witnessing", since she was aware of herself but also critically detached from it.  This was tremendously unpleasant for her, full of anxiety and fear:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The moment the eyes opened the next morning, the mind exploded in worry. Is this insanity? Pscyhosis? Schizophrenia? Is this what people call a nervous breakdown? Depression? What happened? And would it ever stop? ...The mind was in agony as it tried valiantly to make sense of something it could never comprehend, and the body responded to the anguish of the mind by locking itself into survival mode, adrenaline pumping, senses fine-tuned, finding and responding to the threat of annihilation in every moment."&lt;ref name = Collisions49/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Having a background in [[meditation]], Segal questioned whether this break could be the first step in a positive journey but dismissed it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The thought did arise that perhaps this experience of witnessing was the state of Cosmic Consciousness Maharishi had described long before as the first stage of awakened awareness. But the mind instantly discarded this possibility because it seemed impossible that the hell realm I was inhabiting could have anything to do with Cosmic Consciousness."&lt;ref name = Collisions49/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the years after her break Segal continued to function with seeming normalcy, completing a doctorate in psychology at the [[Wright Institute]].&lt;ref name = Collisions102&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  She continued to feel completely depersonalized, literally as if her own name did not refer to anyone.&lt;ref name = Feeling&gt;{{cite book |author=Abugel J; Simeon D |title=Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2008 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONLyq-mVLuIC&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 143–5] |isbn=0-19-538521-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She described it as if her "...body, mind, speech, thoughts, and emotions were all empty; they had no ownership, no person behind them. I was utterly bereft of all my previous notions of reality".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 144; as quoted in Simeon &amp; Abugel, 2006, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Segal's state of mind terrified her, and she sought advice from California's [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] community. Buddhism intentionally cultivates loss of ego and a sense of emptiness and oneness, and spiritual teachers tried to help Segal see her condition positively. Several even congratulated her: "This is a wonderful experience. It has to stay eternally with you. This is perfect freedom. You have become (''moksha'') of the realized sages," read one letter she received.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 122; as quoted in Simeon &amp; Abugel, 2006, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve years after her initial break, Segal dramatically entered another phase of her experience, centered around a sense of unity of perception between herself and the world: &lt;blockquote&gt; "In the midst of a particularly eventful week, I was driving north to meet some friends when I suddenly became aware that I was driving through myself.  For years there had been no self at all, yet here on this road everything was myself, and I was driving through me to arrive where I already was.  In essence, I was going nowhere because I was everywhere already.  The infinite emptiness I knew myself to be was now apparent as the infinite substance of everything I saw."&lt;ref name = Collisions49/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  This sense of cognitive and spiritual oneness remained with Segal for two years, up through the publishing of ''Collisions'' in 1996.

==Spirituality==
&lt;!---===Exploration===
On the path to understanding her condition Segal met with many noted spiritual teachers who helped her to accept her condition and see it in a positive light.  Among them were Ramana Maharishi, Papaji, Gangaji, Jean Klein, Andrew Cohen, Christopher Titmuss, and Reb Anderson.  Many of the teachers were excited about Segal's state of mind and recognized her as having achieved a state which many sought to attain through yours of careful study.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}---&gt;

===Analysis===
Segal's story also received attention by many writers and publications.  ''Collisions'' was reviewed by [[Yoga Journal]] magazine in 1997, the reviewer writing, "This frank and engaging account is a fascinating view of the unfolding of a realization without a spiritual practice or intention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Yoga Journal | date = Mar–Apr 1997 | volume = 133  |issn = 0191-0965 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SOkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 115–6] | title = Book review - ''Collisions with the infinite''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2004 book ''The Biology of Transcendence'' tried to characterize Segal's state of mind during her second phase of union:  "[It was] fusion with 'the vastness' and her discovery that the vastness perceived its universe through her own sensory system, which was at that point the sensory system of the vastness itself...[she] essentially perceived the universe perceiving itself, but without her, that perception did not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Biology of Transcendence:  A Blueprint of the Human Spirit | last = Pearce | first = JC | publisher = Inner Traditions/Bear &amp; Company | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-59477-016-6 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=-nHZyZ7f_YYC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 79]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 graduate dissertation by Arvin Paul used Segal's experience as an example of "Shift/s in the Locus of Identity Upon Initial Awakening", "a shift from the conventional sense of self to the uninvolved witness, and/or allpervasive presence, and/or boundless spaciousness, and/or pure awareness, and/or Being, and/or emptiness/void, and/or the Self, and/or the simple recognition of nonseparateness."  Paul quotes Segal:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"That recognition doesn’t change who you really are, ever. You have always been That. And yes, there is a way that the Vastness Itself can perceive Itself so directly, without any fogging or shadowing or taking anything else to be who you are. I guess you could call it a waking up, but what seems most important to convey is that this is who everyone is all the time whether the direct awareness of it is there or not."&lt;ref name = awakening&gt;{{cite book |author=Lumiere-Winns J; Lumiere LM |title=The Awakening West: Conversations With Today's New Western Spiritual Leaders |publisher=Fair Winds Press (MA) |location= |year=2003 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=jBLUI0oS794C&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 269–71] |isbn=1-59233-010-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Segal was interviewed for the chapter devoted to her in the 2003 book ''The Awakening West'' by Lynn Marie Lumiere and John Lumiere-Wins.&lt;ref name = awakening/&gt;

===Segal's own teaching===
After Segal's second shift she began sharing her insights with the public and with a group of psychologists in a "training group". She says, " I started training groups for therapists because I want this to be conveyed to those who are in the business of trying to help end suffering". She wants people to see "things to be what they are" instead of pathologizing "a broad range of human experience".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience with depersonalization disorder==
{{main|Depersonalization disorder}}

After her initial break, Segal sought to determine what had happened to her and consulted various psychologists and psychiatrists.&lt;ref name = Collisions101&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though some had no clear explanation for the experience, one labelled it [[depersonalization disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; stating "I don't know what else it could be but symptoms of [[depersonalization]]".  Segal went on to read up on depersonalization, [[derealization]], and [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], finding some related to her experience but none were a perfect fit and they ultimately failed to capture the sensation of lacking a self in conjunction with normal, or even improved functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p.92-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Segal's story was profiled in the 2006 book ''Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self'' by Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel.&lt;ref name = Feeling/&gt;  It was suggested for a book review in The Journal of the [[American Psychological Association]] that rather than representing depersonalization, Segal's experiences may represent a [[dissociative disorder]].&lt;ref name = review&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Waugaman | first1 = R. M. | title = Book Review: FEELING UNREAL: DEPERSONALIZATION DISORDER AND THE LOSS OF SELF. By Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugel. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, 242 pp., paperback $16.95 | doi = 10.1177/0003065109349506 | journal = Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1504–1508 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 book ''Stranger to My Self: Inside Depersonalization; the Hidden Epidemic'' by Jeffrey Abugel contextualized Segal's experience as following: "Sometimes, however, even a person well-versed in eastern philosophy may find themselves depersonalized in a way that seems to be anything but part of the road to enlightenment."&lt;ref name = Stranger/&gt;  ''Stranger'' noted that Segal's reportedly sudden depersonalization experience was part of a longer—possibly compulsive—history of searching for and at times experiencing that phenomenon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a young girl, Segal would sometimes repeat her own name in her head over and over.  Eventually, "a threshold was crossed and the identity, as that name, broke like a ship released suddenly from its mooring to float untethered on the ocean waves...Vastness appeared...There was no person to whom that name referred, no identity as that name.  No one."  Then came fear, eventually followed by a return to normalcy.  But the compulsion to do the same thing once again always returned.  Many people with DPD have cited similar early life incidents.  They may involve repeating words until they lose their meaning, or looking intently in the mirror until an overwhelming sense of strangeness emerges.  Usually these episodes pass, are forgotten, and remain in the realm of youthful mind games.&lt;ref name = Stranger/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet for Segal, as she became older the episodes became much more prominent rather than less.  Segal's autobiography was completed in 1996 and she had begun giving presentations and leading weekly dialogues as well as a "training group" for therapists.  By late spring Segal began having even more intense experiences in which, "the vastness became even vaster to itself."&lt;ref name = Afterword&gt;[[#Collisions|Segal]], 1996, p. 173-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The experiences entranced her but became increasingly disruptive.  By the end of the summer she was exhausted, and doctors encouraged her to rest.  Around the same time, she noticed that the fear from years before had returned.

Suzanne spent that fall at her home in Stinson Beach, California. During this period she recovered memories of childhood abuse.  Spiritual teacher [[Stephan Bodian]], who counseled Segal during that time wrote, "They seemed to explain some of the fear she had experienced during the 10 lonely years of being no one before realizing that she was everything. When I suggested that perhaps the fear originated from a part of herself that was split off or dissociated from conscious awareness, she immediately agreed."&lt;ref name = Afterword/&gt;

''Stranger'' documented this period as a retreat from the earlier spiritual themes that had defined her experience.  "As a psychologist, she was well tutored in a possible ramification of childhood abuse--dissociation.  Once again, Segal began to perceive things differently, this time from the psychological viewpoint rather than that of transcendent spirituality."&lt;ref name = Stranger/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Segal did not have time to discover what the source of her dramatic shifts in perception had been.  By February 1997, at the age of 42, her physical and mental capabilities began to quickly decline.  She entered the hospital on February 27, and doctors discovered a malignant brain tumor, having surgery but refusing [[chemotherapy]] or [[Radiation therapy|radiation]].&lt;ref name = Stranger/&gt;

On March 10 she married her fiancé Steve Kruszynski.  After the wedding they traveled to Oklahoma to seek out alternative treatments, but Segal's debilitation returned during the trip and they had to return home, entering a coma several days later.&lt;ref name = Afterword/&gt;

She died on the morning of Tuesday, April 1.  Bodian described her funeral:&lt;blockquote&gt; Following a Tibetan custom, the body was wrapped in a cloth, surrounded by flowers, and left untouched for three days. On the third day we sat with her body as a local rabbi performed a traditional Jewish ceremony at her mother's request.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following Saturday, nearly 100 people gathered to celebrate her life, appreciate her gifts to us, and share our grief. At sunset, her husband, Steve, her fourteen-year-old daughter, Arielle, and her brother Bob waded out into the cold spring surf and scattered her ashes into the sky.&lt;ref name = Afterword/&gt; 
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Members of the spiritual and psychological community went on to debate the significance of her experience.  In the afterword to the 1998 edition of ''Collisions'', Bodian gave his personal opinion, "Those of us who were close to Suzanne never doubted the depth or the authenticity of her realization."&lt;ref name = Afterword/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3718">'''Telesphorus of Cosenza''' (or ''Theophorus'', ''Theolophorus'') was a name assumed by one of the pseudo-prophets during the time of the [[Western Schism]]. As an pseudonymous author of a Latin work ''Liber de magnis tribulationibus'', the name was attached to a 1365 production of the [[Fraticelli]]. The ''Liber'' was updated (by 1386) to fit the situation in the Schism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Verbeke|author2=D. Verhelst|author3=Andries Welkenhuysen|title=The Use and Abuse of Eschatology in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89frds8lRqkC&amp;pg=PA24|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-6186-259-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Telesphorus" stated that he was born in [[Cosenza, Italy]] and lived as a [[hermit]] near the site of the [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|ancient Thebes]].  His book of predictions on the Schism was the most popular of the prophetic treatises of the period. More than twenty manuscripts of it are extant, and it first appeared in print, with various interpolations, as ''Liber de magnis tribulationibus in proximo futuris'' (Venice, 1516). 

==''Liber de magnis tribulationibus''==
The work was compiled about 1386 from the writings of [[Joachim of Fiore]], [[Jean de Roquetaillade]], the ''Cyrillic Prophecy'' (of [[Cyril of Constantinople]]), and other apocalyptic treatises whose authors are mentioned in the dedicatory preface addressed to Antoniotto Adorno, the [[Doge]] of [[Venice]]. 

Its main prophecies are as follows: 

#The schism will end in 1393 at [[Perugia]], where the [[antipope]] and his followers will be punished; 
#A short period of peace will follow, whereupon the Emperor Frederick III with three antipopes will inaugurate a cruel persecution of the clergy, who will be deprived of all their temporalities; 
#King Charles of France will be imprisoned, but miraculously liberated; 
#The "Angelic Pastor" will ascend the papal throne;
#Under his pontificate, the clergy will voluntarily renounce their temporal possessions and a general council will legislate that the income of the clergy is limited to what is necessary for a decent livelihood; 
#The "Angelic Pastor" will take from the German [[Prince-elector|elector]]s the right to elect the Emperor, he will crown the French King Charles emperor, and restore the Church to its original poverty and service of God; 
#Finally, the Pope and the Emperor will undertake a crusade, regain the [[Holy Land]], and bring the Jews, Greeks, and [[infidel]]s back to Christ. 

Part 6, the crowning of the French king, was a popular prophecy in its own right, and drew on an existing tradition of prophecy about a [[Second Charlemagne]]. Reeves suggests that the origin of the Telesphorus prophecy was the wish to put the Second Charlemagne in context for followers of Joachim of Fiore. In the 1380s the king of France was [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], son of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marjorie Reeves |title=Joachim of Fiore and the Prophetic Future |year=1976 |publisher=SPCK |isbn=0-281-02887-7|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of these prophecies, written by the German theologian [[Henry of Langenstein]], was printed in [[Bernhard Pez]], ''Thesaurus Anecdotorum Noviss'', I, II, (Augsburg, 1721-9), 507-64.

'''Volodymyr Zatonsky''' ({{lang-uk|Володи́мир Зато́нський}}; {{lang-ru|Затонский, Владимир Петрович}} ''Vladimir Petrovich Zatonsky'' ) (July 27, 1888 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1938) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[politician]], [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] activist, and member of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] [[Academy of Sciences]] (since 1929). 
==Life and career==
Zatonsky was born in the village of Lysets in of Ushitsy (Ushytsia) [[Uyezd]], [[Podolia Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now in [[Dunaivtsi Raion]], [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]) into the family of a [[volost]] [[scribe|pysar]].

He joined the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) party as a [[Menshevik]] in 1905. In March 1917 he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] as the member of the Kiev Committee, later joining the Kiev [[revkom]] as well. He was one of few who initiated the organization of the Congress of the Workers-Peasants and Soldiers deputies as well as the military coup in [[Kiev]]. Zatonsky participated in the fight against the [[Central Rada]]. 

When the [[Red Army]] took over Kiev in 1918 after the [[Kiev Arsenal January Uprising|January Uprising]], Zatonsky recalled that he only narrowly escaped execution as a [[counterrevolutionary]] when only Lenin's mandate saved his life.&lt;ref&gt;''Budivnytstvo Radianskoyi Ukrainy'' (Kharkiv: 1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1918 he was  the Head of the Ukrainian delegation from the Soviet Ukrainian People's Republic for the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk Peace Conference]]. From March 19 to April 18, 1918, he was Chairman of All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee. In July 1918 he was a [[commissar]] of a [[Offensive (military)|strike force]] against the [[Left Socialist-Revolutionary]] rebellion in [[Moscow]]. 

Beginning in November 1918 he was the [[Narkom]] of People's Education. While in that post he did everything in his power to shut down the [[Kamyanets-Podilsky State University]] as the concentration of the counter-revolutionary forces of [[Symon Petliura]]. He personally was offered a position by Lenin as a representative of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukrainian People's Republic]] in the [[Russian SFSR]].

In 1920 he was chairman of [[Galrevkom]]. In 1921 he received the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for the suppression of the [[Kronshtadt mutiny]]. Afterwards he held various government and Party positions in the Ukrainian SSR. In 1922 he was one of the persons who signed for the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as the representative of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. In September 1933 Zatonsky was appointed as chief editor of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia]].

On November 3, 1937, he was arrested in a movie theater while he was with his family. Later the authorities conducted an unsanctioned search of his apartment searching for a proof of him being a spy for "[[bourgeois]]" [[Poland]]. After several days his wife was arrested as well. He was charged with being a member of an anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalist center. On July 29, 1938, he was convicted after a 20-minute-long trial and sentenced to [[Without the right of correspondence|10 years in prison without right of correspondence]]. During the [[Great Purge]] this was a euphemism for a death sentence, and the same day he was executed by firing squad. In 1956 Zatonsky, along with many others, was posthumously [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitated]].

'''William Lane''' (6 September 1861&amp;nbsp;– 26 August 1917) was an Australian journalist, author, advocate of [[Australian labour movement|Australian labour politics]] and a [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] ideologue.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090663b.htm|title=Lane, William (1861–1917)|author=[[Gavin Souter]]|year=1983|work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 9|publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]]|pages=658–659|accessdate=27 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321035048/http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090663b.htm|archive-date=21 March 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane was born in [[Bristol]], [[England]] into an impoverished family. After showing great skill in his education, he worked his way into [[Canada]] as first a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]], then as a reporter for the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' where he would later meet his future wife Ann Lane, ''née'' Macquire. After settling in Australia with his wife and child, as well as his brother John, he became active in the Australian labour movement, founding the Australian Labour Federation and becoming a prolific journalist for the movement. He authored works covering topics such as [[Labor rights|labour rights]] and [[white nationalism]].

After becoming disillusioned with the state of Australian politics following an [[History of the Australian Labor Party|ideological split]] in the labour movement, he and a group of utopian acolytes (among them influential writer and poet [[Mary Gilmore]]) moved to [[Paraguay]] in 1892 to found [[New Australia]], with the intention of building a new society on the foundations of his utopian ideals. Following disagreement with the colony regarding the legality of [[miscegenation]] and [[Drinking culture|alcohol consumption]], he left to found the nearby colony Cosme in May 1894, and later abandoned the project altogether in 1899.

Upon resetting in [[New Zealand]] he continued his journalistic endeavours until his death in August 1917. After his death he was both celebrated as a champion of utopian socialism, and condemned as the arrogant leader of a failed new society. Due to his radical politics and his extensive journalistic career, he remains a controversial figure in Australian history.

==Early life==
Lane was born in [[Bristol]], England on 6 September 1861, as the eldest son of James Lane, an [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] landscape gardener, and his English wife Caroline, ''née'' Hall.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; Lane was born with a debilitating [[clubfoot]], a condition that would be partially corrected in [[Montreal]] later in life, leaving him with a limp. Lane's father James was a drunkard who when Lane was born was earning a miserable wage, but later he improved his circumstances and became an employer.

The young Lane was educated at [[Bristol Grammar School]] and demonstrated himself as a gifted student, but he was sent early to work as an office boy. Lane's mother died when he was 14 years of age, and at age 16 he migrated to Canada where he worked odd jobs such as a [[Linotype machine|linotype operator]]. During this time he began engrossed in the writings of economist [[Henry George]] and socialist [[Edward Bellamy]]. In 1881 by the age of 24 he became a reporter for the [[Detroit Free Press]], where he would meet his future wife Ann Macquire whom he would marry on 22 July 1883.

==Radical journalism in Australia==
In 1885 William and Ann Lane, along with brother John, as well as their first child migrated to [[Brisbane]], Australia, where Lane immediately got work as a feature writer for the weekly newspaper ''[[Queensland Figaro]]'', then as a columnist for the newspapers [[Brisbane Courier]] and the Evening Telegraph, using a number of pseudonyms (''Lucinda Sharpe'', which some consider to be the work of Lane's spouse; ''William Wilcher;'' and ''Sketcher'').

Lane's childhood experiences as the son of a drunkard fashioned him into a [[Teetotalism|lifelong abstainer]] from alcohol. In 1886 he created an Australia-wide sensation by spending a night in the Brisbane lock-up disguised as a drunk, and subsequently reporting the conditions of the cells as "Henry Harris". Lane's father was a drunk who impoverished the family.&lt;ref name="ADB" /&gt;

With the growth of the [[Australian labour movement]], Lane's columns under the ''Sketcher'' pseudonym, especially his "Labour Notes" in the Evening Telegraph, began to increasingly promote [[Labour movement|labourist philosophy]]. Lane himself began to attend meetings supporting all manner of popular causes, speaking against repressive laws and practices and Chinese immigrants, all while utilising a charismatic American intonation he had attained during his time in the States.

After becoming the de facto editor of the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], Lane left the newspaper during November 1887 to found the weekly ''[[The Boomerang]]'', a newspaper described as "a live newspaper, racy, of the soil", in which pro-worker themes and lurid racism were brought to a fever-pitch by both ''Sketcher'' and ''Lucinda Sharpe''. He became a powerful supporter of [[Emma Miller]] and [[women's suffrage]]. A strong proponent of [[Henry George]]'s [[Single Tax]] Movement, Lane became increasingly committed to a radically alternative society, and ended his relationship with the ''Boomerang'' due to its private ownership.

In May 1890 he began the trade union funded Brisbane weekly ''[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]]'', the rhetoric of which became increasingly threatening towards the employers, the government, and the British Empire itself. The defeat of the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]] convinced Lane that there would be no real social change without a completely new society, and ''The Worker'' became increasingly devoted to his New Australia [[utopian]] idea which would later be made a reality.

===''White or Yellow?''===
[[File:1910 White Australia badge.png|thumb|300px|In 1910, fear of the [[Yellow Peril]] prompted the nativist Australian Natives' Association to create the White Australia badge, with which the wearer could identify his or her racial loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ Museum Victoria description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105150237/http://museumvictoria.com.au/learning-federation/white-australia/medal---australia-for-australians/ |date=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Though his efforts were primarily directed towards the non-fictional, Lane was an avid author whose works deeply reflected his political philosophy, as short as his bibliography is. ''The Workingman's Paradise'', an allegorical novel written in sympathy with those involved in the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|1891 shearers' strike]], was published under his pseudonym ''John Miller'' in early 1892. In the novel Lane articulated the belief that [[anarchism]] is the noblest social philosophy of all. Through the novel's philosopher and main protagonist he relates his belief that society may have to experience a period of [[state socialism]] to achieve the ideal of [[Communist anarchism]]. [[Mary Gilmore]], later a celebrated Australian writer, said in one of her letters that ''"''the whole book is true and of historical value as Lane transcribed our conversations as well as those of others''"''.

Most prominent in his bibliography is his novella ''White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908'' (1887). In this work, Lane proposed a horde of Chinese people would legally arrive to Australia, who would then overrun White society and monopolise the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the "empty north" of the continent.&lt;ref name="Affeldt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stefanieaffeldt.net/texte/Affeldt_WhiteSugarYellowPeril2011.pdf|title='White Sugar' against 'Yellow Peril' Consuming for National Identify and Racial Purity|last=Affeldt|first=Stefanie|date=12 July 2011|website=|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Australian [[invasion literature]], ''White or Yellow?'' reflects Lane's nationalist [[racialism]] and left-wing politics within a [[future history]] of Australia under attack by the [[Yellow Peril]].

[[File:Oceania UN Geoscheme - Map of Melanesia.svg|thumb|right|300px|The Yellow Peril proscriptions of the White Australia policies excluded the brown-skinned peoples of Melanesia from immigration to Australia.]]
Lane wrote that in the near future, British capitalists would manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of its socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists' manipulation of the Australian economy would then provoke a [[Ethnic conflict|race war]] throughout the continent, fought between the White settlers and Chinese workers.

The racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of ''White or Yellow?'' work to justify forcible expulsion and murder of Chinese workers as an acceptable response to the loss of physical and economic control of Australia.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009" /&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Historically the leaders of the Australian labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic threat to Australia due to their eagerness to work for low wages, as well as them presenting a [[libertinism|libertine]] and [[miscegenation|race-diluting]] threat to Christian civilisation. Lane's work was intended to act as an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.&lt;ref name="Auerbach 2009"&gt;Auerbach, Sascha. ''Race, Law, and "The Chinese Puzzle" in Imperial Britain'', London: Macmillan, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

==New Australia Colony==
{{Main article|New Australia}}

Contriving a division among Australian labour activists between the permanently disaffected and those who later formed the [[Australian Labor Party]], Lane refused the Queensland Government's offer of a grant of land on which to create a utopian settlement, and began an Australia-wide campaign for the creation of a new society elsewhere on the globe, peopled by rugged and sober Australian bushmen and their proud wives.

Eventually [[Paraguay]] was decided upon, and Lane and his family and hundreds of acolytes (238 total) from [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and [[South Australia]] departed Mort Bay in Sydney in the ship ''Royal Tar'' on 1 July 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/places-you-can-no-longer-go-new-australia|title=Places You Can No Longer Go: New Australia – Atlas Obscura|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327082552/http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/places-you-can-no-longer-go-new-australia|archive-date=27 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wr5brDm38EQC|title=National Treasures from Australia's Great Libraries|date=1 January 2005|publisher=National Library Australia|isbn=9780642276209|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Australia soon had its crisis, brought on by the issues of interracial relationships (Lane singled out the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] as racially taboo) and alcohol. Lane's dictatorial manner soon alienated many in the community, and by the time the second boatload of utopians arrived from [[Adelaide]] in 1894, Lane had left with a core of devotees to form a new colony nearby named Cosme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85955057|title=AN ACCOUNT OF WILLIAM LANE'S COSME SETTLEMENT IN PARAGUAY|last=McLeod|first=Allan|date=27 May 1927|newspaper=[[Windsor And Richmond Gazette]]|accessdate=19 October 2018|issue=2065|location=New South Wales, Australia|volume=39,|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/1893-the-new-australia-colony-collection/|title=1893 The New Australia Colony Collection: Australia's migration history timeline|website=www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au|publisher=NSW Migration Heritage Centre|access-date=2016-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312110948/http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/objectsthroughtime/1893-the-new-australia-colony-collection/|archive-date=12 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Lane became disillusioned with the process, and returned to Australia in 1899.

==Later life==
Lane then went with his family to [[New Zealand]]. After initial melancholia, he soon refound his old verve as a pseudonymous feature writer from 1900 for the newspaper ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' ("Tohunga"), only this time as ultra-conservative and pro-Empire. He had retained the strong racial antipathy toward East Asians he expressed in his literature, and during [[World War I]] he developed extreme [[anti-German sentiment]]s. He died on 26 August 1917 in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, having been editor of the ''Herald'' from 1913 to 1917, much admired, having lost one son Charles at a [[cricket]] match in Cosme in [[Paraguay]], and another Donald on the first day of the ANZAC landings (25 April 1915) on the beaches of [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]].

===Liberal leader===
Jones was one of only three Liberal [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|Members of the House of Assembly]] (MHA) re-elected in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]]. On November 15, 2007, she was named the [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]] of the Liberal Party and Official Opposition Leader, after party leader [[Gerry Reid]] was defeated in his own district. Jones became the first woman to lead the Liberal Party in the province.&lt;ref name=interim/&gt; The party originally planned to hold a leadership convention to select a new, permanent leader in 2008, but postponed the vote twice. Jones continued to serve as interim leader during this period of time, and in December 2009, announced her intention to run for the permanent leadership when the convention was to be scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Dave|title=Jones will run|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/Living/2009-12-17/article-1443587/Jones-will-run/1|accessdate=9 June 2013|newspaper=The Telegram|date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2010, Jones was acclaimed Liberal leader after she was the only person to file nomination papers for the position.&lt;ref name="acclaimed"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones acclaimed Liberal Leader|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2010-07-30/article-1638415/-Jones-acclaimed-Liberal-Leader/1|newspaper=The Telegram|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones acclaimed N.L.

She was expected to be sworn in as leader at the party's convention in November of that year, however the convention was delayed when Jones announced in August that she would be taking a leave of absence from her position to undergo treatment for [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/n-l-liberal-leader-jones-has-breast-cancer-1.909386|title=N.L.

Liberal candidate [[Marshall Dean]] won the election taking nearly 48% of the vote and defeating the Progressive Conservative candidate by 126 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberals win provincial byelection in rural N.L|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/liberals-win-provincial-byelection-in-rural-n-l-1.832006|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public opinion====
Under Jones' leadership the Liberal Party remained in second place in public opinion polls. After receiving 22% in the [[Newfoundland and Labrador general election, 2007|2007 general election]], the party's support has not risen above those levels. For the majority of time since the election their support has been in the mid-teens according to polls conducted by Corporate Research Associates (CRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra.ca/en/home/Newsroom/SupportforConservativesinNLisUnchangedandRemainsHi.aspx/ |title=CRA Poll |publisher=Cra.ca |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' own popularity had consistently remained lower than her own party's; CRA's quarterly polls on Newfoundland and Labrador politics have found that no more than 11% of those surveyed have felt Jones would make the best premier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.ca/site-cra/media/CRA/10-2%20NL%20WEB%20TABLES(1).pdf CRA - May 2010 Poll]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CJON-DT|NTV]] Telelink poll conducted in February 2011, found that 13% of decided voters would support the Liberal Party and that 12% thought Jones was the best choice to be premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntv.ca/video/?p=11323|title=Provincial Tories Still Have Big Lead: Poll|publisher=NTV News|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the NTV Telelink poll led former Liberal provincial and federal cabinet minister [[John Efford]] to criticize Jones's leadership. Efford said that Jones would not become premier and while he did not call on her to resign as leader, he did say that "it's clear what she ought to do in the face of poor polling results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jones-won-t-become-premier-efford-1.992711|title=Jones won't become premier: Efford|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CRA poll in March 2011, saw Jones' personal popularity rise to 18%, her highest level since becoming Liberal leader in 2007. Her personal popularity was also tied with that of her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cra.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/11-1-NL-Press-Release.pdf|title=Support for the Progressive Conservative Party Remains High|publisher=Corporate Research Associates|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/pcs-dunderdale-still-dominate-poll-1.1061854|title=PCs, Dunderdale Still Dominate: Poll|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2011, CRA released a poll showing that Jones' popularity had dropped slightly to 16% but her party's support had risen to 22%. While the Progressive Conservatives still held a large lead in the poll, at 57%, the Liberals were statistically tied with the [[Newfoundland and Labrador New Democratic Party|New Democrats]], who had the support of 20% of those surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tories drop, NDP surge in new poll|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/tories-drop-ndp-surge-in-new-poll-1.1061853|accessdate=2018-05-02|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
On August 9, 2011, two months before the provincial election, Jones announced that she was resigning as leader due to a slower recovery from breast cancer than she expected.&lt;ref name="resign"&gt;{{cite news|title=N.L. Liberal leader resigns over health|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/n-l-liberal-leader-resigns-over-health-1.977686|accessdate=2 May 2018|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sought re-election in her district during the [[Newfoundland and Labrador general election, 2011|2011 provincial election]], and won 71 per cent of the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yvonne Jones re-elected in Labrador|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/yvonne-jones-re-elected-in-labrador-1.983786|accessdate=2 May 2018|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal politics==
In April 2013, Jones resigned her seat in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly to run as the Liberal candidate in the federal by-election in [[Labrador (electoral district)|Labrador]] created by the resignation of [[Peter Penashue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jones declared Liberal candidate for Labrador byelection|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2013-03-27/article-3208578/Jones-declared-Liberal-candidate-for-Labrador-byelection/1|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=The Telegram|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Liberals name Jones as candidate in Labrador byelection|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/liberals-name-jones-as-candidate-in-labrador-byelection-1.1314334|accessdate=2 May 2018|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defeated Penashue to win the seat on May 13, 2013. She was sworn in on June 4, 2013.

Upon her Election, Jones was appointed the Liberal critic for Northern Development, the Northern Economic Development Agency, the Arctic Council, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, and Search and Rescue. In August 2013, Jones was elected Chair of the Liberal Party of Canada Newfoundland and Labrador caucus. In February 2014, she became Vice-Chair of the Public Accounts committee.

On December 2, 2015, she was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary#Canada|Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bill Blair, Adam Vaughan among new parliamentary secretaries|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-parliamentary-secretaries-named-1.3346942|website = www.cbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
