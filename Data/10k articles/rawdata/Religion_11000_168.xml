'''Oskar Ernst Bernhardt''', also known as '''Abd-ru-shin''' or '''Abdruschin''' (18 April 1875, [[Bischofswerda]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]], [[German Empire]] – 6 December 1941, [[Ore Mountains (Central Europe)|Kipsdorf, Ore Mountains]], Germany), is best known as the author of the ''[[In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grailmessage.com In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message]- Edition in three volumes&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Abd-ru-shin means "Son of Light" in the [[Persian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Massimo|author-last=Introvigne|author-link=Massimo Introvigne|editor-link=Wouter Hanegraaff|editor-last=Hanegraaff|editor-first=Wouter J.|year=2006|title=Dictionary of Gnosis and Western Esotericism|chapter=Grail Traditions in Western Esotericism|place=Leiden / Boston|publisher=Brill|pages=436–438, 1183}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
After a brief commercial training Oskar Ernst Bernhardt began his literary activity while still a young man. This often led him to foreign countries. In 1915 he was interned in [[England]]. Released in 1919, he first went to [[Dresden]], later to [[Bavaria]] and in 1923 began to write the first lectures of the Grail Message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grailadministrationnigeria.org/content/author|title=The Author {{!}} Grail Administration Nigeria|website=grailadministrationnigeria.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 he settled in Vomperberg, [[state of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. There he wrote [[Grail Message|"In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message]]". He was labeled a "dangerous" element by the Nazi authorities and exiled from [[Austria]] in 1938.

==Life, publishing, legacy==

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}

Bernhardt was born in Bischofswerda, Germany, trained in business, and successfully established himself in Dresden. He traveled and wrote travel books, stories, and plays. He resided in New York and London. He was in London when World War I broke out and in 1914 he was interned on the [[Isle of Man]].

This seclusion gave him time to reflect, question, and deepen his understanding.  He was released in the Spring of 1919 and returned to Germany. He began to write ''In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message'' in 1923 and completed it in 1931 under the pen name Abd-ru-shin.

In 1928 he settled in Austria, Tyrol on a mountain plateau called Vomperberg. Here he continued writing ''The Grail Message''. The Nazis came to power in 1938, ending his work there. He was arrested and exiled to Kipsdorf in the Erzgebirge. He was forbidden any further writing. He died while in Gestapo custody.

==Legacy==
After the war, his family returned to Vomperberg and carried on his work. Other writings by Abd-ru-shin published by Grail Foundation Press include ''The Ten Commandments of God and The Lord's Prayer'', ''Questions and Answers'', and ''Prayers''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Image:Child baptism with water.jpg|thumb|right|266px|Affusion of the [[infant]]]]
'''Affusion''' ([[Latin|la.]] ''affusio'') is a method of [[baptism]] where water is poured on the head of the person being baptized.  The word "affusion" comes from the Latin ''affusio'', meaning "to pour on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Affusion "Affusion"] ''Dictionary.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Affusion is one of four methods of baptism used by Christians, which also include total [[submersion baptism]], partial [[immersion baptism]], and [[aspersion]] or sprinkling.&lt;ref&gt;"There are four principal methods of baptizing: (1) submersion (or total immersion) ; (2) immersion, when the head is dipped with or without the candidate standing in the water; (3) affusion, when water is poured over the head and (4) …" (John Gordon Davies, ''The Architectural Setting of Baptism''. Barrie and Rockliff 1962. p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The four principal modes are: 1. ''Submersion''; or total immersion, where the candidate goes briefly but entirely below the water, on the model of those baptised by John in the River Jordan; 2. ''Immersion''; where the head, as the prime seat of Man's rational and spiritual being, is in some way submerged, with or without the candidate having to stand in the same container of water; 3. ''Affusion''; …" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BgkQIcRgNk0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F5bITJyiN43vsgb67oHHBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=baptism%20submersion%20immersion%20affusion&amp;f=false Charles Thomas, ''Christianity in Roman Britain to A.D. 500'']. University of California Press 1981 {{ISBN|0-520-04392-8}}. p, 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the early Church baptism was by one of four methods: complete submersion of the entire body, immersion of the head, affusion or pouring, or aspersion or sprinkling" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=bekUBTND4q4C&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=F5bITJyiN43vsgb67oHHBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=baptism%20submersion%20immersion%20affusion&amp;f=false Steven J. Schloeder, ''Architecture in Communion'']. Ignatius Press 1998 {{ISBN|0-89870-631-9}}. p. 113).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"There have been four different modes of conferring baptism throughout history: (1) ''submersion'', also called ''dipping'', in which the candidate is completely submerged under the baptismal waters; (2) ''immersion'', in which the candidate stands or kneels in rather shallow water, and the water is either poured over the head of the candidate or the candidate's head itself is pushed partially into the water; (3) ''affusion'', in which water is poured over the head of the candidate; and (4) ''aspersion'' …" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=693VAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion&amp;dq=baptism+submersion+immersion+affusion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DKTITM7vIdCOswbBt_WBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA S. Anita Stauffer, ''On Baptismal Fonts: Ancient and Modern''. Grove Books 1994, pp. 9-10).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian denominations which baptize by affusion do not deny the legitimacy of baptizing by submersion or immersion; rather, they consider that affusion is a sufficient, if not necessarily preferable, method of baptism. Affusion and aspersion tend to be practiced by [[Christian denomination]]s that also practice [[infant baptism]]. This may be due to the practical difficulties of totally immersing an infant underwater.  However, [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] practice infant immersion. [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonites]], and [[Conservative Mennonites]] still practice baptism by pouring.

==History of affusion==
Affusion became the standard practice in the western church around the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9013238 "Baptistery"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007. Retrieved March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but was in use much earlier. The earliest explicit reference to baptism by affusion occurs in the [[Didache]] (c. AD 100), the seventh chapter of which gives instructions on how to baptize, which include affusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;…But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But if you have neither, '''pour out''' water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit. (Emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/didache-roberts.html "Didache"] in ''The Ante-Nicene Fathers: Translations of the Writings of the Fathers down to A.D. 325''. vol. 1. Roberts, Alexander; Donaldson, James; and Coxe, A. Cleveland, Eds. (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company), 1951 (original pub. in U.S. 1885).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This text implies that early Christians saw affusion as a viable alternative to immersion when no living water (i.e. running water like a river or spring) or cold water is available.

Acts of various martyrs show that many were baptized in prison, while awaiting martyrdom; immersion would have been impossible. The most common use, however, was for ill or dying people who could not rise from their beds. It was consequently known as "baptism of the sick". Receiving this baptism was regarded as a bar to [[Holy Orders]], but this sprang from the person's having put off baptism until the last moment&amp;mdash;a practice that in the fourth century became common, with people enrolling as [[catechumen]]s but not being baptized for years or decades. While the practice was decried at the time, the intent of the criticism was not to encourage baptism by immersion, but to refrain from delaying baptism.

==Affusion and the Bible==
In the [[New Testament]] book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], the [[baptism of the Holy Spirit]] is sometimes described, as a “pouring out” of the [[Holy Spirit]] ([http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?acts+2:17-18,33;acts+10:45 Acts 2:17,18,33; Acts 10:45]). [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], the author of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], uses the word "baptism" to describe a "pouring," which seems to indicate that the word "baptism" can refer to pouring and not just dipping or immersing. It may also indicate that [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]]’s concept of baptism includes, or allows for, [[baptism]] by pouring. For instance, on [[Pentecost]], the [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] were baptized with the [[Holy Spirit]] by having the Spirit “poured out” on them from heaven not by being dipped in the [[Holy Spirit]] until they were completely immersed.

Submersionists say that passages like these do not directly speak to the issue of water baptism because they are, strictly speaking, about baptism with the [[Holy Spirit]]. Affusionists think they indirectly apply to water baptism, though, by telling us something about the general ''concept'' of baptism, regardless of whether the medium of baptism is water or Spirit.

Affusionists see more evidence that [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]]’s concept of baptism includes pouring by noting an additional possible connection between water baptism and Holy Spirit baptism. In [[Acts 10]], Peter is “astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles” ([http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+10:45 Acts 10:45]). Peter responds by saying, “Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have" ([http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+10:47 Acts 10:47]).

Affusionists read Peter to be saying "by having the Spirit poured out on them, these people already have been baptized with the Spirit, so why not actually baptize them with water." They understand Peter’s words to imply that water baptism is a symbolic picture of the Holy Spirit baptism.  If this is right, affusionists contend, then water baptism should be, or, at least, can be, by pouring, because the baptism with the Holy Spirit of which it is a picture occurs by pouring.

Also noteworthy to affusionists is that, in [http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Luke+11:38 Luke 11:38], the word ''ἐβαπτίσθη'' [''ebaptisthē'']&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/ebaptisthe__907.htm ''ebaptisthē'']&lt;/ref&gt; is used in the Greek and ''baptizatus''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latin-dictionary.net/definition/6105/baptizo-baptizare-baptizavi-baptizatus ''baptizatus'']&lt;/ref&gt; is used in the Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/interlinear/luke/11-38.htm Luke 11:38 Greek Interlinear]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newadvent.org/bible/luk011.htm New Advent: Luke 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Both words are used, in other passages, to mean baptism. But in that verse of Luke, the "washing" referred to is partial, like affusion.

'''Anathapindika''' ({{lang-pi|Anāthapiṇḍika}}; {{lang-sa|Anāthapiṇḍada}}) was a wealthy merchant and banker, believed to have been the wealthiest merchant in [[Savatthi]] in the time of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Born '''Sudatta''', he received the nickname ''Anathapindika'', literally "one who gives alms to the poor", due to his reputation of loving to give to those in need. Anathapindika was the chief male lay disciple and the greatest [[Patronage|patron]] of Gautama Buddha along with his female counterpart [[Visakha]]. Anathapindika is known as the male lay disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in generosity. Anathapindika is frequently referred to as Anathapindika-''setthi'' (''[[śreṣṭhī|setthi]]'' meaning "wealthy person" or "millionaire"), and is sometimes referred to as Mahā Anāthapindika to distinguish him from Cūla Anāthapindika, another disciple of the Buddha.

== Background ==
In Buddhist belief, when a fully enlightened [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] arrives in the world, he always has a set of chief disciples that fulfill different roles. On top of the pair of chief [[Arahant]] disciples such as Gautama Buddha's chief male disciples [[Sariputta]] and [[Moggallana]], and his chief female disciples [[Khema]] and [[Uppalavanna]], all Buddhas have a set of chief lay disciples as well. Gautama Buddha's chief male lay disciple and patron was Anathapindika, with his chief female lay disciple and patron being [[Visakha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myanmarnet.net/nibbana/gotama/gcobv12.htm#24|title=The great chronicle of Buddhas|last=Lay|first=U Do|date=|website=www.myanmarnet.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602031053/http://www.myanmarnet.net/nibbana/gotama/gcobv12.htm#24|archive-date=2017-06-02|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]], in the time of [[Padumuttara Buddha|Padumattara Buddha]], a householder was inspired when Padumattara Buddha spoke of his own chief lay disciple and patron. The householder then resolved in that lifetime to become the chief lay disciple of a future Buddha himself, and did several good deeds in hopes of becoming one. His wish was fulfilled in this lifetime when he was reborn as Anathapindika and became the chief male lay disciple of Gautama Buddha.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|title=Anāthapindika|website=www.palikanon.com|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230025428/http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|archive-date=2017-12-30|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography ==

=== Early Life and Family ===
Anathapindika was born with the given name Sudatta, and was the son of a wealthy merchant named Sumana. When Sudatta grew up, he married a woman named Puññalakkhanā, the sister of a wealthy merchant in [[Rajagaha|Rājagaha]]. Sudatta was known for his generosity even before his conversion to Buddhism, and was known to the public by the nickname "Anathapindika", or "one who gives alms to the poor", due to his love for giving. Anathapindika had one son, Kāla, and three daughters, Mahā-Subhaddā, Cūla-Subhaddā and Sumanā. His daughter-in-law was Sujātā, the youngest sister of his female counterpart, [[Visakha]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;

=== Meeting the Buddha ===
The [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]] describes Anathapindika's first encounter with the Buddha as being in Rājagaha. While on business, Anathapindika went to visit his brother-in-law, who was already a follower of the Buddha. When he arrived at this brother-in-law's house, he noticed that the household was preparing for an elaborate feast, and mistook it as preparation for a wedding or a visit from the king.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel334.html|title=Anathapindika: The Great Benefactor|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008080100/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel334.html|archive-date=2017-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Anathapindika asked about the preparations, his brother-in-law explained that they were preparing for a visit from the Buddha (the Enlightened One) and his monks. Upon hearing this, Anathapindika became overjoyed, exclaiming "You mean that a fully enlightened being had arisen in the world?", and immediately resolved to go meet him.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IStatqlilL8C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Anathapindika&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRk7S1id_WAhXLiVQKHW2sBXQQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Anathapindika&amp;f=false|title=The Buddha and His Disciples|last=Dhammika|first=Shravasti|date=2005-12-01|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=9789552402807|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day Anathapindika arose early to meet the Buddha, but realized it was still dark. He still continued however, after a friendly [[Yaksha|yakka]] whispered in his ear and urged him to continue. Anathapindika eventually reached a figure which called him "Sudatta" and asked him to come forward. Surprised to hear his birth name, which was not known to the public, he concluded it could only be the Buddha, and went forward. The Buddha then had a discussion with him and expounded the [[Four Noble Truths]], afterwards Anathapindika achieved the state of [[Sotāpanna|Sotapanna]], a stage of [[Four stages of enlightenment|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obo.genaud.net/backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm|title=Anathapindiko|website=obo.genaud.net|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008030508/http://obo.genaud.net/backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm|archive-date=2017-10-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;[[File:Anathapindika's great act of charity.jpg|thumb|Anathapindika's great act of charity|alt=]]
=== Building Jetavana Monastery ===
Following Anathapindika's first encounter with the Buddha, he requested to offer him a meal, which the Buddha accepted, and then asked to build a temple for him and his monks in his hometown of Savatthi, to which the Buddha agreed.&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;

Shortly after, Anathapindika went back to Savatthi to search for a place to build the monastery. Looking for a place that was both accessible to followers and peacefully secluded, he came across a park belonging to Prince Jeta, the son of [[Pasenadi|King Pasenadi]] of [[Kosala]]. Anathapindika offered to buy the park from the prince but the prince refused, after Anathapindika persisted, the prince joking said he will sell him the park if he covers it with gold coins, to which Anathapindika agreed.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/btg/btg26.htm|title=Jetavana, The Vihara|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2017-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909142638/http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/btg/btg26.htm|archive-date=2017-09-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anathapindika later came back with wagons full of gold pieces to cover the park with. When Prince Jeta stated he was merely joking, Anathapindika and the prince went to arbitrators who concluded that Prince Jeta had to sell the park at the agreed price. After seeing Anathapindika's resolve, Prince Jeta offered to build a wall and gate for the monastery. Afterwards, Anathapindika spent several million more gold pieces building the temple and its furnishings, in what would come to be known as the [[Jetavana|Jetavana Monastery]], also often referred to in Buddhist scriptures as "Anathapindika's Monastery".&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Chief Lay Disciple ===
The Buddha designated Anathapindika as his chief lay disciple, along with [[Visakha]]. He is considered to be the male Buddhist lay disciple who was foremost in both generosity and character. Throughout his life, Anathapindika received hundreds of monks at his house for alms daily and regularly sent food, medicine and supplies to the monastery. The temple was also regularly maintained by Anathapindika's servants.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

Whenever the Buddha was in [[Savatthi]], Anathapindika would visit him twice a day. After first meeting the Buddha, Anathapindika committed to following the teachings and strictly observing the [[Five Precepts|five precepts]], as well as encouraged his family, friends, employees, and everybody around him to do the same.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt; Anathapindika was also well versed in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]], and an excellent debater. Buddhist scriptures describe a time when he visited a temple of another religious tradition and a debate ensues, with Anathapindika skillfully defeating the followers of the other religious tradition.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Anathapindika and Visakha were not only the greatest donors to Gautama Buddha but also his primary aides when dealing with the general public. The Buddha frequently turned to one of the two chief lay disciples whenever there needed to be something arranged with the lay community.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

=== Encounter with the Earth Spirit ===
[[File:Jetavana - Buildings, Shravasti (9237067203).jpg|thumb|Scene of some remains at [[Jetavana|Jetavana Monastery]].]]Even the wealthy Anathapindika's wealth was not limitless. At one time, the wealthy banker lost a significant amount of his fortune in a flash flood, which washed away large amounts of his gold, and was reduced to poverty due to his love of giving as well as due to lending out large amounts to his friends. Despite this, Anathapindika continued his patronage and support of Buddhism, although more modestly. It is said he later returned to his wealthy status, however, due to the help of a redemptive [[Deva (Buddhism)|''deva'']], or spirit.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;

Based on accounts from the Buddhist scriptures, there was a ''deva'' living in Anathapindika's house at the time. According to the [[31 planes of existence|laws of his realm]], the ''deva'' had to leave his abode whenever the Buddha or a monk was in the house, as a form of respect. Annoyed by this, the ''deva'' appeared before Anathapindika and suggested he preserve his treasure and stop his patronage of Buddhism since he was no longer wealthy. Appalled by this suggestion, Anathapindika explained that the only treasures he knew of were the [[Three Jewels]]; the Buddha, the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]], and the [[Sangha]], and that he would continue to support Buddhism so long as he had something to give. Anathapindika then ordered the ''deva'' to leave his house, stating that enemies of the Buddha were not welcome, forcing the ''deva'' to find a new place to live. The homeless ''deva'' went to several authorities, eventually reaching [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]], the king of the ''devas'' in [[Trāyastriṃśa]], who suggested he must atone by retrieving Anathapindika's lost gold, convincing his debtors to repay their debts, and by giving Anathapindika a buried treasure, which had no owner. This resulted in Anathapindika returning to wealth, even richer than he was before.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMYViaXor6cC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Anathapindika&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn37jJ5N_WAhXlrlQKHVcJBMcQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Anathapindika&amp;f=false|title=Philanthropy in the World's Traditions|last=Ilchman|first=Warren Frederick|last2=Katz|first2=Stanley Nider|last3=Queen|first3=Edward L.|date=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=025333392X|location=|pages=89|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;

=== The Story of Kalakanni ===
The extent of Anathapindika's generosity was not limited just to material gifts. One famous story described in the Buddhist scriptures is the story of Kalakanni. Kalakanni (whose name means "unlucky bird")&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt; was a childhood friend of Anathapindika who was impoverished. When Kalakanni asked Anathapindika for aid, the ''setthi'' offered him a job at his house. This decision was met with backlash from Anathapindika's household, due to Kalakanni's low status and the superstition at the time of Kalakanni's name being a bad omen. Anathapindika ignored this superstition and his status however, and granted his friend a job. This eventually worked in the favor of the household however, when a group of thieves attempted to rob Anathapindika while he was away on a business trip. When the vigilant Kalakanni noticed the thieves, he started making loud noises, convincing the thieves that the household was full and causing them to leave.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;

=== Death ===
When Anathapindika grew ill later in life he was visited by [[Sariputta]] and [[Ananda]], two of the Buddha's principle disciples. Sariputta delivered a sermon, recommending Anathapindika focus on freeing his mind from clinging and to reflect on the impermanence of existence. The ''setthi'' later proclaimed this sermon to have been the most profound sermon he has ever heard, which Sariputta explained was because this teaching was not normally given to laypeople.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shortly after Sariputta and Ananda left, Anathapindika died. According to the Buddhist scriptures, Anathapindika was reborn as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|''deva'']] in [[Tushita|Tusita]] heaven after his death, where he would live as long as his female counterpart [[Visakha]], and the king of [[Tavatimsa]] heaven, [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|title=Anáthapindika|website=palikanon.de|access-date=2017-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172420/http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel334.html#part5|title=Anathapindika: The Great Benefactor|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822145605/https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel334.html#part5|archive-date=2018-08-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Jetavana.jpg|thumb|The remains of a section of [[Jetavana|Jetavana Monastery]].]]
Anathapindika is considered to be one of the most exemplary adherents of the Buddhist virtue of generosity. Not only did he regularly provide alms and necessities to the monks at Jetavana, he hosted hundreds of monks at his residence for meals daily.&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt; Referring to Anathapindika, the Buddha stated that for one who was dedicated to perfecting the virtue of generosity, nothing in the world is capable of stopping him from giving. Anathapindika's love of giving, combined with some misfortune, at one point reduced the ''setthi'' to poverty. But even in times of hardship, Anathapindika was described as continuing his patronage of Buddhism, although with much more modest gifts. His wealth was eventually [[Karma in Buddhism|restored to him]] however, due to the power of the [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] of his generosity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Anathapindika's patronage had a significant impact on Buddhism. Anathapindika's hometown of [[Savatthi]] was considered to be the center of Buddhism at the time, being the location of a significant number of the Buddha's sermons. On top of that, the Buddha spent more [[Vassa|rainy seasons]] at [[Jetavana|Jetavana monastery]] than at any other temple during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/sravasti-diamond-rough/|title=Sravasti: Diamond in the Rough|last=Badiner|first=Allan Hunt|work=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172527/https://tricycle.org/magazine/sravasti-diamond-rough/|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|title=Anáthapindika|website=palikanon.de|access-date=2017-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172420/http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/ay/anaathapindika.htm|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the building of Migāramātupāsāda monastery in Savatthi by [[Visakha]], the Buddha would alternate between Anathapindika's monastery and Visakha's monastery whenever he was staying in Savatthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/j/jetavana.htm|title=Jetavana|website=palikanon.de|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318055031/http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/j/jetavana.htm|archive-date=2018-03-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm|title=Migáramátupásáda|website=palikanon.de|access-date=2018-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318054545/http://palikanon.de/english/pali_names/me_mu/migaramatupasada.htm|archive-date=2018-03-18|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anathapindika's generosity even inspired [[Pasenadi|King Pasenadi]], another follower of the Buddha, to himself start generous patronage of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":022"/&gt;

Buddhist scholars George D. Bond and [[Ananda W. P. Guruge|Ananda W.P Guruge]], point to the story of Anathapindika as evidence that the Buddhist path for lay people and the rewards of generosity in Buddhism are not distinct from the path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] that is the focus of Buddhist monastics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Arsinoe''' sometimes spelled '''Arsinoë''', ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀρσινόη derived from ''arsis'' "to rise, to lift" and ''nous'' "mind, intellect" ), was the name of the following individuals.
* Arsinoe, one of the [[Nysiads]] (Dodonides), nurses of the infant [[Dionysus]] in [[Nysa (mythology)|Mount Nysa]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. ''Fabulae, 182''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arsinoe, daughter of [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] and possibly [[Philodice (mythology)|Philodice]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, Book 3.10.3''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Scholia. ''ad Pindar, Pythian Ode.'' ''3.14'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the sister of [[Hilaeira]] and [[Phoebe (Leucippid)|Phoebe]], who were abducted by the [[Castor and Pollux|Dioscuri]]. By the god [[Apollo]], Arsinoe bore [[Asclepius]], 'leader of men'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. ''Description of Greece 2.26.6'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[De Natura Deorum]], 3.22''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eriopis]] 'with the lovely hair'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]]. ''Catalogue of Women, 63''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Otherwise, the mother of Asclepius was called [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]], daughter of [[Phlegyas]] because it is said that Asclepius being the son of Arsinoe, was a fiction invented by [[Hesiod]], or by one of Hesiod's interpolators, just to please the Messenians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At Sparta she had a sanctuary and was worshipped as a heroine.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias''. Description of Greece, 3.12.7''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arsinoe, one of the [[Minyades]], according to Plutarch. These daughter of [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]] were struck with madness and having conceived a greedy appetite for man's flesh, cast lots accordingly for their children to see who they were going to eat. Whereupon it fell to [[Leucippe|Leucippe's]] lot to produce her son [[Hippasus (mythology)|Hippasus]] to be cut in pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]]. ''Moralia: Quaestiones Graecae, 38'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arsinoe or [[Alphesiboea]], daughter of [[Phegeus (king of Psophis)|Phegeus]], king of [[Psophis]] in Arcadia and sister of [[Pronous (mythology)|Pronous]] and [[Agenor, son of Phegeus|Agenor]]. She was the wife of [[Alcmaeon (mythology)|Alcmaeon]], leader of the [[Epigoni]] by whom she bore a son, [[Clytius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. ''Description of Greece, 6.17.6''&lt;/ref&gt; After Alcmaeon was purified from blood guilt by Phegeus for murdering his own mother [[Eriphyle]], Arsinoe was given in marriage to the hero who received from him the necklace of [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]]. Later on, her brothers, Pronous and Agenor killed Alcmaeon at the instigation of their father. When Arsinoe condemned them of the act, they clapped her into a chest and carried her to [[Tegea]]. There they gave her as a slave to Agapenor, falsely accusing her of her husband's murder. Eventually, retribution came when the sons of Alcmaeon, [[Amphoterus (son of Alcmaeon)|Amphoterus]] and [[Acarnan (son of Alcmaeon)|Acarnan]] slew their father's murderers and also Phegeus and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''Bibliotheca, Book 3.7.5-6'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arsinoe, nurse of [[Orestes]] who saved him from the hands of his mother [[Clytemnestra]], and carried him to the aged [[Strophius]], the father of [[Pylades]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]]. ''Pythian Ode, 11.17''&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditions called this nurse [[Laodamia|Laodameia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]]. ''ad Pindar, 1.c.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arsinoe, daughter of King Nicocreon of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] in [[Cyprus]] (descendant of [[Teucer]], son of [[Telamon]]). She was loved by [[Arceophon]] who wooed her, but the maiden's father refused to give his daughter to Arceophon because of the latter's Phoenician descent. Arceophon was upset and began to come to Arsinoe's house by night, hoping to win her heart, but in vain. He then tried to bribe Arsinoe's nurse so that she might arrange for them to meet, but Arsinoe reported this to her parents, who cut off the nurse's tongue, nose and fingers and drove her out of their house. Having lost every hope, Arceophon committed suicide by starving himself to death. The fellow citizens grieved at his death and buried him with honors. When Arsinoe leaned out of the window to take a look at the funeral ceremony, the goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]] turned her into stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]].

An '''Azali''' ({{lang-fa|ازلیان}})&lt;ref name = "Bábism" &gt;Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm pp. 351-352]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Azali | encyclopedia = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | volume = 2006 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264/Azali | accessdate = 2006-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eoi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia of Islam |year= 1999 |article=Sub-i Azal | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amanat"&gt;{{cite book | first = Abbas | last = Amanat | title = Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran | publisher =  Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 1989 | pages = 384, 414}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Azali Bábí'''&lt;ref name = "Barrett"&gt;Barrett (2001) p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a070.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a follower of the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]] of [[Subh-i-Azal]] and the [[Báb]]. Early followers of the Báb were known as [[Bábism|Bábís]]; however, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís followed Mirza Husayn `Ali, known as [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and became known as [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis.&lt;ref&gt;"But the upshot of the whole matter is, that out of every hundred Bábís probably not more than three or four are Ezelís &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, all the rest accepting Behá'u'lláh &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the final and most perfect manifestation of the Truth." (Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm p. 351])&lt;/ref&gt;

Current estimates are that there are no more than a few thousand.&lt;ref name = Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "iranica"/&gt;

==Distinguishing characteristics==
{{Babism}}
{{main|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}
Azalis do not accept any who advanced claims to be the Báb's promised one ("[[He whom God shall make manifest|Him whom God shall make manifest]]"). The most bitterly contested claim is that of Bahá'u'lláh in 1863. Azalis rejected the divine claims of Bahá'u'lláh, arguing that the world must first accept the laws of the Báb before "He Whom God Shall Make Manifest" can appear.&lt;ref name = "Britannica: Azali"&gt;{{cite web | title = Azali | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011527/Azali | accessdate = 2006-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement in Persian secular and constitutional reform===
With respect to the direction that Azali Bábism took immediately after the split, [[Denis MacEoin|MacEoin]] notes:

{{quote|Azali Babism represents the conservative core of the original Babi movement, opposed to innovation and preaching a religion for a non-clerical gnostic elite rather than the masses. It also retains the original Babi antagonism to the Qajar state and a commitment to political activism, in distinction to the quietist stance of Baháism [sic]. Paradoxically, Azali conservatism in religious matters seems to have provided a matrix within which radical social and political ideas could be propounded.|&lt;ref name = "iranica"/&gt;}}

After the split with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were very active in secular reform movements and the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905&amp;ndash;1907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a [[heresy]] and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to believe it to be true. Coupled with the Azali practice of ''taqiyya'' (dissimulation) determining whether or not a particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.&lt;ref name = "iranica"/&gt;

===Taqiyya===
[[Taqiya]] ("dissimulation") was practiced by some Bábís. It was justified by some as a response to the often violent oppression the community faced. However, prominent Bábí leaders never encouraged individuals to practice it; and some who had practiced ''taqiyya'' later abandoned it, declared themselves openly, and were put to death.&lt;ref name="Manuchehri (1999)"&gt;{{Harvnb|Manuchehri|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Azalis, however, the practice became ingrained and widespread. One historian has noted:

{{quote|The Azali Babis and in particular Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani and Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi showed little hesitation in alteration and falsification of Babi teachings and history in their works. Azali Babis regarded taqiyyah as an imperative requirement.

In contrast the Azali Babis glorified taqiyyah in their literature. Taqiyyah was considered a virtue and classified into various levels of concealment. Prominent Azali leaders openly recanted their faith and even abused [the] Bab and Azal in the process.|&lt;ref name="Manuchehri (1999)"/&gt;}}

==Succession and aftermath==
There was some dispute on the question over who was Subh-i-Azal's appointed successor.&lt;ref&gt;Browne (1918) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/msbr6.htm pp. 312-314]&lt;/ref&gt; MacEoin states that Subh-i-Azal appointed Yahya Dawlatábádí as his successor in turn after the death of his (Yahya's) father, Mirza Hadi Dawlatábádí.&lt;ref name = "iranica"/&gt; However, this was disputed by Subh-i-Azal's grandson, [[Jalal Azal]] , indicating that this question was not entirely resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Momen, M. |title = The Cyprus Exiles |journal = Bahá'í Studies Bulletin |year = 1991 |page=106 |url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
MacEoin notes that, in any event, neither he (Yahya Dawlatábádí) nor anyone else arose to organize the affairs of the community, or produce significant writing to develop the religion. He goes on to say (writing in 1999):

{{quote|With the deaths of those Azalis who were active in the Constitutional period, Azali Babism entered a phase of stagnation from which it has never recovered. There is now no acknowledged leader nor, to the knowledge of the present writer, any central organization. Members tend to be secretive about their affiliation, converts are rare, and association appears to run along family lines. It is difficult to estimate current numbers, but these are unlikely to exceed one or two thousand, almost all of whom reside in Iran.|&lt;ref name = "iranica"/&gt;}}

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Peru''' begins with references to Peru in Bahá'í literature as early as 1916, with the first [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] visiting as early as 1919. A functioning community wasn't founded in [[Peru]] until the 1930s with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 |location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url =http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; which progressed into finding national Peruvian converts and achieved an independent national community in 1961.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844–1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953–1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963 | location = Haifa, Israel | pages = 19, 22, 23, 36, 46, 52, 109 | url =http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 41,900 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ==

[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on 8 April 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 – after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. `Abdu'l-Bahá's sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]]on 4 April 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]]. Hence the mercy of God must encompass all humanity. Therefore do ye not think it permissible to leave that region deprived of the breezes of the Morn of Guidance. Consequently, strive as far as ye are able to send to those parts fluent speakers, who are detached from aught else save God, attracted with the fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all desires and temptations. ...[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador|Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and the seventh country [[Belize]]...The teachers going to those parts must also be familiar with the [[Spanish language]].

The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unavailing in 1919. Foremost was [[Martha Root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Allmart | first = Husayn | title = Martha Root’s Journey to Chile | work = The Chilean Temple Initiative | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United State | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323081114/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | archivedate = 23 March 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root's travels included Peru which was reported in October 1920 in an edition of the ''Star of the West'', including making contact with several people through a Dr. Vargas.&lt;ref name="Morales"&gt;Boris Handal Morales (2011). ''[http://bahai-library.com/handal_eve_nicklin_english Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart (1895–1985), "Madre Spiritual del Perú"]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades ==

Among the earliest Bahá'ís known in Peru were Louis Mathew (1935) and Isabel Stebbins Dodge (1935–38).&lt;ref name="Morales" /&gt;[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on 1 May 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the 1 May cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on 19 May calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; Following this call Stuart and Nellie S. French (1936) went through Peru.&lt;ref name="Morales" /&gt; In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan'' (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; Isabel Stebbins Dodge was joined by her mother, Mrs. Joel Stebbins, the summer of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bahaiworldvolvii029810mbp/bahaiworldvolvii029810mbp_djvu.txt The Baha'i World; A Biennial International Record, Volume VII] p.18, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The first pioneer under the next plan was Eve Nicklin, called the "Spiritual Mother of Peru"&lt;ref name="Morales" /&gt; who arrived in Peru in 1941.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In 1942–3 she was able to coordinate a number of talks by traveling Bahá'í Philip Sprague amounting to several hundred people.&lt;ref name="Morales" /&gt;

In 1943 during the annual Bahá'í convention of the United States, Shoghi Effendi announced a Northern- and Southern-international convention which would include representatives from each state and province from the United States and Canada and each republic of Latin America. During this convention, Isabel Tirada de Barrada and Raymond Betts were the Peruvian delegates.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt;

The first South American Bahá'í Congress was held in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], November 1946. In 1947 the Bahá'í international teaching committee for South America (CEPSA) was appointed and the first members were all from Chile. Retrospectively a stated goal of the committee was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | issue = 493 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953.

=== Transition to Latin leadership ===

The second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in [[Santiago, Chile]], in January 1948 and was organized and executed by CEPSA. The Peruvian official delegate was Mercedes Sanchez. In 1950, the Bahá'í Faith achieved legal recognition in Chile with the formation of an international Regional Spiritual Assembly for South America whose first members were Edmund Miessler of [[Brazil]], Margot Worley of Brazil, Eve Nicklin of [[Peru]], Gayle Woolson of [[Colombia]], Esteban Canales of [[Paraguay]], Mercedes Sanchez of Peru, Dr. Alexander Reid of [[Chile]], Rangvald Taetz of [[Uruguay]], and Manuel Vera of Peru.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt;

In 1957 this Assembly was split into two – basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]] represented the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States at conventions held in Panama and Lima, Peru when Latin American national Baha'i assemblies were elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebabhistory.blogspot.com/2010/11/horace-holley-left-us-for-holy-land.html Jan. 1960: Horace Holley Left U.S. for Holy Land after Thirty-Six Years Service on U.S. National Spiritual Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National community ==

In 1961, ''La Asamblea Espiritual Nacional de los Bahais del Peru'' was elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/El+Salvador/articles/pfECxjAjjkX/Latin+America+Marks+Key+Anniversary+EstablishmentLatin America Marks Key Anniversary In Establishment Of Baha'i Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963 there were 19 delegates for the convention to elect the National Spiritual Assembly of Peru. For the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] the international head of the religion since its election in 1963, the delegates for the voting were the members of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the world.

In 1975 Bahá’ís attending an All-Quechua Bahá’í Conference were photographed beside a sign, which, translated from the Spanish, reads: “Bahá’u’lláh is the return of [[Viracocha]].”&lt;ref name="Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buck |first=Christopher |title=Native Messengers of God in Canada?

The first Aymara International Baha'i Conference was held in [[Juli, Peru]], in August 1978. More than 200 Baha'is from Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru were present. The entire conference was conducted in the [[Aymara language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1980 two teams of Native American Baha'is from Alaska, Canada and the United States representing 10 tribes under the name ''Trail of Light'' traveled from the north to the south starting mid June and taught in Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Bolivia, Chile, Peru and finally Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin America; 'Trail of Light' sets many hearts ablaze |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1982 |issue = 620 |issn=0195-9212 |pages=10–11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 a reprise of the 'Trail of Light' was undertaken when an international team of five Bahá'ís spent 17 days in Guatemala; they were a Mapuche Indian from Chile, a Quechua from Peru, a [[Bribri]] from Costa Rica, and two Guaymis from Panama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Guatemala |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1984 | issue = 638 |issn=0195-9212 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other efforts in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The World; Guatemala |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1984 | issue = 644|issn=0195-9212 |page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = 'Trail of Light' visits indigenous peoples|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1985 | issue = 649 |issn=0195-9212 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects promulgating the religion in southern Peru were noted in the 1980s among the [[Aymara people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing up in Miquihue/Cresciendo en Miquihue |work=The Chilean Temple Initiative About Chile Interviews |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |year=2009 |url=http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/59/44/ |accessdate=22 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315183834/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/59/44/ |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent situation ==

=== Socio-economic development ===

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[Socio-economic development (Bahá'í)|socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory" /&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 |journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

Since 1977 the international Bahá'í community has established several radio stations worldwide, particularly in the Americas. Programmes may include local news, music, topics related to socio-economic and community development, educational programmes focusing on [[indigenous language]] and culture, and Bahá'í introductory and deepening material.&lt;ref name="Smith-siyah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|title= radio; radio stations |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1|pages= 287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A project studied these radio stations through faculty from [[Northwestern University]] from 1980–1982, and briefly in 1983, and reviewed Bahá'í Radio projects in Peru and Bolivia as well and resulted in a PhD by Kurt John Hein in 1985 following which he took up service at [[WLGI]] Radio Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="Kurt"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hein | first = Kurt John | title = Radio Bahá'í – Ecuador; A Bahá'í Development Project | publisher = George Ronald | year = 1988 | location =  | page = 215 inc. bibliography | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=159 | isbn = 0-85398-272-4 | access-date = 23 January 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503204301/http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=159# | archive-date = 3 May 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Bahá'í radio]] station was established in Peru to nurture and preserve the local culture by featuring local story-tellers and music recorded at station-sponsored annual indigenous music festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Protection of Minorities, Written statement to the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities | year = 1994 | place = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Bahá'í International Community |url =http://statements.bahai.org/94-0819.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/oshea_hein_radio_ecuador Radio Baha'i Ecuador, by Kurt Hein: Review] by Des O'Shea, Published in CADE: Journal of Distance Education, 4:1, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; With regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the Bahá'í World Centre progress was maintained in developments of the radio stations in communication with the Audio-Visual Department at the Bahá'í administrative offices. In 1980 almost the entire staff of the radio station in Ecuador traveled to Peru to make extensive presentations to the international Bahá'í media conference in Puno where the second Bahá'í Radio station would be set up.&lt;ref name="Kurt" /&gt; Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. In the feedback it was highlighted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Peru one development for the [[International Youth Year]] was when about five hundred youth from eighteen countries in Latin America, North America and Europe attended a Youth Conference in Lima in 1985. Among the tribes and native groups represented were the Aymaras and Quechuas (Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru), the Mapuches (Chile) and the Aguarunas (Peru). Forty-seven youth organizations were officially represented on panels. Organized under the guidance of the Bahá'íNational Assembly of Peru, the conference was opened by Dr. Angel Degado, acting mayor of Lima. The gathering culminated in the creation of eight national and international youth projects including the planting of some 2000 plants in Lima's Grau Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bic.org/statements-and-reports/bic-statements/86-0603.htm International Youth Year]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 Regional conference ==

Regional conferences were called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] 20 October 2008 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. Just a month later a regional conference was hosted in Ecuador by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Ecuador in November 2008 and attracted over 1000 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | title = Big turnout for regional Baha’i conferences | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service| date = 11 November 2008 | url =http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story/668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | title = The Quito Regional Conference | newspaper = Bahá'í International News Service| date = 23 November 2008 | url =http://news.bahai.org/community-news/regional-conferences/quito.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early phase==
There were more than 160 references to the Bábí and Bahá'í religions in the Spanish daily press, books, periodicals and manuscripts from the founding of the religions in 1844 to 1947. The earliest press articles found were published in 1850 and announce the news of the [[Bábism#Zanjan upheaval|Zanjan upheaval]] (Madrid October 24) and the [[Execution of the Báb]] (Barcelona and Madrid on different days of November).  Most of the books found are translations of foreign authors or reference works like dictionaries, encyclopedias or manuals but there are some contributions made by Spanish authors.&lt;ref name="Irfan05"/&gt; See also [[Bahá'í Faith in the Netherlands#First Contact|first contact]] between the Netherlands and the Bábí and Bahá'í faiths.

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
In the history of the Bahá'í Faith the first mentions of Spain start in the twentieth century. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911-12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Establishment of the community==
[[Leonora Armstrong]] was an American pioneer living in Brazil when she saw to a translation into Spanish.&lt;ref name="dblcrus"/&gt; She decided to go to [[Madrid]] to study the Spanish language because [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion, wanted Spanish literature and she wanted to become proficient in the language. In July 1930 she boarded a French ship which first took her to several ports of call in West Africa and then to Barcelona.

In September 1942 Bahá'í Virginia Orbison pioneered for the first time when she arrived in Santiago, Chile, from the United States to carry on the work begun by Marcia Atwater. See [[Bahá'í Faith in Chile]]. After a few years she returned to the US briefly before moving south again -this time to Brazil where she met Leonora Armstrong and reviewed the translation Armstrong had contracted.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; Starting in 1946, following [[World War II]], Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bahá'í community to send [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to Europe including Spain; the Bahá'ís set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by [[Edna True]].&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburg | first = Margit | editor = Peter Smith | title = Bahá'ís in the West | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2004 | pages = 228–63 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=hlmFDBtqxOwDtX3by7wn6EYCqec#PPA233,M1 | isbn = 1-890688-11-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison was the first pioneer under the European Committee to reach Spain in January 1947.&lt;ref name="BN191"/&gt; The second pioneer to Spain was Eduardo Gonzales in June 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = European Teaching|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1947 | number = 197 | page =1 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed until March 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Success Marks Santiago Congress|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1948 | number = 197 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbison describes conditions early on - "You had to know someone well before you'd dare mention the Faith."&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; Nevertheless, a young bank employee had carried on correspondence about [[Esperanto]] with a friend of Orbison's in the United States and they were able to meet and discuss the religion. Orbison mentioned that a universal auxiliary language was a [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í teaching]]. He and a friend returned the next day and both soon joined the religion. Other early contacts were afraid to be associated with the religion.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; By June 1947 there is mention of the first two converts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Baha'i Pilgrimage|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1947 | number = 200 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of Madrid was formed.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]], a prominent Bahá'í and member of the Committee, visited the Bahá'ís in Spain among other European countries in 1948 and again in 1951 when she was appointed as a [[Hand of the Cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Activities in Europe|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1954 | number = 277 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 1949 there were two assemblies in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = European News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1949 | number = 220 | page =3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Orbison, Marion Little, and a Spaniard Bahá'í traveled to Barcelona to meet Bahá'ís there.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; By April 1950 Else Horneman had joined Orbison in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = European Teaching Committee|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1950 | number = 230 | page =17 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==

===Towards a national organization===
In September 1951 the first Iberian conference took place with nine native Bahá'ís and other pioneers who had attended the Fourth European Teaching Conference – recommendations from the consultation included exchanging updated information and further coordination between the communities, and to send contributions for the final work on the [[Shrine of the Báb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Iberian Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1951 | number = 250 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 a large meeting was held by the Spaniards in Barcelona which Orbison attended.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; According to Orbison's recollection many years later the next morning the police investigated the meeting and the women staying in the apartment were arrested on investigation that they were communists. All the Bahá'ís of Barcelona were then gathered and questioned. The fact of converting one communist to a religion believing in God, and affirmations of Bahá'í teachings of obedience to government, may have played a role in relaxing the fears of the police. Regardless all were released.&lt;ref name="BN586"/&gt; In October 1953 Americans pioneers Gertrude Eisenberg and Tenerife True pioneered to the [[Canary Islands]] and in June 1954 a young Persian, Shoghi Riaz Rouhani, also moved there.

In 1955 the first native Carnarians joined the religion and in April the first assemblies of the Canaries were elected simultaneously in the cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].&lt;ref name="canaries"&gt;{{Cite web|title=50th Anniversary of the Bahá'í Community in the Canaries (1953–2003) |work=Official Website of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Canary Islands |publisher=Comunidad Bahá`í de Canarias |year=2007 |url=http://www.bahai-canarias.org/aniversa/index.php |accessdate=2018-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907052827/http://www.bahai-canarias.org/aniversa/index.php |archivedate=2013-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955 there was an assembly in [[Murcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The 1st Local Spiritual Assembly…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1955 | number = 289 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alicante]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News - Spiritual Assembly of the…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1955 | number = 308 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1955 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of [[Ceuta]] was elected.&lt;ref name="BN300"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Local Spiritual Assembly of Ceuta… |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1956 | number = 300 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regional national assembly was elected for the Iberian peninsula from 1957 to 1962.&lt;ref name="nsas"/&gt; The 1957 convention was witnessed by [[Charles Wolcott]] as a representative of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = We Look at Our Objectives|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1957 | number = 316 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Iberian Peninsula|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1958 | number = 329 |pages=21–22 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born, raised, and married in Iran, Rúhu'lláh Furúghí moved to Spain in October 1958 with his wife and five children (the youngest, one year of age, the eldest fifteen).&lt;ref name="ruhu"&gt;{{Cite book | title = In Memoriam; Rúhu'lláh Furúghí, 1915-1979 | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre  | pages = 690–691 | year = 1986 | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/666-693.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1 | author = prepared under the supervision of the Universal House of Justice.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no knowledge of the language nor of the circumstances in their chosen goal. After spending nine months in [[Barcelona]] he moved with his family to [[Mallorca]] to assist with the formation of its first local assembly. Three years later the family pioneered once more, this time to [[Granada]] where there had been no Bahá`ís.

[[Guy Murchie]] is Bahá'í and former staff writer for the [[Chicago Sunday Tribune]] and author of several books. For a time around 1958 he was living in [[Málaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Murchie | first = Guy | title = I am a Baha'i | newspaper = Chicago Sunday Tribune | date = 1958-07-13 | url = http://bahai-library.com/murchie_pamphlet_reprint_article | accessdate = 2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1959 there were 28 Bahá'ís registered in Spain.&lt;ref name="BN341" /&gt; In May 1959 the first Bahá'í marriage was registered with the government as a civil ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Attain First Recognition of Baha'i Marriage in Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1959 | number = 342 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Spain was first elected in 1962&lt;ref name="nsas"/&gt; with attendance by [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Paul Haney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Long-Awaited New European National Communities Spring into Being|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1959 | number = 376 |pages=8–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first members were: Antonio Jimenez, Luis Ortuno, Francisco Salas, Jose Lopez Monge, Ruhollah Mehrabhkani, Carlos Chias, Ramon Escartin, Isidro Torrella, and Charles Ioas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Goals Gained In Continental Europe|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1959 | number = 376 | page =14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since forming a national community===
In 1964 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[John Ferraby]] visited Bahá'ís of Murcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Meeting in Murcia, Spain…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1964 | number = 401 | page =5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a regional conference was held in Cartagena, in the south of Spain, to discuss the progress of the religion in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Regional Teaching Conjerence held in Cartagena…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1964 | number = 410 | page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first assembly of Granada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = In Europe|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1965 | number = 412 | page =12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Santa Maria de Barbara in Cataluñia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = New Local Assemblies in Europe|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1965 | number = 428 | page =11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; was elected in 1965.

====Bahá'í Schools====
In August 1968 the national assembly purchased land for a permanent [[Bahá'í school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News Briefs |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1968 | number = 449 | page =13 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural summer school, with Hand of the Cause Dr. [[Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir]], in [[Liria]] in August 1971 with attendees from 19 communities.&lt;ref name="BN449"/&gt; In July 1975 Hand of the Cause of God [[Ugo Giachery]] gave a talk at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World - Spain; Mr. Giachery speaks at Summer School |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1975 | volume = 52 | number = 08 | page =20 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 1976 there was a viewing of ''The Green Light Expedition''documenting Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]]'s trip up the Amazon River and into the high mountain ranges of Peru and Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World - Spain; Spanish Bahá'ís attend winter school |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1977 | number = 550 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1977 session of the school held sessions for children, youth and adults which attracted 227 people including 30 non-Bahá'ís, and 35 children.&lt;ref name="BN560"/&gt; In 1981 the Bahá'ís held a second school in the north central region of Spain to which over 100 people form 26 communities attended.&lt;ref name="BN611"/&gt; In 1983 some 200 Bahá'ís from 45 communities gathered for a spiritualization conference at the national school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World - Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1983 | number = 630 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =17 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 [[Institution of the Counsellors|Continental Counselor]] Mas'úd Khamsí toured among the communities of Bahá'ís and gave public interviews and met with institutions of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World - Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1984 | number = 640 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spiritual Assembly of Mallorca held several month long classes (mostly for non-Bahá'ís) in computer usage in two cities on the island in 1985.&lt;ref name="BN661"/&gt; In 1986 Bahá'ís in Terrassa and Cartagena held weekend institutes on the subject of the equality of women and men - a core [[Bahá'í teachings|Bahá'í teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1987 | number = 672 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 some 170 Persian speaking Bahá'ís gathered at the national school -the keynote talk was given by [[Adib Taherzadeh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1987 | number = 672 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiplying interests====
In July 1968 that the national assembly received registry number 2 in the Register of Non-Catholic Religious Associations in the Ministry of Justice. This recognition of the National Spiritual Assembly carries with it the automatic legal recognition of all Local Spiritual Assemblies duly formed in accordance with the Statutes of the National Spiritual Assembly after various government levels and to the Supreme Court denied options. In December 1966 a new basic law of the land was approved by national referendum, and one provision of the new law provided for government protection of all religions. To implement this new concept, a Law on Religious Liberty was passed by the national Parliament on June 28, 1967.&lt;ref name="BN446"/&gt; At the same time the religion was registered in the Ministry of Information and Tourism thus permitting the publication of [[Bahá'í literature]] in Spain, as well as the importation and distribution of religious materials from outside the country. Following the registrations it was possible to hold public meetings for the first time and to present the religion a number of venues and several articles on the Faith were published in Catalonia, the Balearic and Canary Islands and elsewhere. Radio program broadcast mention of the religion for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News Briefs|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1969 | number = 449 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historic Meefing at Malaga, Spain|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1971 | number = 483 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national assembly initiated the ''Bahá'í News Bulletin'' internally while externally a number of articles were published by various journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Spain – Publicity|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1970 | number = 469 | page =22 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 an observance of [[Human Rights Day]] was sponsored by the Bahá'ís of Barcelona with some 200 persons attending. The guest speaker's talk was entitled "Equality of Rights and Opportunities, Especially Regarding Women" while Bahá'í Professor Mehrabkhani presented "The Spiritual Source of Human Rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Bahá'í – United Nations Activities Around the World In 1971 |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1972 | number = 496 |pages=20–22 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was held again in 1973 and the Bahá'ís of Tarasa held its first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Reports from Spain, Singapore, Swaziland and Tanzania |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1973 | number = 507 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the first televised broadcast mentioning the religion was aired with interviews of Bahá'ís and the Bahá'ís organized their first institute on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Around the World - Spain: Information on Faith aired over television |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1974 | number = 523 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 radio coverage of the religion expanded with a variety of programs including some regular programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Around the World - Spain |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1979 | number = 579 | ISSN=0043-8804 | page =13 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the Bahá'í community of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] Majorca was among nine religious groups asked to participate in a round table discussion sponsored by an ecumenical organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Around the World- Spain |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1980 | number = 589 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'ís suggested that a group be formed to help teachers include spiritual education, without proselytizing, in the regular school curricula. The Bahá'ís were then asked to develop the idea and present a plan of action at a later meeting. Monthly meetings presided over by a priest were held at the Bahá'í center to work on the project. In 1980 the national assembly began to publish "Pensamiento Baha'i" (Baha'i Thought), in bi-monthly form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Around the World - Spain |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1980 | number = 595 | ISSN=0195-9212 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

In the Canaries in 1990 European youth gathered in Gran Canaria some of whom went on to form "Art Sano," in 1998 and performed around the island.&lt;ref name="canaries"/&gt; Bahá'ís were present in the [[University of La Laguna]] since the late eighties and officially formed the University Bahá'í Club began to 1993.&lt;ref name="canaries"/&gt; In November 1992 seventy-two Bahá'ís from the Canaries participated in the second [[Bahá'í World Congress]].&lt;ref name="canaries"/&gt; In 1994 the Bahá'ís of the Canaries formed the Bahá'í Association of Women.&lt;ref name="canaries"/&gt;

Regional conferences were called for by the [[Universal House of Justice]] in October 2008 and one was held for the Iberian peninsula 24–25 January 2009 to celebrate recent achievements in grassroots community-building and to plan their next steps in organizing in their home areas. More than 1,000 Bahá'ís from Spain, 140 from Portugal, and 135 from the Canary Islands attended. In addition, two Baha’is came from the principality of Andorra in the Pyrenees Mountains, and nine from the Spanish city of Melilla in North Africa.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Callirrhoe''' or '''Callirhoe''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Καλλιρρόη, meaning "Beautiful Flow," often written '''Callirrhoë''') was a [[naiads|naiad]].

Evelyn-White. Theogony.

[[File:Methodistcommunion2.jpg|thumb|A [[Holy Echarist|Communion Sunday]] service at a [[United Methodist]] church in the United States.]]

A '''church service''' (also called a '''service of worship''', or simply a '''service''') is a formalized period of christian communal [[Christian worship|worship]], often held in a church building. It often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing [[seventh-day Sabbatarianism]]. The church service is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the 'Word of God' (the [[Christian Bible]]) and encouraged in their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]]. Technically, the "church" in "church service" refers to the [[Christian church|gathering of the faithful]] rather than to the [[Church (building)|building]] in which it takes place. In most Christian traditions, services are presided over by [[clergy]] wherever possible.

Styles of service vary greatly, from the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] traditions of [[liturgy|liturgical]] worship to the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] style, that often combines worship with teaching for the believers, which may also have an evangelistic component appealing to the non-Christians or skeptics in the congregation. [[Quakers]] and some other groups have no formal outline to their services, but allow the worship to develop as the participants present feel moved.

==From Jewish to Christian services==
{{see also|Early Christianity}}
The first miracle of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], the healing of the crippled man on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] steps, occurred because [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] went to the Temple to pray ({{bibleverse||Acts|3:1}}). Since the Apostles were originally Jews, see [[Jewish Christians]], the concept of fixed hours for services, and services therefore which differed from weekday to [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] to holy day, were familiar to them. [[Pliny the Younger]] (63 - ca. 113), who was not a Christian himself, mentions not only fixed times of prayer by believers, but also specific services—other than the [[Eucharist]]—assigned to those times: "They met on a stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a divinity ... after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat in common a harmless meal."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Epistulae'', Book X, [http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?pageno=117&amp;fk_files=2025 Letter xcvii].&lt;/ref&gt;

The real evolution of the Christian service in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] is shrouded in mystery. By the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|second]] and [[Christianity in the 3rd century|third centuries]], such [[Church Fathers]] as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], and [[Tertullian]] wrote of formalised, regular services: the practice of [[Matins|Morning]] and [[Vespers|Evening]] Prayer, and prayers at the third hour of the day ([[terce]]), the sixth hour of the day ([[sext]]), and the ninth hour of the day ([[none (liturgy)|none]]).  With reference to the Jewish practices, it is surely no coincidence that these major hours of prayer correspond to the first and last hour of the conventional day, and that on Sundays (corresponding to the [[Sabbath in Christianity]]), the services are more complex and longer (involving twice as many services if one counts the [[Eucharist]] and the afternoon service). Similarly, the liturgical year from [[Christmas]] via [[Easter]] to [[Pentecost]] covers roughly five months, the other seven having no major services linked to the work of Christ. However, this is not to say that the Jewish services were copied or deliberately substituted, see [[Supersessionism]].

==Contemporary church service==
[[File:Bishop Francis R. Reiss, Preaching 2012.jpg|thumb|left|A [[sermon]], or [[homily]], is an element of a church service.]]
Today a wide variety of church services exist, from the long and elaborate services of [[Eastern Christianity]] to the very basic [[Evangelism|Evangelistic]] sermon. Though the majority of services are still conducted in church buildings designed specifically for that purpose, some services take place in "store front" or temporary settings. For those unable to attend a service in a church building a burgeoning [[televangelism]] and radio ministry provides broadcasts of services. A number of Websites have been set up as "cyber-churches" to provide a virtual worship space free to anyone on the Internet.

Church services are often planned and led by a single pastor or a small group of [[elder (Christianity)|elders]] or may follow a format laid out by the dictates of the denomination. Some churches are "lay led" with members of the congregation taking turns guiding the service or simply following format that has evolved over time between the active members.

A few begin their church services with the ringing of a [[church bell|bell]] (or a [[ring of bells|number of bells]]). The service usually involves the singing of [[Hymn#Christian hymnody|hymns]], reading of [[scripture]] verses and possibly a [[psalm]], and a [[sermon]]. If the church follows a [[lectionary]], the sermon will often be about the scripture [[lection]]s assigned to that day. [[Eucharist]]ic churches have usually [[Holy Communion]] either every Sunday or several Sundays a month. Less liturgical congregations tend to place a greater emphasis on the sermon.

Vocal music is traditionally sung by a [[choir]] or the [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] (or a mixture of the two), usually accompanied by an [[organ (music)|organ]]. Sometimes other instruments such as piano, classical instruments, or modern band instruments may be part of the service, especially in churches influenced by the [[contemporary worship]] movement. Some churches are equipped with state-of-the-art [[multi-media]] equipment to add to the worship experience. The congregation may sing along in [[hymnal]]s or words to hymns and worship songs may be displayed on a screen. More liturgical denominations may have the words to specific prayers written in a [[missal]]ette or [[prayer book]], which the congregation follows.

Many churches will take up a [[collection plate|collection]] during the service. The rationale for this is taken from {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:1-2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|9:9-11|KJV}}, and {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|5:16-18|KJV}}. But some churches eschew this practice in favor of voluntary anonymous donations for which a box or plate may be set up by the entrance, or return-address envelopes may be provided that worshippers may take with them.

Some churches offer [[Sunday school]] classes. These will often be for younger children, and may take place during the whole of the service (while the adults are in church), or the children may be present for the beginning of the service and at a prearranged point leave the service to go to Sunday school. Some churches have adult Sunday school either before or after the main worship service.

Following the service, there will often be an opportunity for fellowship in the [[Fellowship hall|church hall]] or other convenient place. This provides the members of the congregation a chance to socialize with each other and to greet visitors or new members. Coffee or other refreshments may be served.

{{Main|Christian liturgy}}

Church services take many forms, and set liturgies may have different names. Services typically include:

*Regular Sunday services. These are a part of most traditions. [[Holy Communion]] may be celebrated at some or all of these; often it is included either once a month or once a quarter. A few denominations have their main weekly services on Saturday rather than Sunday. Larger churches often tend to have several services each Sunday; often two or three in the morning and one or two in the late afternoon or evening.
*Midweek services. Again, Holy Communion can be part of these, either on every occasion or on a regular basis.
*Holiday services. Treated like a regular Sunday service, but made more specific for the day.
*[[Wedding]]s. These are normally separate services, rather than being incorporated into a regular service, but may be either.
*[[Funeral]]s. These are always separate services. 
*[[Baptism]]s. These may be incorporated into a regular service, or separate.
*[[Confirmation]]. This is normally incorporated into a regular Sunday service, which will also include communion. It was traditionally the [[first Communion]] of the confirmee, but more recently children whether confirmed or not are invited to communion in some denominations.
*[[Ordination]] of clergy. New bishops, elders, priests and deacons are usually ordained or installed generally in a solemn but celebratory ceremony on Saturday or Sunday generally open to the public either by their own superior or another approved senior minister with ordination powers either at the area headquarters church or the cathedral or another church agreed upon by those to be ordained and the ordaining ministers. Ordination of bishops or elders may require consecration by more than one individual and have a more limited audience.   
*[[First Communion]]. Children may celebrate Communion for the first time.
*Opening of new churches or church buildings.
*Dedication of new [[missionary|missionaries]] or those about to be sent on new missions.
*[[Compline]]
*[[Canonical hours]]
*[[Divine Liturgy]]
*[[Divine Service (Lutheran)]]
*[[Evening Prayer (Anglican)]]
*[[Easter Vigil]]
*[[Mass (liturgy)]]
*[[Morning Prayer (Anglican)]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2654">'''Favomancy''' is a form of [[divination]] that involves throwing [[common beans|beans]] on the ground and interpreting the patterns into which the beans fall; it is therefore a type of [[cleromancy]]. Various forms of favomancy are present across the world's cultures. The term comes from the [[Vicia Faba]] meaning Fava bean, and by way of cult etymology, from the [[Latin]] ''faba'' for "bean" and formed by analogy with the names of similar divination methods such as [[alectromancy]].

Favomancy used to be practised by seers in [[Russia]], in particular, among the [[Ubykh people|Ubykh]]. Russian methods of favomancy may still exist after the departure of the Ubykhs from the Caucasus in 1864, but the details are now lost of exactly how Ubykh soothsayers interpreted the patterns formed by the beans.&lt;ref&gt;Tsapina, O. 2002 ''Something Old, Something New: Continuity and Modernization in Eighteenth-Century Russia.'' Available from [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth-century_studies/v035/35.2tsapina.html JHU].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] term for a favomancer (pxażayš’) simply means "bean-thrower", and it later became a synonym for all [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s and seers in general in that language.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, H. 1963 ''Dictionnaire de la langue oubykh'' page 149. Universitetsforlaget: Oslo.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Muslim traditions of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], favomancy is called ''bacanje graha'' 'bean-throwing' or ''falanje'' (from Persian ''fal'' 'to bode'). The fortune-teller places 41 white beans onto a flat surface, dividing them into smaller groups using a complex set of rules. The resulting number of beans in each group is then interpreted as a favorable or unfavorable sign for the different aspects of life represented by each of the groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falanje.com/page.php?15 |title=Fortune telling |publisher=Falanje.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Russian and Bosnian methods are remarkably similar, and likely share a common origin. Since the method is not present in the West, it is possible that the origin might be in the Middle East. A similar method exists in Iran, involving fifty-three peas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGap-UV72KwC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=Reading Russian Fortunes: Print Culture, Gender and Divination in Russia from 1765 |author=Faith Wigzell |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3qJMMYH6VYC&amp;pg=PA113 |title=The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia |author=William Francis Ryan |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion. 2 (2006) Article 1: www.religjournal.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and policy framework==

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government declares that it generally respect this right.&lt;ref name="servat.unibe.ch"&gt;http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/al00000_.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Government declares its secularism. There is no official religion and all religions are equal;&lt;ref name="servat.unibe.ch" /&gt; however, the predominant religious communities (Sunni Muslim, Bektashi, Orthodox, and Catholic) enjoy a greater degree of official recognition (e.g., national holidays) and social status based on their historical presence in the country. Official holidays include holy days from all four predominant faiths.

All registered religious groups have the right to hold bank accounts and to own property and buildings. No restriction is imposed on families regarding the way they raise their children with respect to religious practices. The generally amicable relationship among religions in society contributed to religious freedom.

===Licensing===

The Government doesn't require registration or licensing of religious groups; however, the State Committee on Cults maintains records and statistics on foreign religious organizations that contact it for assistance. No groups reported difficulties registering during the period covered by this report. All registered religious groups have the right to hold bank accounts and own property. Religious movements may acquire the official status of a juridical person by registering with the Tirana District Court under the Law on Nonprofit Organizations, which recognizes the status of a nonprofit association regardless of whether the organization has a cultural, recreational, religious, or humanitarian character. All religious communities have criticized the Government for its unwillingness to grant them tax-exempt status. Since 2003 foreign religious missionaries have been exempt from the residence permit tax.

The State Committee on Cults, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture, Youth, and Sports, is charged with regulating relations between the Government and all religious communities as well as protecting freedom of religion and promoting interreligious cooperation and understanding. The committee claims that its records on religious organizations facilitate the granting of residence permits by police to foreign employees of various religious organizations. No organization claimed any difficulty in obtaining residency permits during the period covered by this report. However, as a general rule, foreign religious missionaries were issued only 1-year residency permits instead of the 5-year permits allowed by law for residents in the country more than 2 years. During the period covered by this report, the Committee began working with the Government on criteria that would allow longer-term residency permits of up to 5 years for well-established religious organizations with long-term ties to the country.

There is no law or regulation forcing religious organizations to notify the Committee of their activities; however, article 10 of the Constitution calls for separate bilateral agreements to regulate relations between the Government and religious communities. The Catholic Church continued to be the only religious community that had finalized such an agreement with the Government. The Committee had a mandate to negotiate agreements with the three remaining groups and created a working group in May 2006 for this purpose. The Committee reportedly reached an agreement with three groups—the Muslim, Orthodox, and Muslim Bektashi communities. VUSH, a Protestant umbrella organization, approached the Committee to negotiate a bilateral agreement but had not received a response by the end of the reporting period.

===Religious Schools===

The Ministry of Education states that public schools in the country are secular and that the law prohibits ideological and religious indoctrination.&lt;ref name="servat.unibe.ch"/&gt; According to official figures, religious communities, organizations, and foundations managed 101 educational institutions, of which 15 were officially religious-affiliated schools, with more than 2,600 students. By law the Ministry of Education must license such schools, and curricula must comply with national education standards. The Catholic and Muslim groups operated numerous state-licensed schools and reported no problems in obtaining new licenses for new schools. The Orthodox Church and the Bektashis operated strictly religious educational centers for the training of clerics.

==Religious property claims==
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion; however, restitution of property expropriated by the former communist government continued to be a problem. According to the law on the restitution of and compensation for such properties, religious communities have the same rights as private individuals in matters of property restitution or compensation, but the religious communities questioned the law's limitation on property restitution to {{convert|150|acre|km2}}. During the reporting period, the Government had not established a special fund for monetary compensation, but the Prime Minister's Office consistently attempted to resolve religious property issues. The Government also announced plans to remove bureaucratic and legalistic hurdles that hindered the return of confiscated properties by eliminating the requirement that religious organizations produce titles and deeds to prove original ownership. During the communist era, properties confiscated by the regime generally were recorded, and the Government was working to recognize these archival documents as equivalent to property titles, thus clarifying land ownership in some cases.

All four major traditional communities had substantial property claims that remained unresolved. In cases involving the return of religious buildings, the Government often failed to return the land surrounding the buildings, sometimes because of redevelopment claims by private individuals who began farming it or using it for other purposes. The Orthodox Church continued construction of a new cathedral in Tirana on a parcel of land that it received as compensation for other land seized by the communist government, but it claimed a lack of action on other property claims throughout the country, as well as difficulty in recovering religious icons and precious manuscripts. Both the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church were trying to regain possession of archives seized by the communist government and held in the national archives.

Although the Catholic Church had substantial outstanding property claims, it indicated that it was not actively pursuing these and had decided to focus its efforts in other areas. Nevertheless, if compensation were eventually to be paid out to other religious groups, it would expect to receive compensation as well.

The Albanian Islamic Community and the Muslim Bektashis also requested that the Government return a number of properties. The Islamic Community succeeded in obtaining the title to a large parcel of land in Tirana where a mosque once stood. However, it did not receive a building permit for construction of a new mosque. Under the new Urban Regulatory Plan for Tirana, another parcel of land in Tirana, also owned by the Islamic Community, had been set aside for this purpose. The Islamic Community rejected this location as too small and continued to favor the original site. The problem remained unresolved at the end of the period covered by this report. The Bektashi community was also seeking compensation from the Government for victims of religious maltreatment during the communist regime.

==Citizenship issues==
The Orthodox Church's 1954 statute states that its archbishop must have Albanian citizenship; however, the archbishop was a Greek citizen who was seeking Albanian citizenship. During the period covered by this report, the Government did not take action on his citizenship application, submitted in 2003.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
Generally, Albania has very little religious strife. However, there have been some incidents of mistreatment as a result of religious beliefs.

Since 2001 a number of Albanian Muslims have been harassed, discriminated and persecuted because of their religious beliefs. The Security Services of Albania have detained an Albanian imam, Artan Kristo, without any proven conviction. According to Artan Kristo's statements and the statements of a number of Albanian imams and the Muslim Forum of Albania, Kristo is illegally detained, since he did not agree to become a spy for the Albanian Security Services.

While there is no law restricting the demonstration of religious affiliation in public schools, there have been instances when students were not allowed to do so in practice. In December 2003, a male Muslim student was prohibited from having his [[diploma]] photograph taken because he had a beard. The student was eventually permitted to graduate through the intervention of the Office of the [[Ombudsman]] (a government institution tasked with investigating citizens' charges of human rights violations and protecting their fundamental freedoms).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  

In 2002, some [[Bektashi]] communities outside of Tirana experienced intimidation, vandalism, and threats of violence. Subsequently, the Albanian authorities identified those responsible (non-Albanian citizens) and expelled them for immigration laws violations. There were no new reports of vandalism during the period covered by this report. Bektashi leaders believe that foreign religious influences seeking to undermine the country's efforts to maintain religious tolerance and freedom were at the root of these incidents. Other religious leaders have expressed similar concerns about the potentially divisive role played by foreign religious extremists.&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35434.htm | work = International Religious Freedom Report 2004 | title = Albania | publisher = [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], [[United States Department of State]] | date = 15 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Secretary of the Islamic Community of Albania, Sali Tivari, was shot and killed at the Community's headquarters in January 2003. The General [[Prosecutor]]'s Office returned the case to the authorities for further investigation and it has remained unsolved by the end of the period covered by this report.&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004" /&gt;

In October 2003, police arrested Kastriot Myftari, author of the book "Albanian National Islamism" on charges of inciting [[religious hatred]] against Islam. The book contained the author's opinions on Islam and how the religion has impacted upon Albanian life. According to the [[prosecutor]]'s office, several statements in the book demeaned Islam. The prosecutor had asked the [[court]] for 6 months [[imprisonment]] for the author. In June, the court acquitted Myftari of all charges.&lt;ref name="state.gov-2004" /&gt;

During year 2004, representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] expressed concerns that churches, crosses, and other buildings were targets of [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51536.htm | title = Albania | work = International Religious Freedom Report 2005 | publisher = [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], [[United States Department of State]] | date = 8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005 a speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.president.al/english/pub/info.asp?id=1089 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712211636/http://www.president.al/english/pub/info.asp?id=1089 | archivedate = 12 July 2007 | title = The Lecture of President Moisiu at the Oxford Forum "The Inter-religious tolerance in the tradition of the Albanian people." | date = 9 November 2005 | work = President of the Republic of Albania}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Albania's president in London, aroused public protests from [[The Muslim Forum of Albania]] that accused the president of insulting Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.forumimusliman.org/english/pershtyp7.html | publisher = [[The Muslim Forum of Albania]] | title = Su: The President of Albania, Alfred Moisiu, insults the Muslims | date = 11 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, a novel from the Socialist MP, Ben Blushi was condemned by a number of Muslim NGO's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.forumimusliman.org/english/blushi.html | publisher = [[The Muslim Forum of Albania]] | title = The Muslim Forum and other Muslim associations are annoyed by the racism and islamophobia of Ben Blushi | date = 28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as racist and Islamophobic. According to the NGO's the author shows signs of racism against the Turks, [[Romani people]] and Albanian Muslims in the novel, and portrays the prophet Muhammed in a very disrespectful way.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country. There were no reports of forced religious conversion.

'''Gopachal rock-cut Jain monuments''', also called ''Gopachal Parvat'' Jaina monuments, are a group of Jain carvings dated to between 7th and 15th century. They are located on the south side of [[Gwalior Fort]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]. They depict Tirthankaras in seated [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] posture as well as standing [[Kayotsarga]] posture, in the typical naked form of Jain iconography. This group of Jain monuments is related to numerous others found in the north side of the fort including the [[Siddhachal Caves]].

==Location==
The Gopachal rock cut Jain monuments are located inside the fort of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, on a rock cliff east of the [[Scindia School]]. The Gwalior city and the fort is connected to other Indian cities by major highways NH 44 and 46 (Asian Highway 43 and 47), a railway station and airport ([[IATA]]: GWL). It is located near other historic Hindu and Jain temples from the medieval era.&lt;ref name="TitzeBruhn1998p106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asibhopal.nic.in/monument/morena_padhavali_groupoftemplesatbatesar.html Group of temples at Batesar], ASI Bhopal Circle (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asibhopal.nic.in/monument/morena_naresar_temples1to22.html Naresar Temples], ASI Bhopal Circle (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Gopachal rock cut monuments are a part of nearly 100 Jain monuments found in and around the Gwalior city, but these are dated earlier than the [[Siddhachal Caves]] located about {{Convert|2|km}} north of these monuments. Both monuments were defaced and desecrated around 1527 when the Emperor Babur ordered their destruction.&lt;ref name=cunninghamgfortjain&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologicalsu02arch#page/n455/mode/2up Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures], A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 364-370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kurt Titze|author2=Klaus Bruhn|title=Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loQkEIf8z5wC|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1534-6|pages=101–102}}, Quote: "In 1527, the Urvahi Jinas were mutilated by the Mughal emperor Babar, a fact he records in his memoirs".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ringp314"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Noelle Watson|author3=Paul Schellinger|title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA314|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-63979-1|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, the Jain community restored many of the statues by adding back stucco heads on the top of the damaged idols.&lt;ref name=cunninghamgfortjain/&gt;

The prolific [[Apabhramsha]] author [[Raidhu]] was responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carved images  as attested by multiple inscriptions.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=31}} These include the two colossal images of [[Rishabhanatha|Adinatha]] (57 feet) and [[Chandraprabha]].{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}}

== Description ==
The Gopachal rock-cut monuments depict the Tirthankaras in seated or standing meditating positions. They are not as colossal as some of those found in the Siddhachal Caves, but they are big. The Gopachal monuments include standing and seated [[Rishabhanatha]] (Adinatha), [[Neminatha]], [[Parshvanatha]] and [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name="TitzeBruhn1998p106"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cunninghamgfortjain/&gt;&lt;ref name=asifortjain&gt;[http://asibhopal.nic.in/monument/gwalior_gwalior_gwaliorfort_more.html Gwalior Fort], Archaeological Survey of India, Bhopal Circle, India (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TitzeBruhn1998p106"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kurt Titze|author2=Klaus Bruhn|title=Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loQkEIf8z5wC|year=1998|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1534-6|pages=106–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jains, Tirthankara Parshvanath delivered his discourse ([[deshna]]) on this hill.

'''Gerhard Albert Baum''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (1923–2017), better known as '''Gregory Baum''', was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] priest and theologian in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. He became known in North America and Europe in the 1960s for his work on ecumenism, interfaith dialogue, and the relationship between the Catholic Church and Jews. In the later 1960s, he went to the New School for Social Theory in New York and became a sociologist, which led to his work on creating a dialogue between [[classical sociology]] ([[Marx]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Durkheim]], [[Toennies]], [[Weber]], etc.) and Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Gregory|title=Religion and Alienation, 2nd Edition|date=2006|publisher=Novalis|location=Ottawa|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, he welcomed the insights of the Theology of Liberation that came from Latin America and other societies. He also became interested in the work of Karl Mannheim and developed a program of ideology critique that he hoped would eliminate the ideological elements in religion, especially those elements that preached contempt for others and allowed Christians to remain unmoved by the suffering of the victims of social injustice and structural violence.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Baum continued his study into ideology critique by integrating the work of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. He connected the Frankfurt School's concept of "the end of innocent critique" with the Catholic Church's "preferential option for the poor". Both concepts extended his interest in ideology critique. Since Baum has always been interested in social ethics, he also studied the work of Karl Polanyi, with whom he sympathized greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Gregory|title=Religion and Alienation, 2nd Edition|date=2006|publisher=Novalis|location=Ottawa|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in the late 1980s that Baum moved to Quebec and developed an interest in Quebec Catholicism, which he saw as more progressive and contextual than its English Canadian and American counterparts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Early life==
Born on June 20, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= O'Brien | first=John Anthony |date=1964 | title=Steps to Christian unity | publisher= Doubleday | page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[Jews|Jewish]] mother and a Protestant father, in [[Berlin]], he came to Canada from England as a war refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/actualites-en-societe/369349/c-etait-un-temps-ou-les-juifs-etaient-internes-au-quebec | accessdate = October 20, 2017 | language = fr | date= January 26, 2013 | title= C’était un temps où des réfugiés juifs étaient internés au Québec | first = Fabien | last= Deglise | work = Le Devoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived by boat in Quebec in 1940 with other Germans, most of them Jewish, and they were interned in refugee camps, under military control. After some transfers between Quebec, Trois-Rivières, New-Brunswick and Farnham, he was finally interned to Sherbrooke, Quebec.

Only 17 years old at this time of his internment, he considered this period of his life as an incredible adventure. Among the refugees, some intellectuals hastened to set up inside the camps educational systems of which he took advantage. Although Canada had no law for the refugees at this time, Emma Kaufman, member of the wealthy Kitchener, Ontario family, who met them in these camps,  pressured the government so that some could complete their studies outside of camps with financial aid (scholarships) that she had collected.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Baum was the professor of theology and sociology at University of Saint Michael's College in the [[University of Toronto]] and, after 1986, professor of theological ethics at [[McGill University]]'s Faculty of Religious Studies. In Montreal, he was associated with the [[Jesuit]] [Centre justice et foi] until his death in 2017.

During the church council [[Vatican II]] he was a [[peritus]], or theological advisor, at the Ecumenical Secretariat, the commission responsible for three conciliar documents, [[On Religious Liberty]], [[On Ecumenism]], and [[On the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions]].

In particular, he advocated the position, as a response to the Holocaust, of the [[rabbi]] and philosopher [[Emil Fackenheim]] regarding the cessation of efforts to convert the [[Jews]], famously stating:
{{quote|After Auschwitz the Christian churches no longer wish to convert the Jews. While they may not be sure of the theological grounds that dispense them from this mission, the churches have become aware that asking the Jews to become Christians is a spiritual way of blotting them out of existence and thus only reinforces the effects of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Gregory Baum, The Twentieth Century. A Theological Overview, (Orbis Books Maryknoll, New York - G. Chapman, London 1999), cited in {{cite web|title=Towards an Ethical Code of Conduct for Religious Conversions|first=Hans|last=Ucko|authorlink=Hans Ucko|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=5628#sdendnote6sym}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He composed the first draft of the conciliar document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions, that was later expanded to address all the world religions. It was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on October 28, 1965.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

From 1962 to 2004, he was the editor of ''The Ecumenist'', a review of theology, culture and society, which is now published by Novalis. He continued contributing to ''The Ecumenist'', serving as editor of one issue per year until his death. He was also a member and frequent editor of the international Catholic review ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]''. In 2012 he signed the [[Catholic Scholars' Declaration on Authority in the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchauthority.org/sponsors/sponsorsa-c.asp#baum|title=Gregory Baum|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retirement, Baum developed an interest in Islam, especially the work of [[Tariq Ramadan]], the European reformer, and in Fernand Dumont, the French Canadian sociologist, philosopher, theologian, and poet, both of whom he admired greatly.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Personal life==

Throughout his life Baum maintained warm and cordial friendships with people from diverse horizons.  Canadian author Michael Higgins, who first met Baum in 1968 writes "Politeness, ingenuousness, and collegiality are the personal as well as professional qualities that have defined his life and vocation no matter the setting—university, chancery, parish hall, retreat house, or activist cell."&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, The Theologian as Journalist:  A Tribute to Gregory Baum, Commonweal 138.21 (2011): 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, while studying mathematics at McMaster University, a friend gave him a copy of  Augustine's Confessions. Shortly after he became a Roman Catholic. In 1947 he entered the Augustinian Order and was ordained to the priesthood. In 1978, after leaving the Augustinians, he married his close friend Shirley Flynn and lived with her until her death in 2007.  A strong supporter of gays and lesbians in the Church, Baum had been aware since adolescence of his own attraction to men. After moving to Montreal in 1986, he fell in love with a former priest of whom he says, "his unwavering love, which has given stability to my life as a theologian, has been a gift from God." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Gregory|date=2017|title=The Oil Has Not Run . |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|pages=114–116; 208–211|isbn=978-0-7735-9996-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baum died in hospital in Montreal on October 18, 2017, surrounded by his friends. His funeral was held at his Montreal parish church, Saint Pierre-Apôtre.

'''Heinrich Theodor Böll''' ({{IPA-de|bœl|lang}}; 21 December 1917 – 16 July 1985) was one of Germany's foremost post-[[World War II]] writers. Böll was awarded the [[Georg Büchner Prize]] in 1967 and the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1972.{{Sfn|Conard|1992|p=xviii}}

== Biography ==

Böll was born in [[Cologne]], Germany, to a [[Catholic]], pacifist family that later opposed the rise of [[Nazism]]. He refused to join the [[Hitler Youth]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="KATERKater2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael H. KATER|author2=Michael H Kater|title=Hitler Youth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlIOP1O7H4wC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=26 August 2012|date=30 April 2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01991-1|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was apprenticed to a bookseller before studying German at the [[University of Cologne]]. In 1942 he married Annemarie Cech, with whom he would have three sons; she later collaborated with him on a number of different translations of English and American literature into German that he produced over the years. Conscripted into the [[Wehrmacht]], he served in [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and was wounded four times (as well as contracting [[typhoid]] fever) before being captured by Americans in April 1945 and sent to a [[prisoner-of-war camp]].{{Sfn|Conard|1992|pp=xvi–xvii}}

After the war he returned to Cologne and began working in his family's cabinet shop and, for one year, worked in a municipal statistical bureau, an experience which he did not enjoy and which he left in order to take the risk of becoming a writer instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Harry|title=Deutsche Erzählungen|date=1984|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520050541|page=423|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a_ll4XkchPMC&amp;pg=PA421&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+biography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j83LU7y4K6OM7Qbnp4DoCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20biography&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Böll became a full-time writer at the age of 30. His [[first novel]], ''Der Zug war pünktlich'' (''[[The Train Was on Time]]''), was published in 1949. He was invited to the 1949 meeting of the [[Group 47]] circle of German authors and his work was deemed to be the best presented in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill (ed)|first1=Frank N.|title=The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 7|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136593349|page=349|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nq1GU6I5umQC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+%22biography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT2wU-yDIceSONDEgMgL&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20%22biography&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other novels, short stories, [[radio play]]s and [[essay]] collections followed.

==Awards, honours and appointments==

Böll was extremely successful and was lauded on a number of occasions. In 1953 he was awarded the Culture Prize of German Industry, the Southern German Radio Prize and the German Critics' Prize. In 1954 he received the prize of the [[Tribune de Paris]]. In 1955 he was given the French prize for the best foreign novel. In 1958 he gained the [[Eduard von der Heydt]] prize of the city of Wuppertal and the prize of the [[Bavarian Academy of Arts]]. In 1959 he was given the Great Art Prize of the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia, the Literature Prize of the city of Cologne, and was elected to the Academy of Science and the Arts in Mainz.

In 1960 he became a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]] and gained the [[Charles Veillon]] Prize.

In 1967 he was given the [[Georg Büchner Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Robert C.|title=Understanding Heinrich Böll|date=1992|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=0872497798|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ywEubOALsZgC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+PEN&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WxHQU57iEcjB7AbZl4HABA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20PEN&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 he received the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] "for his writing which through its combination of a broad perspective on his time and a sensitive skill in characterization has contributed to a renewal of German literature".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1972/ Nobel prize website]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was given a number of honorary awards up to his death, such as the membership of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1974, and the [[Carl von Ossietzky|Ossietzky Medal]] of 1974 (the latter for his defence of and contribution to global human rights).

Böll was President of [[PEN International]], the worldwide association of writers and the oldest human rights organisation, between 1971–1973.{{Sfn|Conard|1992|p=15}}

==Works==

His work has been translated into more than 30 languages, and he remains one of Germany's most widely read authors. His best-known works are ''[[Billiards at Half-past Nine]]'' (1959), ''[[And Never Said a Word]]'' (1953), ''[[The Bread of Those Early Years (novel)|The Bread of Those Early Years]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Clown (novel)|The Clown]]'' (1963), ''[[Group Portrait with Lady (novel)|Group Portrait with Lady]]'' (1971), ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Safety Net]]'' (1979).

Despite the variety of themes and content in his work, there are certain recurring patterns: many of his novels and stories describe intimate and personal life struggling to sustain itself against the wider background of war, terrorism, political divisions, and profound economic and social transition. In a number of his books there are protagonists who are stubborn and eccentric individualists opposed to the mechanisms of the state or of public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Draugsvold (ed)|first1=Ottar G.|title=Nobel Writers on Writing|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786406291|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dTObt85SNvkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MFSwU8HzFoOEOLm7gWg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media scandals ==
The 1963 publication of ''[[The Clown (novel)|The Clown]]'' was met with polemics in the press for its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] party.&lt;ref name="Magill2013p350"&gt;Frank N. Magill (2013) The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nq1GU6I5umQC&amp;pg=PA350 p.350]&lt;/ref&gt; Böll was devoted to Catholicism but also deeply critical of aspects of it (particularly in its most conservative incarnations). In particular, he was unable to forget the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] of July 1933 between the Vatican and the Nazis, signed by the future [[Pope Pius XII]], which helped confer international legitimacy on the regime at an early stage in its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Und Sagte Kein Einziges Wort|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134986823|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z8XSJpyo2nkC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+1970s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iUywU--aCMbYPfT4gZAL&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%201970s&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Böll's liberal views on religion and social issues inspired the wrath of conservatives in Germany.&lt;ref name="Magill2013p350"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finlay1996p8"&gt;Frank Finlay (1996) ''On the Rationality of Poetry: Heinrich Böll's Aesthetic Thinking'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzsnzwmIFGoC&amp;pg=PA8 p.8]&lt;/ref&gt; His 1972 article ''[[Soviel Liebe auf einmal]]'' (''So much love at once'') which accused the tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' of falsified journalism, was in turn retitled,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} at the time of publishing and against Böll's wishes, by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', and the imposed title was used as a pretext to accuse Böll of sympathy with terrorism.&lt;ref name="WerkeV18p454"&gt;Heinrich Böll: [https://books.google.com/books?id=gHUHAQAAMAAJ ''Werke ''], Volume 18: 1971–1974. Köln : Kiepenheuer und Witsch, 2003, {{ISBN|3-462-03260-7}}, pp.454-ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular criticism was driven in large part by his repeated insistence upon the importance of due process and the correct and fair application of the law in the case of the [[Baader-Meinhof Gang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Bernard A.|title=Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0815340575|page=135|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ox_gXq2jpdYC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+1970s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mdDLU9b5BY2h7Aax_YGQBQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%201970s&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative press even attacked Böll's 1972 Nobel Prize, arguing that it was awarded only to "liberals and left-wing radicals."&lt;ref name="Magill2013p350"/&gt;

==Influences==

Böll was deeply rooted in his hometown of Cologne, with its strong [[Roman Catholic]]ism and its rather rough and drastic sense of humour. In the immediate post-war period, he was preoccupied with memories of the War and the effect it had—materially and psychologically—on the lives of ordinary people. He made them the heroes in his writing. His Catholicism was important to his work in ways that can be compared to writers such as [[Graham Greene]] and [[Georges Bernanos]] though, as noted earlier, his perspective was a critical and challenging one towards Catholicism rather than a merely passive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Robert C.|title=Understanding Heinrich Böll|date=1992|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=0872497798|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ywEubOALsZgC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Graham+Greene+and+Georges+Bernanos+Heinrich+Boll&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QUzRU-ODBsKk0QWYsIGICA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Graham%20Greene%20and%20Georges%20Bernanos%20Heinrich%20Boll&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was deeply affected by the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s' takeover of Cologne, as they essentially exiled him in his own town. Additionally, the destruction of Cologne as a result of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Allied bombing during World War II]] scarred him for life; he described the aftermath of the bombing in ''The Silent Angel''. Architecturally, the newly-rebuilt Cologne, prosperous once more, left him indifferent. (Böll seemed to be a pupil of [[William Morris]] – he let it be known that he would have preferred [[Cologne Cathedral]] to have been left unfinished, with the 14th-century wooden crane at the top, as it had stood in 1848). Throughout his life, he remained in close contact with the citizens of Cologne, rich and poor. When he was in hospital, the nurses often complained about the "low-life" people who came to see their friend Heinrich Böll.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

His villains are the figures of authority in government, business, the [[mainstream media]], and in the Church, whom he castigates, sometimes humorously, sometimes acidly, for what he perceived as their conformism, lack of courage, self-satisfied attitude and abuse of power. His simple style made his work a favourite for German-language textbooks in Germany and abroad.

==Analysis==

His works have been dubbed ''[[Trümmerliteratur]]'' (the literature of the rubble). He was a leader of the German writers who tried to come to grips with the memory of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], and the [[Holocaust]] and the guilt that came with them. Because of his refusal to avoid writing about the complexities and problems of the past he was labelled by some with the role of 'Gewissen der Nation' (conscience of the nation), in other words a catalyst and conduit for memorialisation and discussion in opposition to the tendency towards silence and taboo. This was a label that he himself was keen to jettison because he felt that it occluded a fair audit of those institutions which were truly responsible for what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sargeant|first1=Maggie|title=Kitsch &amp; Kunst: Presentations of a Lost War|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=3039105124|pages=171–2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LUM0XLuvDlQC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+%22biography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=70WwU7uoBszUPNuRgPAC&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20%22biography&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived with his wife in Cologne and in the [[Eifel|Eifel region]]. However, he also spent time on [[Achill Island]] off the west coast of Ireland. His cottage there is now used as a guesthouse for international and Irish artists. He recorded some of his experiences in Ireland in his book [[Irish journal|''Irisches Tagebuch'' (''Irish Journal'')]]; later on the people of Achill curated a festival in his honour. The Irish connection also influenced the translations into German by his wife Annemarie, which included works by [[Brendan Behan]], [[J. M. Synge]], [[G. B. Shaw]], [[Flann O'Brien]] and [[Tomás Ó Criomhthain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hboll.htm |title=Heinrich Böll |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084809/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hboll.htm |archivedate=6 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the president of the then West German [[P.E.N.]] and subsequently of the [[International P.E.N.]] organizations. He travelled frequently as a representative of the new, democratic Germany. His appearance and attitude were in complete contrast to the boastful, aggressive type of German which had become infamous all over the world during [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] rule. Böll was particularly successful in [[Eastern Europe]], as he seemed to portray the dark side of [[capitalism]] in his books; his books were sold by the millions in the [[Soviet Union]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bruhn and Henry Glade:[http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/projboll.htm ''Heinrich Böll in der Sowjetunion, 1952–1979] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408182906/http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/projboll.htm |date=2008-04-08 }} Einführung in die sowjetische Böll-Rezeption und Bibliographie der in der UdSSR in russischer Sprache erschienenen Schriften von und über Heinrich Böll'', Berlin 1980, {{ISBN|3-503-01617-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] was expelled from the Soviet Union, he first took refuge in Heinrich Böll's Eifel cottage. This was in part the result of Böll's visit to the Soviet Union in 1962 with a cultural delegation, the first of several trips he made to the country, during which he built friendships with several writers and connections with many producers of dissident literature. Böll had previously recommended Solzhenitsyn for the Nobel Prize for Literature, under the auspices of his position in the West German P.E.N. When Solzhenitsyn was awarded the prize in 1976, he quoted from Böll's works to the reception committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Frank|title=On the Rationality of Poetry: Heinrich Böll's Aesthetic Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9051839898|pages=179–184|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nzsnzwmIFGoC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=%22Heinrich+Boll%22+Solzhenitsyn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gpDBU6HgEfOw7Ab23oHgBg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Heinrich%20Boll%22%20Solzhenitsyn&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Böll publicly left the [[Catholic church]], "without falling away from the faith".&lt;ref&gt;"vom Glauben abgefallen"&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich Böll died in 1985 at the age of 67.

==Legacy and influence==

Böll's memory lives on, among other places, at the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]]. A special Heinrich Böll Archive was set up in the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|Cologne Library]] to house his personal papers, bought from his family, but much of the material was damaged, possibly irreparably, when the building collapsed in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=Kate|title=Acclaimed German writer's archive lost in building collapse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/06/heinrich-boll-archive-cologne|website=The Guardian|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His cottage in Ireland has been used as a residency for writers since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Residency |url=http://www.heinrichboellcottage.com/html/Residency.html |website=Heinrich Böll Cottage |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022135726/http://heinrichboellcottage.com/html/Residency.html |archivedate=22 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anglo-Hindu law''' reflected the difference in values between "[[law]]" in Western tradition and [[British Raj|colonial]] [[Hindu]] tradition. It was not until the 1770s, when the British Empire came to colonize [[History of India|India]], that the concept of law came into practice.

Colonial Hindu law marks a long span of nearly 200 years, beginning in [[Company rule in India|1772]] and ending in [[Partition of India|1947]]. This period may be split into two main phases. The first phase (beginning in 1772 and ending in 1864) is marked by three main events: translation of the ''[[Dharmaśāstra]]s'' by British scholar-administrators, the use of court [[pandit]]s to define laws and rules, and the rise of [[case law]]. The second phase (from 1864 to 1947) is marked by the dismissal of court pandits, the rise of legislative processes, and a codified law system.

== Pre-British India ==
{{further|Company rule in India}}
The British had been observing the country for nearly twenty years before their first implemented legal plan for renovating India’s method of governing.  As Europeans began gaining power and increasing the number of territories they controlled, they gradually became acquainted with the way the different territorial systems operated. Beginning with the coastal territories and moving inland, the British accumulated more Indian states. However, they could not oppose the customs and traditions that were already in place without offending the native peoples. Because they only held a minimal amount of power to implement change and enact laws, they had to respect the wishes the natives or reach a compromise.  The British had to administer law coinciding with the rule of each [[zamindar]] (hereditary leader); this meant that only [[Custom (law)|customary law]] could be implemented at that time.

There was tension between the two religious groups ([[Islam|Muslim]] and Hindu), since the sources of their rules differed greatly. The Muslims' governing body (and laws) derived from the [[Qur'an]] and books written by doctors who had studied [[Sharia]]. For the Hindu population, however, the guidelines on how to live life came from the ''[[Dharmaśāstra]]s'' ([[Sanskrit]] texts describing duties). Although laws in place were text-based, there was still a great deal of variation between different regions. Customary law was the main type of government in the territories and differed greatly in defining crime, punishment, guilt, how courts were organized and so on.

The British saw this system as unfair, due to the ambiguity of laws in different regions and lack of a [[English law|common law]]. They believed this system to be dysfunctional and an invitation for corruption, due to the ability of judges to decide a case as they saw fit with no [[precedent]]. For example, two cases could have virtually-identical facts but the outcome and punishment of the two might be very different. This was not a problem in the Indian tradition, but the British proposed a plan for unifying laws.

== First British law ==

India underwent a seismic shift in the way in which she was governed on August 21, 1772 when, in Bengal’s capital city [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], a new plan of governance was implemented by [[Warren Hastings]]. This marked the first step towards uniting Muslim and Hindu legal traditions. The “Plan for the Administration and Justice in Bengal” (more commonly known as the "Judicial Plan") laid the foundation for replacing ambiguous laws that were not formally written down into a British system, with different branches of government. Warren Hastings’ Judicial Plan included a provision which left certain religious matters to traditional law. This stipulated that inheritance, marriage, caste, and other religious use or institutions should be in accordance with the ''Dharmaśāstras'' and not subject to British law.

The '''International Federation of Messianic Jews''' (IFMJ), is an international religious [[organization]] that was created in 1978 by a [[rabbi]] called [[Haim Levi]]. That same [[year]], it was stablished one of the first messianic [[synagogues]] in the [[United States]], and also the Jewish Messianic Institute ''Etz Chayim'' (the [[tree of life]]) where it was possible to bring rabbis coming from other [[countries]] to be trained. This organization, like the other messianic [[Church (congregation)|congregations]], are not accepted as being [[jewish]] by the other mainstream branches of [[judaism]], neither by the [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox rabinate]] from [[Israel]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Jon Andreas Nödtveidt''' (28 June 1975 – 13 August 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Dissection.nu [http://www.dissection.nu/ DISSECTION Official Website]; retrieved 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Swedish musician. Best known as the lead guitarist and vocalist of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], he co-founded the band in 1989 with bassist Peter Palmdahl.

Nödtveidt also performed in several other projects, including The Black (as Rietas), De Infernali, [[Nifelheim]], [[Ophthalamia]] (as Shadow), Satanized, Siren's Yell, and Terror, a [[grindcore]] band which featured members of [[At the Gates]].

He also worked as a journalist in ''Metal Zone'', where he was responsible for keeping track of the growing black metal scene. He was a member of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, now known as [[Temple of the Black Light]], and the Werewolf Legion, a Swedish gang (not to be confused with the Russian Werewolf Legion). Contrary to popular belief, he was not its co-creator, but "was introduced [...] by close friends at a quite early stage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=interviews&amp;lang=eng&amp;nr=123 DISSECTION. Interview with Jon Nödtveidt, June 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075021/http://www.metalcentre.com/webzine.php?p=interviews&amp;lang=eng&amp;nr=123 |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nödtveidt was convicted of being an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the 1997 [[Keillers Park murder|murder of Josef ben Meddour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Harris  | first = Chris  | last2 = Wiederhorn  | first2 = Jon  | title = Metal File: Light This City, Gwar, Dissection &amp; More News That Rules  | work = ''MTV.com''  | publisher = [[MTV]]  | date = 25 August 2006  | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539335/metal-file-light-this-city-gwar-amp-more.jhtml  | accessdate =28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; an Algerian [[gay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Harris  | first = Chris  | last2 = Wiederhorn  | first2 = Jon  | title = Metal File: Light This City, Gwar, Dissection &amp; More News That Rules  | work = ''MTV.com''  | publisher = [[MTV]]  | date = 25 August 2006  | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539335/metal-file-light-this-city-gwar-amp-more.jhtml  | accessdate =28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; man. He restarted Dissection upon his release from prison in 2004.

==Death==
On 13 August 2006 Nödtveidt was found dead in his apartment in [[Hässelby]], by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside a circle of lit candles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalstorm.ee/events/news_comments.php?news_id=3051 "Dissection Frontman Jon Nödtveidt Commits Suicide"]. Metal Storm. Retrieved December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reports indicated that he was found with an open copy of the ''Satanic Bible'', but these were later dismissed by Dissection's guitarist [[Set Teitan]]. According to him, "it's not any atheist, humanist and ego-worshiping ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' by [[Anton LaVey]] that Jon had in front of him, but a Satanic [[grimoire]]. He despised LaVey and the 'Church of Satan'."&lt;ref&gt;Blabbermouth [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=56947 DISSECTION Guitarist: JON NÖDTVEIDT Didn't Have Copy Of 'The Satanic Bible' At Suicide Scene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002214/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=56947 |date=2011-09-27 }}; retrieved 9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The said "Satanic grimoire" is reputed to be the ''Liber Azerate'', one of the publishings of the Misanthropic Luciferian Order, by which Nödtveidt apparently was influenced, his last album ''[[Reinkaos]]''{{'}}s lyrics being co-written by the same man who wrote the ''Liber Azerate''.

Nödtveidt's brother, Emil "Nightmare Industries" Nödtveidt, the [[rhythm guitar]]ist and [[keyboardist]] of [[Gothic metal|gothic]] [[industrial metal]] band [[Deathstars]], wrote a song named "Via the End" the night he heard about Nödtveidt's suicide. The song appears as the fifth track on Deathstar's third album ''[[Night Electric Night]]''.

Regarding his views on suicide, Nödtveidt said:&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen, Metallion: The Slayer Mag Diaries, p. 569&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote2|The Satanist decides of his own life and death and prefers to go out with a smile on his lips when he has reached his peak in life, when he has accomplished everything, and aim to transcend this earthly existence. But it is completely un-satanic to end one's own life because one is sad or miserable. The Satanist dies strong, not by age, disease or depression, and he chooses death before dishonor! Death is the orgasm of life! So live life accordingly, as intense as possible!|Jon Nödtveidt}}

The '''Latvia's First Party''' ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Pirmā Partija}}) was a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]], [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} [[List of political parties in Latvia|political party in Latvia]].  It merged with [[Latvian Way]] to form [[Latvia's First Party/Latvian Way]] in 2007.

It was founded on 25 May 2002, led by [[Ēriks Jēkabsons]] and [[Ainārs Šlesers]]. The party included a number of priests from all the major branches of Christianity in Latvia ([[Lutheran]], [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Catholic]], [[Orthodoxy in Latvia|Orthodox]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]]) and, also, members  of ''Jaunā Paaudze (New Generation)'', a controversial [[evangelism|charismatic]] group. As a result, it was informally nicknamed "the party of priests" or "pastors' party".

Using [[populism|populist]] promises and support from religious organisations, it won 9.5% of the popular vote and 10 out of 100 seats at the [[legislative]] [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2002|elections of October 5, 2002]] and has joined all the [[coalition]] governments since that time. At the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 elections]] it ran together with [[Latvian Way]]; the bloc took 8.58%, but also won 10 seats in parliament.  The parties merged the following years.

==Political positions==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}

The party proclaimed itself to be a strong supporter of the traditional family. It sponsored a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, unambiguously excluding [[homosexual]] unions. Several prominent members of the party have been labelled as [[homophobia|homophobic]] by its critics. E.g. [[Jānis Šmits]] who was appointed to the position of chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee has called his parliamentary colleagues to get familiar with religious writings "in case they can actually, read", quoting a passage from [[Book of Moses|The Book of Moses]], that could be loosely translated as: "men having gay sex must die, and their corpses must be left soaking in their own blood". Additionally, Latvijas Pirmā Partija members have several times made public statements saying that they don't feel that there is a necessity for a [[gay pride]] march in [[Riga]], which allegedly contradicts the [[Freedom of speech|Freedom of Speech and Peaceful Assembly]] enshrined in the [[Constitution of Latvia]]. The pressure group [[Mozaīka]] (Mosaic) have mostly organized Gay Rights Rallies that some religious organizations see as overt frontal attacks on the Latvian way of life. Mozaīka have stated that they have done this to raise awareness for the rights of gays in Latvia via international media. Between annual rallies Mozaīka has done little to slowly generate improved understanding of gays in Latvia and has preferred to follow its strategy of shock tactics. ([[s:Constitution of Latvia#Chapter VIII: Fundamental Human Rights|articles 100 and 103]]).

Some have alleged that quoting the Bible as a reference point for legislation can be viewed as unconstitutional, since Latvia is a [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular state]], where religion is separate from the state ([[s:Constitution of Latvia#Chapter VIII: Fundamental Human Rights|article 99]] of the Constitution of Latvia). Supporters of the First Party deny that the "separation of church argument" can properly be used to keep people of faith silent when it comes to issues of morality or the passing or failing of laws that have strong moral dimensions. The ideas under the separation of church and state doctrine have to do with (a) the state not being allowed to control the church, or (b) the church not being allowed to control the state. All legislators have the right to vote their conscience.

Economically, First Party supports the existing [[status quo]] in Latvian economics. Compared to other parties, it is less concerned with [[budget deficit]]s and believes that the government should do everything possible to stimulate economic growth, even at the cost of possibly running deficits. In its first parliamentary election in 2002, First Party also run on an anti-corruption agenda. In the next election, it emphasized its competence and experience (in particular, the achievements of its leader, Šlesers, as the Minister of Transportation).

On ethnic relations, First Party is viewed as more Russian-friendly than most of the Latvian political parties. Most of the party's supporters are ethnically Latvian but it does not attempt to appeal to Latvian nationalism and has a number of ethnic minorities among its voters. Recently, it created a "Russian centre" for its ethnically Russian members.

The leadership of the party includes several prominent businessmen, most notably, its leader Ainars Šlesers. His critics have attacked the First Party, saying that it is little more than a business project to further Slesers' interests in real estate business. His supporters point to many examples of improvement in Latvia's transportation infrastructure, including the airport and the national railroad.

Largely because of the influence of the First Party a new cabinet-level ministry has been developed, The Ministry of Children and Family Affairs. The position of Minister of Children and Family Affairs has been held by Baptist pastor Ainars Bastiks since 2002. This ministry has emphasized reducing the number of children in Latvia's orphan care system. One strategy has been the development and implementation of a new national foster care recruiting and training program, which has grown considerably every year since 2004. Another emphasis of this ministry has to do with the elevation of the importance of the "father" in Latvian society. The national holiday, "Father's Day" has been proposed with the corresponding encouragements for fathers to take their paternal responsibilities seriously. Stiffer penalties for "deadbeat dads" who avoid paying child support have been enacted.

==Scandals==
The first chairman of party, Ēriks Jēkabsons, resigned as Minister of the Interior. Later, due to various disagreements about the direction that the party was taking, he left the party itself and became an independent MP.

Following the 2005 municipal election, a [[Jūrmala]] businessman Germans Milušs attempted to bribe the members of city council to ensure the election of Juris Hlevickis, a First Party member, as Jūrmala mayor. Hlevickis fell one vote short of becoming the mayor and, in 2007, both Milušs and Hlevickis were convicted and received prison sentences.

During the bribery attempt, Milušs's phone conversations were wiretapped by Latvian police. The wiretaps contain cryptic conversations between Milušs and Ainārs Šlesers, which were leaked to national TV in 2006. This resulted in the resignation of Šlesers as the Minister of Transportation on March 17, 2006. Šlesers was not however charged or convicted of bribery and returned to the position of the Minister of Transportation in November 2006.

This article is a list of Khalifas (successors) of Sufi religious leader Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi. The term '''Khalifa''' ({{lang-ar|خليفة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḫalīfah}}/{{transl|ar|ALA|khalīfah}}'') derives from the [[Arabic]] {{Audio|Ar-khalifa.ogg|خليفة '''Khalīfa'''}}. Its etymological root word is {{lang-ar|خلف}} (Khalf) means, behind, relates to someone surviving her or his predecessors. In [[Sufism]], ''Khalifa'' ({{lang-bn|খলিফা}}) means a deputy, caliph, successor or apostle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.almaany.com/home.php?language=arabic&amp;lang_name=%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A&amp;word=%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A9/ |title= خليفة – Arabic to Arabic Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.almaany.com/home.php?language=english&amp;word=%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A9&amp;lang_name=Arabic&amp;type_word=2&amp;dspl=0/ |title= خليفة – Arabic to English Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a Sufi [[sheikh]] who is to act as an authorized successor of his Sufi Master/ [[Pir (Sufism)]] to lead the Sufi Order ([[Tariqa]]).

As the founder of [[Maizbhanderi Sufi Order]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edainikazadi.net/eazadi.php?page=12&amp;subpage=1&amp;date=2014-01-21 |title=Benglali News Media: The Daily Azadi, Title: The ORS Festival of Gaus-e-Azam Maizbhanderi since today, Published on: January 21, 2014, Last page, 3rd column}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bn|মাইজভাণ্ডারী তরীকা}}, the universal Sufi Saint Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi {{lang-bn|আহমদ উল্লাহ মাইজভাণ্ডারী}} (1826–1906)&lt;ref&gt;Research work: Sondorshon, Author: Salim Jahangir PhD, Publisher: Bangla Academy, Published on: June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; had millions of followers in South Asia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/84/bgd33602.pdf.aspx/ |title=Article: Bangladesh – Maijbhandari sect – Sufism – Religious extremism, Page: 01, Published by: RRT Research Response- Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed hundreds of ''Khalifa''/ Spiritual Sufi Successors to continue his Sufi teachings and thought among society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=0415581702 |title=Research work: Sufism and Saint Veneration in Contemporary Bangladesh: The Maijbhandaris of Chittagong (Routledge Advances in South Asian Studies), Hans Harder, Head of Department of Modern South Asian Languages and Literatures, Heidelberg University}}&lt;/ref&gt; These successors came from different territories in addition to disciples from different religions. This list also can be said as '''Khalifa of Ghaus-e-Azam Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi''' in fact, he is vastly denoted as Ghaus-e-Azam {{lang-bn|গাউছুল আজম}}&lt;ref&gt;Bengali Lyric Collection: Ofaat Nama, Author: Aminul Haq Harbangiri, Published on: 1907, Now the only main copy obtained to Chittagong University Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farsi Book: Aaaina-e Bari, Author: Abdul Gani Kanchanpuri, It is inscribed in the book that it was finished writing on Jumada (II) 14, 1330 H (1909/10 AD), 2nd edition: 30 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book in both Arabic &amp; Farsi: Tohfatul Akhiaar Fi Daaf-e-Shararatil Ashrar, 1st Edition: 1313 Bengali/1907 AD, Author: Aminul Haq Forhadabadi, Bengali translation: Sayed Faizul Islam Farhadabadi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theoretical Bengali book on Maizbhanderi philosophy: Alakar Renesaar Juuger Akti Dik, Author: Syed Delwar Hosain Maizbhanderi, Published on: 1974 AD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion Book on Maizbhanderi Pphilosophy: Belayet-e-Motlaqa, Author: Syed Delwar Hosain Maizbhanderi, 3rd Edition: 1974 AD&lt;/ref&gt; by writers in Parisian, Urdu, Bengali and English works. Among Sufi communities he is known as Ghaus-e-Azam in the perception of spiritual hierarchy.

==Importance of sobriquet==
Some Khalifa remain unidentified because they went to different parts of the region; they wanted to remain anonymous because of self-will and to keep themselves engaged in introspective thought and practices. Some of them became famous by pseudonyms; their original names generally remain unknown, examplease are: Baba Bhanderi ({{lang-bn|বাবা ভাণ্ডারী}}), Harvangiri ({{lang-bn|হারভাঙ্গীরি}}), Mandakini ({{lang-bn|মান্দাকিনী}}), Forhadabadi ({{lang-bn|ফরহাদাবাদী}}) and Rahe Bhanderi ({{lang-bn|রাহে ভান্ডারী}}).&lt;ref&gt;Urdu biography: Dewan-e Azim, Author: Fouzul Azim Amiree, Published: 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Purbokon dec 24 medu"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://dainikpurbokone.net/index.php/-lfontglfont-colorq5a5757qg-lfontg/2013-08-24-18-15-27/14222-2014-01-03-18-54-46/ |title=Daily news media: Doinik Purbokon, Education Page, No.: 6, Column title:  Release the students from political turmoil.

==Resources==
A list of his Successors; firstly became published by one of his descendant Delwar Hossain Maizbhanderi in his famous work 'Gausul Azam Maizbhandarir Jiboni O Karamat' {{lang-bn|গাউছুল আজম মাইজভাণ্ডারীর জীবনী ও কারামত}} (Life sketch of Hazrat Kebla Kaba).&lt;ref&gt;A historical discussion book: Life sketch of Hazrat Kebla Kaba, Author: Syed Delwar Hossain Maizbhanderi, 1st Edition, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In that book the author expressed his sorrow for such an incomplete list. Meanwhile, many among those of his ''Khalifa'' latterly became famous in the society&lt;ref&gt;A collection of Biography: Tajkeratul Maizbhanderia, Publisher: Maizbhanderi Academy, Published: 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Monthly publication: Alok Dhara, Reg.

As a continuous process, that list became published twice more in recent days. Once at the preface of [[Rahe Bhander Sufi Order]] 'Noxar Shondhane' {{lang-bn|নকশার সন্ধানে}}&lt;ref&gt;Regular magazine the preface of Rahe Bhander Sufi Order: Noxar Shondhane, List published on: 5th Issue&lt;/ref&gt; as a descending followers apart&lt;ref name="dainikpurbokone.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dainikpurbokone.net/index.php?option=com_phocagallery&amp;view=category&amp;id=1 |title= news media: Doinik Purbokon (Hard Copy), Page: 2, Column: 8, Title: Rahe Bhander Sufi Order’s founder’s ORS Festival is today, Published: December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chittagongdaily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chittagongdaily.com/%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B8/ |title=News media: Chittagong Daily, Column: Saint’s role in promoting initiation of humanity and appreciation of human rights organization, Published: December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Maizbhanderi Sufi Order and latterly at a publication on the 100th Disappearance Anniversary&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative publication: the century of Gausul Azam Maizbhanderi’s disappearance ceremony; 1906-2006 AD, Published: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  of Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi. Here, a spiritual successors' (''Khalifa'') list of Ahmed Ullah Maizbhanderi is being written following all those and other published lists.

==Limitation==
This list is unable to show neither their seniority nor superiority nor even dignity but names and the place where they born or placed to rest in peace based on available information. It is to note that, none of them are alive now but most of them still have thousands of followers and affectionate. All of them are well known as 'Maizbhaderi' {{lang-bn|মাইজভাণ্ডারী}} in a common identification purpose. A research report prepared by the Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) and Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT)of Australia reported; today there have over 10 millions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/country/australian_refugee_review_tribunal/bangladesh/Maijbhandari%20sect.pdf |title=Article: Bangladesh – Maijbhandari sect – Sufism – Religious extremism, Page:1-2, Published by: RRT Research Response- Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Maizbhanderi Sufi followers across the globe.

'''Luxor Temple''' is a large [[Ancient Egyptian temple]] complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the [[Egyptian language]] it is known as ''ipet resyt'', "the southern sanctuary". In Luxor there are several great temples on the east and west banks.  Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers and tourists include the [[Mortuary Temple of Seti I|Temple of Seti I]] at [[Kurna|Gurnah]], the [[Temple of Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el Bahri]], the Temple of [[Ramesses II]] (a.k.a. [[Ramesseum]]), and the Temple of [[Ramesses III]] at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]]; and the two primary cults temples on the east bank are known as the [[Karnak]] and Luxor.&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;Science, "Excavation of the Temple of Luxor," Science, 6, no. 6 (1885): 370.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the king in death.  Instead Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the kings of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of [[Alexander the Great]] who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo.)

To the rear of the temple are chapels built by [[Amenhotep III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], and Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by [[Tutankhamun]] and Ramesses II. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]], the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of the Roman government in the area.

==Construction==
[[File:LuxorTemple,OriginalObelisks.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original two obelisks, as seen in 1832. The one on the right is now in Paris, known as the [[Luxor Obelisk]].]]
Luxor temple was built with sandstone from the [[Gebel el-Silsila]] area, which is  located in South-Western Egypt.&lt;ref name="Bernd"&gt;Bernd Fitzner, Kurt Heinrichs, and Dennis La Bouchardiere, "Weathering damage on Pharaonic sandstone monuments in Luxor-Egypt," Building and Environment, 38 (2003): 1089.&lt;/ref&gt; This sandstone from the  Gebel el-Silsila region is referred to as Nubian Sandstone.&lt;ref name="Bernd"/&gt; This sandstone was used for the construction for monuments in Upper Egypt as well as in the course of past and current restoration works.&lt;ref name="Bernd"/&gt;

Like other Egyptian structures a common technique used was symbolism, or illusionism.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander Badawy, "Illusionism in Egyptian Architecture," Studies in the Ancient Oriental Civilization, 35 (1969): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, to the Egyptian, a sanctuary shaped like an Anubis Jackal was really Anubis.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; At the Luxor temple, the two obelisks (the smaller one closer to the west is now at the [[Place de la Concorde]] in Paris) flanking the entrance were not the same height, but they created the illusion that they were.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; With the layout of the temple they appear to be of equal height, but using illusionism, it enhances the relative distances hence making them look the same size to the wall behind it. Symbolically, it is a visual and spatial effect to emphasize the heights and distance from the wall, enhancing the already existing pathway.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

==Excavation==
From medieval times the Muslim population of [[Luxor]] had settled in and around the temple, at the southward end of the mount.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; Due to the Luxor’s past city population building on top of and around the Luxor temple, centuries of rubble had accumulated, to the point where there was an artificial hill some 14.5 to 15 metres (48- 50 ft) in height.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; The Luxor Temple had begun to be excavated by Professor [[Gaston Maspero]] after 1884 after he had been given the order to commence operations.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; The excavations were carried out sporadically until 1960. Over time, accumulated rubbish of the ages had buried three quarters of the temple which contained the courts and colonnades which formed the nucleus of the Arab half of the Modern village. Maspero had taken an interest earlier, and he had taken over the post of Mariette Pasha to complete the job in 1881. Not only was there rubbish, but there were also barracks, stores, houses, huts, pigeon towers, which needed to be removed in order to excavate the site. (There still exists a working mosque within the temple which was never removed.) Maspero received from the Egyptian minister of public works the authorization needed to obtain funds in order to negotiate compensation for the pieces of land covered by the houses and dependencies.

==Festivals==
It has been determined that the Luxor temple holds great significance to the [[Opet Festival]]. The Luxor Temple was dedicated to the [[Theban Triad]] of the cult of the Royal Ka, [[Amun]], [[Mut]], and [[Khonsu]] and was built during the [[New Kingdom]], the focus of the annual [[Opet Festival]], in which a cult statue of Amun was paraded down the Nile from nearby [[Karnak Temple]] (''ipet-isut'') to stay there for a while, with his consort Mut, in a celebration of fertility – hence its name. However, other studies at the temple by the Epigraphic Survey team present a completely new interpretation of Luxor and its great annual festival (the Feast of Opet).&lt;ref name="Lanny"&gt;Lanny Bell, "Luxor Temple and the Cult of the Royal Ka," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 44, no. 4 (1985): 251.&lt;/ref&gt; They have concluded that Luxor is the temple dedicated to the divine Egyptian ruler or, more precisely, to the cult of the Royal Ka.&lt;ref name="Lanny"/&gt; Examples of the cult, of the Royal Ka can be seen with the colossal seated figures of the deified Ramesses II before the Pylon and at the entrance to the Colonnade are clearly Ka-statues, cult statues of the king as embodiment of the royal Ka.

==Shrine stations==
Six [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]] shrines, serving as way stations for the barques of the gods during festival processions, were set up on the avenue between the [[Karnak Temple|Karnak]] and Luxor Temple.&lt;ref name="Charles"&gt;Charles Nims, "Places about Thebes," Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 14, no. 2 (1955): 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The avenue which went in a straight line between the Luxor Temple and the Karnak area was recently{{when|date=January 2012}} lined with human-headed sphinxes of Nekhtanebo I,21, in ancient times it is probable that these replaced earlier sphinxes which may have had different heads.&lt;ref name="Charles"/&gt; Along the avenue the stations were set up for ceremonies such as the Feast of Opet which held significance to temple.&lt;ref name="Charles"/&gt; Each station had a purpose, for example the fourth station was the station of Kamare, which cooled the oar of Amun.&lt;ref name="Charles"/&gt; The Fifth station of Kamare was the station which received the beauty of Amun.&lt;ref name="Charles"/&gt; Lastly the Sixth Station of Kamare was a shrine for Amun, Holy of Steps.&lt;ref name="Charles"/&gt;

==Defacement==
{{main article|Ding Jinhao engraving scandal}}
In 2013, a Chinese student posted a picture of engraved graffiti that read "Ding Jinhao was here" ({{zh|s=丁锦昊到此一游}}) in [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] on a sculpture. This discovery spurred debate about increased tourism after the media confirmed a Chinese student caused this and other defacements. The engraving has since been partially cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/travel/china-egypt/|title=Netizen outrage after Chinese tourist defaces Egyptian temple|author=Hiufu Wong, CNN|date=27 May 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milo Crispin''' (d. 1149?) was [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] of the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Bec]]. He wrote the lives of five of its abbots: [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Gulielmus de Bellomonte]], [[Boso Beccensis Abbas|Boso]], [[Theobaldus]] and [[Letardus]].

==Biography and works==
His life of Lanfranc is printed in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' of the [[Bollandists]] (May 28). The other four (those of Theobaldus and Letardus being mere summaries) are included in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' (Vol. CL).

Milo must have been an old man when he wrote them, for in the last chapter of his life of Lanfranc he relates something which he himself heard [[St. Anselm]] say. As St. Anselm died in 1109, and Letardus did not die till 1149, Milo Crispin shows here incidentally that his own religious life had lasted more than forty years.

He came of the noble race of Crispin descended from the [[Neustria]]n, [[Gislebert]], who first received the name Crispin because of his erect curly hair. All Gislebert's sons distinguished themselves, and the family proved generous benefactors to the Abbey of Bec. Two of his descendants subsequently became monks there--[[Gilbert Crispin|Gilbert]], afterwards [[Abbot of Westminster]], who wrote the life of [[St. Herluin]], founder and first Abbot of Bec, and his brother Milo. No details of the latter's career have been preserved, nor is it known when he died.

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}

'''Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent''' mainly took place from the 12th to the 16th centuries, though [[Muslim conquests|earlier Muslim conquests]] made limited inroads into modern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] as early as the time of the [[List of Rajput dynasties|Rajput kingdoms]] in the 8th century. With the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], Islam spread across large parts of the subcontinent. In 1204, [[Bakhtiyar Khalji]] led the Muslim conquest of [[Bengal]], marking the eastern-most expansion of Islam at the time.

Prior to the rise of the [[Maratha Empire]], which was followed by the [[British conquest of India|conquest of India]] by the [[British East India Company]], the Muslim [[Mughal Empire]] was able to annex or subjugate most of India's kings. However, it was never able to conquer the kingdoms in the upper reaches of the Himalayas, such as those of modern [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Sikkim]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]; the kingdoms of the extreme south of India, such as [[Travancore]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]; or the kingdoms in the east, such as the [[Ahom Kingdom]] in [[Assam]].

==Early Muslim presence==
[[Islam in South Asia]] existed in communities along the Arab coastal trade routes in [[Sindh]], [[Bengal]], [[Gujarat]], [[Kerala]], and [[Ceylon]] as soon as the religion originated and had early gained acceptance in the Arabian Peninsula, though the first incursion by the new Muslim successor states of the [[Arab World]] occurred around 636 [[Common Era|CE]] or 643 AD, during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], long before any Arab army reached the frontier of India by land.

===Arab naval expeditions===
Uthman b. Abul As Al Sakifi, governor of Bahrain and [[Oman]], sent out ships to raid Thane, near modern-day [[Mumbai]], while his brother Hakam sailed to [[Bharuch|Broach]] and a third fleet sailed to [[Debal]] under his younger brother Mughira either in 636 [[Common Era|CE]] or 643 AD. According to one source all three expeditions were successful,&lt;ref name="Baladhuri p209"&gt;{{harvnb|al-Balādhurī|1924|p=209}}: "'Uthmân ibn-abu-l-'Âși ath-Thaķafi ... sent his brother, al-Hakam, to al-Bahrain, and went himself to 'Umân, and sent an army across to Tânah. When the army returned, he wrote to 'Umar, informing him of this expedition. 'Umar wrote to him in reply, ' ... By Allah, I swear that if they had been smitten, I would exact from thy tribe the equivalent.' Al-Hakam sent an expedition against Barwaș [Broach] also, and sent his brother, al-Mughîrah ibn-abu-l-'Âsi, to the gulf of ad-Daibul, where he met the enemy in battle and won a victory."&lt;/ref&gt;  however, another source states Mughira was defeated and killed at Debal.&lt;ref name="Fredunbeg, Mirza Kalichbeg pp57"&gt;Fredunbeg, Mirza Kalichbeg, "The Chachnama: An Ancient History of Sind", pp57&lt;/ref&gt;  These expeditions were sent without the Caliph [[Umar]]'s consent, and he rebuked Uthman, saying that had the Arabs lost any men the Caliph would have killed an equal number of men from Utham's tribe in retaliation.&lt;ref name="Baladhuri p209" /&gt;  The expeditions were sent to attack pirate nests, to safeguard Arabian trade in the [[Arabian Sea]], and not to start the conquest of India.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sailendra Nath,  "Ancient Indian History and Civilization 2nd Edition", pp346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khushalani, Gobind, "Chachnama Retold An Account of the Arab Conquests of Sindh", pp221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editors: El Harier, Idris,  &amp; M'Baye, Ravene,  "Spread of Islam Throughout the World ", pp594&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rashidun Caliphate and the Indian frontier==
[[File:Arabsumf1.png|thumb|325px|right|Arab campaigns in the Indian Subcontinent. A generic representation, not to exact scale.]]
The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisa]]-[[Gandhara]] in modern-day Afghanistan, [[Zabulistan]] and [[Sindh]] (which then held Makran) in modern-day Pakistan, all of which were culturally and politically part of India since ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, Jaswant Lal, "Advanced Study in The History of Medieval India Vol 1", pp31&lt;/ref&gt; were known as "The Frontier of Al Hind". The first clash between a ruler of an Indian kingdom and the Arabs took place in 643 AD, when Arab forces defeated Rutbil, King of Zabulistan in Sistan.&lt;ref&gt;Wink, Andre, " Al-Hind The Making of the Indo-Islamic Worlds Vol 1", pp119&lt;/ref&gt;  Arabs led by Suhail b. Abdi and Hakam al Taghilbi defeated an Indian army in the [[Battle of Rasil]] in 644 AD at the [[Indian Ocean]] sea coast,&lt;ref name="Wink, Andre pp201"&gt;Wink, Andre, " Al-Hind The Making of the Indo-Islamic Worlds Vol 1", pp201&lt;/ref&gt;  then reached the Indus River. Caliph [[Umar|Umar ibn Al-Khattab]] denied them permission to cross the river or operate on Indian soil and the Arabs returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Peter, "The War of the Three Gods: Romans, Persians and the Rise of Islam", pp192&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah ibn Aamir]] led the invasion of Khurasan in 650 AD, and his general Rabi b. Ziyad Al Harithi attacked [[Sistan]] and took [[Zaranj]] and surrounding areas in 651 AD&lt;ref&gt;Shaban M. A., "The Abbasid Revolution ", pp22 - pp23&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ahnaf ibn Qais]] conquered the [[Hepthalites]] of [[Herat]] in 652 AD and advanced up to [[Balkh]] by 653 AD. Arab conquests now bordered the Kingdoms of Kapisa, Zabul and Sindh in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Arabs levied annual tributes on the newly captured areas, and leaving 4,000 men garrisons at [[Merv]] and [[Zaranj]] retired to [[Iraq]] instead of pushing on against the frontier of India.&lt;ref&gt;Editor = Daryaee, Touraj, "The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History", pp215 - pp216&lt;/ref&gt; Caliph Uthman b. Affan sanctioned an attack against Makran in 652 AD, and sent a recon mission to Sindh in 653 AD. The mission described Makran as inhospitable, and Caliph Uthman, probably assuming the country beyond was much worse, forbade any further incursions into India.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Henry, "Historians of India: Appendix The Arabs in Sind, Vol III, Part 1", pp9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khushalani, Gobind, "Chachnama Retold An Account of the Arab Conquests of Sindh", pp72&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the beginning of a prolonged struggle between the rulers of [[Kabul]] and Zabul against successive Arab governors of Sistan, Khurasan and Makran in modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The [[Kabul Shahi]] kings and their [[Zunbil]] kinsmen blocked access to the [[Khyber Pass]] and [[Gomal Pass]] routes into India from 653 to 870 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Balādhurī|1924|pp=141–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; while modern [[Balochistan, Pakistan]], comprising the areas of Kikan or Qiqanan, Nukan, Turan, Buqan, Qufs, Mashkey and Makran, would face several Arab expeditions between 661 - 711 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Fredunbeg, Mirza Kalichbeg, "The Chachnama: An Ancient History of Sind", pp71 - pp79&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs launched several raids against these frontier lands, but repeated rebellions in Sistan and Khurasan between 653 - 691 AD diverted much of their military resources in order to subdue these provinces and away from expansion into Al Hind. Muslim control of these areas ebbed and flowed repeatedly as a result until 870 AD. Arabs troops disliked being stationed in Makran,&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland, Robert G., "In Gods Path: The Arab Conquests and Creation of An Islamic Empire", pp191&lt;/ref&gt;  and were reluctant to campaign in the Kabul area and Zabulistan, the difficult terrain and underestimation of Zunbil's power,&lt;ref&gt;Wink, Andre, " Al-Hind The Making of the Indo-Islamic Worlds Vol 2", pp113&lt;/ref&gt; Arab strategy to extract tribute instead of systematic conquest, and the fierce resistance of Zunbil and Turki Shah stalled Arab progress repeatedly in the "Frontier Zone".&lt;ref name="Wink, Andre pp129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hugh, "The Great Arab Conquests", pp194 - pp196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umayyad expansion in Al Hind==
Muawiyah established [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] rule over the Arabs after the first [[First Fitna]] in 661 AD, and resumed expansion of the Muslim Empire. After 663/665 AD, the Arabs launched an invasion against Kapisa, Zabul and what is now Pakistani [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]]. Abdur Rahman b. Samurra besieged [[Kabul]] in 663 AD, while Haris b Marrah advanced against Kalat after marching through Fannazabur and Quandabil and moving through the [[Bolan Pass]]. King Chach of Sindh sent an army against the Arabs, the enemy blocked the mountain passes, Haris was killed and his army was annihilated. [[Al Muhallab ibn Abi Suffrah]] took a detachment through the Khyber pass towards [[Multan]] in Southern [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] in modern-day Pakistan in 664 AD, then pushed south into Kikan, and may have also raided Quandabil. Turki Shah and Zunbil expelled Arabs from their respective kingdoms by 670 AD, and Zunbil began assisting in organizing resistance in Makran.&lt;ref name="Wink, Andre pp201" /&gt;

===Battles in Makran and Zabulistan===
Arabs launched several campaigns in eastern Balochistan between 661 - 681 AD, four Arab commanders were killed during the campaigns, but Sinan b. Salma managed to conquer parts of Makran including the Chagai area,&lt;ref&gt;Dashti, Naseer, "The Baloch and Balochistan", pp65&lt;/ref&gt; and establish a permanent base of operations in 673 AD.&lt;ref name="Baladhuri p212"&gt;{{harvnb|al-Balādhurī|1924|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid b.

==Al Hajjaj and the East==
[[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf Al Thaqifi]], who had played a crucial role during the [[Second Fitna]] for the Umayyad cause, was appointed the governor of Iraq in 694 AD, further extended to [[Khurasan]] and [[Sistan]] in 697 AD. Al-Hajjaj also sponsored Muslim expansion in [[Makran]], Sistan, [[Transoxiana]] and Sindh.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyland, Robert G., "In Gods Path: The Arab Conquests and Creation of An Islamic Empire", pp150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip, "History of The Arabs 10th Edition", pp209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns in Makran and Zabul===
Arab hold on Makran had weakened when Arab rebels seized the province, and Hajjaj had to send three governors between 694 - 707 AD before Makran was partially recovered by 694 AD.&lt;ref name="Wink, Andre pp129"&gt;Wink (2002), pg.129 - pp131&lt;/ref&gt;  Al Hajjaj also fought Zunbil in 698 AD and 700 AD.

Arab rule was restricted to the west of Thar desert.

==Last days of Caliphate control==
When the [[Abbasid Revolution]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750 AD after the [[Third Fitna]], Sindh became independent and was captured by Musa b. K'ab al Tamimi in 752 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Henry, "Historians of India: Appendix The Arabs in Sind, Vol III, Part 1", pp51&lt;/ref&gt;  Zunbil had defeated the Arabs in 728 AD, and saw off two Abbasid invasions in 769 and 785 AD. Abbasids attacked Kabul several times and collected tribute between 787 Ad - 815 Ad and extracted tribute after each campaign. Abbasid Governor of Sindh, Hisham (7in office 768 - 773 AD) raided Kashmir, recaptured parts of Punjab from [[Karkota dynasty|Karkota]] control,&lt;ref&gt;Editors = Idris El Harer, El Hadje Ravane M'Baye,  "The Spread of Islam Throughout The World", pp613&lt;/ref&gt; and launched naval raids against ports of Gujarat in 758 and 770 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Wink (2002), pg.210&lt;/ref&gt;  which like other Abbasid Naval raids launched of 776 and 779 AD, gained no territory. Arabs occupied Sindian (Southern Kutch) in 810 AD, only to lose it in 841 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Editors = Idris El Harer, El Hadje Ravane M'Baye,  "The Spread of Islam Throughout The World", pp614&lt;/ref&gt;
Civil war erupted in Sindh in 842 AD, and the Habbari dynasty occupied Mansurah, and by 871, five independent principalities emerged, with the Banu Habbari clan controlling in Mansurah, Banu Munabbih occupying Multan, Banu Madan ruling in Makran, with Makshey and Turan falling to other rulers, all outside direct Caliphate control.&lt;ref&gt;Editors: Bosworth, C.E.  &amp;Asimov, M.S,  "History of Civilizations of Central Asia " Vol IV, pp298 - pp301&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ismaili]] missionaries found a receptive audience among both the [[Sunni]] and non-Muslim populations in Multan, which became a center of the Ismaili sect of Islam. The [[Saffarid|Saffarid Dynasty]] of Zaranj occupied Kabul and the kingdom of Zunbil permanently in 871 AD. A new chapter of Muslim conquests began when the [[Samanids|Samanid Dynasty]] took over the Saffarid Kingdom and [[Sabuktigin]] seized [[Ghazni]].

==Later Muslim invasions==
{{See also|Rajput resistance to Muslim conquests|List of Rajput dynasties|l1=Rajput kingdoms of North India}}

Muslim incursions resumed under later Turkic and Central Asian Mongol dynasties with more local capitals, who supplanted the Caliphate and expanded their domains both northwards and eastwards and led to the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].

===Ghaznavid Period===
{{main article|Mahmud of Ghazni}}
[[File:Tomb of Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in 1839-40.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Sultan]] Mahmud of Ghazni in 1848.]]

Under [[Sabuktigin]], [[Ghazni]] found itself in conflict with the [[Shahi]] Raja [[Jayapala]]. When Sabuktigin died and his son Mahmud ascended the throne in 998, Ghazni was engaged in the North with the [[Qarakhanid]]s when the Shahi Raja renewed hostilities.

In the early 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] launched seventeen expeditions into South Asia. In 1001, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni defeated Raja [[Jayapala]] of the [[Hindu Shahi]] Dynasty of [[Gandhara]] (in modern Afghanistan), the [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Battle of Peshawar]] and marched further into [[Peshawar]] (in modern Pakistan) and, in 1005, made it the center for his forces.

The Ghaznavid conquests were initially directed against the [[Ismaili]] [[Fatimid]]s of [[Multan]], who were engaged in an ongoing struggle with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in conjunction with their compatriots of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in North Africa and the Middle East; Mahmud apparently hoped to curry the favor of the Abbasids in this fashion. However, once this aim was accomplished, he moved onto the richness of the loot of wealthy temples and monasteries. By 1027, Mahmud had captured parts of North India and obtained formal recognition of Ghazni's sovereignty from the Abbassid Caliph, [[al-Qadir]] Billah.

Ghaznavid rule in Northwestern India (modern Afghanistan and Pakistan) lasted over 175 years, from 1010 to 1187. It was during this period that [[Lahore]] assumed considerable importance apart from being the second capital, and later the only capital, of the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]].

At the end of his reign, Mahmud's empire extended from [[Kurdistan]] in the west to [[Samarkand]] in the Northeast, and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Although his raids carried his forces across Northern and Western India, only Punjab came under his permanent rule; [[Kashmir]], the [[Doab]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Gujarat]] remained under the control of the local Indian dynasties. In 1030, Mahmud fell gravely ill and died at age 59. As with the invaders of three centuries ago, Mahmud's armies looted temples in [[Varanasi]], [[Mathura]], [[Ujjain]], [[Maheshwar]], Jwalamukhi, [[Somnath]] and [[Dwarka]].

===Mu'izz al-Din===
{{main article|Mu'izz al-Din}}
[[File:Ghurids1200.png|thumb|240px|Map of the [[Ghurid dynasty]] at its greatest extent under [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad]].]]
[[Mu'izz al-Din]] better known as Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori was a conqueror from the region of [[Ghor]] in [[Afghanistan]]. Before 1160, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] covered an area running from central Afghanistan east to the Punjab, with capitals at Ghazni on the banks of Ghazni river in present-day Afghanistan, and at [[Lahore]] in present-day [[Pakistan]]. In 1160, the Ghorids conquered Ghazni from the Ghaznavids, and in 1173 Muhammad Bin Sām was made governor of Ghazni. He raided eastwards into the remaining Ghaznavid territory, and invaded [[Gujarat]] in the 1180s but was defeated by the Indian queen Naikidevi of Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;Indian History V.K. Agnihotri: p.23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A historical and cultural study of the inscriptions of Gujarat: p.109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1186 and 1187 he conquered Lahore in alliance with a local Hindu ruler, ending the Ghaznavid empire and bringing the last of Ghaznavid territory under his control, and seemed to be the first Muslim ruler seriously interested in expanding his domain in the sub-continent, and like his predecessor Mahmud initially started off against the [[Ismaili]] kingdom of [[Multan]] that had regained independence during the [[Nizari]] conflicts, and then onto booty and power.

In 1191, he invaded the territory of [[Prithviraj III]] of [[Ajmer]], who ruled much of present-day [[Rajasthan]] and [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], but was defeated at the [[Battles of Tarain|First battle of Tarain]].&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra, ''Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206-1526)'', (Har-Anand Publications, 2006), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Mu'izz al-Din assembled 120,000 horsemen and once again invaded India. Mu'izz al-Din's army met Prithviraj's army again at Tarain, and this time Mu'izz al-Din won; Govindraj was slain, Prithviraj executed&lt;ref&gt;''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', Vol. I, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 263.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mu'izz al-Din advanced onto Delhi. Within a year, Mu'izz al-Din controlled Northern Rajasthan and Northern Ganges-Yamuna Doab. After these victories in India, and Mu'izz al-Din's establishment of a capital in Delhi, Multan was also incorporated into his empire. [[Mu'izz al-Din]] then returned east to Ghazni to deal with the threat on his eastern frontiers from the Turks and Mongols, whiles his armies continued to advance through Northern India, raiding as far east as [[Bengal]].

Mu'izz al-Din returned to Lahore after 1200. In 1206, Mu'izz al-Din had to travel to Lahore to crush a revolt. On his way back to Ghazni, his caravan rested at Damik near [[Sohawa]] (which is near the city of [[Jhelum]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of modern-day Pakistan). He was assassinated on 15 March 1206, while offering his evening prayers. The identity of Ghori's assassins is disputed, with some claiming that he was assassinated by local Hindu [[Gakhars]] and others claiming he was assassinated by Hindu [[Khokhars]], both being different tribes.

===The Delhi Sultanate===
{{main article|Delhi Sultanate}}
[[File:Tughlaq dynasty 1321 - 1398 ad.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Delhi Sultanate reached its zenith under the [[Turkic peoples|Turko]]-[[Indian people|Indian]] [[Tughlaq dynasty]].&lt;ref name="malik"&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam in South Asia: A Short History|author=[[Jamal Malik]]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2008|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FduG_t2sxwMC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Muhammad's successors established the first dynasty of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], while the [[Mamluk]] Dynasty in 1211 (however, the Delhi Sultanate is traditionally held to have been founded in 1206) seized the reins of the empire. ''Mamluk'' means "slave" and referred to the Turkic slave soldiers who became rulers. The territory under control of the Muslim rulers in Delhi expanded rapidly. By mid-century, Bengal and much of central India was under the Delhi Sultanate. Several Turko-Afghan dynasties ruled from Delhi: the Mamluk (1206–1290), the [[Khalji]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq]] (1320–1414), the [[Sayyid]] (1414–51), and the [[Lodhi]] (1451–1526). During the time of Delhi Sultanate, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] resisted successfully attempts of Delhi Sultanate to establish dominion in the Southern India, serving as a barrier against invasion by the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/Vijayanagar Vijayanagar | historical city and empire, India | Britannica.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain kingdoms remained independent of Delhi such as the larger kingdoms of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], parts of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], Gujarat, [[Malwa]] (central India), and [[Bengal]], nevertheless all of the area in present-day Pakistan came under the rule of Delhi.

[[File:The end of Buddhist Monks, A.D. 1193.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The image, in the chapter on India in ''Hutchison's Story of the Nations'' edited by [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|James Meston]], depicts the Bakhtiyar Khilji's massacre of Buddhist monks in [[Bihar, India]].

The Sultans of Delhi enjoyed cordial, if superficial, relations with Muslim rulers in the Near East but owed them no allegiance. They based their laws on the ''[[Quran]]'' and the ''[[sharia]]'' and permitted non-Muslim subjects to practice their religion only if they paid the ''[[jizya]]'' (poll tax). They ruled from urban centres, while military camps and trading posts provided the nuclei for towns that sprang up in the countryside.

Perhaps the most significant contribution of the Sultanate was its temporary success in insulating the subcontinent from the potential devastation of the Mongol invasion from Central Asia in the 13th century, which nonetheless led to the capture of Afghanistan and western Pakistan by the Mongols (see the [[Ilkhanate]] Dynasty). Under the Sultanate, "Indo-Muslim" fusion left lasting monuments in architecture, music, literature, and religion. In addition it is surmised that the language of [[Urdu]] (literally meaning "horde" or "camp" in various Turkic dialects) was born during the Delhi Sultanate period as a result of the mingling of Sanskritic Hindi and the Persian, Turkish, Arabic favoured by the Muslim invaders of India{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

The Sultanate suffered significantly from the sacking of Delhi in 1398 by [[Timur]], but revived briefly under the Lodi Dynasty, the final dynasty of the Sultanate before it was conquered by [[Babur|Zahiruddin Babur]] in 1526, who subsequently founded the [[Mughal Dynasty]] that ruled from the 16th to the 18th centuries.

===Timur===

Informed about civil war in [[South Asia]], Timur began a trek starting in 1398 to invade the reigning [[Sultan]] Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the [[Tughlaq]] Dynasty in the north Indian city of [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name=packhum389&gt;Volume III: To the Year A.D. 1398, Chapter: XVIII.

Timur crossed the [[Indus River]] at [[Attock]] (now [[Pakistan]]) on 24 September. In [[Haryana]], his soldiers each killed 50 to 100 Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of the Sikhs: The Sikh Gurus | author=Hari Ram Gupta | isbn=8121502764}} See page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Timur's invasion did not go unopposed and he did meet some resistance during his march to Delhi, most notably with the [[Sarv Khap]] coalition in northern India, and the [[Governor]] of [[Meerut]]. Although impressed and momentarily stalled by the valour of Ilyaas [[Awan Pakistan|Awan]], Timur was able to continue his relentless approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398 to combat the armies of Sultan Mehmud, already weakened by an internal battle for ascension within the royal family.

The Sultan's army was easily defeated on 17 December 1398. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed more than 100,000 "Hindu" captives.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;&lt;ref name=packhum389/&gt;

Timur himself recorded the invasions in his memoirs, collectively known as ''Tuzk-i-Timuri''.&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;&lt;ref name=packhum389/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimur"&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/index.jsp?serv=pf&amp;file=80201010&amp;ct=0 Volume III: To the Year A.D. 1398, Chapter: XVIII.

Muslim historian Irfan Habib writes in "Timur in the Political Tradition and Historiography of Mughal India" that in the 14th century, the word "Hindu" (people of "Al-Hind", "Hind" being "India") included "both Hindus and Muslims" in religious connotations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiecentrale.revues.org/500 Timur in the Political Tradition and Historiography of Mughal India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|When Timur entered Delhi after defeating Mahmud Toghloq's forces, he granted an amnesty in return for protection money (mâl-e amâni). But on the fourth day he ordered that all the people of the city be enslaved; and so they were. Thus reports Yahya, who here inserts a pious prayer in Arabic for the victims’ consolation ("To God we return, and everything happens by His will"). Yazdi, on the other hand, does not have any sympathy to waste on these wretches. He records that Timur had granted protection to the people of Delhi on the 18th of December 1398, and the collectors had begun collecting the protection money. But large groups of Timur's soldiers began to enter the city and, like birds of prey, attacked its citizens. The "pagan Hindus" (Henduân-e gabr) having had the temerity to begin immolating their women and themselves, the three cities of Delhi were put to sack by Timur's soldiers. "Faithless Hindus", he adds, had gathered in the Congregation Mosque of Old Delhi and Timur's officers put them ruthlessly to slaughter there on the 29th of December. Clearly, Yazdi's "Hindus" included Muslims as well.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Timur in the Political Tradition and Historiography of Mughal India, Irfan Habib, p. 295-312&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, that does not prove that the men gathering at the mosque were Muslims as it could have been Hindus who gathered at the Mosque for protection.

The statement implying that Muslims were targeted during the Dehli massacre was contradicted by Timur's own words, during the 15 day massacre of Dehli, Timur himself stated that "Excepting the quarters of the sayyids, the 'ulama and the other Musalmans (Muslims), the whole city was sacked", proving that Timur differentiated between the two religious groups (Muslims and Hindus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osnkLKPMWykC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=In+timur%27s+own+words+%22Excepting+the+quarter+of+the+sayyids,+the+%27ulama+and+the+other+Musalmans,+the+whole+city+was+sacked&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4z8iM697QAhXLQI8KHVveBAMQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20timur's%20own%20words%20%22Excepting%20the%20quarter%20of%20the%20sayyids%2C%20the%20'ulama%20and%20the%20other%20Musalmans%2C%20the%20whole%20city%20was%20sacked&amp;f=false | title=Sikhism Origin and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mass murder of Delhi, Timur's soldiers massacred more than 150,000 Indians, and all inhabitants not killed were [[POW|captured]] and [[slavery|enslaved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UavBlPQfuagC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=timur+massacre+150,000+men+in+delhi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip1dacntzQAhWIo48KHQXTARAQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=timur%20massacre%20150%2C000%20men%20in%20delhi&amp;f=false | title=Islam in Global History: Volume One: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War| author=  Dr. Nazeer Ahmed, PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timur's memoirs on his invasion of India describe in detail the massacre of "Hindus", looting plundering and raping of their women and the plunder of the wealth of [[Hindustan]] ([[Greater India]]). It gives details of how villages, towns and entire cities were rid of their "Hindu" male population through systematic mass slaughters and [[genocide]].

Timur left Delhi in approximately January 1399. In April he had returned to his own capital beyond the [[Oxus]] (Amu Darya). Immense quantities of spoils were taken from India. According to [[Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo]], 90 captured [[elephants]] were employed merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest, so as to erect a [[mosque]] at Samarkand&amp;nbsp;— what historians today believe is the enormous [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]]. Ironically, the mosque was constructed too quickly and suffered greatly from disrepair within a few decades of its construction.

===Regional sultanates===

Kashmir was conquered by the [[Shah Mir dynasty]] in the 14th century. Regional kingdoms such as Bengal, Gujarat, [[Malwa Sultanate|Malwa]], Khandesh, Jaunpur, and Bahmanis expanded at the expense of the Delhi Sultanate.

===The Mughal Empire===
{{Main article|Mughal Empire}}
{{See also|Ahom–Mughal conflicts}}
India in the 16th century presented a fragmented picture of rulers who lacked concern for their subjects and failed to create a common body of laws or institutions.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Outside developments also played a role in shaping events. The circumnavigation of Africa by the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498 allowed Europeans to challenge Muslim control of the trading routes between Europe and Asia. In Central Asia and [[Afghanistan]], shifts in power pushed [[Babur]] of [[Ferghana]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]) southward, first to [[Kabul]] and then to India. The dynasty he founded endured for more than three centuries.

====Babur====
{{main article|Babur}}
[[File:Babur visiting the Urvah valley in Gwalior 1.jpg|thumb|Babur and the Mughal Army at the Urvah valley in [[Gwalior]].]]

Claiming descent from both [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Timur]], Babur combined strength and courage with a love of beauty, and military ability with cultivation. He concentrated on gaining control of Northwestern India, doing so in 1526 by defeating the last Lodhi Sultan at the [[First battle of Panipat]], a town north of [[Delhi]]. Babur then turned to the tasks of persuading his Central Asian followers to stay on in India and of overcoming other contenders for power, mainly the [[Rajputs]] and the [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. He succeeded in both tasks but died shortly thereafter in 1530. The Mughal Empire was one of the largest centralised states in premodern history and was the precursor to the [[British Empire|British Indian Empire]].

Babur was followed by his great-grandson, [[Shah Jahan]] (r. 1628–58), builder of the [[Taj Mahal]] and other magnificent buildings. Two other towering figures of the Mughal era were [[Akbar]] (r. 1556–1605) and [[Aurangzeb]] (r. 1658–1707). Both rulers expanded the empire greatly and were able administrators. However, Akbar was known for his religious tolerance and administrative genius while Aurangzeb was a pious Muslim and fierce advocate of more orthodox Islam.

====Aurangzeb====
{{main article|Aurangzeb}}
[[File:India in 1700 Joppen.jpg|thumb|right|220px|In the year 1690 the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]'s realms spanned from in the west [[Kabul]] to [[Chittagong]] in the east; from [[Leh]] in the north to [[Cape Comorin]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=HTCsAAAAIAAJ |page=178 }} |title=The East India Company and the British Empire in the Far East |first1=Marguerite Eyer |last1=Wilbur |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1951 |page=178 |isbn=9780804728645 |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While some rulers were zealous in their spread of Islam, others were relatively liberal. Moghul emperor [[Akbar]] was relatively liberal and established a new religion, [[Din-e Ilahi|Din E Elahi]], which included beliefs from different religions. He abolished the jizya twice. In contrast, his great-grandson [[Aurangazeb]] was a more religious and orthodox ruler.

In the century-and-a-half that followed the death of Aurangzeb, effective Muslim control weakened. Succession to imperial and even provincial power, which had often become hereditary, was subject to intrigue and force. The [[mansabdari]] system gave way to the [[zamindari]] system, in which high-ranking officials took on the appearance of hereditary landed aristocracy with powers of collecting rents. As Delhi's control waned, other contenders for power emerged and clashed, thus preparing the way for the eventual British takeover.

==Impact on India, Islam and Muslims in India==

[[Will Durant]], a famous historian, wrote about medieval India, "The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= |title= The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage|publisher= |author= Will Durant|page= 459|date= |archiveurl= |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion theories===
Considerable controversy exists both in scholarly and public opinion as to how conversion to Islam came about in [[Indian subcontinent]], typically represented by the following schools of thought:&lt;ref name="der Veer"&gt;der Veer, pg 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus who converted to Islam however were not completely immune to persecution due to the [[caste system among Muslims]] in India established by [[Ziauddin Barani|Ziauddin al-Barani]] in the ''Fatawa-i Jahandari'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateless.freehosting.net/Caste%20in%20Indian%20Muslim%20Society.htm Caste in Indian Muslim Society]&lt;/ref&gt; where they were regarded as an "Ajlaf" caste and subjected to discrimination by the "Ashraf" castes.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;

Critics of the "religion of the sword theory" point to the presence of the strong Muslim communities found in [[South India|Southern India]], modern day [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], western [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]] coupled with the distinctive lack of equivalent Muslim communities around the heartland of historical Muslim empires in South Asia as refutation to the "conversion by the sword theory".&lt;ref name="Eaton"/&gt; The legacy of Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue even today.
Not all Muslim invaders were simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were borne of Hindu wives of Muslim rulers) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of [[Ibn Battuta]] who traveled through [[Delhi]] in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi's population. His memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]] were often favored with important posts at the royal courts suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term "[[Turk (disambiguation)|Turk]]" was commonly used to refer to their higher social status.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  However S.A.A. Rizvi&lt;ref&gt;S.A.A. Rizvi ''The Wonder That Was India''&amp;nbsp;– II&lt;/ref&gt; points to [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]] as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html Islam and the sub-continent&amp;nbsp;– appraising its impact]{{better source|date=March 2014}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125173422/http://india_resource.tripod.com/islam.html |date=25 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aurangzeb===
[[Aurangzeb]]'s Deccan campaign saw one of the largest death tolls in South Asian history, with an estimated 4.6 million people killed during his reign, Muslims and Hindus alike.&lt;ref name=mwhite&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Matthew White (historian)|Matthew White]]|year=2011|title=Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements|publisher=[[Canongate Books ]]|page=113|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q5w9qmd1UeMC&amp;pg=PP113}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated of 2.5 million of Aurangzeb's army were killed during the [[Mughal–Maratha Wars]] (100,000 annually during a quarter-century), while 2 million civilians in war-torn lands died due to [[drought]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[Famine in India|famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise of Organised Brutality|first=Siniša|last=Malešević|page=119|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFlEDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=aurangzeb+rule#v=onepage&amp;q=aurangzeb%20rule&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mwhite"/&gt;

===Expansion of trade===
[[File:Cheraman jumamasjid.JPG|thumb|[[Cheraman Juma Masjid]] in [[Kerala]]]]
Islam's impact was the most notable in the expansion of trade. The first contact of Muslims with India was the Arab attack on a nest of pirates near modern-day [[Mumbai]] to safeguard their trade in the [[Arabian Sea]]. Around the same time many Arabs settled at Indian ports, giving rise to small Muslim communities. The growth of these communities was not only due to conversion but also the fact that many Hindu kings of south India (such as those from [[Cholas]]) hired Muslims as mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod (2002), pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant aspect of the Muslim period in world history was the emergence of Islamic [[Sharia]] courts capable of imposing a common commercial and legal system that extended from Morocco in the West to Mongolia in the North East and Indonesia in the South East. While southern India was already in trade with Arabs/Muslims, northern India found new opportunities. As the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms of Asia were subjugated by Islam, and as Islam spread through Africa&amp;nbsp;– it became a highly centralising force that facilitated in the creation of a common legal system that allowed letters of credit issued in say Egypt or Tunisia to be honoured in India or Indonesia (The Sharia has laws on the transaction of business with both Muslims and non-Muslims{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}). In order to cement their rule, Muslim rulers initially promoted a system in which there was a revolving door between the clergy, the administrative nobility and the mercantile classes. The travels of explorer Muhammad Ibn-Abdullah [[Ibn-Batuta]] were eased because of this system. He served as an Imam in Delhi, as a judicial official in the Maldives, and as an envoy and trader in the Malabar. There was never a contradiction in any of his positions because each of these roles complemented the other. Islam created a compact under which political power, law and religion became fused in a manner so as to safeguard the interests of the mercantile class. This led world trade to expand to the maximum extent possible in the medieval world. [[Sher Shah Suri]] took initiatives in improvement of trade by abolishing all taxes which hindered progress of free trade. He built large networks of roads and constructed [[Grand Trunk Road]] (1540–1544), which connects [[Chittagong]] to [[Kabul]]. Parts of it are still in use today. The geographic regions add to the diversity of languages and politics.

===Cultural influence===
The divide and rule policies, two-nation theory, and subsequent partition of India in the wake of Independence from the [[British Empire]] has polarised the sub-continental psyche, making objective assessment hard in comparison to the other settled agricultural societies of India from the North West. Muslim rule differed from these others in the level of assimilation and syncretism that occurred. They retained their identity and introduced legal and administrative systems that superseded existing systems of social conduct and ethics. While this was a source of friction it resulted in a unique experience the legacy of which is a Muslim community strongly Islamic in character while at the same time distinctive and unique among its peers.

The impact of Islam on Indian culture has been inestimable. It permanently influenced the development of all areas of human endeavour&amp;nbsp;– language, dress, cuisine, all the art forms, architecture and urban design, and social customs and values. Conversely, the languages of the Muslim invaders were modified by contact with local languages, to Urdu, which uses the Arabic script. This language was also known as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], an umbrella term used for the vernacular terminology of [[Hindi]] as well as [[Urdu]], both major languages in South Asia today derived primarily from Sanskrit grammatical structures and vocabulary.

Muslim rule saw a greater urbanisation of India and the rise of many cities and their urban cultures. The biggest impact was upon trade resulting from a common commercial and legal system extending from [[Morocco]] to [[Indonesia]]. This change of emphasis on mercantilism and trade from the more strongly centralised governance systems further clashed with the agricultural based traditional economy and also provided fuel for social and political tensions.

A related development to the shifting economic conditions was the establishment of Karkhanas, or small factories and the import and dissemination of technology through India and the rest of the world. The use of ceramic tiles was adopted from architectural traditions of Iraq, Iran, and Central Asia. Rajasthan's blue pottery was a local variation of imported Chinese pottery. There is also the example of Sultan Abidin (1420–70) sending Kashmiri artisans to Samarqand to learn book-binding and paper making. Khurja and Siwan became renowned for pottery, Moradabad for brass ware, Mirzapur for carpets, Firozabad for glass wares, [[Farrukhabad]] for printing, Sahranpur and Nagina for wood-carving, Bidar and Lucknow for bidriware, Srinagar for papier-mache, Benaras for jewellery and textiles, and so on. On the flip-side encouraging such growth also resulted in higher taxes on the peasantry.

Numerous Indian scientific and mathematical advances and the [[Hindu numerals]] were spread to the rest of the world{{ref|radar.ngcsu.edu.185}} and much of the scholarly work and advances in the sciences of the age under Muslim nations across the globe were imported by the liberal patronage of Arts and Sciences by the rulers. The languages brought by Islam were modified by contact with local languages leading to the creation of several new languages, such as [[Urdu language|Urdu]], which uses the modified [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]], but with more Persian words. The influences of these languages exist in several dialects in India today.

Islamic and Mughal architecture and art is widely noticeable in India, examples being the [[Taj Mahal]] and [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]]. At the same time, Muslim rulers destroyed most of the ancient Indian architectural marvels and converted them into Islamic structures, most notably at [[Varanasi]], [[Mathura]], [[Ayodhya]] and the Kutub Complex in [[New Delhi]].

Historian Richard Eaton has tabulated a campaign of destruction of idols and temples by Delhi Sultans, intermixed with instances of years where the temples were protected from desecration.&lt;ref name=re2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M.

For example, a [[Sanskrit]] inscription notes that Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] repaired a Siva temple in [[Bidar]] after his [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during conquest, and then patronizing or repairing temples after conquest. This pattern came to an end with the [[Mughal Empire]], where [[Akbar the Great]]'s chief minister [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]] criticized the excesses of earlier sultans such as [[Mahmud of Ghazni]].&lt;ref name="eaton297"/&gt;

In many cases, the demolished remains, rocks and broken statue pieces of temples destroyed by Delhi sultans were reused to build mosques and other buildings. For example, the Qutb complex in Delhi was built from stones of 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples by some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Anthony (1993), Architectural patronage and the past: The Tughluq sultans of India, Muqarnas, Vol. 10, 311-322&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Muslim mosque in Khanapur, Maharashtra was built from the looted parts and demolished remains of Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=awhc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Anthony |last2=Crane |first2=Howard |date=1983 |title=The Tughluqs: Master Builders of the Delhi Sultanate |url=http://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3053/original/DPC0347.PDF |journal=Muqarnas |volume=1 |pages=123–166 |jstor=1523075 |doi=10.2307/1523075}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] destroyed Buddhist and Hindu libraries and their manuscripts at [[Nalanda]] and [[Odantapuri]] Universities in 1193 AD at the beginning of the Delhi Sultanate.&lt;ref name=regbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gul and Khan (2008), [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libphilprac/182 Growth and Development of Oriental Libraries in India], Library Philosophy and Practice, University of Nebrasaka-Lincoln&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical record of a campaign of destruction of temples and defacement of faces or heads of Hindu idols lasted from 1193 through the early 13th century in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the command of Ghuri. Under the Khaljis, the campaign of temple desecration expanded to Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, and continued through the late 13th century.&lt;ref name=re2000/&gt; The campaign extended to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under Malik Kafur and [[Ulugh Khan]] in the 14th century, and by the Bahmanis in 15th century.&lt;ref name=regbook&gt;Richard Eaton, {{Google books|5PgEmMULQC8C|Temple Desecration and Muslim States in Medieval India}}, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Orissa temples were destroyed in the 14th century under the Tughlaqs.

Beyond destruction and desecration, the sultans of the Delhi Sultanate in some cases had forbidden reconstruction of damaged Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples, and they prohibited repairs of old temples or construction of any new temples.&lt;ref&gt;Eva De Clercq (2010), ON JAINA APABHRAṂŚA PRAŚASTIS, Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hung. Volume 63 (3), pp 275–287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Islam (1997), A Note on the Position of the non-Muslim Subjects in the Sultanate of Delhi under the Khaljis and the Tughluqs, Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, 45, pp. 215–229; R Islam (2002), Theory and Practice of Jizyah in the Delhi Sultanate (14th Century), Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society, 50, pp. 7–18&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, the Sultanate would grant a permit for repairs and construction of temples if the patron or religious community paid [[jizya]] (fee, tax). For example, a proposal by the Chinese to repair Himalayan Buddhist temples destroyed by the Sultanate army was refused, on the grounds that such temple repairs were only allowed if the Chinese agreed to pay jizya tax to the treasury of the Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;A.L.

===Nalanda===
{{main article|Nalanda}}
In 1193, the Nalanda University complex was destroyed by [[Afghan people|Afghan]] [[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]]-[[Ghilzai]] [[Muslim]]s under [[Bakhtiyar Khalji]]; this event is seen as the final milestone in the [[decline of Buddhism in India]]. He also burned Nalanda's major Buddhist library and [[Vikramshila]] University,&lt;ref&gt;Page 292, "India's Interaction With China, Central and West Asia", written by Abdur Rahman, year 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous Buddhist monasteries in India. When the Tibetan translator, Chag Lotsawa [[Dharmasvamin]] (Chag Lo-tsa-ba, 1197–1264), visited northern India in 1235, Nalanda was damaged, looted, and largely deserted, but still standing and functioning with seventy students.

Mahabodhi, Sompura, Vajrasan and other important monasteries were found to be untouched. The Ghuri ravages only afflicted those monasteries that lay in the direct of their advance and were fortified in the manner of defensive forts.

By the end of the 12th century, following the Muslim conquest of the Buddhist stronghold in Bihar, Buddhism, having already declined in the South, declined in the North as well because survivors retreated to Nepal, Sikkim and Tibet or escaped to the South of the Indian sub-continent.

These efforts included the destruction of numerous old temples, such as Martand, prohibition of Hindu rites, rituals and festivals and even the wearing of clothes in the Hindu style. He is known as "Butcher of Kashmir" and among the most hated figures among Kashmiri Hindus.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir and Its People: Studies in the Evolution of Kashmiri Society|author1=Kaw, K.|author2=Kashmir Education, Culture, and Science Society|date=2004|publisher=A.P.H.

===Vijayanagar===
{{main article|Hampi}}
The city flourished between the 14th century and 16th century, during the height of the [[Vijayanagar Empire]]. During this time, it was often in conflict with the kingdoms which rose in the Northern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], and which are often collectively termed the [[Deccan Sultanates]]. The Vijaynagar Empire successfully resisted Muslim invasions for centuries. But in 1565, the empire's armies suffered a massive and catastrophic defeat at the hands of an alliance of the Sultanates, and the capital was taken. The victorious armies then razed, depopulated and destroyed the city over several months. The empire continued its slow decline, but the original capital was not reoccupied or rebuilt.

===Somnath===
{{main article|Somnath}}
Around 1024 CE, during the reign of [[Bhima I]], [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] raided Gujarat, and plundered the Somnath temple. According to an 1169 CE inscription, Bhima rebuilt the temple.

The marble-curled around structure is a superior example of Maratha architecture. Lord Krishna's two feet tall statue is carved in silver and is placed on a marble-inlaid altar with silver-plated doors. Mahmud of Ghazni had taken these doors from the famous Somnath Temple in Gujarat to Ghazni in Khorasan in 1026 AD. The Afghan trespasser, Mahmud Shah Abdali, later took the gates to Lahore, from where Shrinath Madhavji Shinde today popularly known as The Great Maratha Mahadji Scindia reacquired them. The Scindia ruler later established them in Gopal Mandir, bringing to a halt the doors’ long journey. Bayajibai Shinde, Maharaja Daulat Rao Scindia's queen, built the temple in the 19th century. Its location in the middle of the market area right in the heart of the city adds to its popularity.] Mosque and Tomb of the Emperor Soolta Mahmood of Ghuznee, publisher British Library

The {{strong|Order of the Star in the East}} (OSE) was an international organization based at [[Varanasi|Benares (Varanasi)]], [[India]], from {{daterange|1911|1927}}. It was established by the leadership of the [[Theosophical Society]] at [[Adyar, Chennai]], in order to prepare the world for the arrival of a [[Messianism|messianic]] entity, the so-called [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|''World Teacher or Maitreya'']]. The OSE acquired members worldwide as it expanded in many countries; a third of its diverse membership {{circa|1926}} was unaffiliated with the Theosophical Society. The precursor of the OSE was the {{strong|Order of the Rising Sun}} ({{dash year|1910}}, also at Benares) and the successor was the {{strong|Order of the Star}} ({{dash year|1927|1929}}, based at [[Ommen]], the [[Netherlands]]). The precursor organization was formed after leading [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] discovered a likely candidate for the new messiah in the then{{en dash}}adolescent [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895{{en dash}}1986), a [[South India]]n [[Brahmin]] who was installed as Head of the Order. Almost two decades later Krishnamurti rejected the messianic role, repudiated the Order's mission, and in 1929 disbanded the OSE's successor. The founding and activities of these organizations, as well as the largely unexpected dissolution of the OSE's successor, garnered widespread media attention and public interest. They also led to crises in the Theosophical Society and to [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] in Theosophy.

==Background==
&lt;!--This section is linked from within this article ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
{{Theosophy}}
One of the central tenets of late 19th-century [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] as promoted by the [[Theosophical Society]] was the complex [[doctrine]] of intelligent evolution of all existence. This was said to be occurring on a [[Cosmos|Cosmic]] scale, incorporating both physical and non-physical aspects of the known and unknown Universe, and affecting all of its constituent parts regardless of apparent size or importance. The theory was originally promulgated in the ''[[Secret Doctrine]]'' (published 1888),{{r|sd}} a book by [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of contemporary Theosophy and the Theosophical Society.{{r|ngc2004-pp7}}

According to this view, Humankind's evolution on Earth (and beyond) is part of the Cosmic evolution. It is reputedly overseen by a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called ''[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]'', whose upper echelons consist of advanced spiritual beings. Blavatsky portrayed the Theosophical Society as one of the Hierarchy's many attempts (or "impulses") throughout the millennia, to guide Humanity{{spaced en dash}}in concert with the intelligent evolutionary scheme{{spaced en dash}}to its ultimate, immutable objective: the attainment of perfection and the conscious participation in the evolutionary process.{{r|masters}} Blavatsky stated that these attempts require an Earth-based infrastructure (such as the Theosophical Society), to pave the way for the Hierarchy's physically appearing emissaries, "the torch-bearer{{interp|s}} of Truth".{{r|hb1889-pp306}} The mission of these reputedly regularly appearing emissaries is to practically translate, in a way and language understood by contemporary humanity, the knowledge required to propel it to a higher evolutionary stage.{{r|masters}}

==History==

===Early history===
Blavatsky also wrote about the possible impact of Theosophy and the Theosophical Society in her book ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' (published 1889):

{{quote
|text=If the present attempt, in the form of our Society, succeeds better than its predecessors have done, then it will be in existence as an organized, living and healthy body when the time comes for the effort of the {{dfn|1=XX|title=20 (in Roman numerals)}}th century. The general condition of men's minds and hearts will have been improved and purified by the spread of its teachings, and, as I have said, their prejudices and dogmatic illusions will have been, to some extent at least, removed. Not only so, but besides a large and accessible literature ready to men's hands, the next impulse will find a numerous and {{em|united}} body of people ready to welcome the new torch-bearer of Truth. He will find the minds of men prepared for his message, a language ready for him in which to clothe the new truths he brings, an organization awaiting his arrival, which will remove the merely mechanical, material obstacles and difficulties from his path. Think how much one, to whom such an opportunity is given, could accomplish. Measure it by comparison with what the Theosophical Society actually {{em|has}} achieved in the last fourteen years, without {{em|any}} of these advantages and surrounded by hosts of hindrances which would not hamper the new leader.{{nbsp}}{{small|{{interp|Emphasis in original.}}}}
|author=Helena Blavatsky|source={{italics correction|''The Key to Theosophy''}}{{r|hb1889-pp306}}
}}

Based on this and other Blavatsky writings, Theosophists expected the future advent of the aforementioned "next impulse"; additional information was the purview of the Society's ''[[wikt:esoteric#Adjective|Esoteric]] Section'', which Blavatsky had founded and originally led.{{r|ts-es}}

After Blavatsky’s death in 1891, influential Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] expanded on her writings about the Spiritual Hierarchy and the Masters.{{r|cwl}} He formulated a [[Christology]] in which he identified Christ with the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Theosophical representation]] of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Maitreya]]. Leadbeater believed that Maitreya-as-Christ had manifested on Earth in several occasions, using in each case a specially prepared person as a "vehicle". The incarnated Maitreya assumed the role of World Teacher of Humankind, dispensing knowledge regarding underlying truths of Existence.{{r|cwl}}

[[Annie Besant]], another well-known and influential Theosophist (and eventual close associate of Leadbeater’s), had also developed an interest on the advent of the next emissary from the Spiritual Hierarchy.{{r|il2012-pp132}} During the decades of the 1890s and 1900s, along with Leadbeater and others, she became progressively convinced that this advent would happen sooner than Blavatsky's proposed timetable.{{r|hb1889-p306|il2012-pp132}} They came to believe it would involve the imminent reappearance of [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya as World Teacher]], a monumental event in the Theosophical worldview.{{r|il2012-pp136}} However, not all Theosophical Society members accepted Leadbeater's and Besant's ideas on the matter; the dissidents charged them with straying from Theosophical [[orthodoxy]] and, along with other concepts developed by the two, their elaborations on the Theosophical Maitreya were derisively labeled ''[[Neo-Theosophy]]'' by their opponents.{{r|abk1930-pp327}}

Besant became President of the Theosophical Society in 1907,{{r|rv2001-p35}} and added considerable weight to the belief of Maitreya's imminent manifestation; this eventually became a commonly held expectation among Theosophists.{{r|gs1999}} Besant had started commenting on the possibly imminent arrival of the next emissary as early as 1896; by 1909 the proclaimed "coming Teacher" was a main topic of her lectures and writings.{{r|ml1975-pp11|nyt1909}}

==="Discovery" of Jiddu Krishnamurti===
Sometime between late April and late May{{nbsp}}1909, at the private beach of the Theosophical Society Headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], Leadbeater encountered [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], a fourteen-year-old [[South India]]n [[Brahmin]].{{r|ml1975-pp1}} At the time Jiddu Narayaniah, Krishnamurti's father and longtime Theosophist, was employed by the Society; the family, in relatively poor condition, lived next to the compound. Leadbeater, a controversial figure whose knowledge on [[occult]] matters was highly respected by the Society's leadership, came to believe young Krishnamurti was a suitable candidate for the vehicle of the World Teacher{{spaced en dash}}despite the boy's reputedly dull personality and lackluster intellect.{{r|vehicle|ew1964-pp287}} Leadbeater soon placed Krishnamurti, and at the latter's insistence his inseparable younger brother Jiddu Nityananda ("Nitya"), under his and the Society's wing; in late{{nbsp}}1909 Besant, as President of the Society and head of its Esoteric Section, admitted the Jiddu brothers into both.{{r|jk-jn}} In March{{nbsp}}1910 she became their [[Legal guardianship|legal guardian]].{{r|jk-ab}}

Following the "discovery", Leadbeater began occult examinations of Krishnamurti, to whom he had assigned the [[pseudonym]] {{em|Alcyone}}{{spaced en dash}}the [[Alcyone (star)|name of a star]] in the [[Pleiades|Pleiades star cluster]], and of characters from [[Greek mythology]].{{r|alcyone}} Leadbeater's belief regarding the boy's suitability was strengthened by his [[clairvoyance]]-aided investigations of Krishnamurti's reputed [[Reincarnation|past and future lives]]. The results of these investigations were recorded, and eventually published in Theosophical magazines starting April{{nbsp}}1910, and in a book in 1913.{{r|b&amp;l1913-fwd}} They were widely read and discussed within the Society, as according to Leadbeater, contemporary Theosophists were involved in various "lives of Alcyone". Such reputed involvement became a matter of status and prestige among Theosophists; it also contributed to factionalism within the Society.{{r|ml1975-pp23}} In the meantime, Krishnamurti was put on a comprehensive multiyear regiment of physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual training in preparation for his probable future role.{{r|rv2001-chs4}}

&lt;!--This section is linked from within this article ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
In late{{nbsp}}1910 the Theosophical Society published the first work "by Alcyone", a booklet entitled ''[[At the Feet of the Master]]''. The book became very popular among Theosophists, and around the same time (officially, in January{{nbsp}}1911), the {{strong|Order of the Rising Sun}} was founded at [[Varanasi|Benares (Varanasi)]] by [[George Arundale]], a prominent Theosophist. Arundale, Principal of the [[Central Hindu School|Central Hindu College]] (CHC), had been impressed by Alcyone’s writings, and formed the Order around a CHC-based study group of [[wikt:disciple#Noun|disciple]]s headed by Krishnamurti. The new entity was generally focused on the expected World Teacher, yet the recently discovered Krishnamurti-Alcyone was{{spaced en dash}}somewhat obliquely{{spaced en dash}}at the center of its attention.{{r|atfm|ml1975-pp42}}

Meanwhile, the activities and proclamations of Leadbeater, Besant, and other senior Theosophists regarding Krishnamurti and the expected Teacher became entangled in prior disputes within and without the Theosophical Society, and also the subjects of new controversies.{{r|gt1986-ch15|mcnr1911}} The evolving controversies, as well as objections by [[Hindu]] members of the CHC [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], prompted Besant to officially disband the organization in May{{nbsp}}1911; however, a replacement had already been formed.{{r|il2012-pp298}}

===Order of the Star in the East===
In April{{nbsp}}1911 Besant founded the {{strong|Order of the Star in the East}} (OSE), based again at Benares, which replaced the Order of the Rising Sun. It was named after the [[Star of Bethlehem]], signifying the proclaimed approach of the new manifestation of Christ-Maitreya.{{r|rv2001-p64}} The top positions of the organization were filled: "Mrs Besant and Leadbeater were made Protectors of the new Order of which Krishna {{interp|Jiddu Krishnamurti}} was the Head, Arundale Private Secretary to the Head, and Wodehouse Organizing Secretary".{{r|ml1975-pp46}} News regarding Krishnamurti, the Order, and its mission received widespread publicity and worldwide press coverage; the publicity may have been at least partly driven by aspects of the era's prevailing ''{{lang|fr|nocat=yes|[[fin de siècle]]}}'' mood.{{r|publicity}}

The goal of the OSE was to educate and prepare the world for the arrival of the World Teacher and to remove any material obstacles and difficulties from his path.{{r|aew1911}} By late{{nbsp}}1913, the Order had {{nobr|about 15,000 members}} worldwide; most of them were also members of the Theosophical Society.{{r|ml1975-p74a}} However, membership was open to anyone, the only precondition being acceptance of the "Declaration of Principles", which stated the following:

{{quote
|text=
{{olist
|We believe that a great Teacher will soon appear in the world, and we wish so to live now that we may be worthy to know Him when He comes.
|We shall try, therefore, to keep Him in our minds always, and to do in His name, and therefore to the best of our ability, all the work which comes to us in our daily occupations.
|As far as our ordinary duties allow, we shall endeavour to devote a portion of our time each day to some definite work which may help to prepare for His coming.
|We shall seek to make Devotion, Steadfastness and Gentleness prominent characteristics of our daily life.
|We shall try to begin and end each day with a short period devoted to the asking of His blessing upon all that we try to do for Him and in His name.
|We regard it as our special duty to try to recognise and reverence greatness in whomsoever shown, and to strive to co-operate, as far as we can, with those whom we feel to be spiritually our superiors.

Following its establishment the OSE began its mission in earnest. Lecture tours, meetings and other activities were undertaken by prominent members of the Order.{{r|tns1926}} Articles and pamphlets about the OSE and its mission, published regularly by Theosophical organizations, were joined by an official bulletin, ''The Herald of the Star'', originally based at Adyar, which started publication in January{{nbsp}}1912.{{r|herald}}

As Krishnamurti came of age, he embarked on an intensified schedule of lectures and discussions in several countries, and acquired a large following among the membership of the Theosophical Society.{{r|jk-ose}} National Sections of the Order were eventually formed in as many as forty countries.{{r|wh1925}}

On {{nobr|28 December 1911,}} during a ceremony officiated by Krishnamurti at the close of the annual Theosophical Convention (held that year at Benares), those present were reported to be suddenly overwhelmed by a strange feeling of "tremendous power", which seemed to be flowing through Krishnamurti. In Leadbeater's description, "it reminded one irresistibly of the rushing, mighty wind, and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. The tension was enormous, and every one in the room was most powerfully affected." The next day, at a meeting of the Esoteric Section, Besant for the first time announced that it was now obvious Krishnamurti was indeed the chosen vehicle. Thereafter, 28 December became a "sacred day" for the Order.{{r|sacred-day}}

In 1912, Krishnamurti's father sued Besant in order to annul her guardianship of his son, which he had previously granted. Among the reasons stated in Narayaniah's deposition was his objection to the [[Apotheosis|deification]] of Krishnamurti, said to have been caused by Besant's "announcement that he was to be the Lord Christ, with the result that a number of respectable persons had prostrated before him." Besant eventually won the case on appeal.{{r|ml1975-pp62}}

Also in 1912, most members of the Theosophical Society's [[Germany|German]] Section followed its head, [[Rudolf Steiner]], in splitting from the parent Society{{spaced en dash}}partly due to disagreement over Besant's and Leadbeater's proclamations concerning Krishnamurti's [[Messiah|messianic]] status.{{r|rmd1992}}

Controversy regarding the OSE and Krishnamurti again engulfed the Central Hindu College. In 1913, a number of the Order's supporters resigned their positions at the CHC following opposition by the school's administration and trustees, who considered the Order's activities unacademical.{{r|chc|gt1986-ch15}}

In 1920, Krishnamurti's younger brother Nitya replaced Wodehouse as Organising Secretary.{{r|ml1975-p125}} The next year, the first international Congress of the Order of the Star in the East was held in [[Paris, France]], attended by 2,000{{nbsp}}members out of then about{{nbsp}}30,000 worldwide. At the Congress it was decided that there would be no special ceremonies or [[ritual]]s associated with the Order or with the World Teacher.{{r|ml1975-p129}} Also in the 1920s, regularly scheduled multiday Star Camps, supported by well-organized facilities, started to be held in the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]], and [[India]]. They were attended by thousands of members, with coverage provided by local and international media.{{r|rl1943-pp88}}

In late{{nbsp}}1925, close Krishnamurti associate and friend D.{{nbsp}}Rajagopal{{nnbsp}}{{r|vehicle}} was appointed general secretary following Nitya's unexpected death. While the Order's activities continued without visible disruption, Nitya's death was a privately devastating, watershed event for Krishnamurti.{{r|jn-death}}

Financing the venture and subsequent expansion did not appear to present a problem.{{r|ml1975-p74b}} Properties in several countries were acquired via specially-formed [[Land trust|trusts]] or by affiliates, for a variety of purposes.{{r|properties}} In collaboration with the Theosophical Society, the OSE had been producing a number of publications and propaganda material {{see at|External links|lc=y|at=}}; in 1926, it organized its own publishing arm: the Star Publishing Trust, based at [[Eerde, Ommen]], the Netherlands. Along with an official international bulletin published in Ommen (the ''International Star Bulletin''), national bulletins eventually appeared in twenty-one countries, and in fourteen different languages.{{r|spt}} Also in 1926 it was reported that the Order's membership had reached about{{nbsp}}43,000, two{{nbsp}}thirds of which were members of the Theosophical Society.{{r|members}}

====Claims and expectations====
By {{nobr|year-end 1925,}} efforts of prominent Theosophists and their affiliated factions to favorably position themselves for the expected {{em|Coming}} were reaching a climax. Extraordinary pronouncements of accelerated spiritual advancement were being made by various parties, privately disputed by others. Ranking members of the Order and the Society had publicly declared themselves to have been chosen as [[apostle]]s of the new Messiah. The escalating claims of spiritual success, and the internal (and hidden from the public) Theosophical politics, alienated an increasingly disillusioned Krishnamurti. His commitment and enthusiasm had been uneven since the Order's early days, and in private he had occasionally expressed doubts about his presumed mission.{{r|ml1975-chs10}} He refused to recognize anyone as his disciple or apostle.{{r|ml1975-chs25}} In the meantime, World Teacher-related spinoff projects proliferated: in August{{nbsp}}1925 the establishment of a "World Religion" and a "World University" were announced by the Theosophical leadership. Both of them were later "quietly shelved".{{r|ml1975-pp214}}

The annual Star Congress for 1925 opened at Adyar on the "sacred day" of 28{{nbsp}}December, following the much anticipated but uneventful Theosophical Convention.{{r|ml1975-p223}} At the opening, an event occurred that was reminiscent of the incident that had happened on the same day of 1911. Krishnamurti had been giving a speech about the World Teacher and the significance of his coming, when "a dramatic change" took place: his voice suddenly altered and he switched to first person, saying "I come for those who want sympathy, who want happiness, who are longing to be released, who are longing to find happiness in all things. I come to reform and not to tear down, I come not to destroy but to build." For many of the assembled who noticed, it was a "spine-tingling" revelation, "felt{{nbsp}}... instantly and independently"{{spaced en dash}}confirmation, in their view, that the manifestation of the Lord Maitreya through his chosen vehicle had begun.{{r|manifest}}

The reputed manifestation of the World Teacher prompted a number of celebratory statements and assertions by prominent Theosophists that were not unanimously accepted by Society members. One result was the persistence of controversy regarding the project.{{r|wt-controv}} Besant and other leaders of the Society largely managed to contain the dissenters and the controversy, but in the process sustained unflattering publicity.{{r|lat1926b}} However, the so-called ''World Teacher Project'' was also receiving serious and neutral coverage in the global media, and according to reports it was followed sympathetically and with interest by non-Theosophists.{{r|wt-pov}}
[[File:Jiddu Krishnamurti 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=photo portrait of Jiddu Krishnamurti in the 1920s|Jiddu Krishnamurti in the 1920s]]

In related developments following the perceived manifestation, Besant announced in January{{nbsp}}1927, "{{interp|t}}he World Teacher is here",{{r|ml1975-p241}} and many Star members expected Krishnamurti's unequivocal public proclamation of his messianic status. Reflecting the new situation, in June{{nbsp}}1927 the name of the organization was changed to {{strong|Order of the Star}}, and its main organ was retitled {{italics correction|''The Star Review''}}; the organization relocated at Ommen, with D.{{nbsp}}Rajagopal serving as Chief Organizer.{{r|os-obj|review}}

The renamed organization had two objectives:{{nnbsp}}{{r|os-obj}}

{{block indent
|text=
{{blist
|To draw together all those who believe in the Presence of the World Teacher in the world
|To work with Him for the establishment of His ideas
}}
}}

Complementing the reorganization and the proclamations of the World Teacher's manifestation, in 1928 the so-called {{em|World Mother Project}}, headed by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] (George Arundale's young wife), was put in motion by Theosophical leaders. Krishnamurti again distanced himself from this endeavor, which Indian and international press reports dubbed "Mrs. Besant's New Fad", and it was to be short-lived.{{r|wmp}}
{{clear}}

===Dissolution and repudiation===
By the late{{nbsp}}1920s, Krishnamurti's emphasis in public talks and private discussions had changed. He had been gradually discarding or contradicting Theosophical concepts and terminology, disagreeing with leading Theosophists, and talking less about the World Teacher; public interest, and attendance at his speaking engagements, remained high.{{r|lat1926a|ml1975-p257}} The shift in emphasis mirrored fundamental changes in Krishnamurti as a person, including his increasing disenchantment with the World Teacher Project. They led Krishnamurti to a thorough reevaluation of his relationship with the Project, the Theosophical Society, and Theosophy in general.{{r|jk-exp}} Finally, on {{nobr|3 August 1929}}, at the Ommen Star Camp, he disbanded the Order in front of Besant and about 3,000{{nbsp}}members.{{r|isb2|wp1929}} In his speech dissolving the organization (also broadcast on [[Netherlands|Dutch]] radio),{{r|ml1975-p272}} Krishnamurti said:

{{quote
|text=I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect. That is my point of view, and I adhere to that absolutely and unconditionally. Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path.
|author=Jiddu Krishnamurti|source={{italics correction|''The Dissolution of the Order of the Star''}}{{r|jk1929-pp3}}
}}

Despite the changes in Krishnamurti's outlook and pronouncements during the preceding years (and more recent rumors of impending dissolution),{{r|ml1975-pp260}} the ending of the Order and its mission shocked many of its supporters. Prominent Theosophists openly or under various guises turned against Krishnamurti{{spaced en dash}}including Leadbeater, who reputedly stated, "the Coming has gone wrong".{{r|ml1975-pp277}} However, other Society members supported Krishnamurti's new direction, and opposed the critical views expressed by Theosophical leaders.{{r|jk-support}}

Soon after the dissolution Krishnamurti severed his ties to Theosophy and the Theosophical Society.{{r|tmg1930|jk-ts}} He denounced the concepts of [[Messiah|saviors]], leaders, and spiritual teachers.{{r|rv2001-pp180}} Vowing to work towards setting humankind "absolutely, unconditionally free",{{r|jk1929-p14}} he repudiated all doctrines and theories of inner, spiritual and psychological evolution such as those implied in the Theosophical tenets described above {{see above|Background|lc=y|at=n}}. Instead, he posited that his goal of complete psychological freedom could be realized only through the understanding of individuals' actual relationships with themselves, society, and nature.{{r|rv2001-pp180|jk1980}}

Krishnamurti returned to the donors estates, property and funds that had been given to the Order in its various incarnations.{{r|assets}} He spent the rest of his life promoting his post-Theosophical message around the world as an independent speaker and writer. He became widely known as an original, influential thinker on philosophical, psychological, and religious subjects.{{r|ww1986}}

==Consequences==
In 1907, the first year for which reliable records were kept,{{r|gt1986-p943}} the worldwide membership of the Theosophical Society was estimated at over{{nbsp}}15,000. During the following two decades membership suffered due to splits and resignations, but by the mid{{en dash}}1920s it was rising again; it eventually peaked in 1928 at {{nobr|about 45,000 members}}.{{r|ts-members}} The membership of the Order in its various guises kept increasing steadily, yet Krishnamurti's changing message in the period leading to the dissolution may have negatively affected growth.{{r|jk-support}} Many members of the Order were also members of the Theosophical Society;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jr1986-p288}} consequently, as many as a third of the members of the Society left "within a few years" of Krishnamurti's disbanding of the Order.{{r|bc1980-pp130}} In the opinion of a Krishnamurti biographer, the Society, already in decline for other reasons, "was in disarray" upon the dissolution of the Order. While Theosophical publications and leading members tried to minimize the effect of Krishnamurti's actions and the defunct Order's importance, the "truth{{nbsp}}... was that the Theosophical Society had been {{nobr|pole-axed. ...}} {{interp|Krishnamurti}} had combatively challenged the central tenet of its beliefs".{{r|rv2001-pp188}}

The failed project led to considerable analysis and retrospective evaluations by the Society and by well-known Theosophists, at that time and since.{{r|wt-eval}} It also resulted in governance changes in the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]], a reorientation of its Esoteric Section, re-examination of parts of its doctrine, and reticence to outside questions regarding the OSE and the World Teacher Project.{{r|rv2001-pp268}} According to both theosophical and non-theosophical observers, Theosophical organizations, especially the Theosophical Society Adyar, by the close of the 20th{{nbsp}}century had yet to recover from Krishnamurti's rejection and the entire World Teacher affair, and entered the 21st still dealing with their effects.{{r|ts-state}}

==Cultural references==
Events and personalities related to the World Teacher Project and the OSE have been portrayed, or alluded to, in artistic and cultural works.

"The Word of the Master" ({{lang-fi|Mestarin käsky}}), is a 1925 work for voice and piano by [[Finland|Finnish]] composer [[Leevi Madetoja]] {{nobr|({{abbrlink|Op.|Opus number}} 71/2).}} Originally published as "At the Feet of the Master (''Alcyone'')", its devotional lyrics are based on the eponymous book {{see above|Order of the Rising Sun|lc=y|at=n}}. The three-minute-long work was republished under the new title in 1929; {{as of|2002|lc=y}}, it was included in contemporary performances on [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-Audio]].{{r|madetoja}}

"Benares, 1910", an episode in the 1990s US television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' created by [[George Lucas]], is taking place in Benares around the time of Krishnamurti's discovery and the formation of the OSE. The hour-long episode loosely (and sympathetically) portrays these and related events. The including series explores the childhood and youth of the fictional character [[Indiana Jones]]; in this installment, the [[protagonist]] gets to meet the boy Krishnamurti, Besant and Leadbeater.{{r|ijc}} Filmed on location at Benares. The episode originally aired on {{nobr|3 July 1993,}} during [[primetime]], on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network;{{nnbsp}}{{r|sb2007}} it achieved modest [[Nielsen ratings]].{{r|dg1993}} It was later re-packaged in a television [[Television film|"Movie of the Week"]] titled ''The Journey of Radiance''{{nbsp}}(2000),{{r|sb2007}} which was also released, along with related documentary material, on [[DVD-Video]]{{nbsp}}(2007).{{r|ijc}}

''Blue Dove'', a [[Musical theater|musical]] in two acts, is based on Krishnamurti's life between his discovery by Leadbeater and the start of his career as an independent philosopher and speaker following the dissolution of the Order of the Star. The musical, with a running time of two hours and fifteen minutes, premiered in October{{nbsp}}2004 at Los Angeles' Ivar Theatre and had a three-week stage run; a 40-minute recording of songs was released in 2005. The [[libretto]] and plot, by Englishman Peter Wells, employ considerable [[artistic license]] in their portrayals of related persons and events.{{r|bd2004}}

&lt;ref name="jk-ab"&gt;{{harvnb|Lutyens|1975|p=40}}. Besant and Krishnamurti developed a very close, lasting personal relationship {{harv|Vernon|2001|pp=46{{en dash}}47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishnamurti experienced life-changing events of physical, psychological and spiritual nature starting in 1922. These mystified the leaders of the Theosophical Society who were ultimately unable to explain them, but provided Krishnamurti with an avenue of growth and life independent of Theosophy, the Order, and the Society. Another major factor was Nitya's premature death from [[tuberculosis]] in {{nobr|November 1925,}} which deeply affected Krishnamurti, and had revelatory consequences. His continuing disagreements with leading Theosophists became more acute, despite Besant's efforts for conciliation. She offered to resign as President of the Society, and in 1928, in sympathy with Krishnamurti, closed the Esoteric Section. She reopened it after the dissolution of the Order.{{xref|text={{sp}}See also {{slink|Jiddu Krishnamurti|Life-altering experiences}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Nitya was charged by Theosophical leaders, and reputedly by the Masters, with looking after Krishnamurti and with assisting him in his presumed mission.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="jk-ts"&gt;{{harvnb|Lutyens|1975|pp=276, 285}}. Krishnamurti remained on friendly terms with individual members of the Society. In 1980, he visited the Adyar Headquarters after an almost 50-year absence, and "reconciled the rift that seemingly existed between him and the Society" {{harv|Rodrigues|2012|p=470}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitya's death shocked Krishnamurti's circle; it "broke him {{interp|Krishnamurti}} completely". He had received assurances regarding his brother's well-being by prominent Theosophists and reputedly, by members of the hidden Spiritual Hierarchy. Yet he recovered quickly.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="lat1926b"&gt;{{harvnb|''Los Angeles Times''|1926b}}. This press report considered "the strenuous efforts" of Besant "and her cult" regarding the World Teacher as objects of amusement; in contrast, Krishnamurti was said to "have retained no little common sense despite his recent dip into theosophy".&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="ml1975-p223"&gt;{{harvnb|Lutyens|1975|p=223}}. The 1925 Theosophical Convention took place on the 50th{{nbsp}}anniversary of the founding of the Theosophical Society. There were high expectations among Theosophists and Star members, mainly due to rumors of significant imminent manifestations related to the World Teacher.

[[Reincarnation]] is considered a fundamental doctrine in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].

&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{harvnb|Lutyens|1975|loc=pp.{{nbsp}}246, 315 {{interp|in "Notes and Sources", note for {{p.|252}}}}}}. The new bulletin was edited by Lutyens' mother Emily ([[Née|{{em|née}}]] Lady [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton#Marriage and children|Lytton]]). Like its predecessor, it also increasingly published or republished articles on a wide array of issues.

&lt;ref name="rmd1992"&gt;{{harvnb|McDermott|1992}}. Rudolf Steiner, at the time [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|leader of the German Section of the Theosophical Society]], rejected the claims of Krishnamurti's messianic status. The resulting tensions between the German Section and Besant and Leadbeater was one of the reasons that led to a split in the Society and, in 1912, to Steiner forming the [[Anthroposophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, thirteen-year-old Indian Desikacharya Rajagopalacharya ("D.{{nbsp}}Rajagopal", 1900{{en dash}}1993) was "discovered" by Leadbeater in 1913, and for a time it was rumored in Theosophical circles that he might supplant Krishnamurti. However, Krishnamurti was considered the most likely vehicle candidate, for whom the Society made available its resources. Rajagopal went on to become a decades-long close associate and friend of Krishnamurti's, but their relationship soured in old age.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan Twardowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈpan tfarˈdɔfski}}), in [[Polish folklore]] and [[Polish literature|literature]], is a [[Sorcerer (person)|sorcerer]] who made a [[deal with the Devil]].&lt;ref name="widacka"&gt;{{cite web |author=Hanna Widacka |url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/index.php?enc=576 |title=Legendy i fakty o Mistrzu Twardowskim |work=www.wilanow-palac.art.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pan Twardowski sold his soul in exchange for special powers &amp;ndash; such as summoning up the spirit of Polish King [[Sigismund Augustus]]' deceased wife &amp;ndash; but he eventually met a tragic fate. The tale of Pan Twardowski exists in various diverging versions and forms the basis for many works of fiction, including one by [[Adam Mickiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Adam Mickiewicz |url=http://mickiewicz.kulturalna.com/a-33.html |title=Pani Twardowska |work=mickiewicz.kulturalna.com |publisher=|pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
[[File:Wojciech Gerson - Zjawa Barbary Radziwiłłówny.jpg|thumb|right|Pan Twardowski summoning [[Barbara Radziwiłł|Barbara Radziwiłłówna's]] ghost for King [[Sigismund II of Poland|Sigismund Augustus]]. Painting by [[Wojciech Gerson]].]]

According to an old legend, Twardowski was a nobleman ([[szlachcic]]) who lived in [[Kraków]] in the 16th century. He sold his soul to the [[devil]] in exchange for great knowledge and [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers. However, Twardowski wanted to outwit the devil by including a special clause in the contract, stating that the devil could only take Twardowski's soul to [[Hell]] during his visit to [[Rome]] &amp;ndash; a place the sorcerer never intended to go.&lt;ref name="widacka" /&gt; Other variants of the story have Twardowski being sold to the devil as a child by his father.

With the devil's aid, Twardowski quickly rose to wealth and fame, eventually becoming a courtier of King [[Sigismund II of Poland|Sigismund Augustus]], who sought consolation in magic and [[astrology]] after the death of his beloved wife, [[Barbara Radziwiłł]].&lt;ref name="bugaj"&gt;{{cite web |author=Roman Bugaj |url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/index.php?enc=72 |title=Mistrz Twardowski |work=www.wilanow-palac.art.pl |publisher="Mówią wieki", nr 9, 1972 |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-03-20|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have [[Conjuration|summoned]] the [[ghost]] of the late queen to comfort the grieving king, using a magic mirror.&lt;ref name="bugaj" /&gt; The sorcerer also wrote two books, both dictated to him by the devil &amp;ndash; a book on magic and an [[encyclopedia]]. 

After years of evading his fate, Twardowski was eventually tricked by the devil and caught not in the city, but at an [[inn]] called ''Rzym'' (''Rome'' in Polish).&lt;ref name="widacka" /&gt; While being spirited away, Twardowski started to pray to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], who made the devil drop his victim midway to Hell.&lt;ref name="widacka" /&gt; Twardowski fell on the [[Moon]] where he lives to this day. His only companion is his sidekick whom he once turned into a [[spider]]; from time to time Twardowski lets the spider descend to [[Earth]] on a thread and bring him news from the world below.&lt;ref name="widacka" /&gt;

== Historical Twardowski ==
Some German historians have suggested that Twardowski may have been a [[Germans|German]] nobleman who was born in [[Nuremberg]] and studied in [[Wittenberg]] before coming to Kraków.&lt;ref name="widacka" /&gt; His speculative name ''Laurentius Dhur''&lt;ref name="bugaj" /&gt; was [[Latin]]ised to ''Durus'' and in turn rendered as ''Twardowski'' in Polish; ''durus'' and ''twardy'' mean "hard" in Latin and Polish respectively. There is also some speculation that this legend was inspired by the life of either [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] or his associate [[Edward Kelley]], both of whom lived in Kraków for a time.

The title ''Pan'', used as a universal [[honorific]] and polite form of address in modern [[Polish language|Polish]], was reserved for members of nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') at the time the tale developed and was roughly equivalent to the English ''Sir'' (see [[Polish name]]). Twardowski's [[Given name|forename]] is sometimes given as ''Jan'' (John), although most versions of his tale do not mention a forename at all. This, however, may have resulted as a confusion between ''Pan Twardowski'' and a Polish [[Catholic]] priest writer, [[Jan Twardowski]].

== Pan Twardowski in literature, music and film ==
[[File:Ignacy Gierdziejewski, Pan Twardowski.jpg|thumb|Pan Twardowski abducted by the devil. Painting by [[Ignacy Gierdziejewski]].]]
The legend of Pan Twardowski inspired a great number of Polish, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Russia]]n and German poets, novelists, composers, directors and other artists.

One of the best known literary works featuring Pan Twardowski is the humorous [[ballad]] ''Pani Twardowska'' by [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (1822). In this version of the story, Twardowski agrees to be taken to Hell on the condition that the devil spends one year living with his wife, Pani (Lady) Twardowska. The devil, however, prefers to run away and thus Pan Twardowski is saved. [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] wrote music for the ballad in 1869.

Other works based on the legend include:

* ''Pan Tvardovsky'', an [[opera]] by [[Alexey Verstovsky]], [[libretto]] by [[Mikhail Zagoskin]] (1828);
* ''Pan Tvardovsky'', Zagoskin's short story from the collection ''An Evening on the Khopyor'' (1834);
* ''Mistrz Twardowski'' [''Master Twardowski''], a [[novel]] by [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] (1840);
* ''Tvardovsky'', a ballad by [[Semen Hulak-Artemovsky]];
* ''Pan Twardowski'', a [[ballet]] by [[Adolf Gustaw Sonnenfeld]] (1874);
* ''Twardowski'', a [[poem]] by [[Jaroslav Vrchlický]] (1885);
* ''Mistrz Twardowski'', a [[poem]] by [[Leopold Staff]] (1902);
* ''Pan Twardowski'', a ballad by [[Lucjan Rydel]] (1906);
* ''Pan Tvardovsky'', a [[film]] by [[Ladislas Starevich]] (1917);
* ''Pan Twardowski'', a ballet by [[Ludomir Różycki]] (1921);
* ''[[Pan Twardowski (1921 film)|Pan Twardowski]]'', a film by [[Wiktor Biegański]] (1921);
* ''Pan Twardowski, czarnoksiężnik polski'' [''Pan Twardowski, a Polish sorcerer''], a novel by [[Wacław Sieroszewski]] (1930);
* ''[[Pan Twardowski (1936 film)|Pan Twardowski]]'', a film by [[Henryk Szaro]], [[screenplay]] by [[Wacław Gąsiorowski]] (1936);
* ''Pan Twardowski oder Der Polnische Faust'' [''Pan Twardowski or The Polish [[Faust]]''], a novel by [[Matthias Werner Kruse]] (1981);
* ''Dzieje Mistrza Twardowskiego'' [''The Story of Master Twardowski''], a film by [[Krzysztof Gradowski]] (1995).
* ''Legendy Polskie. TWARDOWSKY'' [''Polish Tales. TWARDOWSKY''], a short [[Science Fiction|sci-fi]] film directed by [[Tomasz Bagiński]] (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Tomasz Bagiński, 2015 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRdYz8cnOW4 Full movie on YouTube streaming service]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Hearts of Stone|Hearts of Stone]]'', an expansion to RPG game [[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]; has a main storyline heavily inspired by the legend (2015).

Pan Twardowski is also a popular character in the [[folk art]] of the Kraków region. He may be found, for example, in some of the famous Cracovian [[Nativity scene|cribs]] ([[szopka|szopki]]). He is typically depicted as a Polish noble either riding a [[rooster]] or standing on the Moon.

== Places associated with Pan Twardowski ==

[[File:Pan Twardowski 09 2009.jpg|thumb|210px|Pan Twardowski statue in Bydgoszcz]]

Pan Twardowski is said to have lived in or near [[Kraków]], the capital of Poland at the time. Different places in Kraków claim to be the exact location of Twardowski's house. The sorcerer might have lived either somewhere in the city center, near the [[Rynek Główny]] or [[Ulica Grodzka]], or across the River [[Vistula]] in the village of [[Krzemionki]] (now part of Kraków).

Across Poland, there are a number of inns and pubs called ''Rome'' ("Rzym"), all of which claim to be the one where Pan Twardowski met the devil. The oldest of these inns date back to only the late 17th century, about 100 years after Twardowski's time. The one in [[Sucha Beskidzka|Sucha]] is probably the best known of these inns.

In the [[sacristy]] of a church in [[Węgrów]], hangs a polished metal plate claimed to be the magic mirror which once belonged to Pan Twardowski.&lt;ref name="wegow"&gt;{{cite web |author = Jan Mielniczka |url = http://www.wegrow.com.pl/artykul/5135_90.html |title = Legendy o Węgrowie |work = www.wegrow.com.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = 2007-10-29 |accessdate = 2009-03-19 |language = pl |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006223204/http://www.wegrow.com.pl/artykul/5135_90.html |archivedate = 2008-10-06 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a legend, it was possible to see future events reflected in the mirror until it was broken in 1812 by Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoléon Bonaparte]] of [[France]] when he saw in it his future retreat from [[Russia]] and collapse of his empire.&lt;ref name="wegow" /&gt;

It is also said that Pan Twardowski spent some time in the city of [[Bydgoszcz]], where, in his memory, a figure was recently mounted in a window of a tenement, overseeing the Old Town. At 1:13 p.m. and 9:13 p.m. the window opens and Pan Twardowski appears, to the accompaniment of weird music and devilish laughter. He takes a bow, waves his hand, and then disappears. This little show gathers crowds of amused spectators.

The Ramanandi Sampradaya is one of the largest and most egalitarian Hindu sects India, around the [[Ganges Plain]], and Nepal today.{{sfn| Burghart |1983|p=362}} It mainly emphasizes the worship of [[Rama|Rāma]],{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}} as well as [[Vishnu]] directly and other incarnations.{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} While considered Vaiṣṇava, the Ramanandi are the largest ascetic group that celebrates the [[Maha Shivaratri|Śivarātri]] festival, which is dedicated to [[Shiva]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=255|quote=And finally, it must be noted that many groups that are considered {{IAST|Vaiṣṇava}} also worship {{IAST|Śiva}}. The largest ascetic groups that celebrate the Śivaratri festival with mortification of the flesh and pilgrimages are the {{IAST|Vaiṣṇava}} {{IAST|Rāmānandī}}s.}} {{IAST|Rāmānandī}} ascetics rely upon meditation and strict ascetic practices, but also believe that the grace of god is required for them to achieve liberation. For that reason, the {{IAST|Tyāga}} section of the {{IAST|Rāmānandī}} ascetics, unlike some {{IAST|Śaiva}} ascetics, do not cut the [[Upanayana|sacred thread]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=316|loc="Wear a Sacred Thread" is noted as a distinctive mark of {{IAST|Rāmānandī}} ascetics in Table 33, "Groups and Sects of Ascetics".}} Their reasoning for this is that only {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} or {{IAST|Rāma}} can grant liberation.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=256}}

Most Ramanandis consider themselves to be the followers of [[Ramananda]], a [[Vaishnava]] saint in medieval India.{{sfn|Raj|Harman|2007|p=165}} Philosophically, they are in the [[Vishishtadvaita]] ([[IAST]] {{IAST|Viśiṣṭādvaita}}) tradition.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}}

Its ascetic wing constitutes the largest Vaishnava [[Hindu monasticism|monastic order]] and may possibly be the largest monastic order in all of India.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia 1999}} There are two major subgroups of Ramanandi ascetics: the Tyagi, who use ash for initiation, and the Naga, who are the militant wing.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=316}}

== History ==
{{See also|Ramananda}}

''[[Bhaktamal]]'', a gigantic hagiographic work on Hindu saints and devotees written by Raghavadas in 1660,{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|p=95}} was a core text for all Vaishnavas including Ramanandis.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=55}} This text lists [[Ramanuja]], expounder of [[Vishishtadvaita]] school of Vedanta, and Ramananda as saints of the [[Sri Sampradaya|Ramanuja Sampradaya]] but Galta peeth of Ramanandi Vaishnavas have ruled out this by prohibiting Ramanuja Vaishnavas from taking Shahi snan in [[Kumbh Mela]].{{sfn|Callewaert|Snell|1994|p=97}} Many localized commentaries of ''Bhaktakamal'' were taught to young Vaishnavas across India. In the 19th century, proliferation of the printing press in the [[Gangetic plain]]s of North India allowed various commentaries of the text to be widely distributed. Of these, Bhagavan Prasad's ''Shri Bhaktamal: Tika, Tilak, aur Namvali Sahit'' was considered to be the most authoritative.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=55}} In this text, Bhagvan Prasad lists 108 prominent Vaishnavas starting with Ramanuja and ending with Ramananda.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=56}} Ramananda's guru Raghavananda is described as an egalitarian guru who taught students of all castes. Ramananda himself is described as an [[avatar]] of [[Rama]], a humble student with great yogic talents who was asked to form his own sampradaya as a punishment by his guru.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|pp=57–58}} The text located his birth in [[Prayag]] in c. 1300 CE.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=57}}

[[J.N. Farquhar]], a noted missionary and indologist, published his own work on the Ramanandi Sampradaya based on his interaction with various Ramanandis at the ''[[Kumbh Mela]]'' of 1918.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=60}} Farquhar credits Ramananda (c. 1400–1470 CE){{sfn|Farquhar|1920|p=323}} and his followers as the origin of the North Indian practice of using Ram to refer to the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].{{sfn|Farquhar|1920|pp=323–324}} Based on the textual evidence and similarity of sect marks between Ramanandis and Sri Vaishnavas, Farquhar concludes that Ramananda migrated to [[Benares]] from [[Tamil Nadu]]. He acknowledges that Ramananda accepted disciples from all castes and did not observe the restrictions in matters of food. However, Farquhar finds no evidence to show that Ramananda endeavoured to "overturn caste as a social institution".{{sfn|Farquhar|1920|pp=324–325}} On the other hand, Sita Ram, author of the ''Vaishnava history of Ayodhya'', and [[George Abraham Grierson|George Grierson]], eminent linguist and Indologist, represent Ramananda as saint who tried to transcend caste divisions of medieval India through the message of love and equality. The scholars also disagree on Ramananda's connection with Ramanuja. While Farquhar finds them completely unconnected, Sita Ram and Grierson place Ramananda within the Ramanuja tradition.{{sfn|Pinch|1996|p=61}}

Up to the nineteenth century, many of the trade routes in northern India were guarded by groups of warrior-ascetics, including the Nāgā sections of the Rāmānandīs, who were feared because of their strength and fearlessness.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=274}} The British took steps to disarm these militant groups of ascetics, but even today the sects still retain their heroic traditions.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=274}}

==Geography==
Ramanandi live chiefly in the northern part of India.{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} Ramanandi monasteries are found throughout western and central India, the Ganges basin, the Nepalese [[Terai]], and the Himalayan foothills.{{sfn| Burghart |1983|p=362}} Ramanandis are spread across [[India]], mainly in [[Gujarat]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]. The majority of Hindu immigrants to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] belonged to Vaishnava sects such as the Ramanandi. Hindus in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] currently practice based on the teachings of Ramananda.{{sfn|West|2001|p=743}}

==Saints==
Saints [[Dhanna Bhagat|Dhanna]] and [[Bhagat Pipa|Pipa]] were among the immediate disciples of Ramananda.{{sfn|Farquhar|1920|p=328}} Hymns written by them find mention in the [[Adi Granth]], holy scripture of the [[Sikhs]].{{sfn|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=5}} Sects founded by saints [[Raidas]], Sena and Maluk Das are also of a direct Ramanandi origin.{{sfn|Farquhar|1920|p=328}}

The poet-saint [[Tulsidas]], who composed the [[Ramcharitmanas]], was a member of this sect.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}}{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} His writings made [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]] devotees of each other and thereby bridged the gap between Vaishnavas and Shaivites. Because Tulsidas attempted to reconcile various theologies scholars like [[Ramchandra Shukla]] do not agree that he can considered to be a Ramanandi exclusively.{{sfn|Shukla|2002|p=44}}

Some sources say [[Jayadeva]], who composed the [[Gita Govinda]], was also a member of this sect.{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} Other sources classify Jayadeva simply as a Bengal Vaishnava.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}}

Some sources say that [[Kabir]] was a disciple of Ramananda.{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}} Other sources say that [[Ramananda]] was a student of [[Kabir]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=254}} Kabir also founded a separate sect that is now known as the [[Kabirpanthi]].{{sfn|Tattwananda|1984|p=10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1018">'''Resacralization''' is the return of [[religious]] meanings to public sectors of social life such as [[politics]], the [[arts]], and the [[human body|body]], and the resistance of [[secularization]]. This is consistent with Berger's (1967) definition of secularization as the removal of religious meanings from public life, or [[privatization]]. Another possible definition of resacralization would be the growing realization that the separation between public and private spheres is itself a cultural construction of modern [[society]].

In June 1950, he won the first [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] Chopin Award. He made his concert debut with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] performing Chopin’s [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|F Minor Concerto]] under [[George Schick]] in 1951. He was reengaged to perform [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Beethoven’s 4th]] the following season, and also made his New York [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] debut in 1952.&lt;ref name=ofc/&gt;

'''''Sarbloh Warriors''''' is a [[computer game]] in development by [[Taranjit Singh]], a [[Birmingham]]-based Sikh video game creator. It is touted as the first game [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] with the theme of [[Sikhism]]. Set during the 18th century, the game explores how the nascent Sikh community was suffering under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] imperial rule and religious intolerance, and how the Sikhs rebelled against the Mughal empire to secure a future for their faith.

It is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[first-person adventure|first person]] [[action-adventure game]], featuring a variety of characters, custom-designed levels, authentic [[India]]n and [[Persia]]n architecture, with period weaponry, costumes and armour.

In 2006, Singh complained that the game was unfairly stereotyped by the [[BBC]] as being [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]], stating that it was meant to educate the youth on the complicated history of Sikh-Muslim tension. This was eventually resolved and production was continued.

Due to the lack of public donations and some issues with funding, Sarbloh Warriors has been halted temporarily.

[[File:Sadirvan of the Süleymaniye Mosque.jpg|thumb|Shadırvan of the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]], [[Istanbul]]]]
'''Shadirvan''' ({{lang-tr|şadırvan}}, {{lang-ar|شاذروان}}) is a type of [[fountain]] that is usually built in the [[yard]] or entrance in front of [[mosque]]s, [[caravanserai]]s, [[khanqah]]s and [[madrasah]]s, with the main purpose of providing [[water]] for drinking or [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]] to several people at the same time, but also as decorative visual or sound element.

Shadirvan is [[Persia]]n in origin, and is a typical element of [[Ottoman architecture]]. Examples include [[Shadirvan square]] in [[Prizren]], and the [[Band-e Kaisar]] Shadervan Bridge in Iran.

'''Shaman''' ('''Dr. Michael Twoyoungmen''') is a [[fictional character]], [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a member of [[Alpha Flight]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Shaman was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in ''Uncanny [[X-Men]]'' in the 120th issue of the comic in April 1979.

==Fictional character biography==
Michael Twoyoungmen is from [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] and is a member of Canada's [[First Nations]] (specifically the [[Tsuu T'ina]]).

His grandfather, elderly and near death, asks him to become his mystical apprentice. Twoyoungmen, not believing in magic, refuses. At around the same time, his wife Kathryn Twoyoungmen becomes terminally ill. Twoyoungmen desperately seeks a cure but, despite promising his daughter Elizabeth he would find one, Kathryn dies; his grandfather passes away on the very same day.

Grief-stricken, Twoyoungmen secludes himself in a cabin in [[Banff National Park]], leaving Elizabeth to be raised by family friends the McNeils (whose daughter Heather will one day become Alpha Flight leader [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]]). Twoyoungmen's failure to save Kathryn kindles a deep-seated resentment and anger in Elizabeth. In his cabin, Twoyoungmen receives the skull of his grandfather and experiences a vision of the man. Twoyoungmen studies Sarcee magic, eventually becoming strong enough in his beliefs to draw mystical items from his enchanted medicine bag at will. He adopts the title and garb of a shaman.

Several years later, Shaman assists in the birth of [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]], the product of a mystical union between a human and the Inuit goddess Nelvanna. Shaman casts spells to bind Snowbird to the Earthly realm. He raises her and she ages rapidly, stabilizing several weeks later at an apparent physical age of someone in their 20s. Seeking superhuman agents to join [[Alpha Flight]], Heather and her husband James Hudson (aka Alpha Flight founder [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]]) visit Shaman and recruit both him and Snowbird.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

A few years after Shaman joins Alpha Flight, his daughter Elizabeth discovers a skull at an archeological site and experiences a vision of [[Ranaq the Devourer]], one of the [[Great Beasts]]. She summons her father— who she knows is Shaman despite his use of spells to conceal his identity—to examine the skull. The two then meet Lucas Strang and his great-granddaughter Emily. Emily is possessed by Ranaq and attempts to destroy Elizabeth, but instead activates her latent mystical powers, allowing Elizabeth to defeat the possessed woman. Shaman has Elizabeth reach into his medicine bag and withdraw the Coronet of Enchantment, a mystical circlet which she dons to become [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], a prophesied person of great mystical power. Shaman does not tell Talisman that the Coronet, once donned, cannot be removed without causing her intense agony. Shortly thereafter, Talisman is trapped in the pocket dimension contained within Shaman's medicine bag despite his promise that he will save her. Although she is later rescued by the [[Beyonder]], this newest failed promise turns her resentment of Shaman into hatred.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Shaman's failure to save his daughter leads to a crisis of faith and Shaman is unable to draw mystical items from his medicine bag. Shaman embarks on a vision quest and learns anew the secrets of mysticism from the spirit of his grandfather. Shaman gains the power to beseech nature spirits for aid, although he can not command them as Elizabeth does. He also receives a staff and an eagle helm, which can transform into a [[familiar spirit]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

When a pregnant Snowbird is about to give birth to her first child and the birth needs to happen at a place of power, Shaman beseeches the spirits to lead him to such a place. However, Talisman, corrupted by her power and fueled by her rage, compels the spirits to unknowingly lead Shaman and Alpha Flight to a place of evil instead. Snowbird's child is possessed by the spirit of a sailor who has lain under the [[permafrost]] for over a century. Calling himself [[Pestilence (comics)|Pestilence]], he battles Alpha Flight. Talisman plans to allow Pestilence to defeat Alpha Flight and then step in to defeat him, humiliating her father. However, Talisman is unable to defeat Pestilence as he is only partially of the spirit world, having been preserved in ice, and is thus outside the influence of her powers. As they fight, he tears the Coronet of Enchantment from her brow. Shocked back to her senses, Elizabeth is devastated over what she has done and apologizes to her father. Shaman, believing it is the only way to save Alpha Flight, dons the Coronet and takes on the mantle and powers of Talisman. Shaman, who grew cold and distant as Talisman just as Elizabeth had, eventually relinquishes the Coronet to Elizabeth and takes up his original medicine bag and powers again. He continues to work with Alpha Flight again under the name Shaman.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Much later, time-displaced versions of Alpha Flight are brought forward in time and remain in the present, assuming the mantle of Alpha Flight while the original Alpha Flight depart Earth to return a clutch of [[Marrina Smallwood|Plodex]] eggs to the Plodex homeworld.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Shaman, along with [[Major Mapleleaf]] II, both [[Puck (comics)|Pucks]], [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], and [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], is brutally attacked by [[Xorn|the Collective]]. Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States. Shaman is later confirmed dead by Sasquatch.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers #16''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]" storyline, Shaman (alongside Guardian, Vindicator, and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) is among the heroes who return from the dead after what happened to the death realms due to Amatusu-Mikaboshi's rampage through the Underworld. He ends up with a reunited Alpha Flight as they once again fight the Great Beasts.&lt;ref&gt;''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaman remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.&lt;ref&gt;''Chaos War #5''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
During his initial training with the spirit of his grandfather, Shaman underwent intensive physical and mental training and discipline.  He gained the understanding of the Sacree medicine men was able to concentrate to the point of not just thinking of objects, but feeling or knowing them in order to draw them out of his medicine pouch.  He was also able to run at full speed through the forest without disturbing the wildlife that lived there.

Shaman, as a fully trained doctor, also has knowledge of anatomy and intricate surgical and medical procedures.  Before his training as a mystic, he was referred to as the best surgeon in Canada. Due to his training, he recognized that his grandfather's skull had had the flesh boiled from it.

Shaman is a magic-wielder who carries a [[medicine bag]] which contains a pocket dimension known as the Void. He can summon all manner of physical and mystical objects and potions from the bag.

Following his vision quest, Shaman gains the power to beseech spirits to fulfill his requests. He cannot force the spirits to obey. In this incarnation, Shaman carries a "spirit staff," which glows when he summons the spirits. He wears an "eagle helm," which can transform into an eagle which serves as his [[familiar spirit]].

Shaman can levitate by manipulating ambient mystical energy, but cannot fly.

When Shaman takes on the role of [[Talisman (comics)|Talisman]], he acquires the power to command natural spirits to do his will. He can manipulate vast mystical energy for a wide variety of effects. He has since relinquished these powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">The '''Shrine Consolidation Policy''' ('''''Jinja seirei''''', also '''''Jinja gōshi''''', '''''Jinja gappei''''') was an effort by the [[Government of Meiji Japan]] to abolish numerous smaller [[Shinto]] [[Shinto shrine|shrines]] and consolidate their functions with larger regional shrines. In 1900, the Shrine Bureau (''Jinja kyoku'') was created as a branch of the Home Ministry, and it was this organ that was responsible for the implementation of the policy.&lt;ref name="kokugakuin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koremaru|first1=Sakamoto|title=Jinja gōshi|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1105|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the policy was to reduce the political influence of Shinto, bringing the remaining shrines under government jurisdiction and making them easier to control. Within the first twenty years of the policy, 77,899 Shinto shrines were closed, despite considerable local opposition.&lt;ref name="Picken2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart D. B.

The '''Temple of Kom Ombo''' is an unusual double [[Egyptian temple|temple]] in the town of [[Kom Ombo]] in [[Aswan Governorate]], [[Upper Egypt]]. It was constructed during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], 180–47 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, Discovering Ancient Egyptology, Facts on File, 1993. p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Some additions to it were later made during the Roman period. The building is unique because its 'double' design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods.&lt;ref name="david99"&gt;David, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god [[Sobek]], god of fertility and creator of the world with [[Hathor]] and [[Khonsu]].&lt;ref name="david99" /&gt; Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god [[Horus#Her-ur (Horus the Elder)|Haroeris]] ("Horus the Elder"), along "with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of [[Hathor]] or Tefnet/Tefnut&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)."&lt;ref name="david99" /&gt; The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.

The texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters invoked the gods of [[Kom Ombo]] and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple.&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Men in Egypt 3000 BCE to 395 CE&lt;/ref&gt; A temple was already built in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Little remains of the New Kingdom temple.&lt;ref&gt;Gods and Men in Egypt 3000 BCE to 395 CE&lt;/ref&gt; The existing temple was begun by [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]] (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], most notably [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator]] (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer [[hypostyle]]s. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and "probably represents a set of surgical instruments."&lt;ref name="david99" /&gt; 

Much of the temple has been destroyed by the [[Nile]], earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by [[Copts]] who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by [[Jacques de Morgan]] in 1893.&lt;ref name="david99" /&gt;

A few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/44/33460/Heritage/Museums/Crocodile-Museum-opens-in-Aswan.aspx|title=Crocodile Museum opens in Aswan - Museums - Heritage - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone [[sphinx]] statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm in width and 38cm in height, likely dates to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45546415|title=Archaeologists find sphinx at Egypt temple|date=2018-09-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reverend}}
'''The Right Reverend''' (abbreviations: The Rt Revd; The Rt Rev'd; The Rt Rev.) is a [[style (manner of address)|style]] applied to certain [[religion|religious]] figures.

*In the [[Anglican Communion]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crockford.org.uk/faq/how-to-address-the-clergy "How to address the clergy", ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' website.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman Catholicism in the United Kingdom|Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain]], it applies to [[bishop]]s, except that ''[[The Most Reverend]]'' is used for [[archbishop]]s (elsewhere, all [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] bishops are styled as ''The Most Reverend'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crockford.org.uk/standard.asp?id=116 |title=How to address the clergy |website=crockford.org.uk |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In some churches with a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] heritage, it applies to the current [[Moderator of the General Assembly]], such as
**the current [[Moderator of the United Church of Canada]]
**the current [[Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland]]
**the current [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].
**the current Moderator of the [[Presbyterian Church of East Africa]].
**the current Moderator of the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana]].
**the current Moderator of the Sutlej Reformed Church of Pakistan 

*In the Catholic Church, it applies to [[abbot]]s of [[monastery|monasteries]] in the [[Latin Church]] and [[archimandrite]]s in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. [[Monsignor]]s of the ranks of [[protonotary apostolic]] and domestic prelate were formerly styled ''The Right Reverend Monsignor'', but the currently correct style for them is ''The Reverend Monsignor''.
*In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, [[bishop]]s are styled "The Right Reverend" whether they are heads of dioceses or vicar bishops. The title is also used for archimandrite-level monastics and for some married priests holding the title of [[protopresbyter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goarch.org/-/forms-of-addresses-and-salutations-for-orthodox-clergy|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Methodism]], as in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican tradition]], the style is also applied to bishops of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]]. Other [[List of Christian denominations#Methodists|Methodist denominations]], including the [[United Methodist Church]], only use this to refer to [[District Superintendent (Methodism)|district superintendent]]s, not their bishops.

{{Theosophy}}
'''Theosophy''' is an [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] [[religion|religious]] movement established in the United States during the late nineteenth century. It was founded largely by the Russian émigrée [[Helena Blavatsky]] and draws its beliefs predominantly from Blavatsky's writings. Categorised by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] as part of the [[occultism|occultist]] current of Western esotericism, it draws upon both older European philosophies like [[Neoplatonism]] and Asian religions like [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

As taught by Blavatsky, Theosophy holds that there is an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]], who—although found across the world—are centered in [[Tibet]]. These Masters are believed to have cultivated great wisdom and supernatural powers, and Theosophists believe that it was they who initiated the modern Theosophical movement through disseminating their teachings via Blavatsky. They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found across the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing [[world religions]]. Theosophical groups nevertheless do not refer to their system as a "religion". Theosophy preaches the existence of a single, divine [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]].  It promotes an [[emanationism|emanationist]] cosmology in which the universe is perceived as outward reflections from this Absolute.  Theosophy teaches that the purpose of human life is spiritual emancipation and claims that the human soul undergoes [[reincarnation]] upon bodily death according to a process of [[karma]].  It promotes values of universal brotherhood and social improvement, although it does not stipulate particular ethical codes.

Theosophy was established in [[New York City]] in 1875 with the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]] by Blavatsky, [[Henry Olcott]], and [[William Quan Judge]].  Blavatsky and Olcott relocated to India, where they established the Society's headquarters at [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], [[Tamil Nadu]].  Blavatsky described her ideas in two books, ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''.  Blavatsky was repeatedly accused of fraudulently producing purportedly supernatural phenomena, often in connection with these "masters.". Following Blavatsky's death in 1891, there was a schism in the Society, with Judge leading the [[Theosophical Society in America]] to secede.  Under Judge's successor [[Katherine Tingley]], a Theosophical community named [[Lomaland]] was established in [[San Diego]].  The Adyar-based Society was later taken over by [[Annie Besant]], under whom it grew to its largest extent during the late 1920s, before going into decline. 

Theosophy played a significant role in bringing knowledge of South Asian religions to Western countries, as well as in encouraging cultural pride in various South Asian nations.  A variety of prominent artists and writers have also been influenced by Theosophical teachings.  Theosophy has an international following, and during the twentieth century had tens of thousands of adherents.  
Theosophical ideas have also exerted an influence on a wide range of other esoteric movements and philosophies, among them [[Anthroposophy]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and the [[New Age]].

==Definition==

Theosophy's founder, the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]], insisted that it was not a religion,{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=137}} although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past.{{sfn|Franklin|2018|p=193}} That Theosophy should not be labelled a religion is a claim that has been maintained by Theosophical organisations,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=196}} who instead regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science.{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=234}} As a result, Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances,{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=196|2a1=Dixon|2y=2001|2p=4}} resulting in Theosophists who also identify as Christians, Buddhists, or Hindus.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=4}}

Some scholars of religion who have studied Theosophy have characterised it as a religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=38, 72|2a1=Godwin|2y=1994b|2p=xix|3a1=Hammer|3a2=Rothstein|3y=2013|3p=2|4a1=Franklin|4y=2018|4p=192}} In his history of the Theosophical movement, Bruce F. Campbell noted that Theosophy promoted "a religious world-view" using "explicitly religious terms" and that its central tenets are not unequivocal fact, but rather rely on belief.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=72, 196}} [[Olav Hammer]] and Mikael Rothstein termed it "one of the modern world's most important religious traditions".{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=2}} Various scholars have pointed to its eclectic nature; [[Joscelyn Godwin]] described it as a "universally eclectic religious movement",{{sfn|Godwin|1994b|p=xix}} while scholar J. Jeffrey Franklin characterised Theosophy as a "hybrid religion" for its syncretic combination of elements from various other sources.{{sfn|Franklin|2018|pp=xiv, 192}}

Scholars have also classified Theosophy as a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|pp=130–31}}&lt;ref&gt;Olav Hammer (2000), ‘‘Claiming Knowledge’’,  Brill&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Lavoie,  ‘‘The Theosophical Society’’, BrownWalker Press, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lavoie|first1=Jeffrey D.|title=The History of a Spiritualist Movement|date=2012|publisher=Universal Publishers|isbn=9781612335537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell for instance referred to it as "an esoteric religious tradition",{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=38}} while the historian Joy Dixon called it an "esoteric religion".{{sfn|Dixon|2001|pp=3, 5}} More specifically, it is considered a form of occultism.{{sfn|Carlson|1993|p=3}} Along with other groups like the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the Theosophical Society has been seen as part of an "occult revival" that took place in Western countries during the late nineteenth century.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=8}} The historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] noted that Theosophy helped to establish the "essential foundations for much of twentieth-century esotericism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=131}}
Although Theosophy draws upon Indian religious beliefs, the sociologist of religion [[Christopher Partridge]] observed that "Theosophy is fundamentally Western. That is to say, Theosophy is not Eastern thought in the West, but Western thought with an Eastern flavour."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|pp=90–91}}

===Etymology===

[[File:Blavatsky and Olcott.jpg|thumb|right|Blavatsky and Olcott, two of the founding members of the Theosophical Society]]

At a meeting of the Miracle Club in [[New York City]] on 7 September 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Judge agreed to establish an organisation, with [[Charles Sotheran]] suggesting that they call it the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=27–28|2a1=Meade|2y=1980|2p=151|3a1=Washington|3y=1993|3pp=53–54|4a1=Goodrick-Clarke|4y=2004|4p=7|5a1=Lachman|5y=2012|5pp=130–31, 136}} Prior to adopting the name "Theosophical", they had debated various potential names, among them the Egyptological Society, the Hermetic Society, and the Rosicrucian Society.{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=232}} The term was not new, but had been previously used in various contexts by the [[Eirenaeus Philalethes|Philaletheian]]s and the [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Jakob Böhme]].{{sfnm|1a1=Washington|1y=1993|1p=55|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Lachman|3y=2012|3p=133}}
Etymologically, the term came from the Greek ''theos'' ("god(s)") and ''sophia'' ("wisdom"), thus meaning "god-wisdom", "divine wisdom", or "wisdom of God".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=24|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=132}} The term ''theosophia'' appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early [[church fathers]], as a synonym for [[theology]].{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=24}} In her book ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'', Blavatsky claimed that the term "Theosophy" had been coined by "the Alexandrian philosophers", especially [[Ammonius Saccas]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=325}}

That Blavatsky's Theosophy is not the only movement to use the term "theosophy" has resulted in scholarly attempts to differentiate the different currents.
Godwin drew a division by referring to Blavatskian Theosophy with a capital letter and older, Boehmian theosophy with a lower-case letter.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}} Alternately, the scholar of esotericism [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]] distinguished the Blavatskian movement from its older namesake by terming it "modern Theosophy".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=130}}
Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}} Causing some confusion, a few Theosophists — such as C. C. Massey — were also theosophers.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=xii}}
In the early years of Blavatsky's movement, some critics referred to it as "Neo-Theosophy" to differentiate it from the older Christian theosophy movement.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=77}} The term "[[Neo-Theosophy]]" would later be adopted within the modern Theosophical movement itself, where it was used—largely pejoratively—to describe the teachings promoted by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] by those who opposed their innovations.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=77}}

According to the scholar of religion James A. Santucci, discerning what the term "Theosophy" meant to the early Theosophists is "not as obvious as one might think".{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=233}} As used by Olcott, the term "Theosophy" appeared to be applied to an approach that emphasised experimentation as a means of learning about the "Unseen Universe"; conversely, Blavatsky used the term in reference to gnosis regarding said information.{{sfn|Santucci|2012|pp=233–234}}

==Beliefs and teachings==

Although the writings of prominent Theosophists lay out a set of teachings, the Theosophical Society itself states that it has no official beliefs with which all members must agree. It therefore has doctrine but does not present this as dogma.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=191|2a1=Dixon|2y=2001|2p=4}} The Society stated that the only tenet to which all members should subscribe was a commitment "to form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color".{{sfn|Dixon|2001|pp=3–4}} This means that there were members of the Theosophical Society who were sceptical about many, or even all, of the Theosophical doctrines, while remaining sympathetic to its basic aim of universal brotherhood.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=4}}

As noted by Santucci, Theosophy is "derived primarily from the writings" of Blavatsky,{{sfn|Santucci|2006|p=1114}} however revisions and innovations have also been produced by subsequent Theosophists like Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=191}} Blavatsky claimed that these Theosophical doctrines were not her own invention, but had been received from a brotherhood of secretive spiritual adepts whom she referred to as the "Masters" or "Mahatmas".{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=1}}

===The Masters===

{{double image|right|Koothoomi.jpg|142|Moryaportrait.jpg|140|Hermann Schmiechen's 1884 depiction of the two Masters whom Blavatsky claimed to be in contact with, Koot Humi (left) and Morya (right).}}

Central to Theosophical belief is the idea that a group of spiritual adepts known as the Masters not only exist but were responsible for the production of early Theosophical texts.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=61}} For most Theosophists, these Masters are deemed to be the real founders of the modern Theosophical movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}} In Theosophical literature, these Masters are also referred to as the Mahatmas, Adepts, Masters of Wisdom, Masters of Compassion, and Elder Brothers.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}} They are perceived to be a fraternity of human men who are highly evolved, both in terms of having an advanced moral development and intellectual attainment.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}} They are claimed to have achieved extra-long life spans,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}} and to have gained supernatural powers, including [[clairvoyance]] and the ability to instantly project their soul out of their body to any other location.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=54}} These are powers that they have allegedly attained through many years of training.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=54}} According to Blavatsky, by the late 19th century their chief residence was in the Himalayan kingdom of [[Tibet]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}} She also claimed that these Masters were the source of many of her published writings.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=53}}

The Masters are believed to preserve the world's ancient spiritual knowledge,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=54}} and to represent a Great White Brotherhood or White Lodge which watches over humanity and guides its evolution.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=54}}
Among those whom the early Theosophists claimed as Masters were Biblical figures like [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Solomon]], and [[Jesus]], Asian religious figures like [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Confucius]], and [[Laozi]], and modern individuals like [[Jakob Bohme]], [[Alessandro Cagliostro]], and [[Franz Mesmer]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=54}} However, the most prominent Masters to appear in Theosophical literature are [[Koot Hoomi]] (sometimes spelled Kuthumi) and Morya, with whom Blavatsky claimed to be in contact.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=55–56}} According to Theosophical belief, the Masters approach those deemed worthy to embark on an apprenticeship or ''chelaship''.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=55}} The apprentice would then undergo several years of probation, during which they must live a life of physical purity, remaining chaste, abstinent, and indifferent to physical luxury.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=55}} Blavatsky encouraged the production of images of the Masters.{{sfn|Introvigne|2018|p=206}} The most important portraits of the Masters to be produced were created in 1884 by [[Hermann Schmiechen]].{{sfn|Introvigne|2018|p=212}} According to scholar of religion [[Massimo Introvigne]], Schmiechen's images of Morya and Koot Humi gained "semi-canonical status" in the Theosophical community,{{sfn|Introvigne|2018|p=214}} being regarded as sacred objects rather than simply decorative images.{{sfn|Introvigne|2018|p=220}}

Campbell noted that for non-Theosophists, the claims regarding the existence of the Masters are among the weakest made by the movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=61}} Such claims are open to examination and potential refutation, with challenges to the existence of the Masters therefore undermining Theosophical beliefs.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=199}}
The idea of a brotherhood of secret adepts had a long pedigree stretching back several centuries before the foundation of Theosophy; such ideas can be found in the work of the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], and was popularised in the fictional literature of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=56}} The idea of having messages conveyed to a medium through by spiritually advanced entities had also been popularised at the time of Theosophy's foundation through the Spiritualist movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=56}}

===The ancient wisdom religion===

According to Blavatsky's teachings, many of the world's religions have their origins in a universal ancient religion, a "secret doctrine" that was known to [[Plato]] and early Hindu sages and which continues to underpin the centre of every religion.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=36}}
She promoted the idea that ancient societies exhibited a unity of science and religion that humanity has since lost, with their achievements and knowledge being far in excess of what modern scholars believe about them.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=37}} Blavatsky also taught that a secret brotherhood has conserved this ancient wisdom religion throughout the centuries, and that members of this fraternity hold the key to understanding miracles, the afterlife, and psychic phenomena, and that moreover these adepts themselves have paranormal powers.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=37–38}}

She stated that this ancient religion would be revived and spread throughout humanity in the future, replacing dominant world religions like [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=36}}
Theosophy tended to emphasise the importance of ancient texts over the popular ritual and custom found within various religious traditions.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=4}}
The Theosophical depiction of Buddhism and Hinduism however drew criticism both from practitioners of orthodox Buddhist and Hindu traditions, as well as from Western scholars of these traditions, such as [[Max Müller]], who believed that Theosophists like Blavatsky were misrepresenting the Asian traditions.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=4}}

===Theology and cosmology===

{{See also|Theosophy (Blavatskian) and Western philosophy}}
Theosophy promotes an [[emanationism|emanationist]] cosmology, promoting the belief that the universe is an outward reflection from the Absolute.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=62}}
Theosophy presents the idea that the world as humans perceive it is illusory, or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'',{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=47}} an idea that it draws from Asian religions.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=51}} Accordingly, Blavatsky taught that a life limited by the perception of this illusory world was ignorant and deluded.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}}

[[File:Montagem Sistema Solar.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|According to Theosophical teaching, each solar system is an emanation of a "Logos" or "Solar Deity", with planetary spirits each overseeing one of the planets.]]

According to Blavatsky's teaching, every [[solar system]] in the universe is the expression of what is termed a "Logos" or "Solar Deity".{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=63}} Ranked below this Solar Deity are seven ministers or planetary spirits, with each of these celestial beings being in control of evolution on a particular planet.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=63}}
In ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky stated that each planet had a sevenfold constitution, known as the "Planetary Chains"; these consist not only of a physical globe but also of two astral bodies, two mental bodies, and two spiritual bodies, all overlapping in the same space.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=43, 63}} According to Blavatsky, evolution occurs on descending and ascending arcs, from the first spiritual globe on to the first mental globe, then from the first astral globe to the first physical globe, and then on from there.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=43}}
She claimed that there were different levels of evolution, from mineral on to vegetable, animal, human, and then to superhuman or spiritual.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=43}} Different levels of evolution occur in a successive order on each planet; thus when mineral evolution ends on the first planet and it proceeds on to vegetable evolution, then mineral evolution begins on the second planet.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=43}}

Theosophy teaches that human evolution is tied in with this planetary and wider cosmic evolution.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=64}}
In ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky advocated the idea of seven "[[Root Race]]s", each of which was divided into seven Sub-Races.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=256}}
In Blavatsky's cosmogony, the first Root Race were created from pure spirit, and lived on a continent known as the "Imperishable Sacred Land".{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=255}} The second Root Race, known as the Hyperboreans, were also formed from pure spirit, and lived on a land near to the [[North Pole]], which then had a mild climate.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=255}} The third lived on the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], which Blavatsky alleged survives today as Australia and Rapa Nui.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=44|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2pp=255–256}} Blavatsky alleged that during the fourth Round of the Earth, higher beings descended to the planet, with the beginnings of human physical bodies developing, and the sexes separating.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} At this point, the fourth Root Race appeared, living on the continent of [[Atlantis]]; they had physical bodies but also psychic powers and advanced technology.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=44–45|2a1=Lachman|2y=2012|2p=256}} She claimed that some Atlanteans were giants, and built such ancient monuments as [[Stonehenge]] in southern England, and that they also mated with "she-animals", resulting in the creation of [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]].{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} The Atlanteans were decadent and abused their power and knowledge, so Atlantis sunk into the sea, although various Atlanteans escaped, and created new societies in Egypt and the Americas.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}

The fifth Root Race to emerge was the Aryans, and was found across the world at the time she was writing.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} She believed that the fifth Race would come to be replaced by the sixth, which would be heralded by the arrival of [[Maitreya]], a figure from Mahayana Buddhist mythology.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=223}} She further believed that humanity would eventually develop into the final, seventh Root Race.{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} At this, she stated that humanity will have reached the end of its evolutionary cycle and life will withdraw from the Earth.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=45}}
Lachman suggested that by reading Blavatsky's cosmogonical claims as a literal account of history, "we may be doing it a disservice."{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}} He instead suggested that it could be read as Blavatsky's attempt to formulate "a new myth for the modern age, or as a huge, fantastic science fiction story".{{sfn|Lachman|2012|p=256}}

====Maitreya and messianism====

Blavatsky taught that Lord Maitreya—a figure she borrowed from Buddhist mythology—would come to Earth as a messianic figure.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=85}} Her ideas on this were expanded upon by Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=85}} They claimed that Maitreya had previously incarnated onto the Earth as [[Krishna]], a figure from Hindu mythology.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=85}} They also claimed that he had entered [[Jesus of Nazareth]] at the time of [[Baptism of Jesus|the latter's baptism]], and that henceforth Maitreya would be known as "the Christ".{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=85}} Besant and Leadbeater claimed that Maitreya would again come to Earth by manifesting through an Indian boy named [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whom Leadbeater had encountered playing on a beach at Adyar in 1909.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=85}} The introduction of the Krishmanurti belief into Theosophy has been identified as a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] element.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=90}}

===Personal development and reincarnation===

[[File:The Theosophical Society (6708436163).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Blavatsky and Olcott at Adyar]]

According to Theosophy, the purpose of human life is the spiritual emancipation of the soul.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=68}} The human individual is described as an "Ego" or "Monad" and believed to have emanated from the Solar Deity, to whom it will also eventually return.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=64}} The human being is presented as composing of seven parts, while operating on three separate planes of being.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=66}} As presented by Sinnett and often repeated in Theosophical literature, these seven parts are the Body (''Rupa''), Vitality (''Prana-Jiva''), the Astral Body (''Linga Sarira''), the Animal Soul (''Kama-Rupa''), the Human Soul (''Manas''), the Spiritual Soul (''Buddhi''), and the Spirit (''Atma'').{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=64}} According to Theosophical teaching, it is the latter three of these components that are immortal, while the other aspects perish following bodily death.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=68}} Theosophy teaches that the Spiritual Soul and the Spirit do not reside within the human body alongside the other components, but that they are connected to it through the Human Soul.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=68}}

In ''The Voice of the Silence'', Blavatsky taught that within each individual human there is an eternal, divine facet, which she referred to as "the Master", the "uncreate", the "inner God", and the "higher self". She promoted the idea that uniting with this "higher self" results in wisdom.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}} In that same book, she compared the progress of the human soul to a transition through three halls; the first was that of ignorance, which is the state of the soul before it understands the need to unite with its higher self. The second is the Hall of Learning, in which the individual becomes aware of other facets of human life but is distracted by an interest in psychic powers. The third is the Hall of Wisdom, in which union with the higher self is made; this is then followed by the Vale of Bliss.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}} At this point the human soul can merge into the One.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=49}}

====Reincarnation and karma====

Throughout her writings, Blavatsky made a variety of statements about rebirth and the afterlife, and there is a discrepancy between her earlier and later teachings on the subject.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=66}} Between the 1870s and circa 1882, Blavatsky taught a doctrine called "metempsychosis".{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=66}}
In ''Isis Unveiled'', Blavatsky stated that on bodily death, the human soul progresses through more spiritual planes.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=38–39}} Two years later, she introduced the idea of [[reincarnation]] into Theosophical doctrine,{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=38–39|2a1=Santucci|2y=2012|2p=235}} using it to replace her metempsychosis doctrine.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=90}} In ''The Secret Doctrine'', she stated that the spirit was immortal and would repeatedly incarnate into a new, mortal soul and body on Earth.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=66}}
According to Theosophical teaching, human spirits will always be reborn into human bodies, and not into those of any other life forms.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=68}} Blavatsky stated that spirits would not be reborn until some time after bodily death, and never during the lifetime of the deceased's relatives.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=91}}

Blavatsky taught that on the death of the body, the astral body survives for a time in a state called [[kama-loka]], which she compared to [[limbo]], before also dying.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=71}} According to this belief, the human then moves into its mental body in a realm called [[devachan]], which she compared to [[Heaven]] or [[paradise]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=71}} Blavatsky taught that the soul remained in devachan for 1000 to 1500 years, although the Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] claimed that it was only 200.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=72}} 

Theosophy espouses the existence of [[karma]] as a system which regulates the cycle of reincarnation, ensuring that an individual's actions in one life affect the circumstances of their next one.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=69}} This belief therefore seeks to explain why misery and suffering exist in the world, attributing any misfortune that someone suffers as punishment for misdeeds that they perpetrated in a prior life.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=70, 71}} In Blavatsky's words, karma and reincarnation were "inextricably interwoven".{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=72}} However, she did not believe that karma had always been the system that governed reincarnation; she believed that it came into being when humans developed egos, and that one day will also no longer be required.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=72}}

Besant and Leadbeater claimed to be able to investigate people's past lives through reading the [[akashic record]], an etheric store of all the knowledge of the universe.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=80}} They for instance claimed to have attained knowledge of their own past lives as monkey-like creatures residing on the moon, where they served as pets to the "Moon-man" (a prior incarnation of the Master Morya), his wife (Koot Humi), and their child (the Lord Maitreya). When they were attacked by "savages" and animals "resembling furry lizards and crocodiles", Besant sacrificed herself to save Morya, and for that act made the karmic evolutionary leap to becoming a human in her next incarnation.{{sfn|Poller|2018|pp=80–81}}

===Morality and ethics===

Theosophy does not express any formal ethical teaching,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=74}} a situation that generated ambiguity.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=194}} However, it has expressed and promoted certain values, such as brotherhood and social improvement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=194}}
During its early years, the Theosophical Society promoted a puritanical attitude toward sexuality, for instance by encouraging [[chastity]] even within marriage.{{sfn|Godwin|1994|p=348}}

By 1911, the Theosophical Society was involved in projects connected to a range of [[progressivism|progressive]] political causes.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=5}} In England, there were strong links between Theosophy and [[first-wave feminism]].{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=5}} Based on a statistical analysis, Dixon noted that prominent English feminists of the period were several hundred times more likely to join the Theosophical Society than were the average member of the country's population.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=6}} Theosophical contingents took part in feminist marches of the period; for instance, a Theosophical group operating under the banner of [[Universal Co-Freemasonry]] marched as part of the [[Women's Coronation Procession]] in 1911.{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=5}}

===Ritual===

The Theosophical Society did not prescribe any specific [[ritual]]s for adherents to practice.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=196}} However, ritualised practices have been established by various Theosophical groups; one such group is the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=196}} Another are the meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophy, which have been characterised as having a "quasi-sacred and quasi-liturgical" character.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=196–197}} {{See also|Christianity and Theosophy#Theosophical Christianity}}

==Historical development==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The American social situation from which the Theosophical Society emerged was one of great upheaval, and the religious situation was one of challenge to orthodox Christianity. The forces that had surfaced in spiritualism included anticlericalism, anti-institutionalism, eclecticism, social liberalism, and belief in progress and individual effort. Occultism, mediated to America in the form of Mesmerism, Swedenborgianism, Freemasonry, and Rosicrucianism, was present. Recent developments in science led by the 1870s to renewed interest in reconciling science and religion. There was present also a hope that Asian religious ideas could be integrated into a grand religious synthesis.|source=— Bruce F. Campbell, 1980.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=20}} }}

The Theosophical Society was largely the creation of two individuals: Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=2}}
Established Christianity in the United States was experiencing challenges in the second half of the nineteenth century, a result of rapid urbanization and industrialization, high rates of immigration, and the growing understanding of [[evolutionary theory]] which challenged traditional Christian accounts of history.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=8}} Various new religious communities were established in different parts of the country, among them the [[Free Religious Association]], [[New Thought]], [[Christian Science]], and [[Spiritualism]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=8–9}} Theosophy would inherit the idea — then popular in the United States — that emphasized the idea of [[free will]] and the inevitability of [[Progress (history)|progress]], including on a spiritual level.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=18}} It was also influenced by a growing knowledge about Asian religions in the United States.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=19}}

Prior to her arrival in the United States, Blavatsky had experience with esoteric currents like Spiritualism.{{sfn|Santucci|2006|p=1115}}
It was through Spiritualism that Blavatsky and Olcott met.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=20}}

In 1884, Olcott established the first Scottish lodge, in Edinburgh.{{sfn|Shaw|2018|p=25}}

In 1980, Campbell noted that Theosophical books were selling at record levels.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=2}}

In the United States, Judge had been devoting himself to the promotion of Theosophy with little success.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=104}}

===Post-Blavatsky===

During her lifetime, Blavatsky had suggested to many different persons that they would be her successor.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=103}} Three of the most prominent candidates — Olcott, Judge, and Besant — all met in London shortly after to discuss the situation.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=104}} Judge claimed that he too was in contact with the Masters, and that they had provided him with a message instructing him to co-delegate the Society's Esoteric Section with Besant.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=104–105}} Olcott however suspected that the notes from the Masters which Judge was producing were forged, exacerbating tensions between them.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=105–106}} Besant attempted to act as a bridge between the two men, while Judge informed her that the Masters had revealed to him a plot that Olcott was orchestrating to kill her.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=106}} In 1893, Besant came down on Olcott's side in the argument and backed the internal proceedings that Olcott raised against Judge.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=107–108}} A two-stage enquiry took place, which concluded that because the Society took no official stance on whether the Masters existed or not, Judge could not be considered guilty of forgery and would be allowed to retain his position.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=108–109}} The details of this trial were leaked to the journalist [[F. Edmund Garrett]], who used them as the basis of his critical book, ''Isis Very Much Unveiled''.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=110}} Judge then announced that the Masters had informed him that he should take sole control of the Esoteric Section, deposing Besant; she rejected his claims.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=110–111}} Amid calls from Olcott that Judge should stand down, in April 1895 the American section voted to secede from the main Society. Judge remained its leader, but died within a year.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=111}}

[[File:Annie-Besant-J-Krishnamurti-Ernest-Wood.jpg|thumb|right|Besant with the child Krishnamurti]]

Olcott then sent Besant to the United States to gain support for the Adyar-based Society. In this she was successful, gaining thousands of new members and establishing many new branches.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=113–114}}
Besant had developed a friendship with the Theosophist [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and together they co-wrote a number of books.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=114–115}} Leadbeater was controversial, and concerns were raised when he was found to have instructed two boys in [[masturbation]]. The American Section of the Theosophical Society raised internal charges against him, although Besant came to his defence.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=115–116}} In a move probably designed to limit negative publicity for the Society, they accepted his resignation rather than expelling him.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=116}}

On Olcott's death in 1907, he had nominated Besant to be his successor, and she was then elected to the position with a large majority in June.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=117–118}} In her first years as the head of the Society, Besant oversaw a dramatic growth in its membership, raising it by 50%, to 23,000.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=119}} She also oversaw an expansion of the Adyar property, from 27 to 253 acres.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=119}} Besant was involved in various activist causes, promoting women's rights in India through the [[Women's Indian Association]] and helping to establish both the [[Central Hindu College]] and a Hindu girls' school.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=119}} Besant also began a campaign for Indian Home Rule, founding a group called the Home Rule League.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=122–123}} She established the ''New India'' newspaper, and after continuing to promote Indian independence in the paper's pages during the [[First World War]] she was interned for several months.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=123–124}} This helped to boost her status within the independence movement, and at the age of 70 she was appointed President of the [[Indian National Congress]], a largely honorary position.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=124}}

In December 1908, Leadbeater was readmitted to the Society; this generated a wave of resignations, with the [[Sydney]] branch seceding to form the Independent Theosophical Society.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=18}} Leadbeater travelled to Adyar, where he met a young boy living there, [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and pronounced him to be the next incarnation of a figure called the [[World Teacher]]. He subsequently took control of the boy's instruction for two years.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=119–120}} With Besant, Leadbeater established a group known as the [[Order of the Star in the East]] to promote the idea of Krishnamurti as World Teacher.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=121}} 
Leadbeater also wanted more ritual within Theosophy, and to achieve this he and [[J. I. Wedgwood]] became bishops in the [[Old Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=125–126}} They then split from that to form their own [[Liberal Catholic Church]], which was independent from the Theosophical Society (Adyar) while retaining an affiliation with it.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=126}} The Church drew most of its membership from the Society and heavily relied upon its resources.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=88}} However, in 1919 the Church was marred by police investigations into allegations that six of its priests had engaged in acts of [[paedophilia]] and Wedgewood — who was implicated in the allegations — resigned from the organisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=126|2a1=Poller|2y=2018|2pp=88–89}}

[[File:Akademie und Tempel.jpg|thumb|left|The Raja Yoga Academy and the Temple of Peace, c. 1915]]

In retaliation, a "Back to Blavatsky" movement emerged within the Society. Its members pejoratively referred to Besant and her followers as practitioners of "Neo-Theosophy", objecting to the Liberal Catholic Church's allegiance to the Pope, and to the prominence that they were according to Besant and Leadbeater's publications.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=126–127}} The main benefactor of the disquiet within the Back to Blavatsky movement was a rival group called the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=127}} One of the most prominent figures to switch allegiance was [[B. P. Wadia]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=143}}
The United Lodge of Theosophists had been established in [[Los Angeles]] in 1909, when it had split from Judge's Theosophical Society in America, seeking to minimise formal organisation.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=143}} It focused on publishing new editions of Blavatsky and Judge's writings, as well as other books, which were usually released anonymously so as to prevent any personality cults developing within the Theosophical movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=143–144}}

The Adyar Society membership later peaked at 40,000 in the late 1920s.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=128}}
The Order of the Star had 30,000 members at its height.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=128}}
Krishnamurti himself repudiated these claims, insisting that he was not the World Teacher, and then resigned from the Society; the effect on the society was dramatic, as it lost a third of its membership over the coming few years.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=128, 130}} Besant died in 1933, when the Society was taken over by [[George Arundale]], who led it until 1945; the group's activities were greatly curtailed by [[World War II]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=130}}

Judge left no clear successor as leader of the Theosophical Society in America, but the position was taken by [[Katherine Tingley]], who claimed that she remained in mediumistic contact with Judge's spirit.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=131, 133}} Kingley launched an international campaign to promote her Theosophical group, sending delegations to Europe, Egypt, and India. In the latter country they clashed with the Adyar-based Theosophical Society, and were unsuccessful in gaining converts.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=134}} Her leadership would be challenged by Ernest T. Hargrove in 1898, and when he failed he split to form [[Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove)|his own rival group]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=135}} In 1897, Tingley had established a Theosophical community, [[Lomaland]], at [[Point Loma]] in [[San Diego]], California.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=135–137}} Various Theosophical writers and artists congregated there,{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=138}} while horticultural development was also emphasised.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=138–139}}
In 1919, the community helped establish a Theosophical University.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=137}}
Longstanding financial problems coupled with an ageing population resulted in the Society selling Lomaland in 1942.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=140–141}} Meanwhile, Tingley's death in 1929 had resulted in the Theosophical Society in America being taken over by [[Gottfried de Purucker]], who promoted rapprochement with other Theosophical groups in what came to be known as the Fraternisation movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=141–142}}

==Demographics==

[[File:Theosophical Society.jpg|thumb|right|Theosophical Society lodge building in Reykjavík, Iceland]]

During its first century, Theosophy established itself as an international movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=147}}
Campbell believed that from its foundation until 1980, Theosophy had gained tens of thousands of adherents.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=175}} He noted that in that latter year, there were circa 35,000 members of the Adyar-based Theosophical Society (9000 of whom were in India), c.5,500 members of the Theosophical Society in America, c.1500 members of the Theosophical Society International (Pasadena), and about 1200 members of the United Lodge of Theosophy.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=177}} Membership of the Theosophical Society reached its highest peak in 1928, when it had 45,000 members.{{sfn|Poller|2018|p=86}}

Theosophical groups consist largely of individuals as opposed to family groups.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=45}} Campbell noted that these members were alienated in ways from conventional social roles and practices.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=45}}

As noted by Dixon, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Theosophical Society "appealed above all to an elite, educated, middle- and upper-middle-class constituency".{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=8}} It was, in her words, "a religion for the 'thinking classes'."{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=8}} Campbell stated that Theosophy attracted "unconventional, liberal-minded Westerners",{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=94}} and according to Dixon they were among those "who constituted themselves as the humanitarian conscience of the middle classes, a dissident minority who worked in a variety of parallel organizations to critique the dominant bourgeois values and culture."{{sfn|Dixon|2001|p=10}}

Campbell also noted that Theosophy appealed to educated Asians, and particularly Indians, because it identified Asia as being central to a universal ancient religion and allowed Asians to retain traditional religious beliefs and practices within a modern framework.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=62}}

==Reception and legacy==

Hammer and Rothstein believed that the formation and early history of the Theosophical Society was one of the "pivotal chapters of religious history in the West."{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=1}} The Theosophical Society had significant effects on religion, politics, culture, and society.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=1}}
In the Western world, it was a major force for the introduction of Asian religious ideas.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=1}} 
In 1980, Campbell described it as "probably the most important non-traditional or occult group in the last century",{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=1}} while in 2012 Santucci noted that it had had "a profound impact on the contemporary religious landscape".{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=240}}

[[File:Librería Sociedad Teosófica en Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|left|A Theosophical bookshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina]]

In approaching Asian religion with respect and treating its religious beliefs seriously, Blavatsky and Olcott influenced South Asian society.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=165}} In India, it played an important role in the Indian independence movement and in the Buddhist revival.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=1}} The Indian independence leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]] developed much of his interest in Hindu culture after being given a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' by two Theosophists.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=172}} Alongside her support for Indian home rule, Besant had also supported home rule for Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.{{sfn|Shaw|2018|p=36}} Campbell suggested that Theosophy could be seen as a "grandfather" movement to this 20th century growth in Asian spirituality.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=vii}}
Given the spread of such ideas in the West, some critics have perceived Theosophy's role as being largely obsolete.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=201}}

===Influence on the arts and culture===

Many important figures, in particular within the humanities and the arts, were involved in the Theosophical movement and influenced by its teachings.{{sfn|Santucci|2012|p=240}} Prominent scientists who had belonged to the Theosophical Society included the inventor [[Thomas Edison]], the biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], and the chemist [[William Crookes]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=165}}

Theosophy also exerted an influence on the arts.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=10}}
Theosophy was also an influence over a number of early pioneers of [[abstract art]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1p=169|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2013|2p=10}} The Russian [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] [[Wassily Kandinsky]] was very interested in Theosophy and Theosophical ideas about colour.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=169–170}} The Dutch abstract artist [[Piet Mondrian]] was also influenced by Theosophical symbolism.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=170–171}} 

Theosophical ideas were also an influence on the Irish literary movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, with writers like [[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Charles Johnston]], [[George William Russell|George Russell]], [[John Eglinton]], [[Charles Weeks]], and [[William Butler Yeats]] having an interest in the movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=165–169}}
The American adventure fiction writer [[Talbot Mundy]] included Theosophical themes in many of his works.{{sfn|Taves|1985|p=153}} He had abandoned his previous allegiance to [[Christian Science]] to join the Theosophical faction led by Tingley, joining the Society in 1923 and settling at the Point Loma community.{{sfn|Taves|1985|pp=157–159}}

===Influence on other religious and esoteric groups===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Bestsellers and television shows are devoted to Theosophical concepts such as reincarnation and spiritual evolution; the Internet overflows with references to Theosophical concepts such as the human aura (a Google search in May 2012 retrieved 47 million hits) and the ''chakras'' (12 million hits). Even truly mainstream media such as the National Geographic Channel present programs devoted to arch-Theosophical themes such as Atlantis, and the spiritual mysteries of Egypt. Terms and ideas created or mediated by spokespersons of the Theosophical Society have over time become household words, and the advent of Theosophy thus marked a fundamental change in the religious lives of countless individuals.|source=— Olav Hammer and Mikael Rothstein, 2013.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=2}} }}

The founders of many later new religious movements had been involved in Theosophy.{{sfn|Santucci|2012|pp=240–241}}
Many esoteric groups — such as Alice Bailey's [[Arcane School]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Anthroposophy]] — are "directly dependent" on Theosophy.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=1}} 
Although he had split from Theosophy when renouncing Leadbeater's claim that he was the World Teacher, Krishnamurti continued to exhibit Theosophical influences in his later teachings.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=148}} In 1923 a former Theosophist, the Anglo-American [[Alice Bailey]], established the [[Arcane School]], which also rested on claims regarding contact with the Ascended Masters.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=150–153}} 

Another former Theosophist, the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, split from the Theosophical Society over the claims about Krishnamurti and then established his own [[Anthroposophical Society]] in 1913, which promoted [[Anthroposophy]], a philosophy influenced by Theosophical ideas.{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=155–158|2a1=Poller|2y=2018|2p=86}} Despite his departure from the Theosophists, Rudolf Steiner nevertheless maintained a keen interest in Theosophy for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37618538/The_Library_of_Rudolf_Steiner_The_Books_in_English The Library of Rudolf Steiner: The Books in English], Journal of Social and Development Sciences. 9 (3): 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Theosophy entered the [[Völkisch movement]] of late 19th century Austria and Germany, it syncretised to form an eclectic occult movement known as [[Ariosophy]].{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=22}} The most prominent Ariosophist, the Austrian [[Guido von List]], was influenced by Theosophical ideas in creating his own occult system.{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=23}}

In the United States during the 1930s, the [["I AM" Activity|I AM]] group was established by [[Guy Ballard]] and Edna Ballard; the group adopted the idea of the Ascended Masters from Theosophy.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=1, 161–163}}
The idea of the Masters—and a belief in Morya and Kuthumi—have also been adopted into the belief system of the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]].{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=163}} The Canadian mystic [[Manly P. Hall]] also cited Blavatsky's writings as a key influence on his ideas.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|pp=163–165}} Theosophical ideas, including on the evolution of the Earth, influenced the teachings of British conspiracist [[David Icke]].{{sfn|Robertson|2016|pp=25, 133–134}}

Hammer and Rothstein stated that Theosophy came to heavily influence "popular religiosity" and by the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries was "permeating just about every nook and cranny of contemporary "folk" religious culture" in Western countries.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=2}} It was a major influence on the [[New Age]] milieu of the latter twentieth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Dixon|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2013|2p=4}} It played an important role in promoting belief in reincarnation among Westerners.{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=68}}

===Scholarly research===

{{See also|Theosophy (Blavatskian) and science}}
[[File:Theosophy Hall E72 jeh.JPG|thumb|right|Theosophy Hall in Manhattan, New York City]]

A considerable amount of literature has been produced on the subject of Theosophy and the Theosophical Society.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=17}} Most early publications on Theosophy fell into two camps: either [[apologetics|apologetic]] and highly defensive, or highly antagonistic and aggressive towards the movement.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=vii}} As of 2001, the scholar of religion [[Olav Hammer]] could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=18}} Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book ''Ocean of Theosophy'' and [[Robert Ellwood]]'s 1986 book ''Theosophy''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=18}} He noted that most of these works treated Theosophical doctrine as if it were a fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of how they have changed over the decades.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=18}} Many articles on the historical development of the movement have also appeared in the journal ''Theosophical History''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=18}}

Many early scholars of religion dismissed Theosophy as being not worthy of study; [[Mircea Eliade]] for instance described Theosophy as a "detestable 'spiritual' hybridism".{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=3}} The academic study of the Theosophical current developed at the intersection of two scholarly sub-fields: the study of new religious movements, which emerged in the 1970s, and the study of Western esotericism.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|pp=3–4}}
A significant proportion of the scholarship on Theosophy constitutes biographies of its leading members and discussions of events in the Society's history.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=17}} In contrast to the significant amount of research focused on the first two generations of Theosophists, little has been produced on later figures.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=3}} Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=19}} Hammer and Rothstein suggested that the "dearth of scholarly literature" on Theosophy was because "powerful individuals and institutions" in Europe and North America regarded the religion as "ludicrous", thus discouraging scholars from devoting their time to researching it.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2013|p=3}}

The '''Tomb of Yu Hong''' ({{lang-zh|t=虞弘墓|w=Yü2-Hung2-Mu4|p=Yú Hóng Mù}}) is the grave of Yu Hong and his wife, dating back to 592 AD ([[Sui dynasty]]). The tomb was discovered by some locals in 1999 in Wangguo village in [[Jinyuan district]] of the city of [[Taiyuan]], it was subsequently excavated officially in July of the same year. This tomb is so far the only archaeological find in the [[Zhongyuan|Central Plains]] region that reflects Central Asian ([[Western Regions]]) culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/e-kaogu/1999zhong/k-8.htm |title=The Yu Hong Tomb of the Sui in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1999 |website=china.org.cn |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb occupant ==
[[File:Rubbing of Yü Hung’s Epitaph.jpg|thumb|Rubbing of Yu Hong’s epitaph]]
The man buried in the tomb went by Yu Hong ({{lang-zh|t=虞弘|w=Yü2 Hung2|p=Yú Hóng}}; 533–592 AD), with Mopan ({{lang|zh-Hant|莫潘}}) as his [[courtesy name]], who was a Central Asian, probably of [[Persian people|Persian]] or [[Sogdia]]n origin, and practiced [[Zoroastrianism]]. He had settled in Early Middle Period China during the [[Northern Qi]], [[Northern Zhou]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasties. The [[epitaph]] found in the tomb records that he was a [[Nobility|noble]] of the city of {{transl|zh|Yü-ho-lin / Yuhelin|italic=no}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|尉紇驎}}) in the mysterious Yu country ({{lang|zh-Hant|魚國}}), assumably for which he is named,&lt;ref name=European-Man&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070524-china-dna_2.html |title=European Man Found in Ancient Chinese Tomb, Study Reveals |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |date=24 May 2007 |website=[[nationalgeographic.com]] |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the two [[Chinese characters|characters]] {{lang|zh-Hant|虞}} and {{lang|zh-Hant|魚}} are [[homophones]].

According to the epitaph, Yu Hong started his career in service of the nomadic tribe at the time, known as [[Rouran Khaganate|Ruru]]. At the age of 13, he was posted as an emissary to [[Sasanian Empire|Persia]] by the [[Khagan]] of Ruru, as well as [[Parthia]], [[Tuyuhun]] and [[Yuezhi]]. Later he went on a mission to the [[Northern Qi]], [[Northern Zhou]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasties. He served as {{transl|zh|chien-chiao sa-pao fu / jianjiao sabao fu}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|檢校薩保府}}, lit. “acting director of the office of Zoroastrian affairs”, or “Sogdian affairs”) during the Northern Zhou period. The term {{transl|zh|sa-pao / sabao}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|薩保}}) comes from the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] {{transl|sog|s′rtp′w}}, means a “[[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] leader”.

He had later served as a provincial governor in the Sui dynasty government, a chieftain of the Central Asian people who had settled in China during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecultureconcept.com/a-silk-road-saga-sarcophagus-of-yu-hong-art-gallery-nsw |title=A Silk Road Saga: Sarcophagus of Yu Hong – Art Gallery NSW |last=McDowall |first=Carolyn |date=12 August 2013 |website=thecultureconcept.com |publisher= |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://anthropology.net/2007/05/28/archaeological-evidence-supplemented-with-genetics-for-yu-hong/ |title=Archaeological evidence supplemented with genetics for Yu Hong |last=Kamrani |first=Kambiz |date=28 May 2007 |website=anthropology.net |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu Hong died at the age of 59 in 592 AD. His wife survived her husband by six years, she was buried in the same grave in 598 AD.&lt;ref name=European-Man /&gt;

A study on ancient DNA reveals that Yu Hong belonged to the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|haplogroup U5]], one of the oldest western Eurasian-specific haplogroups, while his wife can be classified as [[Haplogroup G (mtDNA)|haplogroup G]], the type prevalent in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17456455 |pmc=2169275|title=Evidence of ancient DNA reveals the first European lineage in Iron Age Central China|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=274|issue=1618|pages=1597–601|year=2007|last1=Xie|first1=C.

== Tomb ==
[[File:Rubbing of Yü Hung’s Epitaph Cover.jpg|thumb|Rubbing of Yu Hong’s epitaph cover, carved with nine characters in [[seal script]].]]
It is a single-chamber tomb of brick structure, composed of the tomb passageway, foyer, entrance and chamber. The entrance is almost entirely destroyed except for the lower part. Five octagonal marble pillars were found in the chamber, about 132 centimetres in height, two of which are intact, three are broken. Each one has a pillar foundation in the shape of an upturned lotus. A marble sarcophagus located in the centre of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Yu-Hong’s-Tomb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Chinese%20Archaeology/2/Ar_ch258.PDF |title=The Yu Hong’s Tomb of the Sui Dynasty in Taiyuan |last1=Zhang |first1=Qingjie |last2=Chang |first2=Hongxia |last3=Zhang |first3=Xingmin |last4=Li |first4=Aiguo |others=Xiong, Victor Cunrui |date=2001 |website=kaogu.cn |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the marble pillars and sarcophagus, the tomb has yielded human figurines in stone, horse figurines in pottery, white porcelain bowls, two epitaph covers and stones, et cetera, amounting to more than 80 pieces. The central part of the epitaph cover for Yu Hong is taken up by nine characters in relief in [[seal script]], it reads “Epitaph of Master Yu of the [[Sui dynasty|Great Sui]], formerly unequalled in Honour” ({{lang|zh-Hant|大隋故儀同虞公墓誌}}).&lt;ref name="Yu-Hong’s-Tomb" /&gt;

== Sarcophagus ==
The [[sarcophagus]] is made up of white marble, it assumes the appearance of a temple with the [[East Asian hip-and-gable roof|hip-and-gable roof]]. It is composed of three parts: the rectangular platform, walls in the middle section and the roof. The sarcophagus rested on a support platform, at each side of the platform there are two stone supports in the form of a lion’s head. The entire sarcophagus stands in 2.17 metres in height.

[[File:Painted Panel of the Sarcophagus of Yü Hung (detail 3).jpg|thumb|222px|Detail of the stone panel painting on the sarcophagus, depicting two [[nimbate]] male figures dressing in [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-style attire, drinking wine and playing [[pipa]].]]
[[File:Fire Altar Scene on the Sarcophagus of Yü Hung.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fire altar]] scene on the sarcophagus]]
It is covered with bas-reliefs and painted stone panels, comprising 54 scenes, featuring motifs of Central Asian or Persian origin, such as the costumes, vessels, musical instruments and dances. They depict banqueting, dancing, hunting, among others. As can be seen in the reliefs Yu Hong hunting with nomads on horses, camels, but also hunting on an Indian elephant. In addition, numerous [[Zoroastrian]] symbols are clearly displayed: the [[Atar|holy fire]] on a lotus, guarded by two priests half-bird, half-human wearing the traditional padam (a piece of cloth in front of the mouth),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/december/new_discoveries.htm |title=Sogdians in China: A Short History and Some New Discoveries |last=De la Vaissière |first=Étienne |website=silkroadfoundation.org |accessdate=18 July 2018 |author-link=Étienne de la Vaissière}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also including a portrayal of [[Mithra]] wearing a Sasanian crown, which decorated with the typical symbol of a solar disc resting on crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Sarah Stewart; Firoza Punthakey Mistree; Ursula Sims-Williams |date=18 December 2013 |title=The Everlasting Flame: Zoroastrianism in History and Imagination |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IUVTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=tomb+of+yu+hong+mithra#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20yu%20hong%20mithra&amp;f=false |page=23 |location=London |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9781780768090 |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures in these reliefs all have deep-set eyes and [[beak nose]].

[[File:ChosroesHuntingScene.JPG|thumb|Hunting scene on a gilded silver plate showing Sasanian emperor [[Khosrow I]], which shares similarities with the figures carved on Yu Hong’s sarcophagus: the sun disc and crescent moon symbol, streamers flying behind headdress, position of riding figures, et cetera.]]
The nine main bas-reliefs are the large-size pieces (panels) carved in marble and originally painted in gold (gilded), red and brown pigments, on the exterior of the front right and left walls, and on the interior of the right, rear and left walls. They can be divided into two groups: the first group consists of four pieces, which may depict some scenes from Yu Hong’s daily life; the rest may represent his [[afterlife]] in paradise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sohu.com/a/166030194_649680 |title=Silk Road and the Tomb of Yu Hong at Taiyuan |last=Zhang |first=Qingjie |date=20 August 2017 |website=sohu.com |language=zh |accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each panel is divided into a larger upper part and a smaller lower part.
* '''Panel 1''': the upper part features a man riding on a horse with another man leading the horse and two men standing behind. They all wear gowns with round collars and narrow sleeves, accompanied by two dogs and two birds. The larger bird has a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] that surrounds its head. The lower part features a galloping, winged [[Hippocampus (mythology)|merhorse]].
* '''Panel 2''': the upper part features a hexagonal platform with a balustrade, three men parellel to one another dancing in the balustrade. To the right of the platform are two men. The platform partially hides the man on the left from view, the man on the right is holding in his hands a large jar with legs similar to “wheel-o-feet”. A bird can be seen flying among the grapevines. The lower part features a fighting scene between a male lion and a merhorse.
* '''Panel 3''': the upper part features a man with a halo on camel-back killing a lion. The lower part features another haloed man sitting on a [[cushion]] with a floral border, his right hand guilding a horned vessel to his mouth.
* '''Panel 4''': the upper part features a scene of lion hunting on camel-back. The rider is turning his head back to look down on a male lion behind which he is about to kill. The lower part features an [[antelope]] racing through meadows.
[[File:Panel 5 of the Sarcophagus of Yü Hung.jpg|thumb|Line drawing copy of the panel 5]]
* '''Panel 5''': This piece is in the middle section of the rear wall, facing the gate of the sarcophagus. It is the largest among the nine panels with the most complex scene. The upper part features a rear half of a large felt tent, inside the tent there is a stone bed on which are sitting a man on the left and a woman on the right. The man with deep-set eyes, beak nose and thick beard, wearing a headdress with the symbol of a sun disc resting on crescent moon on the top and streamers flying behind, which is quite similar to the Sasanian crown. He is holding a bowl at chest height with his right hand and looking at the woman. The woman is in a cross-legged sitting position, facing the man. She wears a [[coronet]] and holding a long stem goblet in her right hand. There are two male attendants behind the man and two female ones behind the woman. In front, there is a spacious clearing, on the right and left sides of which are six male musicians in a half-kneeling position. A man dancing the {{transl|zh|Hu-tʻêng / [[Huteng]]}} dance ({{lang|zh-Hant|胡騰舞}}) at the centre, which is a type of dance originally from the [[Western Regions]], characterised by leaps and back flips. It was considered an exotic performance form together with the {{ill|Sogdian whirl|zh|胡旋舞}} at the time. The lower part is a fighting scene between two men and two lions. This relief has long been considered depicting Yu Hong and his wife enjoying a banquet, Bi Bo, an [[associate professor]] of the School of Chinese Classics at Renmin University of China, however, argues that the female figure is not Yu Hong’s wife but rather a representation of [[Daēnā]], a Zoroastrian divinity.

* '''Panel 6''': the upper part features a man killing a lion on elephant back. The lower part is a large bird (probably a dove?) with a silk ribbon tied around its neck and holding a stylised cloud in its beak.
* '''Panel 7''': the upper part features three haloed men (one of them is riding a horse) taking a rest on their journey. The man on horseback wears a bejewelled crown, he is rising a cup in his left hand. The two attendants are standing in front and behind the horse, the one in front is offering a plate of fruits to the master. The lower part features a white goat.

Two attendants are in front of the master, one is offering a plate of fruits, the other is playing [[pipa]]. The lower part features a running white [[reindeer]].
* '''Panel 9''': the upper part features a rider wearing a Persian crown decorated with the typical symbol of a sun disc resting on crescent moon, a necklace, a gown with round collar and tight sleeves. On his feet is a pair of white boots. An attendant stands behind the rider’s horse, holding a canopy (similar to a [[umbraculum]] or a [[baldachin]], but smaller). In front of the horse is a man carrying a plate of fruit. The lower part features a fighting scene between a bull and a lion. The rider depicted in this panel is possibly a representation of [[Mithra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-2-iconography-in-iran-and-central-asia |title=Mithra, Iconography in Iran and Central Asia |last=Grenet |first=Franz |date=13 January 2006 |website=[[Encyclopædia Iranica|iranicaonline.org]] |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4985">The '''[[UNESCO]] Confucius Prize for Literacy''' recognizes the activities of outstanding individuals, governments or governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations ([[NGOs]]) working in [[literacy]] serving rural adults and out-of-school youth, particularly women and girls. The Prize  was established in 2005 through the support of the Government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in honour of the great Chinese scholar [[Confucius]]. It is part of the International Literacy Prizes, which UNESCO awards every year in recognition of excellence and inspiring experiences in the field of literacy throughout the world. The Confucius Prize offers two awards of US$20,000 each, a medal and a diploma, as well as a study visit to literacy project sites in China.

The Prize is open to institutions, organizations or individuals displaying outstanding merit in literacy, achieving particularly effective results and promoting innovative approaches. The selection of prizewinners is made by an International Jury appointed by UNESCO’s Director-General, which meets in Paris once a year. The Prize is awarded at an official ceremony held for that purpose at [[UNESCO]] Headquarters in [[Paris]] on the occasion of [[International Literacy Day]] (8 September).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1073">'''Vaiṣṇava Carana dāsa''' was a [[Vaishnava]] guru. A [[Vaidya]] by caste, his real name was '''Gokulananda Sen'''. His Sripata was located at Tena Vaidyapura about six miles from the [[Jhamatpura]] subdivision of [[Katwa]].  He compiled the [[Padakalpataru]] in 1718-1723 AD. He also wrote the preface for the [[Mahā-vandanā]].

He was the disciple of [[Radhamohana Thakura]], a descendant of [[Srinivasa Acarya]]. His own disciples included [[Krishna das Babaji]]. He was an accomplished musician and popularized the tradition known as "Tenar chap" or "Dhap".
 
He was the friend of a Vaisnava poet named Uddhava dasa (Krsnakanta Majumdar).  Vaisnava dasa was present at the debate held in Bengal in 1708 AD (1115) wherein the superiority of svakiya or parakiya was discussed.

No direct accounts survive, but reconstructions speculate that he may directly continue aspects of the [[Proto-Indo-European pantheon]].

==Sources==
Veles is one of few Slavic gods for which evidence of offerings can be found in all [[Slavic nations]]. The ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', a historical record of the early [[Kyivan Rus]], is the earliest and most important record, mentioning a god named Volos several times. Many etymologists, however, suppose them two different gods.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Here, Volos is mentioned as god of cattle and peasants, who will punish oath-breakers with diseases, the opposite of Perun who is described as a ruling god of war who punishes by death in battle. In the later half of the 10th century, Veles or Volos was one of seven gods whose statues [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Volodymyr I, Prince of Kyiv]] had erected in his city. It is very interesting that Veles's statue apparently did not stand next to others, on the hill where the prince's castle was, but lower in the city, on the marketplace. Not only does this indicate that Veles was connected with commerce, but it also shows that worship of Perun and Veles had to be kept separate: while it was proper for Perun's shrines to be built high, on the top of the hill, Veles's place was down, in the lowlands.

A similar pattern can be observed among the [[South Slavs]]. Here the name of Veles appears only in [[toponyms]], the best-known of which is the city of [[Veles (city)|Veles]] in [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], over which looms a hill of St. [[Elijah|Elias]] the Thunderer. Also, in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a part of [[Sarajevo]] is called Velešići&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosarajevo.ba/stream/article.php?pid%3D118 |accessdate=September 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308193444/http://www.novosarajevo.ba/stream/article.php?pid=118 |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |title=OPIS LOKACIJE MZ UNUTAR OPĆINE }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a mountain Velež&lt;ref&gt;[[Velež (Bosnia and Herzegovina)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} near Mostar, Herzegovina. Other examples are Veles in Western Serbia, Velesnica on the Danube and Velestovo in Montenegro and also the township of Velestino (Βελεστίνο, today Φέρες), apparently bearing testimony to a Slavic layer in the settlement of Thessaly. Another debatable if not improbable example&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp|178}}  is the town of [[Volosko]] in [[Croatia]], situated on the seashore under the peak of Mount [[Učka]], [[nicknamed]] Perun.

Among [[Western Slavs]], the name can be principally found in 15th and 16th century [[Czech Republic|Czech]] records, where it means either [[dragon]] or [[devil]].

==Etymology==

Presumably it is not possible to conclusively determine a definite etymology for the name of the god Veles, though there are several [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] roots that are all closely related to the nature of Veles and his domains.

One possibility is that the name derives from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*wel-'', meaning wool.&lt;ref name="Belaj"&gt;Vitomir Belaj "Hod kroz godinu, mitska pozadina hrvatskih narodnih vjerovanja i obicaja", Golden Marketing, Zagreb 1998., {{ISBN|953-6168-43-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems plausible, since in Slavic cosmology Veles in serpentine form is lying in a nest of black wool in the roots of the Tree of the World&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp |136,154}} and Veles is the shepherd of the dead. ''Volos'' is also the Russian and Ukrainian word for "hair" and Veles is hairy in his beastly form (bear, wolf).

The Proto-Indo-European root ''*welg-'' also means humid, wet. Nothing is more connected with Veles than humidity and wetness. His domain is down, 'у воду пот корч пот колоду' (in the water, below the tree stub and the log). That is where Veles is in his place.

There is also the Indo-European word ''*woltus'' meaning meadow which is derived from the same root. And Veles is the shepherd of the dead who was imagined to browse the deceased on green lush meadows in the underworld.&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp |171}}&lt;ref name=Ivanov_Toporov1973&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Ivanov]] |first1=Vyacheslav | last2=[[Vladimir Toporov|Toporov]] | first2=Vladimir |title=A comparative study of the group of Baltic mythological terms from the root *vel- |year=1973 | publisher=baltistica T.9 Nr.(1) |url=http://www.baltistica.lt/index.php/baltistica/article/view/1802 |ref=Ivanov_Toporov1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And finally the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] (Ἠλύσιον πεδίον or Ἠλύσιος λειμών) where "Ἠλύσιος" is etymologically related to the name Veles and in Greek "λειμών" is a low wet place, a meadow, a pasture.&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp |p252-253}}

The name may also be related to Slavic terminology for oxen, for which the South Slavs, Russians, and Poles use "вол/vol/wół".{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2010}} Volos can also be a derivation from the same root by Eastern Slavic phonetic laws, now considered the most probable explanation for this phonetic form.&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp |171}}

It is probably the same as [[Vala (Vedic)|Vala]], the enemy of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] thunder-god [[Indra]], and to Velns ([[latvian mythology|Latvian]]) or Vėlinas ([[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]]), a devil of [[Baltic mythology]] and enemy of the Baltic thunder-god [[Perkūnas]] (cf. Slavic ''Perun''), as well as Nordic ''Vǫlsi'' "[[Priapus]]". {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Another parallel to Norse mythology is that a Völva, or Vala, was a seeress who was connected with water and foretelling, called 'Völuspa' (that is, Völva+Spake/Speech). In Norse myth, making Völuspas was connected to spinning/braiding the Thread of Fate for the one whose future had been foreseen. Völva is cognate to 'Wheel/Spinning Wheel'. All also traits of the goddess [[Mokosh]]/Vela{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Enemy of Perun and storm myth==
The Russian [[philology|philologists]] [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] and [[Vladimir Toporov]] reconstructed the mythical battle of Perun and Veles through comparative study of various Indo-European mythologies and a large number of Slavic folk stories and songs. A unifying characteristic of all Indo-European mythologies is a story about a battle between a god of thunder and a [[Zmey|huge serpent or a dragon]]. In the Slavic version of the myth, Perun is a god of thunder, while Veles acts as a dragon who opposes him, consistent with the [[Völva|Vala]] etymology; He is also similar to the Etruscan Underworld-monster [[Vetha]] and to the dragon [[Illuyankas]], enemy of the [[Tarhunt|storm god]] of [[Hittites|Hittite]] mythology.

The reason for the enmity between the two gods is Veles's theft of Perun's son, wife or, usually, cattle. It is also an act of challenge: Veles, in the form of a huge serpent, slithers from the caves of the Underworld and coils upwards the Slavic world tree towards Perun's heavenly domain. Perun retaliates and attacks Veles with his lightning bolts. Veles flees, hiding or transforming himself into trees, animals or people. In the end he is killed by Perun, and in this ritual death, whatever Veles stole is released from his battered body in the form of rain falling from the skies. This 'storm myth', or 'divine battle', as it is generally called by scholars today, explained to ancient Slavs the changing of seasons through the year. The dry periods were interpreted as chaotic results of Veles's thievery. Storms and lightning were seen as divine battles. The ensuing rain was the triumph of Perun over Veles and the re-establishment of world order. On a deeper level, as has been said above, Perun's place is up, high and dry and Veles' down, low and wet. By climbing up into the sphere of Perun, Veles disrupts the equilibrium of the world and needs to be put in his place. Perun does this in a fierce battle by smiting him with his lightning and drives him down into the water under the tree stub and the log, and by putting him back in his place he restores order. Then they stop being adversaries and remain just opponents until the next time Veles tries to crawl up into Perun's realm.

The myth was cyclical, repeating itself each year. The death of Veles was never permanent; he would reform himself as a serpent who would shed its old skin and would be reborn in a new body. Although in this particular myth he plays a negative role as bringer of chaos, Veles was not seen as an evil god by ancient Slavs. In fact, in many of the Russian folk tales, Veles, appearing under the Christian guise of [[St. Nicholas]], saves the poor farmer and his cattle from the furious and destructive [[Elias|St. Elias]] the Thunderer, who, of course, represents the old Perun.{{efn |On rudiments of pagan cults in Slavic [[folk Christianity]] see: {{harv |Успенский |1982 |ref=uspensky1982}}}}
The duality and conflict of Perun and Veles does not represent the dualistic clash of good and evil; rather, it is the opposition of the natural principles of earth, water and substance (Veles) against heaven, fire and spirit (Perun).

The Ivanov/Toporov conception of "the key myth" of Slavic mythology has been criticized by several authors, including [[Leo Klejn]]&lt;ref&gt;Клейн Л. С. Воскрешение Перуна. К реконструкции восточнославянского язычества. — Saint Petersburg: Евразия, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Igor M. Diakonoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Дьяконов И. М. Архаические мифы Востока и Запада. Nauka, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Many, including Klejn, pointed out that Ivanov and Toporov often tended to unjustified generalizations and considered many of their arguments "far-fetched". Supporters of the theory, on the other hand, include [[Boris Uspensky]], T. Sudnik and T. Tsivyan, and others.

==God of magic and musicians==
According to Ivanov and Toporov, Veles's portrayal as having a penchant for mischief is evident both from his role in Storm myth and in carnival customs of Koledari shamans. In his role as a [[trickster]] god, he is in some ways similar to both Greek [[Hermes]] and Scandinavian [[Loki]], and like them, he was connected with magic. The word [[Volhv|''volhov'']], obviously derived from his name, in some Slavic languages still means sorcerer, while in the 12th century Ruthenian epic [[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]], character of Boyan the wizard is called Veles's grandson. Since magic was and is closely linked to music in many societies, particularly earlier ones, Veles was also believed to be protector of travelling musicians. For instance, in some wedding ceremonies of northern [[Croatia]] (which continued up to the 20th century), the music would not start playing unless the bridegroom, when making a toast, spilled some of the wine on the ground, preferably over the roots of the nearest tree. The symbolism of this is clear, even though forgotten long ago by those still performing it: the musicians will not sing until a toast is made to their patron deity.&lt;ref name="Belaj"/&gt;

==Post-Christian Veles==
After the advent of Christianity, Veles was split into several different characters. As a god of the Underworld and dragons, he, of course, became identified with the [[Devil]]. His more benevolent sides were transformed to several Christian saints. As a protector of cattle, he became associated with [[Saint Blaise]], popularly known among various Slavic nations as St. Vlaho, St. Blaz, or St. Vlasiy. In [[Yaroslavl]], for example, the first church built on the site of Veles's pagan shrine was dedicated to St Blaise, for the latter's name was similar to Veles and he was likewise considered a heavenly patron of shepherds.&lt;ref name="Rybakov"&gt;[[Boris Rybakov]]. ''Ancient Slavic Paganism''. Moscow, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned already, in many Eastern Slavic folk tales, he was replaced by [[St. Nicholas]], probably because the popular stories of the saint describe him as a giver of wealth and a sort of a trickster.

The '''''Zand-i Wahman Yasn''''' is a medieval [[Zoroastrian]] apocalyptical text in [[Middle Persian]]. It professes to be a prophetical work, in which [[Ahura Mazda]] gives [[Zoroaster]] an account of what was to happen to the ''behdin'' (those of the "good religion", i.e. the Zoroastrians) and their religion in the future. The oldest surviving manuscript (K20, in Copenhagen) is from about 1400, but the text itself is older, written and edited over the course of several generations.

The work is also known as the ''Bahman Yasht'' and ''Zand-i wahman yasht''. These titles are scholastic mistakes,&lt;ref name="EIr" /&gt; in the former case due to 18th century [[Anquetil Du Perron]], and the latter due to 19th century [[Edward William West]]. The text is neither a [[Yasht]], nor is it in any way related to the [[Avesta]]'s (lost) ''Bahman Yasht'' (see note [[#darmesteter|below]]). Chapter and line pointers to the ''Zand-i Wahman Yasn'' are conventionally abbreviated ''ZWY'', and follow the subdivisions defined in the 1957 Anklesaria translation. These subdivisions differ from those used in earlier translations.

The text survives in two versions: a Middle Persian version in [[Pahlavi script]], and in a [[Pazand]] transliteration with commentary in [[Avestan script]]. From the scholastic point of view, the work is enormously interesting for the study of religion. While the text is superficially an Iranian one, there is some question whether some of the details are Iranian adaptions from alien sources. Arguments for both an indigenous origin (with loaning to Judeo-Christian tradition), and vice versa (borrowing from Semitic and Hellenistic sources) have been put forward. A connection to the Hellenistic ''[[Oracles of Hystaspes]]'' is generally acknowledged. That text, unlike most works attributed to [[Pseudepigrapha|Pseudo-Zoroastrian authors]], was apparently based on genuine Zoroastrian traditions.

Structurally, the ''Zand-i Wahman Yasn'' is laid out as a conversation between Zoroaster and Ahura Mazda, in which the latter gives his prophet the ability to see into the future. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 introduce a millennial scheme with seven periods. The first three periods represent the ages up and including the "millennium of Zoroaster". The last four periods, which account for what will occur thereafter, are analogized as a tree with four branches, one each of gold, silver, steel, and impure iron. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 prophesy the calamities that will occur when the "enemies of the good religion" (see [[Aniran]]) conquer Iran at the end of the "tenth millennium", causing a debasement of moral, social, religious order (see [[Asha]], "order"). Chapters 7, 8 and 9 prophesy the events of the last 3,000 years of the world, beginning with the eleventh millennium, and in which the arrival of each of the three ''[[saoshyant]]''s are foretold. The text prophecies the end of the world as a great conflagration in which the world is destroyed/purified by fire, with Ahura Mazda's eventual triumph, after which the dead righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') are resurrected to eternal perfection and reunification with God, and time ends.

{{anchor|darmesteter}}In the 19th century, [[James Darmesteter]] surmised that the ''Zand-i Wahman Yasn'' represented a translation of parts of the Avesta's lost ''Bahman Yasht''. This notion is no longer followed today; modern scholarship is in agreement that the 6th century work has "nothing in common"&lt;ref name="EIr"&gt;{{citation|last=Sundermann|first=Werner|chapter=Bahman Yašt|pages=492–493|volume=III|year=1989|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda Press|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahman-yast-middle-persian-apocalyptical-text}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with what is actually known of the genuine Avestan Bahman yasht texts. The [[Amesha Spenta]] Bahman/Wahman (Av: [[Vohu Manah]]) does not even appear in the text. That the basic "plot" draws on Avestan material, and that the work mimics the style of the Avesta's authors, are generally acknowledged.
