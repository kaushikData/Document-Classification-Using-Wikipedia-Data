      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2449">In [[mathematics]], the '''Ahlfors conjecture''', now a theorem, states that the [[limit set]] of a finitely-generated [[Kleinian group]] is either the whole [[Riemann sphere]], or has measure 0. 

The conjecture was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Ahlfors|authorlink=Lars Ahlfors|year=1966}}, who proved it in the case that the Kleinian group has a [[fundamental domain]] with a finite number of sides. {{harvtxt|Canary|1993}} proved the Ahlfors conjecture for topologically tame groups, by showing that a topologically tame Kleinian group is geometrically tame,  so the Ahlfors conjecture follows from Marden's [[tameness conjecture]] that [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s with finitely generated fundamental groups are topologically tame (homeomorphic to the interior of compact 3-manifolds). This latter conjecture was proved, independently, by {{harvtxt|Agol|2004}} and by {{harvtxt|Calegari|Gabai|2006}}.

{{harvtxt|Canary|1993}} also showed that in the case when the limit set is the whole sphere, the action of the Kleinian group on the limit set is ergodic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6643">The '''Analytical Society''' was a group of individuals in early-19th-century [[United Kingdom|Britain]] whose aim was to promote the use of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]ian notation for [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] in [[calculus]] as opposed to the [[Newton notation for differentiation]].&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;[[Carl B. Boyer]] (1989) ''A History of Mathematics'', 2nd edition, page 592, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] {{ISBN|0-471-09763-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dubbey&gt;J. M. Dubbey (1963) "The Introduction of Differential Notation into Great Britain", [[Annals of Science]] 19: 35–48&lt;/ref&gt; The latter system came into being in the 18th century as a convention of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], and was in use throughout Great Britain. According to a mathematical historian:&lt;ref name=Becher&gt;Harvey W. Becher (1980) "Woodhouse, Babbage, Peacock and Modern Algebra", [[Historia Mathematica]] 7(4): 389–400&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|394}}
:In 1800, English mathematics was trapped in the doldrums of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxional notation]] and of an intuitive geometric-physical approach to mathematics designed to prepare the student for reading Newton's ''Principia''...The study of any mathematics not pertinent to the traditional questions of [[Mathematical Tripos|Tripos]] was not only ignored, but actually discouraged. Cambridge was isolated, and its students remained ignorant of continental developments.

The Society was first envisioned by [[Charles Babbage]] as a [[parody]] on the debate of whether Bible texts should be annotated, with Babbage having the notion that his textbook by [[Sylvestre Lacroix]] was without need for interpretation once translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Babbage]] (1864) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T0AAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 Passages from the Life of a Philosopher], page 28, link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Its membership originally consisted of a group of [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] students led by Babbage and including [[Edward Bromhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=37224|title=Bromhead, Sir Edward Thomas Ffrench|first=A. F. W.|last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Robert Woodhouse]] had brought the Leibniz notation to England with his book ''Principles of Analytical Calculation'' in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Woodhouse]] (1803) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015038638451;view=1up;seq=7 Principles of Analytical Calculation], link from [[HathiTrust]]&lt;/ref&gt; While Newton's notation was unsuitable for a [[function of several variables]], Woodhouse showed,&lt;ref&gt;R. Woodhouse (1803) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015038638451;view=1up;seq=126 Total differential]&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, how to find the [[total differential]] of &lt;math&gt;\phi(p, q), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;where &amp;phi; is a function of ''p'' and ''q'':
:&lt;math&gt;d\phi = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial p} dp + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial q} dq .&lt;/math&gt; The slow uptake of the continental methods in calculus led to the formation of the Analytical Society by [[Charles Babbage]], [[John Herschel]] and [[George Peacock]].&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt;

Though the Society was disbanded by 1814 when most of the original members had graduated, its influence continued to be felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enros|first=Philip C|date=1983-02-01|title=The Analytical Society (1812–1813): Precursor of the renewal of Cambridge mathematics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0315086083900319|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–47|doi=10.1016/0315-0860(83)90031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of Analytical Society work appeared in 1816 when Peacock and Herschel completed the translation of [[Sylvestre Lacroix]]'s textbook ''An Elementary Treatise on Differential and Integral Calculus''&lt;ref&gt;[[George Peacock]] (translator)(1816) [https://archive.org/details/anelementarytre00babbgoog An Elementary Treatise on the Differential and Integral Calculus] by [[Sylvestre Lacroix]], link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; that had been started by Babbage. In 1817 Peacock introduced Leibnizian symbols in that year's examinations in the local senate-house.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; 

Both the exam and the textbook met with little criticism until 1819, when both were criticised by D.M. Peacock, [[vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Sedbergh]], 1796 to 1840. He wrote:&lt;ref name=Dubbey/&gt;
:The University should be more on its guard ... against the introduction of merely algebraic or analytical speculations into its public examinations.

Nevertheless, the reforms were encouraged by younger members of Cambridge University. George Peacock successfully encouraged a colleague, Richard Gwatkin of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]] at Cambridge University, to adopt the new notation in his exams.&lt;ref name=Dubbey/&gt;

Use of Leibnizian notation began to spread after this. In 1820, the notation was used by [[William Whewell]], a previously neutral but influential Cambridge University faculty member, in his examinations. In 1821, Peacock again used Leibnizian notation in his examinations, and the notation became well established.

The Society followed its success by publishing two volumes of examples showing the new method. One was by George Peacock on differential and integral calculus;&lt;ref&gt;G. Peacock (1820) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2f43AAAAMAAJ Collection of Examples of the Application of the Differential and Integral Calculus], link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; the other was by Herschel on the calculus of finite differences. They were joined in this by Whewell, who in 1819 published a book, ''An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics,'' which used the new notation and which became a standard textbook on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Whewell]] (1836) [https://archive.org/stream/elementarytreati00whew#page/n5/mode/2up Elementary Treatise on Mechanics, 5th edition], first edition 1819, link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

John Ainz, a pupil of Peacock's, published a notable paper in 1826 which showed how to apply Leibnizian calculus on various physical problems.

These activities did not go unnoticed at other universities in Great Britain, and soon they followed Cambridge's example. By 1830, Leibniz notation was widely adopted and used alongside the traditional denotation of differentiation by use of dots as Newton had done.

In [[discrete geometry]], an '''arrangement''' is the decomposition of the d-dimensional [[linear space|linear]], [[affine geometry|affine]], or [[projective geometry|projective]] space into connected [[open set|open]] [[abstract cell complex|cell]]s of lower dimensions, induced by a finite collection of geometric objects. Sometimes these objects are of the same type, such as [[hyperplane]]s or [[sphere]]s. An interest in the study of arrangements was driven by advances in [[computational geometry]], where the arrangements were unifying structures for many problems. Advances in study of more complicated objects, such as [[algebraic surface]]s, contributed to "real-world" applications, such as [[motion planning]] and [[computer vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Dan|last=Halperin|contribution=Arrangements|title=Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry|edition=2nd|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58488-301-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest are the [[arrangements of lines]] and [[arrangements of hyperplanes]].

More generally, geometers have studied arrangements of other types of curves in the plane, and of other more complicated types of surface.&lt;ref name="as00"&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], particularly [[computer algebra|computational algebra]], '''Berlekamp's algorithm''' is a well-known method for [[factoring polynomials over finite fields]] (also known as ''Galois fields'').  The algorithm consists mainly of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] reduction and polynomial [[greatest common divisor|GCD]] computations.  It was invented by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] in 1967.  It was the dominant algorithm for solving the problem until the [[Cantor–Zassenhaus algorithm]]  of 1981.  It is currently implemented in many well-known [[computer algebra system]]s.

==Overview==
Berlekamp's algorithm takes as input a [[square-free polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. one with no repeated factors) of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in a finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; and gives as output a polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in the same field such that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The algorithm may then be applied recursively to these and subsequent divisors, until we find the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; into powers of [[irreducible polynomial]]s (recalling that the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of polynomials over a finite field is a [[unique factorization domain]]).

All possible factors of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; are contained within the [[factor ring]]
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\mathbb{F}_q[x]}{\langle f(x) \rangle}.&lt;/math&gt;
The algorithm focuses on polynomials &lt;math&gt;g(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the congruence:
:&lt;math&gt;g(x)^q \equiv g(x) \pmod{f(x)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;
These polynomials form a [[subalgebra]] of R (which can be considered as an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vector space over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;), called the ''Berlekamp subalgebra''.  The Berlekamp subalgebra is of interest because the polynomials &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; it contains satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \prod_{s \in \mathbb{F}_q} \gcd(f(x),g(x)-s).&lt;/math&gt;

In general, not every GCD in the above product will be a non-trivial factor of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, but some are, providing the factors we seek.

Berlekamp's algorithm finds polynomials &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; suitable for use with the above result by computing a basis for the Berlekamp subalgebra.  This is achieved via the observation that Berlekamp subalgebra is in fact the [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of a certain &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;, which is derived from the so-called Berlekamp matrix of the polynomial, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}=[q_{i,j}]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;q_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th power term in the reduction of &lt;math&gt;x^{iq}&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{iq} \equiv q_{i,n-1}x^{n-1} + q_{i,n-2}x^{n-2} + \ldots + q_{i,0} \pmod{f(x)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

With a certain polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt;, say:

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = g_{n-1}x^{n-1}+g_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \ldots + g_0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

we may associate the row vector:

:&lt;math&gt;g = (g_0, g_1, \ldots, g_{n-1}).\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is relatively straightforward to see that the row vector &lt;math&gt;g\mathcal{Q}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds, in the same way, to the reduction of &lt;math&gt;g(x)^q&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently a polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x) \in R&lt;/math&gt; is in the Berlekamp subalgebra if and only if &lt;math&gt;g(\mathcal{Q}-I)=0&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt; [[identity matrix]]), i.e. if and only if it is in the null space of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}-I&lt;/math&gt;.

By computing the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}-I&lt;/math&gt; and reducing it to [[reduced row echelon form]] and then easily reading off a basis for the null space, we may find a basis for the Berlekamp subalgebra and hence construct polynomials &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; in it.  We then need to successively compute GCDs of the form above until we find a non-trivial factor.  Since the ring of polynomials over a field is a [[Euclidean domain]], we may compute these GCDs using the [[Euclidean algorithm]].

==Applications==
One important application of Berlekamp's algorithm is in computing [[discrete logarithm]]s over finite fields &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime and &lt;math&gt;n\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;.  Computing discrete logarithms is an important problem in [[public key cryptography]] and [[Error detection and correction|error-control coding]].  For a finite field, the fastest known method is the [[index calculus|index calculus method]], which involves the factorisation of field elements.  If we represent the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p^n}&lt;/math&gt; in the usual way - that is, as polynomials over the base field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{p}&lt;/math&gt;, reduced modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; - then this is simply polynomial factorisation, as provided by Berlekamp's algorithm.

==Implementation in Computer Algebra Systems==
Berlekamp's algorithm may be accessed in the PARI/GP package using the [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html-stable/Arithmetic_functions.html#factormod factormod] command, and the [[WolframAlpha]] [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=factor+x^5+%2B+x+mod+17] website.

{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}

The '''binomial approximation''' is useful for approximately calculating [[exponentiation|powers]] of sums of a small number and 1. It states that if  &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\alpha x|&lt;/math&gt; ≪ &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are real or complex numbers, then

: &lt;math&gt; (1 + x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x.&lt;/math&gt;

If either &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are complex then the [[absolute value]] denotes the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|modulus]] of the complex number.

The benefit of this approximation is that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is converted from a power to multiplicative factor.  This can greatly simplify mathematical expressions ([[#Example simplification|see example]]) and is a common tool in physics.&lt;ref&gt;For example calculating the [[multipole expansion]]. {{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=D.  |year=1999 |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |edition=Third |pages=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approximation can be proven several ways including the [[binomial theorem]] and ignoring the terms beyond the first two.

By [[Bernoulli's inequality]], the left-hand side of this relation is greater than or equal to the right-hand side whenever &lt;math&gt;x&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Derivation using linear approximation==
The function
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = (1 + x)^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[smooth function]] for ''x'' near 0.  Thus, standard [[linear approximation]] tools from [[calculus]] apply: one has
:&lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \alpha (1 + x)^{\alpha - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt; f'(0) = \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) \approx f(0) + f'(0)(x - 0) = 1 + \alpha x.&lt;/math&gt;

== Derivation using Taylor Series ==
The function 
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = (1+x)^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; may be real or complex can be expressed as a [[Taylor Series]] about the point zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n\\
f(x) &amp;= f(0) + f'(0) x + \frac{1}{2} f''(0) x^2 + \frac{1}{6} f'''(0) x^3 + \frac{1}{24} f^{(4)}(0) x^4 + \cdots\\
(1+x)^{\alpha} &amp;= 1 + \alpha x + \frac{1}{2} \alpha (\alpha-1) x^2 + \frac{1}{6} \alpha (\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)x^3 + \frac{1}{24} \alpha (\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)(\alpha-3)x^4 + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\alpha x|&lt;/math&gt; ≪ &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then the terms in the series become progressively smaller and it can be truncated to
:&lt;math&gt;(1+x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x&lt;/math&gt;.

This result from the binomial approximation can always be improved by keeping additional terms from the Taylor Series above.  This is especially important when &lt;math&gt;|\alpha x|&lt;/math&gt; starts to approach one, or when evaluating a more complex expression where the first two terms in the Taylor Series cancel ([[#Example keeping the quadratic term|see example]]).

Sometimes it is wrongly claimed that &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; ≪ &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is a sufficient condition for the binomial approximation.  A simple counterexample is to let &lt;math&gt;x=10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=10^7&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^\alpha &gt; 22,000&lt;/math&gt; but the binomial approximation yields &lt;math&gt;1 + \alpha x = 11&lt;/math&gt;. For small &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; but large  &lt;math&gt;|\alpha x|&lt;/math&gt;, a better approximation is:

: &lt;math&gt; (1 + x)^\alpha \approx e^{\alpha x.}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example simplification===
Consider the following expression where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are real but &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; ≫ &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;	\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{a-b}} &lt;/math&gt;

The mathematical form for the binomial approximation can be recovered by factoring out the large term &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and recalling that a square root is the same as a power of one half.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{a+b}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{a-b}} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \Big(\big(1+\frac{b}{a}\big)^{-1/2} - \big(1-\frac{b}{a}\big)^{-1/2}\Big)\\
 &amp;\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \Big(\big(1+\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big)\frac{b}{a}\big) - \big(1-\big(-\frac{1}{2}\big)\frac{b}{a}\big)\Big) \\
 &amp;\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \Big(1-\frac{b}{2a} - 1 -\frac{b}{2a}\Big) \\
 &amp;\approx -\frac{b}{a \sqrt{a}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Evidently the expression is linear in &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; ≫ &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; which is otherwise not obvious from the original expression.

===Example keeping the quadratic term===
Consider the expression:
:&lt;math&gt;	(1 + \epsilon)^n - (1 - \epsilon)^{-n} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|\epsilon|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|n \epsilon|&lt;/math&gt; ≪ &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  If only the linear term from the binomial approximation is kept &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x&lt;/math&gt; then the expression unhelpfully simplifies to zero
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(1 + \epsilon)^n - (1 - \epsilon)^{-n} &amp;\approx (1+ n \epsilon) - (1 - (-n) \epsilon)\\
&amp;\approx (1+ n \epsilon) - (1 + n \epsilon)\\
&amp;\approx 0 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.

While the expression is small, it is not exactly zero.  It is possible to extract a nonzero approximate solution by keeping the quadratic term in the Taylor Series, i.e. &lt;math&gt; (1+x)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha x + \frac{1}{2} \alpha (\alpha-1) x^2&lt;/math&gt; so now,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(1+\epsilon)^n - (1 - \epsilon)^{-n}&amp;\approx (1+ n \epsilon + \frac{1}{2} n (n-1) \epsilon^2) - (1 + (-n)(-\epsilon) + \frac{1}{2} (-n) (-n-1) (-\epsilon)^2)\\
&amp;\approx (1+ n \epsilon + \frac{1}{2} n (n-1) \epsilon^2) - (1 + n \epsilon + \frac{1}{2} n (n+1) \epsilon^2)\\
&amp;\approx \frac{1}{2} n (n-1) \epsilon^2 - \frac{1}{2} n (n+1) \epsilon^2\\
&amp;\approx \frac{1}{2} n \epsilon^2 ((n-1) - (n+1)) \\
&amp;\approx - n \epsilon^2 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result is quadratic in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; which is why it did not appear when only the linear in terms in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; were kept.

'''''Brute Force''''' (2005, Copernicus Books {{ISBN|0387271600}}) is a book by [[Matt Curtin]] about [[cryptography]].

In this book, the author accounts his involvement in the [[DESCHALL Project]], mobilizing thousands of personal computers in 1997 in order to meet the challenge to crack a single message [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]].

This was and remains one of the largest [[collaboration]]s of any kind on a single project in history.

The message was unencrypted on June 18 and was found to be "Strong cryptography makes the world a safer place."

This is also the message of Curtin's book where he uses a personal account to reveal to the uninitiated reader some insight into a topic of growing importance which is both technically and politically complicated.

'''Christopher Barry Collins''' is a [[cosmology|cosmologist]] who has written many papers with [[Stephen Hawking]]. He is a [[professor emeritus]] of [[applied mathematics]] at the [[University of Waterloo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/about/people/cbcollin Faculty profile], Univ. of Waterloo, retrieved 2015-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins earned his Ph.D. in 1972 from the [[University of Cambridge]] under the supervision of F. Gerard Friedlander.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=127502|name=Christopher Barry Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of [[Emmy Noether]]'s students at the [[University of Göttingen]]. He returned to China in 1935. After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|full-scale Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, he fled and eventually settled in [[Xikang]], where he became a professor at the newly-founded National Xikang Institute of Technology. He died of a [[stomach ulcer]] in [[Xichang]], [[Xikang]] on October 1, 1940, and a memorial service was held on November 18, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=兩月份甯屬要聞 (Main news of Ningshu in the last two months)|journal=新寧遠月刊 Xin Ningyuan Yuekang (New Ningyuan Monthly)|volume=1|issue=4-5|date=January 25, 1941|place=Xichang, Xikang|language=Chinese|page=53|quote=（十一月份）... 十八日 國立康專舉行曾故教授追悼大會。 ((November)... 18th: National Xikang Institute of Technology held a memorial service for late Prof. Tsen.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Many Chinese sources mistakenly give his date of death as November 1940.)

In [[modal logic]], a '''classical modal logic''' '''L''' is any modal logic containing (as axiom or theorem) the [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] of the modal operators

&lt;math&gt;\Diamond A \equiv \lnot\Box\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;

which is also [[Deductive closure|closed]] under the rule

&lt;math&gt; A \equiv B \vdash \Box A\equiv\Box B.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively one can give a dual definition of '''L''' by which '''L''' is classical iff it contains (as axiom or theorem)

&lt;math&gt;\Box A \equiv \lnot\Diamond\lnot A&lt;/math&gt;

and is closed under the rule

&lt;math&gt; A \equiv B \vdash \Diamond A\equiv\Diamond B.&lt;/math&gt;

The weakest classical system is sometimes referred to as '''E''' and is [[normal modal logic|non-normal]]. Both [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic]] and [[neighborhood semantics]] characterize familiar classical modal systems that are weaker than the weakest normal modal logic '''K'''.

Every [[regular modal logic]] is classical, and every [[normal modal logic]] is regular and hence classical.

In [[mathematics]], a '''constant-recursive sequence''' or '''C-finite sequence''' is a sequence satisfying a linear [[recurrence relation | recurrence]] with constant coefficients.

==Definition==
An order-''d'' '''homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients'''  is an equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = c_1 s(n-1) + c_2 s(n-2) + \dots + c_d s(n-d),&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''d'' coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2, \dots, c_d&lt;/math&gt; are constants.

A sequence &lt;math&gt;s(0), s(1), s(2), \dots&lt;/math&gt; is a '''constant-recursive sequence''' if there is an order-''d'' homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients that it satisfies for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq d&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;s(n)_{n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; is constant-recursive if the set of sequences
:&lt;math&gt;\{s(n + r)_{n \geq 0} : r \geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;
is contained in a [[vector space]] whose dimension is finite.

==Examples==

===Fibonacci sequence===
The sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... of [[Fibonacci number]]s satisfies the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;

with [[initial condition|initial conditions]]
:&lt;math&gt;F_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the recurrence yields the values
:&lt;math&gt;F_2 = F_1 + F_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 5&lt;/math&gt;

etc.

===Lucas sequences===
The sequence 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, ... {{OEIS|id=A000032|name=Lucas numbers beginning at 2: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2), L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1}} of [[Lucas number]]s satisfies the same recurrence as the Fibonacci sequence but with initial conditions 
:&lt;math&gt;L_0 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, every [[Lucas sequence]] is a constant-recursive sequence.

===Geometric sequences===
The [[geometric sequence]] &lt;math&gt;a, a r, a r^2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; is constant-recursive, since it satisfies the recurrence &lt;math&gt;s(n) = r s(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Eventually periodic sequences===
A sequence that is eventually periodic with period length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is constant-recursive, since it satisfies &lt;math&gt;s(n) = s(n - \ell)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq d&lt;/math&gt; for some ''d''.

===Polynomial sequences===
For any polynomial ''s''(''n''), the sequence of its values is a constant-recursive sequence.  If the degree of the polynomial is ''d'', the order of the associated recurrence is ''d'' + 1, with coefficients given by the corresponding element of the [[binomial transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyadzhiev|first=Boyad|date=2012|title=Close Encounters with the Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind|url=https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/2/Boyadzhiev-2013.pdf|journal=Math. Mag.|volume=85|pages=252-266|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first few such equations are

:&lt;math&gt; s(n) = 1 \cdot s(n-1) &lt;/math&gt; for a degree 0 (that is, constant) polynomial,
:&lt;math&gt; s(n) = 2\cdot s(n-1) - 1\cdot s(n-2) &lt;/math&gt; for a degree 1 or less polynomial,
:&lt;math&gt; s(n) = 3\cdot s(n-1) - 3\cdot s(n-2) + 1\cdot s(n-3) &lt;/math&gt; for a degree 2 or less polynomial, and
:&lt;math&gt; s(n) = 4\cdot s(n-1) - 6\cdot s(n-2) + 4\cdot s(n-3) - 1\cdot s(n-4)&lt;/math&gt; for a degree 3 or less polynomial.

A sequence obeying the order ''d'' equation also obeys all higher order equations. These identities may be proved in a number of ways, including via the theory of [[finite differences]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Each equation may be validated by substituting &lt;math&gt;s(j) = f(x_0+jh)&lt;/math&gt; and the degree ''d'' polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt;

for an arbitrary offset &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, an arbitrary spacing ''h'' and arbitrary polynomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;. Any given sequence of ''d'' arbitrary integer, real or complex values can be used to start an order-''d'' constant-recursive sequence. If the given sequence of ''d'' values lies on a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;d-2&lt;/math&gt; or less, then the constant recursive sequence also obeys a lower order equation(s).

== Characterization in terms of exponential polynomials ==
The [[characteristic polynomial]] (or "auxiliary polynomial") of the recurrence is the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;x^d - c_1 x^{d-1} - \dots - c_{d-1} x - c_d&lt;/math&gt;
whose coefficients are the same as those of the recurrence.
The ''n''th term &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; of a constant-recursive sequence can be written in terms of the [[root of a polynomial | roots]] of its characteristic polynomial.
If the ''d'' roots &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, \dots, r_d&lt;/math&gt; are all distinct, then the ''n''th term of the sequence is
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = k_1 r_1^n + k_2 r_2^n + \dots + k_d r_d^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are constants that can be determined by the initial conditions.

For the Fibonacci sequence, the characteristic polynomial is &lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1&lt;/math&gt;, whose roots &lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; appear in [[Binet's formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;F_n = \frac{\phi^n-\bar{\phi}^n}{\sqrt 5}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if a root ''r'' of the characteristic polynomial has multiplicity ''m'', then the term &lt;math&gt;r^n&lt;/math&gt; is multiplied by a degree-&lt;math&gt;(m-1)&lt;/math&gt; polynomial in ''n''. That is, let &lt;math&gt;r_1, \dots, r_e&lt;/math&gt; be the distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial. Then
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = k_1(n) r_1^n + k_2(n) r_2^n + \dots + k_e(n) r_e^n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_i(n)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;m_i - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if the characteristic polynomial factors as &lt;math&gt;(x-r)^3&lt;/math&gt;, with the same root ''r'' occurring three times, then the ''n''th term is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = (a + b n + c n^2) r^n.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=2.1.1 Constant coefficients – A) Homogeneous equations|title=Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Greene|first2=Donald E.|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth| edition=2nd| publisher=Birkhäuser |page=17 | year=1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, if there are polynomials &lt;math&gt;k_i(n)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = k_1(n) r_1^n + k_2(n) r_2^n + \dots + k_e(n) r_e^n,&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;s(n)_{n \geq 0}&lt;/math&gt; is constant-recursive.

== Characterization in terms of rational generating functions ==
A sequence is constant-recursive precisely when its [[generating function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 0} s(n) x^n = s(0) + s(1) x^1 + s(2) x^2 + s(3) x^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[rational function]]. The denominator is the polynomial obtained from the auxiliary polynomial by reversing the order of the coefficients, and the numerator is determined by the initial values of the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the variety of linear recurrences and numerical semigroups|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00233-013-9551-2|journal = [[Semigroup Forum]]|date = 2013-11-14|issn = 0037-1912|pages = 569–574|volume = 88|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s00233-013-9551-2|language = en|first = Ivan|last = Martino|first2 = Luca|last2 = Martino|arxiv = 1207.0111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generating function of the Fibonacci sequence is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{1-x-x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, multiplying a generating function by the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;1 - c_1 x^1 - c_2 x^2 - \dots - c_d x^d&lt;/math&gt;
yields a series
:&lt;math&gt;\left(s(0) + s(1) x^1 + s(2) x^2 + \cdots\right) \left(1 - c_1 x^1 - c_2 x^2 - \dots - c_d x^d \right) = \left(b_0 + b_1 x^1 + b_2 x^2 + \cdots\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;b_n = s(n) - c_1 s(n-1) - c_2 s(n-2) - \dots - c_d s(n-d).&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the recurrence relation
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = c_1 s(n-1) + c_2 s(n-2) + \dots + c_d s(n-d),&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;b_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq d&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(s(0) + s(1) x^1 + s(2) x^2 + \cdots\right) \left(1 - c_1 x^1 - c_2 x^2 - \dots - c_d x^d \right) = \left(b_0 + b_1 x^1 + b_2 x^2 + \dots + b_{d-1} x^{d-1}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
so we obtain the rational function
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \geq 0} s(n) x^n = \frac{b_0 + b_1 x^1 + b_2 x^2 + \dots + b_{d-1} x^{d-1}}{1 - c_1 x^1 - c_2 x^2 - \dots - c_d x^d}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case of a periodic sequence satisfying &lt;math&gt;s(n) = s(n-d)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \geq d&lt;/math&gt;, the generating function is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\frac{s(0) + s(1) x^1 + \dots + s(d-1) x^{d-1}}{1-x^d} =&amp; \left(s(0) + s(1) x^1 + \dots + s(d-1) x^{d-1}\right) + \left(s(0) + s(1) x^1 + \dots + s(d-1) x^{d-1}\right) x^d + {}\\&amp; \left(s(0) + s(1) x^1 + \dots + s(d-1) x^{d-1}\right) x^{2d} + \cdots\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
by expanding the geometric series.

The [[Catalan number#First proof|generating function of the Catalan numbers]] is not a rational function, which implies that the [[Catalan numbers]] do not satisfy a linear recurrence with constant coefficients.

==Closure properties==
The termwise addition or multiplication of two constant-recursive sequences is again constant-recursive.  This follows from the characterization in terms of exponential polynomials.

The [[Cauchy product]] of two constant-recursive sequences is constant-recursive.  This follows from the characterization in terms of rational generating functions.

==Sequences satisfying non-homogeneous recurrences==
A sequence satisfying a non-homogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients is constant-recursive.

This is because the recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;s(n) = c_1 s(n-1) + c_2 s(n-2) + \dots + c_d s(n-d) + c&lt;/math&gt;
can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;c = s(n) - c_1 s(n-1) - c_2 s(n-2) - \dots - c_d s(n-d).&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting this into the equation
:&lt;math&gt;s(n+1) = c_1 s(n) + c_2 s(n-1) + \dots + c_d s(n+1-d) + c&lt;/math&gt;
shows that &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the homogeneous recurrence
:&lt;math&gt;s(n+1) = (c_1 + 1) s(n) + (c_2 - c_1) s(n-1) + \dots + (c_d  - c_{d-1}) s(n+1-d) - c_d s(n-d)&lt;/math&gt;
of order &lt;math&gt;d + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalizations==
A natural generalization is obtained by relaxing the condition that the coefficients of the recurrence are constants.  If the coefficients are allowed to be polynomials, then one obtains [[holonomic function|holonomic sequence]]s.

A [[k-regular sequence|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-regular sequence]] satisfies linear recurrences with constant coefficients, but the recurrences take a different form.  Rather than &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; being a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;s(m)&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, each term &lt;math&gt;s(n)&lt;/math&gt; in a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-regular sequence is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;s(m)&lt;/math&gt; for some integers &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; whose base-&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; representations are close to that of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  Constant-recursive sequences can be thought of as &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-regular sequences, where the [[unary numeral system|base-1 representation]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; consists of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of the digit &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Constructive dilemma'''&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Patrick. A Concise Introduction to Logic With Ilrn Printed Access Card. Wadsworth Pub Co, 2008. Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]]. It is the [[inference]] that, if ''P'' implies ''Q'' and ''R'' implies ''S'' and either ''P'' or ''R'' is true, then ''Q or S'' has to be true. In sum, if two [[material conditional|conditionals]] are true and at least one of their antecedents is, then at least one of their consequents must be too. ''Constructive dilemma'' is the [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive]] version of [[modus ponens]], whereas,
[[destructive dilemma]] is the disjunctive version of ''[[modus tollens]]''. The rule can be stated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(P \to Q) * (R \to S), P \lor R}{\therefore Q \lor S}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that whenever instances of "&lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;", "&lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;", and "&lt;math&gt;P \lor R&lt;/math&gt;" appear on lines of a proof, "&lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt;" can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Formal notation ==
The ''constructive dilemma'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;(P \to Q), (R \to S), (P \lor R) \vdash (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q \lor S&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;(((P \to Q) \land (R \to S)) \land (P \lor R)) \to (Q \lor S)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].

== Natural language example ==

:If I win a million dollars, I will donate it to an orphanage.
:If my friend wins a million dollars, he will donate it to a wildlife fund.
:Either I win a million dollars or my friend wins a million dollars.
:Therefore, either an orphanage will get a million dollars, or a wildlife fund will get a million dollars.

The dilemma derives its name because of the transfer of disjunctive operator.

For a product space, the cylinder σ-algebra is the one which is [[algebra#σ-algebra generated by an arbitrary family|generated]] by [[cylinder set|cylinder sets]].

In the context of Banach space ''X'', the cylindrical σ-algebra Cyl(''X'') is defined to be the coarsest σ-algebra (i.e. the one with the fewest measurable sets) such that every [[continuous linear function]] on ''X'' is a [[measurable function]].  In general, Cyl(''X'') is ''not'' the same as the [[Borel σ-algebra]] on ''X'', which is the coarsest σ-algebra that contains all open subsets of ''X''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21493">In the [[differential geometry]] of [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]]s, a '''Darboux frame''' is a natural [[moving frame]] constructed on a surface.  It is the analog of the [[Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret formulas|Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame]] as applied to surface geometry.  A Darboux frame exists at any non-[[umbilic]] point of a surface embedded in [[Euclidean space]]. It is named after French mathematician [[Jean Gaston Darboux]].

==Darboux frame of an embedded curve==
Let ''S'' be an oriented surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The construction of Darboux frames on ''S'' first considers frames moving along a curve in ''S'', and then specializes when the curves move in the direction of the [[principal curvatures]].

===Definition===

At each point {{math|''p''}} of an oriented surface, one may attach a [[unit vector|unit]] [[normal vector]] {{math|'''u'''(''p'')}} in a unique way, as soon as an orientation has been chosen for the normal at any particular fixed point.  If {{math|''γ''(''s'')}} is a curve in {{math|''S''}}, parametrized by arc length, then the '''Darboux frame''' of {{math|''γ''}} is defined by
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}(s) = \gamma'(s), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''unit tangent'')
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}(s) = \mathbf{u}(\gamma(s)), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''unit normal'')
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{t}(s) = \mathbf{u}(s) \times \mathbf{T}(s), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''tangent normal'')
The triple {{math|'''T''', '''t''', '''u'''}} defines a [[Orientation (vector space)|positively oriented]] [[orthonormal basis]] attached to each point of the curve: a natural moving frame along the embedded curve.

===Geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and relative torsion===

Note that a Darboux frame for a curve does not yield a natural moving frame on the surface, since it still depends on an initial choice of tangent vector.  To obtain a moving frame on the surface, we first compare the Darboux frame of γ with its Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame.  Let
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}(s) = \gamma'(s), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''unit tangent'', as above)
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{N}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{T}'(s)}{\|\mathbf{T}'(s)\|}, &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''Frenet normal vector'')
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{B}(s) = \mathbf{T}(s)\times\mathbf{N}(s), &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (the ''Frenet binormal vector'').

Since the tangent vectors are the same in both cases, there is a unique angle α such that a rotation in the plane of '''N''' and '''B''' produces the pair '''t''' and '''u''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;\cos\alpha&amp;\sin\alpha\\
0&amp;-\sin\alpha&amp;\cos\alpha
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{N}\\
\mathbf{B}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking a differential, and applying the [[Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret formulas]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0&amp;\kappa\cos\alpha\, \mathrm{d}s&amp;-\kappa\sin\alpha\, \mathrm{d}s\\
-\kappa\cos\alpha\, \mathrm{d}s&amp;0&amp;\tau \, \mathrm{d}s + \mathrm{d}\alpha\\
\kappa\sin\alpha\, \mathrm{d}s&amp;-\tau \, \mathrm{d}s - \mathrm{d}\alpha&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=
\begin{bmatrix}
0&amp;\kappa_g \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;\kappa_n \, \mathrm{d}s\\
-\kappa_g \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;0&amp;\tau_r \, \mathrm{d}s\\
-\kappa_n \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;-\tau_r \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* κ&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''[[geodesic curvature]]''' of the curve,
* κ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''normal curvature''' of the curve, and
* τ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''relative torsion''' (also called '''geodesic torsion''') of the curve.{{anchor|Relative torsion|Geodesic torsion}}

==Darboux frame on a surface==
This section specializes the case of the Darboux frame on a curve to the case when the curve is a [[principal curvatures|principal curve]] of the surface (a ''line of curvature'').  In that case, since the principal curves are canonically associated to a surface at all non-[[umbilic]] points, the Darboux frame is a canonical [[moving frame]].

===The trihedron===
[[Image:Darboux trihedron.svg|thumb|right|A Darboux trihedron consisting of a point '''P''' and three orthonormal vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based at '''P'''.]]
The introduction of the trihedron (or ''trièdre''), an invention of Darboux, allows for a conceptual simplification of the problem of moving frames on curves and surfaces by treating the coordinates of the point on the curve and the frame vectors in a uniform manner.  A '''trihedron''' consists of a point '''P''' in Euclidean space, and three orthonormal vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based at the point '''P'''.  A '''moving trihedron''' is a trihedron whose components depend on one or more parameters.  For example, a trihedron moves along a curve if the point '''P''' depends on a single parameter ''s'', and '''P'''(''s'') traces out the curve.  Similarly, if '''P'''(''s'',''t'') depends on a pair of parameters, then this traces out a surface.

A trihedron is said to be '''adapted to a surface''' if '''P''' always lies on the surface and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the oriented unit normal to the surface at '''P'''.  In the case of the Darboux frame along an embedded curve, the quadruple

: ('''P'''(''s'') = &amp;gamma;(''s''), '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = '''T'''(''s''), '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = '''t'''(''s''), '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') = '''u'''(''s''))

defines a tetrahedron adapted to the surface into which the curve is embedded.

In terms of this trihedron, the structural equations read

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{P}\\
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0&amp;\mathrm{d}s&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;\kappa_g \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;\kappa_n \, \mathrm{d}s\\
0&amp;-\kappa_g \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;0&amp;\tau_r \, \mathrm{d}s\\
0&amp;-\kappa_n \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;-\tau_r \, \mathrm{d}s&amp;0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{P}\\
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Change of frame===
Suppose that any other adapted trihedron 
:('''P''', '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
is given for the embedded curve.  Since, by definition, '''P''' remains the same point on the curve as for the Darboux trihedron, and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = '''u''' is the unit normal, this new trihedron is related to the Darboux trihedron by a rotation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{P}\\
\mathbf{e}_1\\
\mathbf{e}_2\\
\mathbf{e}_3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;\cos\theta&amp;\sin\theta&amp;0\\
0&amp;-\sin\theta&amp;\cos\theta&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{P}\\
\mathbf{T}\\
\mathbf{t}\\
\mathbf{u}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where θ = θ(''s'') is a function of ''s''.  Taking a differential and applying the Darboux equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{P} &amp; = \mathbf{T} \mathrm{d}s = \omega^1\mathbf{e}_1+\omega^2\mathbf{e}_2\\
\mathrm{d}\mathbf{e}_i &amp; = \sum_j \omega^j_i\mathbf{e}_j
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the (ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;,ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;) are functions of ''s'', satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\omega^1 &amp; = \cos\theta \, \mathrm{d}s,\quad \omega^2 = -\sin\theta \, \mathrm{d}s\\
\omega_i^j &amp; = -\omega_j^i\\
\omega_1^2 &amp; = \kappa_g \, \mathrm{d}s + \mathrm{d}\theta\\
\omega_1^3 &amp; = (\kappa_n\cos\theta + \tau_r\sin\theta) \, \mathrm{d}s\\
\omega_2^3 &amp; = -(\kappa_n\sin\theta + \tau_r\cos\theta) \, \mathrm{d}s
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Structure equations===
The [[Poincaré lemma]], applied to each double differential dd'''P''', dd'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, yields the following [[Maurer&amp;ndash;Cartan form|Cartan structure equations]].  From dd'''P''' = 0,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\omega^1 &amp; =\omega^2\wedge\omega_2^1\\
\mathrm{d}\omega^2 &amp; =\omega^1\wedge\omega_1^2\\
0 &amp; =\omega^1\wedge\omega_1^3+\omega^2\wedge\omega_2^3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

From dd'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}\omega_1^2 &amp; =\omega_1^3\wedge\omega_3^2\\
\mathrm{d}\omega_1^3 &amp; =\omega_1^2\wedge\omega_2^3\\
\mathrm{d}\omega_2^3 &amp; =\omega_2^1\wedge\omega_1^3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The latter are the [[Gauss&amp;ndash;Codazzi equations]] for the surface, expressed in the language of differential forms.

===Principal curves===
Consider the [[second fundamental form]] of ''S''.  This is the symmetric 2-form on ''S'' given by
:&lt;math&gt;
II = -\mathrm{d}\mathbf{N}\cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{P} = \omega_1^3\odot\omega^1 + \omega_2^3\odot\omega^2
=\begin{pmatrix}\omega^1 \omega^2\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
ii_{11}&amp;ii_{12}\\
ii_{21}&amp;ii_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}\omega^1\\\omega^2\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
By the [[spectral theorem]], there is some choice of frame ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in which (''ii''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;) is a [[diagonal matrix]].  The [[eigenvalue]]s are the [[principal curvatures]] of the surface.  A diagonalizing frame '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the normal vector '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and two principal directions '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This is called a Darboux frame on the surface.  The frame is canonically defined (by an ordering on the eigenvalues, for instance) away from the [[umbilic]]s of the surface.
&lt;!-- Still under construction:
==Frames on a ruled surface==
Let ''S'' be an oriented [[ruled surface]] in three-dimensional Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  One can, following [[Élie Cartan]],&lt;ref&gt;Cartan (1937), Chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;  construct a natural frame on ''S'' analogous to the Darboux frame on an ordinary non-ruled surface.

A '''trihedron'''&lt;ref&gt;Cartan uses the term ''trièdre''.&lt;/ref&gt; in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; consists of a point ''A'' in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a triple of [[orthonormal]] vectors ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based at ''A''.  A '''moving trihedron''' is a trihedron depending on a system of parameters.

A moving trihedron can be attached to ''S'' as follows.

is an assignment of a quadruple of vectors ''A'', ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
The first construction applies to a space curve on ''S''.  Suppose that

==Moving frames==
The Darboux frame is an example of a natural [[moving frame]] defined on a surface.  With slight modifications, the notion of a moving frame can be generalized to a [[hypersurface]] in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], or indeed any embedded [[submanifold]].  This generalization is among the many contributions of [[Élie Cartan]] to the method of moving frames.

===Frames on Euclidean space===

A (Euclidean) '''frame''' on the Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a higher-dimensional analog of the trihedron.  It is defined to be an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple of vectors drawn from '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, (''v''; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), where:
* ''v'' is a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and
* (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an [[orthonormal basis]] of the vector space based at ''v''.
Let ''F''(''n'') be the ensemble of all Euclidean frames.  The [[Euclidean group]] acts on ''F''(''n'') as follows.  Let φ ∈ Euc(''n'') be an element of the Euclidean group decomposing as
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x) =  Ax + x_0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is an [[orthogonal transformation]] and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a translation.  Then, on a frame,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(v;f_1,\dots,f_n) := (\phi(v);Af_1, \dots, Af_n).&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, the affine group moves the origin in the usual way, and it acts via a rotation on the orthogonal basis vectors since these are "attached" to the particular choice of origin.  This is an [[group action|effective and transitive group action]], so ''F''(''n'') is a [[principal homogeneous space]] of Euc(''n'').

===Structure equations===

Define the following system of functions ''F''(''n'') → '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;Treatment based on Hermann's Appendix II to Cartan (1983), although he takes this approach for the [[affine group]].  The case of the Euclidean group can be found, in equivalent but slightly more advanced terms, in Sternberg (1967), Chapter VI.  Note that we have abused notation slightly (following Hermann and also Cartan) by regarding ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as elements of the Euclidean space '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; based at ''v''.  This subtle distinction does not matter, since ultimately only the differentials of these maps are used.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P(v; f_1,\dots, f_n) &amp; = v\\
e_i(v; f_1,\dots, f_n) &amp; = f_i, \qquad i=1,2,\dots,n.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The projection operator ''P'' is of special significance.  The inverse image of a point ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''v'') consists of all orthonormal bases with basepoint at ''v''.  In particular, ''P'' : ''F''(''n'') → '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; presents ''F''(''n'') as a [[principal bundle]] whose structure group is the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'').  (In fact this principal bundle is just the tautological bundle of the [[homogeneous space]] ''F''(''n'') → ''F''(''n'')/O(''n'') = '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The [[exterior derivative]] of ''P'' (regarded as a [[vector-valued differential form]]) decomposes uniquely as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}P = \sum_i \omega^ie_i,\, &lt;/math&gt;

for some system of scalar valued [[one-form]]s ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;.  Similarly, there is an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of one-forms (ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;) such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}e_i = \sum_j \omega_i^je_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the ''e''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are orthonormal under the [[inner product]] of Euclidean space, the matrix of 1-forms ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]].  In particular it is determined uniquely by its upper-triangular part (ω&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j'').  The system of ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 one-forms (ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; (''i''&lt;''j'')) gives an [[absolute parallelism]] of ''F''(''n''), since the coordinate differentials can each be expressed in terms of them.  Under the action of the Euclidean group, these forms transform as follows.  Let φ be the Euclidean transformation consisting of a translation ''v''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; and rotation matrix (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;).  Then the following are readily checked by the invariance of the exterior derivative under [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi^*(\omega^i) = (A^{-1})_j^i\omega^j&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi^*(\omega_j^i) = (A^{-1})_p^i\, \omega_q^p\, A_j^q.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, by the [[Poincaré lemma]], one has the following '''structure equations'''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\omega^i = -\omega_j^i\wedge\omega^j&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\omega_j^i = -\omega^i_k\wedge\omega^k_j.&lt;/math&gt;

===Adapted frames and the Gauss&amp;ndash;Codazzi equations===
Let φ : ''M''  → '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; be an embedding of a ''p''-dimensional [[smooth manifold]] into a Euclidean space.  The space of '''adapted frames''' on ''M'', denoted here by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'') is the collection of tuples (''x''; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x'' ∈ ''M'', and the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; form an orthonormal basis of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; are tangent to φ(''M'') at φ(''v'').&lt;ref&gt;This treatment is from Sternberg (1964), Chapter VI, Theorem 3.1, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several examples of adapted frames have already been considered.  The first vector '''T''' of the Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame ('''T''', '''N''', '''B''') is tangent to a curve, and all three vectors are mutually orthonormal.  Similarly, the Darboux frame on a surface is an orthonormal frame whose first two vectors are tangent to the surface.  Adapted frames are useful because the invariant forms (ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;,ω&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;) pullback along φ, and the structural equations are preserved under this pullback.  Consequently, the resulting system of forms yields structural information about how ''M'' is situated inside Euclidean space.  In the case of the Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret frame, the structural equations are precisely the Frenet&amp;ndash;Serret formulas, and these serve to classify curves completely up to Euclidean motions.  The general case is analogous: the structural equations for an adapted system of frames classifies arbitrary embedded submanifolds up to a Euclidean motion.

In detail, the projection π : ''F''(''M'') → ''M'' given by π(''x''; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x'' gives ''F''(''M'') the structure of a [[principal bundle]] on ''M'' (the structure group for the bundle is O(''p'') &amp;times; O(''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'').)  This principal bundle embeds into the bundle of Euclidean frames ''F''(''n'') by φ(''v'';''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) := (φ(''v'');''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ ''F''(''n'').  Hence it is possible to define the pullbacks of the invariant forms from ''F''(''n''):
:&lt;math&gt;\theta^i = \phi^*\omega^i,\quad \theta_j^i=\phi^*\omega_j^i.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the exterior derivative is equivariant under pullbacks, the following structural equations hold
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\theta^i=-\theta_j^i\wedge\theta^j,\quad \mathrm{d}\theta_j^i = -\theta_k^i\wedge\theta_j^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, because some of the frame vectors ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''f''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; are tangent to ''M'' while the others are normal, the structure equations naturally split into their tangential and normal contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Though treated by Sternberg (1964), this explicit description is from Spivak (1999) chapters III.1 and IV.7.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  Let the lowercase Latin indices ''a'',''b'',''c'' range from 1 to ''p'' (i.e., the tangential indices) and the Greek indices μ, γ range from ''p''+1 to ''n'' (i.e., the normal indices).  The first observation is that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^\mu = 0,\quad \mu=p+1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

since these forms generate the submanifold φ(''M'') (in the sense of the [[Frobenius integration theorem]].)

The first set of structural equations now becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{d}\theta^a = -\sum_{b=1}^p\theta_b^a\wedge\theta^b\\
\\
0=\mathrm{d}\theta^\mu = -\sum_{b=1}^p \theta_b^\mu\wedge\theta^b
\end{array}\right\}\,\,\, (1)
&lt;/math&gt;

Of these, the latter implies by [[Cartan's lemma]] that

:&lt;math&gt;
\theta_b^\mu = s^\mu_{ab}\theta^a
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; is ''symmetric'' on ''a'' and ''b'' (the [[second fundamental form]]s of φ(''M'')).  Hence, equations (1) are the '''Gauss formulas''' (see [[Gauss&amp;ndash;Codazzi equations]]).  In particular, θ&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[connection form]] for the [[Levi-Civita connection]] on ''M''.

The second structural equations also split into the following

:&lt;math&gt;
\left.\begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{d}\theta_b^a + \sum_{c=1}^p\theta_c^a\wedge\theta_b^c = \Omega_b^a = -\sum_{\mu=p+1}^n\theta_\mu^a\wedge\theta^\mu_b\\
\\
\mathrm{d}\theta_b^\gamma = -\sum_{c=1}^p\theta_c^\gamma\wedge\theta_b^c-\sum_{\mu=p+1}^n\theta_\mu^\gamma\wedge\theta_b^\mu\\
\\
\mathrm{d}\theta_\mu^\gamma = -\sum_{c=1}^p\theta_c^\gamma\wedge\theta_\mu^c-\sum_{\delta=p+1}^n\theta_\delta^\gamma\wedge\theta_\mu^\delta
\end{array}\right\}\,\,\, (2)
&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation is the '''Gauss equation''' which expresses the [[curvature form]] Ω of ''M'' in terms of the second fundamental form.  The second is the '''Codazzi&amp;ndash;Mainardi equation''' which expresses the covariant derivatives of the second fundamental form in terms of the normal connection.  The third is the '''Ricci equation'''.

In mathematics, '''Delzant's theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Thomas|last=Delzant|year=1988}}, classifies effective Hamiltonian actions of a torus on a compact connected symplectic manifold of twice the dimension by their image under the momentum mapping (Delzant polytope). A [[Delzant]] polytope is a [[convex polytope]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the slopes of the edges of each vertex are given by a basis of '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

As a corollary, these symplectic manifolds have a complex structure and can be promoted as [[toric variety|toric varieties]], with invariant Kähler structures.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4289">In [[formal language theory]], '''deterministic context-free languages''' ('''DCFL''') are  a [[proper subset]] of  [[context-free language]]s. They are the context-free languages that can be accepted by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]]. DCFLs are always unambiguous, meaning that they admit an [[unambiguous grammar]]. There are non-deterministic unambiguous CFLs, so DCFLs form a proper subset of unambiguous CFLs.

DCFLs are of great practical interest, as they can be parsed in linear time, and various restricted forms of DCFGs admit simple practical parsers. They are thus widely used throughout computer science.

==Description==

The notion of the DCFL is closely related to the [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] (DPDA). It is where the language power of  [[pushdown automaton]]s is reduced to if we make them deterministic;  the pushdown automatons become unable to choose between different state-transition alternatives and as a consequence cannot recognize all context-free languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John |author2=[[Jeffrey Ullman]]  | title = [[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] | year = 1979 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unambiguous grammar]]s do not always generate a DCFL. For example, the language of even-length [[palindrome]]s on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the unambiguous context-free grammar S → 0S0 | 1S1 | ε. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first, which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[John Hopcroft|Hopcroft]] | first = John |author2=[[Rajeev Motwani]] |author3=[[Jeffrey Ullman]] | title = [[Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation]] 2nd edition | year = 2001 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | pages = 249–253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

Deterministic context-free languages can be recognized by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in polynomial time and [[Big-O notation|O]](log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''n'') space; as a corollary, '''DCFL''' is a subset of the complexity class '''[[SC (complexity)|SC]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |doi=10.1145/800135.804426 |title=Deterministic CFL's are accepted simultaneously in polynomial time and log squared space |book-title=Proceedings of the eleventh annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing - STOC '79 |pages=338–345 |location=Atlanta |date=April 30 – May 2, 1979 |last=Cook |first=Stephen A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of deterministic context-free languages is not closed under [[Union (set theory)|union]] but is closed under [[Complement (set theory)|complement]].

==Importance==

The languages of this class have great practical importance in computer science as they can be parsed much more efficiently than nondeterministic context-free languages. The complexity of the program and execution time of a deterministic pushdown automaton is vastly less than that of a nondeterministic one. In the naive implementation, the latter must make copies of the stack every time a nondeterministic step occurs. The best known algorithm to test membership in any context-free language is [[CYK algorithm#Extensions|Valiant's algorithm]], taking O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2.378&lt;/sup&gt;) time, where n is the length of the string. On the other hand, deterministic context-free languages can be accepted in O(''n'') time by an [[LR parser|LR(k) parser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Knuth | first1 = D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9111">In [[mathematics]], the '''difference of two squares''' is a [[Square (algebra)|squared]] (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number. Every difference of squares may be factored according to the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]

:&lt;math&gt;a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;

in [[elementary algebra]].

==Proof== 
The [[mathematical proof|proof]] of the factorization identity is straightforward. Starting from the [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side]], apply the [[distributive law]] to get 
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)(a-b) = a^2+ba-ab-b^2&lt;/math&gt;
By the [[commutative law]], the middle two terms cancel:
:&lt;math&gt;ba - ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;
leaving
:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting identity is one of the most commonly used in mathematics. Among many uses, it gives a simple proof of the [[AM–GM inequality]] in two variables.

The proof just given indicates the scope of the identity in [[abstract algebra]]: it will hold in any [[commutative ring]] ''R''.

Conversely, if this identity holds in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' for all pairs of elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the ring, then ''R'' is commutative.   To see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the original equation and get
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + ba - ab - b^2&lt;/math&gt;

and for this to be equal to &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt;, we must have

:&lt;math&gt;ba - ab = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all pairs ''a'', ''b'' of elements of ''R'', so the ring ''R'' is commutative.

==Geometrical demonstrations==
[[Image:Difference of two squares.svg|right|170px]]

The difference of two squares can also be illustrated geometrically as the difference of two square areas in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. In the diagram, the shaded part represents the difference between the areas of the two squares, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The area of the shaded part can be found by adding the areas of the two rectangles; &lt;math&gt;a(a-b) + b(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;, which can be factorized to &lt;math&gt;(a+b)(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore &lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;

Another geometric proof proceeds as follows: We start with the figure shown in the first diagram below, a large square with a smaller square removed from it. The side of the entire square is a, and the side of the small removed square is b. The area of the shaded region is &lt;math&gt;a^2-b^2&lt;/math&gt;. A cut is made, splitting the region into two rectangular pieces, as shown in the second diagram. The larger piece, at the top, has width a and height a-b. The smaller piece, at the bottom, has width a-b and height b. Now the smaller piece can be detached, rotated, and placed to the right of the larger piece. In this new arrangement, shown in the last diagram below, the two pieces together form a rectangle, whose width is &lt;math&gt;a+b&lt;/math&gt; and whose height is &lt;math&gt;a-b&lt;/math&gt;. This rectangle's area is &lt;math&gt;(a+b)(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;. Since this rectangle came from rearranging the original figure, it must have the same area as the original figure. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:Difference of two squares geometric proof.png]]

==Uses==
===Factorization of polynomials and simplification of expressions===
The formula for the difference of two squares can be used for factoring [[polynomial]]s that contain the square of a first quantity minus the square of a second quantity. For example, the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4 - 1&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

As a second example, the first two terms of &lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 + x - y&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;(x + y)(x - y)&lt;/math&gt;, so we have:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 + x - y = (x + y)(x - y) + x - y = (x - y)(x + y + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, this formula can also be used for simplifying expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2=(a+b+a-b)(a+b-a+b)=(2a)(2b)=4ab&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex number case: sum of two squares===
The difference of two squares is used to find the [[linear factors]] of the ''sum'' of two squares, using [[complex number]] coefficients.

For example, the complex roots of &lt;math&gt;z^2 + 4&lt;/math&gt; can be found using difference of two squares:

:&lt;math&gt;z^2 + 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = z^2 - i^2 \cdot 4&lt;/math&gt;    (since &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; = z^2 - (2 i)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = (z + 2 i)(z - 2 i)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the linear factors are &lt;math&gt;(z + 2 i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z - 2 i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the two factors found by this method are [[complex conjugate]]s, we can use this in reverse as a method of multiplying a complex number to get a real number. This is used to get real denominators in complex fractions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themathpage.com/alg/complex-numbers.htm#conjugates Complex or imaginary numbers] TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalising denominators===
The difference of two squares can also be used in the [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalising]] of [[irrational number|irrational]] [[denominator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themathpage.com/alg/multiply-radicals.htm Multiplying Radicals] TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This is a method for removing [[Nth root|surds]] from expressions (or at least moving them), applying to division by some combinations involving [[square root]]s.

For example:
The denominator of &lt;math&gt;\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{3} + 4}&lt;/math&gt; can be rationalised as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{5}{\sqrt{3} + 4}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{3} + 4} \times \dfrac{\sqrt{3} - 4}{\sqrt{3} - 4}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \dfrac{5(\sqrt{3} - 4)}{(\sqrt{3} + 4)(\sqrt{3} - 4)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \dfrac{5(\sqrt{3} - 4)}{\sqrt{3}^2 - 4^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \dfrac{5(\sqrt{3} - 4)}{3 - 16}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = -\dfrac{5(\sqrt{3} - 4)}{13}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the irrational denominator &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} + 4&lt;/math&gt; has been rationalised to &lt;math&gt;13&lt;/math&gt;.

===Mental arithmetic===
{{Main|Multiplication algorithm#Quarter square multiplication}}
The difference of two squares can also be used as an arithmetical short cut.  If you are multiplying two numbers whose average is a number which is easily squared the difference of two squares can be used to give you the product of the original two numbers.

For example: 
:&lt;math&gt; 27 \times 33 = (30 - 3)(30 + 3)&lt;/math&gt;

Which means  using the difference of two squares &lt;math&gt;27 \times 33&lt;/math&gt; can be restated as
 
:&lt;math&gt;a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;30^2 - 3^2 = 891&lt;/math&gt;.

===Difference of two consecutive perfect squares===

The difference of two consecutive [[square number|perfect square]]s is the sum of the two [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s ''n'' and ''n''+1. This can be seen as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
 (n+1)^2 - n^2 &amp; = &amp; ((n+1)+n)((n+1)-n) \\
           &amp; = &amp; 2n+1
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. Similarly, the difference of two arbitrary perfect squares is calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lcl}
 (n+k)^2 - n^2 &amp; = &amp; ((n+k)+n)((n+k)-n) \\
           &amp; = &amp; k(2n+k)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the difference of two even perfect squares is a multiple of 4 and the difference of two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8.

==Generalizations==
[[Image:Rhombus understood analytically.svg|thumb|right|Vectors {{math|'''a'''}}&amp;nbsp;(purple), {{math|'''b'''}}&amp;nbsp;(cyan) and {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}}&amp;nbsp;(blue) are shown with [[arrow (symbol)|arrows]]]]
The identity also holds in [[inner product space]]s over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real numbers]], such as for [[dot product]] of [[Euclidean vector]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf a}\cdot{\mathbf a} - {\mathbf b}\cdot{\mathbf b} = ({\mathbf a}+{\mathbf b})\cdot({\mathbf a}-{\mathbf b})&lt;/math&gt;
The proof is identical. By the way, assuming that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} have equal [[normed vector space|norms]] (which means that their dot squares are equal), it demonstrates [[analytic geometry|analytically]] the fact that two diagonals of a [[rhombus]] are [[right angle|perpendicular]].
===Difference of two nth powers===
If ''a'' and ''b'' are two elements of a commutative ring ''R'', then &lt;math&gt;a^n-b^n=\left(a-b\right)\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^{n-1-k}b^k\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that binomial coefficients do ''not'' appear in the second factor, and the summation stops at ''n''-1, ''not'' ''n''.

In [[number theory]], '''Euler's theorem''' (also known as the '''Fermat–Euler theorem''' or '''Euler's totient theorem''') states that if ''n'' and ''a'' are [[coprime]] positive integers, then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\varphi (n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]]. (The notation is explained in the article {{crossref|[[modular arithmetic]]}}.)  In 1736, [[Leonhard Euler]] published his proof of [[Fermat's little theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Leonhard Euler (presented:  August 2, 1736; published: 1741) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ssVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Theorematum quorundam ad numeros primos spectantium demonstratio"] (A proof of certain theorems regarding prime numbers), ''Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'', '''8''' : 141–146.
*  For further details on this paper, including an English translation, see:  [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E054.html The Euler Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] had presented without proof.  Subsequently, Euler presented other proofs of the theorem, culminating with "Euler's theorem" in his paper of 1763, in which he attempted to find the smallest exponent for which Fermat's little theorem was always true.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  L. Euler (published: 1763) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5uEAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Theoremata arithmetica nova methodo demonstrata"] (Proof of a new method in the theory of arithmetic), ''Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae'', '''8''' : 74–104.  Euler's theorem appears as "Theorema 11" on page 102.  This paper was first presented to the Berlin Academy on June 8, 1758 and to the St. Petersburg Academy on October 15, 1759.  In this paper, Euler's totient function, &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, is not named but referred to as "numerus partium ad ''N'' primarum" (the number of parts prime to ''N''; that is, the number of natural numbers that are smaller than ''N'' and relatively prime to ''N'').
*  For further details on this paper, see: [http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E271.html The Euler Archive].
*  For a review of Euler's work over the years leading to Euler's theorem, see: [http://people.wcsu.edu/sandifere/History/Preprints/Talks/Rowan%202005%20Euler's%20three%20proofs.pdf Ed Sandifer (2005) "Euler's proof of Fermat's little theorem"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The converse of Euler's theorem is also true: if the above congruence is true, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be coprime.

The theorem is a generalization of [[Fermat's little theorem]], and is further generalized by [[Carmichael function|Carmichael's theorem]].

The theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of &lt;math&gt;7^{222}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;7^{222} \pmod{10}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that 7 and 10 are coprime, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(10) = 4&lt;/math&gt;. So Euler's theorem yields &lt;math&gt;7^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}&lt;/math&gt;, and we get &lt;math&gt;7^{222} \equiv 7^{4 \times 55 + 2} \equiv (7^4)^{55} \times 7^2 \equiv 1^{55} \times 7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, when reducing a power of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are coprime), one needs to work modulo &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; in the exponent of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:
:if &lt;math&gt;x \equiv y \pmod{\varphi(n)}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^x \equiv a^y \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Euler's theorem is sometimes cited as forming the basis of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA encryption system]], however it is insufficient (and unnecessary) to use Euler's theorem to certify the validity of RSA encryption. In RSA, the net result of first [[encryption|encrypting]] a [[plaintext]] message, then later [[decryption|decrypting]] it, amounts to exponentiating a large input number by &lt;math&gt;k\varphi(n) + 1&lt;/math&gt;, for some positive integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In the case that the original number is relatively prime to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, Euler's theorem then guarantees that the decrypted output number is equal to the original input number, giving back the plaintext. However, because &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a product of two distinct primes, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, when the number encrypted is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, Euler's theorem does not apply and it is necessary to use the uniqueness provision of the [[Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese Remainder Theorem]]. The Chinese Remainder Theorem also suffices in the case where the number is relatively prime to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and so Euler's theorem is neither sufficient nor necessary.

== Proofs ==
1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the [[group (mathematics)|theory of groups]]:&lt;ref&gt;Ireland &amp; Rosen, corr. 1 to prop 3.3.2&lt;/ref&gt; 
The residue classes (mod ''n'') that are coprime to ''n'' form a group under multiplication (see the article [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n]] for details). The [[Order (group theory)|order]] of that group is &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Euler's totient function]]. [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] states that the order of any subgroup of a [[finite group]] divides the order of the entire group, in this case &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is any number [[coprime]] to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is in one of these residue classes, and its powers &lt;math&gt;a, a^2, \ldots, a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; are a subgroup. Lagrange's theorem says &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; must divide &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there is an integer &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;kM = \varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;. But then,
:&lt;math&gt;
a^{\varphi(n)} = 
a^{kM} = 
(a^{k})^M \equiv 
1^M =
1 \equiv 
1 \pmod{n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

2. There is also a direct proof:&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, thm. 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Landau, thm. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;R = \lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{\varphi(n)} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; be a [[reduced residue system]] (mod  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be any integer coprime to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; permutes the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;: in other words if &lt;math&gt;ax_j \equiv ax_k \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;j = k&lt;/math&gt;. (This law of cancellation is proved in the article [[Multiplicative group of integers modulo n#Group axioms|multiplicative group of integers modulo n]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bézout's lemma]]&lt;/ref&gt;) That is, the sets &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;aR = \lbrace ax_1, ax_2, \ldots, ax_{\varphi(n)} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;), are identical (as sets - they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is congruent (mod &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) to the product of all the numbers in &lt;math&gt;aR&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\prod_{i=1}^{\varphi(n)} x_i \equiv 
\prod_{i=1}^{\varphi(n)} ax_i =
a^{\varphi(n)}\prod_{i=1}^{\varphi(n)} x_i \pmod{n},
&lt;/math&gt; and using the cancellation law to cancel the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;s gives Euler's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;
a^{\varphi(n)}\equiv 1 \pmod{n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Euler quotient==

The '''Euler quotient''' of an integer ''a'' with respect to ''n'' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;q_n(a)=\frac{a^{\varphi(n)}-1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of Euler quotient is [[Fermat quotient]], it happens when ''n'' is prime.

A number ''n'' coprime to ''a'' which divides &lt;math&gt;q_n(a)&lt;/math&gt; is called generalized [[Wieferich number]] to base ''a''. In a special case, an odd number ''n'' which divides &lt;math&gt;q_n(2)&lt;/math&gt; is called Wieferich number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">In mathematics, '''Fenchel's duality theorem''' is a result in the theory of convex functions named after [[Werner Fenchel]].

Let ''&amp;fnof;'' be a [[proper convex function]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''g'' be a proper concave function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, if regularity conditions are satisfied,

:&lt;math&gt;\inf_x ( f(x)-g(x) ) = \sup_p ( g_\star(p)-f^\star(p)).&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;fnof;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[convex conjugate]] of ''&amp;fnof;'' (also referred to as the Fenchel&amp;ndash;Legendre transform) and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;*&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[concave conjugate]] of ''g''. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;f^{\star} \left( x^{*} \right) := \sup \left \{ \left. \left\langle x^{*} , x \right\rangle - f \left( x \right) \right| x \in \mathbb{R}^n \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\star} \left( x^{*} \right) := \inf \left \{ \left. \left\langle x^{*} , x \right\rangle - g \left( x \right) \right| x \in \mathbb{R}^n \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Mathematical theorem==
Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Banach spaces]], &lt;math&gt;f: X \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g: Y \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; be convex functions and &lt;math&gt;A: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a [[bounded operator|bounded]] [[linear map]].  Then the Fenchel problems:
:&lt;math&gt;p^* = \inf_{x \in X} \{f(x) + g(Ax)\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;d^* = \sup_{y^* \in Y^*} \{-f^*(A^*y^*) - g^*(-y^*)\}&lt;/math&gt;
satisfy [[weak duality]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;p^* \geq d^*&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that &lt;math&gt;f^*,g^*&lt;/math&gt; are the convex conjugates of ''f'',''g'' respectively, and &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjoint operator]].  The [[perturbation function]] for this [[dual problem]] is given by &lt;math&gt;F(x,y) = f(x) + g(Ax - y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that ''f'',''g'', and ''A'' satisfy either
# ''f'' and ''g'' are [[lower semi-continuous]] and &lt;math&gt;0 \in \operatorname{core}(\operatorname{dom}g - A \operatorname{dom}f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{core}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[algebraic interior]] and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dom}h&lt;/math&gt;, where ''h'' is some function, is the set &lt;math&gt;\{z: h(z) &lt; +\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, or
# &lt;math&gt;A \operatorname{dom}f \cap \operatorname{cont}g \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cont}&lt;/math&gt; are the points where the function is [[continuous function|continuous]].
Then [[strong duality]] holds, i.e. &lt;math&gt;p^* = d^*&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;d^* \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; then [[supremum]] is attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Techniques of Variational Analysis|last1=Borwein|first1=Jonathan|last2=Zhu|first2=Qiji|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-2026-3|pages=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-dimensional illustration==

In the following figure, the minimization problem on the left side of the equation is illustrated.  One seeks to vary ''x'' such that the vertical distance between the convex and concave curves at ''x'' is as small as possible.  The position of the vertical line in the figure is the (approximate) optimum.

[[File:FencheDual02.png]]

The next figure illustrates the maximization problem on the right hand side of the above equation.  Tangents are drawn to each of the two curves such that both tangents have the same slope ''p''. The problem is to adjust ''p'' in such a way that the two tangents are as far away from each other as possible (more precisely, such that the points where they intersect the y-axis are as far from each other as possible).  Imagine the two tangents as metal bars with vertical springs between them that push them apart and against the two parabolas that are fixed in place.

Fenchel's theorem states that the two problems have the same solution. The points having the minimum vertical separation are also the tangency points for the maximally separated parallel tangents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1440">In [[mathematical analysis]], '''Glaeser's continuity theorem''', is a characterization of the [[Continuous function|continuity]] of the [[derivative]] of the [[square root]]s of functions of class &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt;. It was introduced in 1963 by [[Georges Glaeser]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Glaeser, "Racine carrée d'une fonction différentiable", ''Annales de l'Institut Fourier'' 13, no 2 (1963), 203–210 : [http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AIF_1963__13_2_203_0 article]&lt;/ref&gt; and was later simplified by [[Jean Dieudonné]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Dieudonné, "Sur un théorème de Glaeser", ''J. Analyse math.'' 23 (1970), 85–88 : [http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/search/?an=0208.07503 Résumé Zbl], [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n466kr5205641643/fulltext.pdf?page=1 article p.85], [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n466kr5205641643/fulltext.pdf?page=2 article p.86], [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n466kr5205641643/fulltext.pdf?page=3 article p.87] (the p. 88, not shown on the free preview contains the reference to Glaeser)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem states: Let &lt;math&gt;f\ :\ U \rightarrow \R^{+}&lt;/math&gt; be a function of class &lt;math&gt;C^{2}&lt;/math&gt; in an open set ''U'' contained in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{f} &lt;/math&gt; is of class &lt;math&gt;C^{1}&lt;/math&gt; in ''U'' if and only if its partial derivatives of first and second order vanish in the zeros of ''f''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5116">Researchers have suggested a link between '''[[handedness]] and ability with [[mathematics]]'''.  This link has been proposed by [[Norman Geschwind|Geschwind]], Galaburda, Annett, and Kilshaw.  The suggested link is that a brain without extreme bias towards locating language in the left hemisphere would have an advantage in mathematical ability.&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;{{cite book|title=Handedness and Developmental Disorder|author=D. V. M. Bishop|pages=158&amp;ndash;159|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1990|isbn=978-0-521-41195-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Me_Lefty.jpg|thumb|Left hand signature]]

==Body of research==
===Douglas study===
A 1967 study by Douglas, found no evidence to correlate mathematical ability with [[left-handedness]] or [[ambidexterity]].  The study compared the people who came in the top 15% of a mathematics examination with those of moderate mathematical ability, and found that the two groups' handedness preferences were similar.  However, it did find that those who came lowest in the test had mixed hand preferences.  A study in 1979 by Peterson found a trend towards ''low'' rates of left-handedness in science students.&lt;ref name=Bishop /&gt;

===Jones and Bell study===
A 1980 study by Jones and Bell also obtained negative results.  This study compared the handedness of a group of engineering students with strong mathematics skills against the handedness of a group of psychology students (of varying mathematics skills).  In both cases, the distribution of handedness resembled that of the general population.&lt;ref name=Bishop /&gt;

===Annett and Kilshaw study===
Annett and Kilshaw themselves support their hypothesis with several examples, including a handedness questionnaire given to undergraduates.  Annett observes that studies that depend from voluntary returns of a handedness questionnaire are going to be biased towards left-handedness, and notes that this was a weakness of the study.  However, the results were that there were significantly more left-handers amongst male mathematics undergraduates than male non-mathematics undergraduates (21% versus 11%) and significantly more non-right-handers (44% versus 24%), and that there was a similar but smaller left-handedness difference for female undergraduates (11% versus 8%).  Annett reports the results of this study as being consistent with the hypothesis, for explaining the cause of handedness, of an absent genetic right-shift factor.&lt;ref name=Bishop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Annett&gt;{{cite book|title=Handedness and Brain Asymmetry|author=Marian Annett|pages=227&amp;ndash;228|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2002|isbn=978-1-84169-104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples used by Annett include a study that observed the hand use of teachers of mathematics and other sciences from various universities and polytechnics, as they underwent a personal interview, compared to a [[control group]] comprising non-mathematics teachers.  Again, a statistically significant difference was found for males, and again Annett states this to be consistent with the right-shift model. Further examples are a 1986 study by Benbow and a 1990 study by Temple of staff at the [[University of Oxford]], which, Annett states, show not that there is a predominance of left-handers in talented groups, whether that talent be with mathematics or otherwise, but rather that there is a shortfall in such groups of people who are strongly right-handed.&lt;ref name=Annett /&gt;

=== Benbow study ===
A study by C. P. Benbow did not work to prove the mathematical abilities of study participants who are left-hand dominant but to prove the weakness in those who are right-hand dominant. Using a series of questions that relate left-handedness and mathematical giftedness, Benbow was able to base their team's conclusion off of a series of questions that associated hand dominance and mathematical ability. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Etaugh|first=Claire|last2=Hoehn|first2=Sandra|date=April 1979|title=Handedness of Handedness Researchers|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2466/pms.1979.48.2.385|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=48|issue=2|pages=385–386|doi=10.2466/pms.1979.48.2.385|issn=0031-5125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ongoing Debate ===
As a controversial subject, the debate over the link between handedness and mathematical abilities is ongoing. Researchers at the University of Liverpool concluded that there is a moderate, yet significant correlation between mathematical skills and handedness. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2016/05/05/study-revisits-link-handedness-maths-ability/|title=Study finds link between handedness and mathematical skills - News - University of Liverpool|website=news.liverpool.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">In [[mathematics]], '''homotopical algebra''' is a collection of concepts comprising the ''nonabelian'' aspects of [[homological algebra]] as well as possibly the [[abelian category|abelian]] aspects as special cases.  The ''homotopical'' nomenclature stems from the fact that a  common approach to such generalizations is via [[abstract homotopy theory]], as in [[Higher-dimensional algebra#Nonabelian algebraic topology|nonabelian algebraic topology]], and in particular the theory of [[closed model category|closed model categories]].

This subject has received much attention in recent years due to new foundational work of [[Vladimir Voevodsky|Voevodsky]], [[Eric Friedlander|Friedlander]], [[Andrei Suslin|Suslin]], and others resulting in the [[A1 homotopy theory|'''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; homotopy theory]] for [[quasiprojective variety|quasiprojective varieties]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  Voevodsky has used this new algebraic homotopy theory to prove the [[Milnor conjecture]] (for which he was awarded the [[Fields Medal]]) and later, in collaboration with [[Markus Rost|M. Rost]], the full [[Bloch-Kato conjecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8665">In [[mathematics]], more specifically non-commutative [[ring theory]], [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], and [[module theory]], the '''Jacobson density theorem''' is a theorem concerning [[simple module]]s over a ring {{mvar|R}}.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem can be applied to show that any [[primitive ring]] can be viewed as a "dense" subring of the ring of [[linear transformation]]s of a vector space.&lt;ref&gt;Such rings of linear transformations are also known as [[full linear ring]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isaacs187"&gt;Isaacs, Corollary 13.16, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem first appeared in the literature in 1945, in the famous paper "Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions" by [[Nathan Jacobson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1990204 Jacobson, Nathan "Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions"]&lt;/ref&gt; This can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the [[Artin-Wedderburn theorem]]'s conclusion about the structure of [[simple ring|simple]] [[Artinian ring]]s.

==Motivation and formal statement==
Let {{mvar|R}} be a ring and let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module. If {{mvar|u}} is a non-zero element of {{mvar|U}}, {{math|''u'' • ''R'' {{=}} ''U''}} (where {{math|''u'' • ''R''}} is the cyclic submodule of {{mvar|U}} generated by {{mvar|u}}). Therefore, if {{mvar|u, v}} are non-zero elements of {{mvar|U}}, there is an element of {{mvar|R}} that induces an [[endomorphism]] of {{mvar|U}} transforming {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}}. The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} and {{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} separately, so that there is an element of {{mvar|R}} with the property that {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' • ''r'' {{=}} ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{mvar|i}}. If {{mvar|D}} is the set of all {{mvar|R}}-module endomorphisms of {{mvar|U}}, then [[Schur's lemma]] asserts that {{mvar|D}} is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are linearly independent over {{mvar|D}}.

With the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way:

:'''The Jacobson Density Theorem.''' Let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module, {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''X'' ⊂ ''U''}} a finite and {{mvar|D}}-linearly independent set. If {{mvar|A}} is a {{mvar|D}}-linear transformation on {{mvar|U}} then there exists {{math|''r'' ∈ ''R''}} such that {{math|''A''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' • ''r''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
In the Jacobson density theorem, the right {{mvar|R}}-module {{mvar|U}} is simultaneously viewed as a left {{mvar|D}}-module where {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, in the natural way: {{math|''g'' • ''u'' {{=}} ''g''(''u'')}}. It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on {{mvar|U}}.&lt;ref&gt;Incidentally it is also a {{math|''D''-''R''}} [[bimodule]] structure.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted before, Schur's lemma proves {{mvar|D}} is a division ring if {{mvar|U}} is simple, and so {{mvar|U}} is a vector space over {{mvar|D}}.

The proof also relies on the following theorem proven in {{harv|Isaacs|1993}} p.&amp;nbsp;185:

:'''Theorem.''' Let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module, {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and {{math|''X'' ⊂ ''U''}} a finite set. Write {{math|''I'' {{=}} ann&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}} for the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|R}}. Let {{mvar|u}} be in {{mvar|U}} with {{math|''u'' • ''I'' {{=}} 0}}. Then {{mvar|u}} is in {{mvar|XD}}; the {{mvar|D}}-[[linear span|span]] of {{mvar|X}}.

===Proof of the Jacobson density theorem=== 
We use [[mathematical induction|induction]] on {{math|{{!}}''X''{{!}}}}. If {{mvar|X}} is empty, then the theorem is vacuously true and the base case for induction is verified.

Assume {{mvar|X}} is non-empty, let {{mvar|x}} be an element of {{mvar|X}} and write {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''X''&amp;thinsp;\{''x''}.}} If {{mvar|A}} is any {{mvar|D}}-linear transformation on {{mvar|U}}, by the induction hypothesis there exists {{math|''s'' ∈ ''R''}} such that {{math|''A''(''y'') {{=}} ''y'' • ''s''}} for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}}. Write {{math|''I'' {{=}} ann&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. It is easily seen that {{math|''x'' • ''I''}} is a submodule of {{mvar|U}}. If {{math|''x'' • ''I'' {{=}} 0}}, then the previous theorem implies that {{mvar|x}} would be in the {{mvar|D}}-span of {{mvar|Y}}, contradicting the {{mvar|D}}-linear independence of {{mvar|X}}, therefore {{math|''x'' • ''I'' ≠ 0}}. Since {{mvar|U}} is simple, we have: {{math|''x'' • ''I'' {{=}} ''U''}}. Since {{math|''A''(''x'') − ''x'' • ''s'' ∈ ''U'' {{=}} ''x'' • ''I''}}, there exists {{mvar|i}} in {{mvar|I}} such that {{math|''x'' • ''i'' {{=}} ''A''(''x'') − ''x'' • ''s''}}.

Define {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''s'' + ''i''}} and observe that for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
y \cdot r &amp;= y \cdot(s + i) \\
&amp;= y \cdot s + y \cdot i \\
&amp;= y \cdot s &amp;&amp; (\text{since } i\in \text{ann}_R(Y)) \\
&amp;= A(y)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we do the same calculation for {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x \cdot r &amp;= x \cdot (s + i) \\
&amp;= x \cdot s + x \cdot i \\
&amp;= x \cdot s + \left ( A(x) - x \cdot s \right )\\
&amp;= A(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, {{math|''A''(''z'') {{=}} ''z'' • ''r''}} for all {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|X}}, as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets {{mvar|X}} of any size.

==Topological characterization==
A ring {{mvar|R}} is said to '''act densely''' on a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module {{mvar|U}} if it satisfies the conclusion of the Jacobson density theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Herstein, Definition, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; There is a topological reason for describing {{mvar|R}} as "dense". Firstly, {{mvar|R}} can be identified with a subring of {{math|End(&lt;sub&gt;''D&lt;/sub&gt;U'')}} by identifying each element of {{mvar|R}} with the {{mvar|D}} linear transformation it induces by right multiplication. If {{mvar|U}} is given the [[discrete topology]], and if {{mvar|U&lt;sup&gt;U&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given the [[product topology]], and {{math|End(&lt;sub&gt;''D&lt;/sub&gt;U'')}} is viewed as a subspace of {{mvar|U&lt;sup&gt;U&lt;/sup&gt;}} and is given the [[subspace topology]], then {{mvar|R}} acts densely on {{mvar|U}} if and only if {{mvar|R}} is [[dense set]] in {{math|End(&lt;sub&gt;''D&lt;/sub&gt;U'')}} with this topology.&lt;ref&gt;It turns out this topology is the same as the [[compact-open topology]] in this case. Herstein, p. 41 uses this description.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings.&lt;ref&gt;Herstein, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]]'s conclusion about the structure of [[simple ring|simple]] right [[Artinian ring]]s is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left [[primitive ring]]s as dense subrings of the ring of {{mvar|D}}-linear transformations on some {{mvar|D}}-vector space {{mvar|U}}, where {{mvar|D}} is a division ring.&lt;ref name="Isaacs187"/&gt;

==Relations to other results==
This result is related to the [[Von Neumann bicommutant theorem]], which states that, for a *-algebra {{mvar|A}} of operators on a [[Hilbert space]] {{mvar|H}}, the double commutant {{mvar|A′′}} can be approximated by {{mvar|A}} on any given finite set of vectors. See also the [[Kaplansky density theorem]] in the von Neumann algebra setting.

'''Libelle''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]] system, developed by the [[Federal Office for Information Security]]. The [[algorithm]] is not published, in an attempt to make [[cryptanalysis]] more difficult (following the principle of [[security through obscurity]] and against [[Kerckhoffs's principle]]). In order to keep the algorithm secret, it is only distributed as a microchip named Jupiter  and not as a piece of software.

It is possible to have a secret cipher algorithm while still reaping the benefits of public cryptography research: one way is to make a non-weakening change to a public algorithm, like changing the [[Nothing up my sleeve number]]s, or chaining the public cipher with an unrelated secret cipher.

A BSI specification document about Pluto gives these numbers: 64 bit block size, 160 bit key size.  Supported modes: [[Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#ECB|Electronic Codebook (ECB)]], [[Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC|Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)]], [[Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CFB|Cipher Feedback (CFB)]]/[[Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#OFB|Output Feedback (OFB)]] with 1,8,16,32 or 64 bits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10525">:''For mediant in music, see [[mediant]].  "Mediant" should not be confused with [[median]].''

In [[mathematics]], the '''mediant''' of two [[vulgar fraction|fraction]]s, generally made up of four positive integers

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{c} \quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad \frac{b}{d} \quad&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\quad \frac{a+b}{c+d}. &lt;/math&gt;

That is to say, the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of the mediant are the sums of the numerators and denominators of the given fractions, respectively. It is sometimes called the '''freshman sum''', as it is a common mistake in the early stages of learning about [[Fraction (mathematics)#Addition|addition of fractions]].

Technically, this is a [[binary operation]] on valid [[fractions]] (nonzero denominator), considered as [[ordered pair]]s of appropriate integers, a priori disregarding the perspective on [[rational numbers]] as equivalence classes of fractions. For example, the mediant of the fractions 1/1 and 1/2 is 2/3. However, if the fraction 1/1 is replaced by the fraction 2/2, which is an [[equivalent fraction]] denoting the same rational number 1, the mediant of the fractions 2/2 and 1/2 is 3/4. For a stronger connection to rational numbers the fractions may be required to be reduced to [[lowest terms]], thereby selecting unique representatives from the respective equivalence classes.

The [[Stern-Brocot tree]] provides an enumeration of all positive rational numbers via mediants in lowest terms, obtained purely by iterative computation of the mediant according to a simple algorithm.

==Properties==

* '''The mediant inequality:''' An important property (also explaining its name) of the mediant is that it lies strictly between the two fractions of which it is the mediant: If &lt;math&gt;a/c &lt; b/d &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then

::&lt;math&gt;\frac a c &lt; \frac{a+b}{c+d} &lt; \frac b d. &lt;/math&gt;

:This property follows from the two relations

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{c+d}-\frac a c={{bc-ad}\over{c(c+d)}} ={d\over{c+d}}\left( \frac{b}{d}-\frac a c \right)&lt;/math&gt; 
:and

::&lt;math&gt;\frac b d-\frac{a+b}{c+d}={{bc-ad}\over{d(c+d)}} ={c\over{c+d}}\left( \frac{b}{d}-\frac a c \right). &lt;/math&gt;

* Assume that the pair of fractions ''a''/''c'' and ''b''/''d'' satisfies the determinant relation &lt;math&gt;bc-ad=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then the mediant has the property that it is the ''simplest'' fraction in the interval (''a''/''c'', ''b''/''d''), in the sense of being the fraction with the smallest denominator. More precisely, if the fraction &lt;math&gt; a'/c' &lt;/math&gt; with positive denominator c' lies (strictly) between ''a''/''c'' and ''b''/''d'', then its numerator and denominator can be written as &lt;math&gt; \,a'=\lambda_1 a+\lambda_2  b &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \,c'=\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2  d &lt;/math&gt; with two ''positive'' real (in fact rational) numbers &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1,\,\lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;. To see why the &lt;math&gt; \lambda_i &lt;/math&gt; must be positive note that

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda_1 a+\lambda_2  b}{\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2  d }-\frac a c=\lambda_2 {{bc-ad}\over{c(\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2  d)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:and

::&lt;math&gt;\frac b d-\frac{\lambda_1 a+\lambda_2  b}{\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2  d }=\lambda_1 {{bc-ad}\over{d(\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2  d )}} &lt;/math&gt;

:must be positive. The determinant relation 
::&lt;math&gt;bc-ad=1 \, &lt;/math&gt; 
:then implies that both &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1,\,\lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt; must be integers,  solving the system of linear equations 
::&lt;math&gt;\, a'=\lambda_1 a+\lambda_2 b &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\, c'=\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2 d &lt;/math&gt;
:for &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1,\lambda_2 &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt; c'\ge c+d. &lt;/math&gt;

* The converse is also true: assume that the pair of [[reduced fraction]]s ''a''/''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''/''d''  has the property that the ''reduced'' fraction with smallest denominator lying in the interval (''a''/''c'',&amp;nbsp;''b''/''d'') is equal to the mediant of the two fractions. Then the determinant relation ''bc''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ad'' = 1 holds. This fact may be deduced e.g. with the help of [[Pick's theorem]] which expresses the area of a plane triangle whose vertices have integer coordinates in terms of the number v&lt;sub&gt;interior&lt;/sub&gt; of lattice points (strictly) inside the triangle and the number v&lt;sub&gt;boundary&lt;/sub&gt; of lattice points on the boundary of the triangle. Consider the triangle &lt;math&gt; \Delta(v_1,v_2,v_3)&lt;/math&gt; with the three vertices ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0,&amp;nbsp;0), ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''c''), ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (''b'',&amp;nbsp;''d''). Its area is equal to 
::&lt;math&gt; \text{area}(\Delta)={{bc-ad}\over 2} \ .&lt;/math&gt;
:A point &lt;math&gt; p=(p_1,p_2) &lt;/math&gt; inside the triangle can be parametrized as 
::&lt;math&gt; p_1=\lambda_1 a+\lambda_2 b,\; p_2=\lambda_1 c+\lambda_2 d,  
&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda_1\ge 0,\,\lambda_2 \ge 0, \,\lambda_1+\lambda_2 \le 1. \, &lt;/math&gt; 
:The Pick formula 
::&lt;math&gt; \text{area}(\Delta)=v_\mathrm{interior}+{v_\mathrm{boundary}\over 2}-1 
&lt;/math&gt;
:now implies that there must be a lattice point ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) lying inside the triangle different from the three vertices if ''bc''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''ad''&amp;nbsp;&gt;1 (then the area of the triangle is &lt;math&gt; \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;). The corresponding fraction ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies (strictly) between the given (by assumption reduced) fractions and has denominator

::&lt;math&gt; q_2=\lambda_1c+\lambda_2d \le \max(c,d)&lt;c+d 
&lt;/math&gt;
:as 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda_1+\lambda_2 \le 1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

*Relatedly, if ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' are reduced fractions on the unit interval such that |''ps''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''rq''| = 1 (so that they are adjacent elements of a row of the [[Farey sequence]]) then 
:&lt;math&gt;?\left(\frac{p+r}{q+s}\right) = \frac12 \left(?\bigg(\frac pq\bigg) + {}?\bigg(\frac rs\bigg)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where ? is [[Minkowski's question mark function]].

:In fact, mediants commonly occur in the study of [[continued fraction]]s and in particular, [[Farey fraction]]s. The ''n''th [[Farey sequence]] ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the (ordered with respect to magnitude) sequence of reduced fractions ''a''/''b'' (with [[coprime]] ''a'', ''b'') such that ''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''n''. If two fractions ''a''/''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''/''d'' are adjacent (neighbouring) fractions in a segment of F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; then the determinant relation &lt;math&gt; bc-ad=1&lt;/math&gt; mentioned above is generally valid and therefore the mediant is the ''simplest'' fraction in the interval (''a''/''c'',&amp;nbsp;''b''/''d''), in the sense of being the fraction with the smallest denominator. Thus the mediant will then (first) appear in the (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d'')th Farey sequence and is the "next" fraction which is inserted in any Farey sequence between ''a''/''c'' and ''b''/''d''. This gives the rule how the Farey sequences ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are successively built up with increasing ''n''.

==Graphical determination of mediants==

[[File:Mediant.png|thumb|Determining the mediant of two rational numbers graphically. The slopes of the blue and red segments are two rational numbers; the slope of the green segment is their mediant.]]
A positive [[rational number]] is one in the form &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; are positive [[natural numbers]]; ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{N}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of positive rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is, therefore, the [[Cartesian product]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; by itself; ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^{+}=(\mathbb{N}^{+})^2&lt;/math&gt;. A point with coordinates &lt;math&gt;(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; represents the rational number &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt;, and the slope of a segment connecting the origin of coordinates to this point is &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; are not required to be [[coprime]], point &lt;math&gt;(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; represents one and only one rational number, but a rational number is represented by more than one point; ''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;(4,2),(60,30),(48,24)&lt;/math&gt; are all representations of the rational number &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;. This is a slight modification of the [[Rational_number#Formal_construction|formal definition]] of rational numbers, restricting them to positive values, and flipping the order of the terms in the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; so that the slope of the segment becomes equal to the rational number.

Two points &lt;math&gt;(b,a)\neq(d,c)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{N}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; are two representations of (possibly equivalent) rational numbers &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c/d&lt;/math&gt;. The line segments connecting the origin of coordinates to &lt;math&gt;(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(d,c)&lt;/math&gt; form two adjacent sides in a parallelogram. The vertex of the parallelogram opposite to the origin of coordinates is the point &lt;math&gt;(b+d,a+c)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the mediant of &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c/d&lt;/math&gt;.

The area of the parallelogram is &lt;math&gt;bc-ad&lt;/math&gt;, which is also the magnitude of the [[cross product]] of vectors &lt;math&gt;\langle b,a\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle d,c\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It follows from the [[Rational_number#Formal_construction|formal definition of rational number equivalence]] that the area is zero if &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c/d&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent. In this case, one segment coincides with the other, since their slopes are equal. The area of the parallelogram formed by two consecutive rational numbers in the [[Stern-Brocot tree]] is always 1.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, David.

==Generalization==

The notion of mediant can be generalized to ''n'' fractions, and a generalized mediant inequality holds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Michael|last=Bensimhoun| url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Extension_of_the_mediant_inequality.pdf|format=PDF
| title = A note on the mediant inequality|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that seems to have been first noticed by Cauchy. More precisely, the weighted mediant &lt;math&gt;m_w&lt;/math&gt; of ''n'' fractions &lt;math&gt;a_1/b_1,\ldots,a_n/b_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_i w_i a_i}{\sum_i w_i b_i}&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;w_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;). It can be shown that &lt;math&gt;m_w&lt;/math&gt; lies somewhere between the smallest and the largest fraction among the &lt;math&gt;a_i/b_i&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43608">The '''model of hierarchical complexity''' is a framework for scoring how complex a [[behavior]] is, such as [[verbal reasoning]] or other [[cognitive]] tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robinson2013|Robinson, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of [[hierarchical]] complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized, in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"&gt;[[#Reference-Commons2007|Commons, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been developed by [[Michael Commons]] and others since the 1980s.

==Overview==
The model of hierarchical complexity (MHC) is a [[Formal system|formal theory]] and a [[mathematical psychology]] framework for scoring how complex a behavior is.&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsPekker2008|Commons &amp; Pekker, 2008]]; [[#Reference-Commonsetal2014|Commons et al., 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]] and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"&gt;[[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al., 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; it quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coombsetal1970|Coombs, Dawes, &amp; Tversky, 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984a|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984a]], [[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984b|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984b]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-LindsayNorman1977|Lindsay &amp; Norman, 1977]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1990|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1990]], [[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1993|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its forerunner was the general stage model.&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"/&gt;

Behaviors that may be scored include those of individual humans or their social groupings (e.g., organizations, governments, societies), animals, or machines. It enables scoring the hierarchical complexity of task accomplishment in any domain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-GiriCommonsHarrigan2014|Giri, Commons, &amp; Harrigan, 2014]]; but for a different view see: [[#Reference-Mascolo2008|Mascolo, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the very simple notions that higher order task actions:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
#are defined in terms of the next lower ones (creating hierarchy);
#organize the next lower actions;
#organize lower actions in a non-arbitrary way (differentiating them from simple chains of behavior).

It is [[cross-cultural]]ly and cross-species valid. The reason it applies cross-culturally is that the scoring is based on the mathematical complexity of the hierarchical organization of information. Scoring does not depend upon the content of the information (e.g., what is done, said, written, or analyzed) but upon how the information is organized.

The MHC is a non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] model of [[developmental stage theories|developmental stages]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; It specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding [[developmental stage theories|stages]]. It is different from previous proposals about developmental stage applied to humans;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[#Reference-InhelderPiaget1958|Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1958]]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of attributing behavioral changes across a person's age to the development of mental structures or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], this model posits that task sequences of task behaviors form hierarchies that become increasingly complex. Because less complex tasks must be completed and practiced before more complex tasks can be acquired, this accounts for the developmental changes seen, for example, in individual persons' performance of complex tasks. (For example, a person cannot perform [[arithmetic]] until the numeral representations of numbers are learned. A person cannot operationally multiply the sums of numbers until addition is learned).

The creators of the MHC claim that previous theories of stage have confounded the stimulus and response in assessing stage by simply scoring responses and ignoring the task or stimulus.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; The MHC separates the task or stimulus from the performance. The participant's performance on a task of a given complexity represents the stage of developmental complexity.

==Vertical complexity of tasks performed==
One major basis for this developmental theory is [[task analysis]]. The study of ideal tasks, including their instantiation in the real world, has been the basis of the branch of stimulus control called [[psychophysics]]. Tasks are defined as sequences of contingencies, each presenting stimuli and each requiring a behavior or a sequence of behaviors that must occur in some non-arbitrary fashion. The complexity of behaviors necessary to complete a task can be specified using the horizontal complexity and vertical complexity definitions described below. Behavior is examined with respect to the analytically-known complexity of the task.

Tasks are [[wikt:quantal|quantal]] in nature. They are either completed correctly or not completed at all. There is no intermediate state (''[[tertium non datur]]''). For this reason, the model characterizes all stages as [[P-hard]] and functionally distinct. The orders of hierarchical complexity are [[quantum|quantized]] like the [[electron]] [[atomic orbitals]] around the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]: each task difficulty has an order of hierarchical complexity required to complete it correctly, analogous to the atomic [[Slater determinant]]. Since tasks of a given quantified order of hierarchical complexity require actions of a given order of hierarchical complexity to perform them, the stage of the participant's task performance is equivalent to the order of complexity of the successfully completed task. The quantal feature of tasks is thus particularly instrumental in stage assessment because the scores obtained for stages are likewise discrete.

Every task contains a multitude of subtasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Overton1990|Overton, 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt; When the subtasks are carried out by the participant in a required order, the task in question is successfully completed. Therefore, the model asserts that all tasks fit in some configured sequence of tasks, making it possible to precisely determine the hierarchical order of task complexity. Tasks vary in complexity in two ways: either as ''horizontal'' (involving classical information); or as ''vertical'' (involving hierarchical information).&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

===Horizontal complexity===
Classical information describes the number of "yes–no" questions it takes to do a task. For example, if one asked a person across the room whether a penny came up heads when they flipped it, their saying "heads" would transmit 1 bit of "horizontal" information. If there were 2 pennies, one would have to ask at least two questions, one about each penny. Hence, each additional 1-bit question would add another bit. Let us say they had a four-faced top with the faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Instead of spinning it, they tossed it against a backboard as one does with dice in a game of [[craps]]. Again, there would be 2 bits. One could ask them whether the face had an even number. If it did, one would then ask if it were a 2. Horizontal complexity, then, is the sum of bits required by just such tasks as these.

===Vertical complexity===
Hierarchical complexity refers to the number of [[recursion]]s that the coordinating actions must perform on a set of primary elements. Actions at a higher order of hierarchical complexity: (a) are defined in terms of actions at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity; (b) organize and transform the lower-order actions (see Figure 2); (c) produce organizations of lower-order actions that are qualitatively new and not arbitrary, and cannot be accomplished by those lower-order actions alone. Once these conditions have been met, we say the higher-order action coordinates the actions of the next lower order.

To illustrate how lower actions get organized into more hierarchically complex actions, let us turn to a simple example. Completing the entire operation 3 × (4 + 1) constitutes a task requiring the [[distributive property|distributive]] act. That act non-[[arbitrarily]] orders adding and multiplying to coordinate them. The distributive act is therefore one order more hierarchically complex than the acts of adding and multiplying alone; it indicates the singular proper sequence of the simpler actions. Although simply adding results in the same answer, people who can do both display a greater freedom of mental functioning. Additional layers of abstraction can be applied. Thus, the order of complexity of the task is determined through analyzing the demands of each task by breaking it down into its constituent parts.

The hierarchical complexity of a task refers to the number of [[Abstract algebra|concatenation]] operations it contains, that is, the number of recursions that the coordinating actions must perform. An order-three task has three concatenation operations. A task of order three operates on one or more tasks of vertical order two and a task of order two operates on one or more tasks of vertical order one (the simplest tasks).

==Stages of development==
[[Stage theory|Stage theories]] describe [[Human evolution|human]] [[organism]]ic and/or [[Technological evolution|technological]] [[Evolution (term)|evolution]] as systems that move through a pattern of distinct stages over time. Here development is described formally in terms of the model of hierarchical complexity (MHC).

===Formal definition of stage===
Since actions are defined inductively, so is the function ''h'', known as the order of the hierarchical complexity. To each action ''A'', we wish to associate a notion of that action's hierarchical complexity, ''h(A)''. Given a collection of actions '''A''' and a participant ''S'' performing '''A''', the ''stage of performance'' of ''S'' on '''A''' is the highest order of the actions in '''A''' completed successfully at least once, i.e., it is: stage (''S'', '''A''') = max{''h(A)'' | ''A'' ∈ '''A''' and ''A'' completed successfully by ''S''}. Thus, the notion of stage is [[Classification of discontinuities|discontinuous]], having the same transitional gaps as the orders of hierarchical complexity. This is in accordance with previous definitions.&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsMiller2001|Commons &amp; Miller, 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"/&gt;

Because MHC stages are conceptualized in terms of the hierarchical complexity of tasks rather than in terms of mental representations (as in Piaget's stages), the highest stage represents successful performances on the most hierarchically complex tasks rather than intellectual maturity.

===Stages of hierarchical complexity===
The following table gives descriptions of each stage in the MHC.

==Relationship with Piaget's theory==
There are some commonalities between the [[Theory of cognitive development|Piagetian]] and Commons' notions of stage and many more things that are different. In both, one finds:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher-order actions defined in terms of lower-order actions. This forces the hierarchical nature of the relations and makes the higher-order tasks include the lower ones and requires that lower-order actions are hierarchically contained within the relative definitions of the higher-order tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher-order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions. This makes them more powerful. Lower-order actions are organized by the actions with a higher order of complexity, i.e., the more complex tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

What [[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al. (1998)]] have added includes:
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions in a non-arbitrary way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

This makes it possible for the model's application to meet real world requirements, including the empirical and analytic. Arbitrary organization of lower order of complexity actions, possible in the Piagetian theory, despite the hierarchical definition structure, leaves the functional correlates of the interrelationships of tasks of differential complexity formulations ill-defined.

Moreover, the model is consistent with the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. According to these theories, progression to higher stages or levels of cognitive development is caused by increases in processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. That is, higher-order stages place increasingly higher demands on these functions of information processing, so that their order of appearance reflects the information processing possibilities at successive ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Demetriou1998|Demetriou, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following dimensions are inherent in the application:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
# Task and performance are separated.
# All tasks have an order of hierarchical complexity.
# There is only one sequence of orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Hence, there is structure of the whole for [[ideal tasks]] and actions.
# There are transitional gaps between the orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Stage is defined as the most hierarchically complex task solved.
# There are discrete gaps in [[Rasch model|Rasch scaled]] stage of performance.
# Performance stage is different task area to task area.
# There is no structure of the whole—[[Horizontal and vertical décalage|horizontal décalage]]—for performance. It is not inconsistency in thinking within a developmental stage. Décalage is the normal modal state of affairs.

==Orders and corresponding stages==
The MHC specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding stages, positing that each of Piaget's substages, in fact, are robustly hard stages.&lt;ref name="CommonsCroneToddChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsCroneToddChen2014|Commons, Crone-Todd, &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; The MHC adds five postformal stages to Piaget's developmental trajectory: systematic stage 12, metasystematic stage 13, paradigmatic stage 14, cross-paradigmatic stage 15, and meta-cross-paradigmatic stage 16. It may be the Piaget's ''consolidate'' formal stage is the same as the ''systematic'' stage. The sequence is as follows: (0) calculatory, (1) automatic, (2) sensory &amp; motor, (3) circular sensory-motor, (4) sensory-motor, (5) nominal, (6) sentential, (7) preoperational, (8) primary, (9) concrete, (10) abstract, (11) formal, and the five postformal: (12) systematic, (13) metasystematic, (14) paradigmatic, (15) cross-paradigmatic, and (16) meta-cross-paradigmatic. The first four stages (0–3) correspond to Piaget's sensorimotor stage at which infants and very young children perform. Adolescents and adults can perform at any of the subsequent stages. MHC stages 4 through 5 correspond to Piaget's pre-operational stage; 6 through 8 correspond to his concrete operational stage; and 9 through 11 correspond to his formal operational stage.

More complex behaviors characterize multiple system models.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio1995|Kallio, 1995]]; [[#Reference-KallioHelkama1991|Kallio &amp; Helkama, 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt; The four highest stages in the MHC are not represented in Piaget's model. The higher stages of the MHC have extensively influenced the field of [[positive adult development]]. Some adults are said to develop alternatives to, and perspectives on, formal operations; they use formal operations within a "higher" system of operations. Some theorists call the more complex orders of cognitive tasks "[[postformal thought]]", but other theorists argue that these higher orders cannot exactly be labelled as postformal thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio2011|Kallio, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Reference-Jordan2018|Jordan (2018)]] argued that unidimensional models such as the MHC, which measure level of complexity of some behavior, refer to only one of many aspects of adult development, and that other variables are needed (in addition to unidimensional measures of complexity) for a fuller description of adult development.

==Empirical research using the model==
The MHC has a broad range of applicability.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; Its mathematical foundation permits it to be used by anyone examining task performance that is organized into stages. It is designed to assess development based on the order of complexity which the actor utilizes to organize information. The model thus allows for a standard [[Numerical data|quantitative]] analysis of developmental complexity in any cultural setting. Other advantages of this model include its avoidance of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] explanations, as well as its use of quantitative principles which are universally applicable in any context.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

The following practitioners can use the MHC to quantitatively assess developmental stages:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

Correlations of similar magnitude have been found in a number of the studies. The following are examples of tasks studied using the model of hierarchical complexity or [[Kurt W.

As of 2014, people and institutes from all the major continents of the world, except Africa, have used the model of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsChen2014|Commons &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the model is very simple and is based on analysis of tasks and not just performances, it is dynamic.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"/&gt; With the help of the model, it is possible to quantify the occurrence and progression of transition processes in task performances at any order of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ross2014|Ross, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mughal Architecture" is the type of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] developed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Iranian architecture|Persian]], Turkish and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of [[Babur]] at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson [[Akbar]] built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were [[Agra Fort]], the fort-city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Buland Darwaza]]. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] commissioned the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]].

Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], who constructed the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Jama Masjid (Delhi)|Jama Masjid]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens in Lahore]]. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.

==Monuments==
===Agra Fort===
{{main article|Agra fort}}
Agra fort is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in [[Agra]], Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by [[Akbar The Great]] during 1565 to 1574. The [[architecture]] of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the [[Rajput]] planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.

=== Humayun's Tomb===
{{main article|Humayun's Tomb}}
'''Humayun's tomb''' is the [[tomb]] of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress [[Bega Begum]] (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.

===Fatehpur Sikri===
{{main article|Fatehpur Sikri}}
Akbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/excavation-at-akbars-fort-at-fatehpur-sikri-reveals-flourishing-jain-and-hindu-habitation/1/243578.html|title=Excavation at Akbars fort at Fatehpur Sikri reveals flourishing Jain and Hindu habitation|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book/story-4DfRoVJ6tVxmWzz1RztA5I.html|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.

It contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration.  The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti.  The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...

The Haramsara, the royal seraglio  in [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in [[Ain-i-Akbari]], the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the [[eunuch]]s were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful [[Rajput]] guards.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page 146, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jodha Bai's Palace====
This is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor ''haramsara'' (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the [[facade]] to create a kind of [[porch]] leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of [[Hindu]] sculptural motifs. 
The glazed tiles on the roofs from [[Multan]] have an eye catching shade of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page151, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was built in honour of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani#The misnomer of Jodhabai|Jodha Bai]], mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar.  Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.

Buland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.

====Inscription====

A [[chronogram]] is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,

{{Quote|In the reign of King of the world Akbar,
To whom is due the order in the country.
The Sheikh-ul-Islam adorned the mosque.
Which for its elegance deserves as much reverence as the Ka'ba.
The year of the completion of this magnificent edifice.
Is found in the words: duplicate of the Masjidi'l-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta (2013), page 172-176, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hill", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The Tomb of [[Sheikh Salim Chishti]] is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350&amp;nbsp;ft. by 440&amp;nbsp;ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.

==Shah Jahan==
The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in [[Lahore]] was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.
Rather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at [[Agra Fort|Agra]], [[Delhi Fort|Delhi]] and [[Lahore Fort|Lahore]]. Some examples include the [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, the tomb of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Lahore Fort]] and the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the  [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], and [[Naulakha pavilion]], which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in [[Thatta]] called [[Shahjahan Mosque]]. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now [[Delhi]]. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-[[Diwan-i-Aam]] and [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.

===Taj Mahal===
{{main article|Taj Mahal}}

The Taj Mahal, a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the "[[teardrop on the cheek of time]]" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The building's longest [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[symmetry]] runs through the entire complex except for the [[sarcophagus]] of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror [[mosque]] in red sandstone, to complement the [[Mecca]]-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used "[[pietra dura]]", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.

==Aurangzeb and later Mughal architecture==
{{further information|Bibi Ka Maqbara}}
In [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with [[stucco]] ornament. [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Lucknow]] have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).

===Badshahi Masjid===
{{main|Badshahi Mosque}}
The [[Badshahi Mosque|Badshahi Masjid]] in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an [[Idgah (place)|''idgah'']]. The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The [[minarets]] are {{convert|196|ft|m}} tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=whc.unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1277/ |title=Badshahi Mosque, Lahore &amp;ndash; UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional monuments===
Additional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant [[Zinat al-Masjid]] in [[Daryaganj]] was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter [[Zinat-al-Nissa]]. Aurangzeb's sister [[Roshan-Ara]] who died in 1671. The tomb of [[Roshanara Begum]] and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]]  was a mausoleum built by Prince [[Azam Shah]], son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]]. The [[Alamgiri Gate]], built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

Another construction of the Mughal era is [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also known as "Fort Aurangabad"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.

==Mughal gardens==
{{main article|Mughal garden}}
[[File:Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness) terrace view from Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure) terrace.jpg|thumb|The [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]] are among the most famous Mughal gardens.]]
Mughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the [[Char Bagh]] gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as [[Pinjore]] Garden in [[Haryana]].

==Mughal bridges==
[[Shahi Bridge, Jaunpur]] was constructed during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9550">In [[quantum field theory]], a '''nonlinear ''σ'' model''' describes a [[scalar field]] {{mvar|Σ}} which takes on values in a nonlinear manifold called the '''target manifold''' &amp;nbsp;''T''. The non-linear ''σ''-model was introduced by {{harvtxt|Gell-Mann|Lévy|1960|loc=section 6}}, who named it after a field corresponding to a spinless meson called ''σ'' in their model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last2=Lévy | first1=M. | last1=Gell-Mann | first2=M. | title=The axial vector current in beta decay | publisher=Italian Physical Society | doi=10.1007/BF02859738 | year=1960 | journal=Il Nuovo Cimento | issn=1827-6121 | volume=16 | pages=705–726| bibcode=1960NCim...16..705G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The target manifold ''T'' is equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]]&amp;nbsp;''g''. {{mvar|Σ}} is a differentiable map from [[Minkowski space]] ''M'' (or some other space) to&amp;nbsp;''T''.

The [[Lagrangian density]] in contemporary chiral form&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gürsey | first1 = F. | title = On the symmetries of strong and weak interactions | doi = 10.1007/BF02860276 | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–240 | year = 1960 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1960NCim...16..230G }}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}g(\partial^\mu\Sigma,\partial_\mu\Sigma)-V(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;
where  we have used a +&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;− [[metric signature]] and the [[partial derivative]] {{math| ''∂Σ''}} is given by a section of the [[jet bundle]] of ''T''&amp;times;''M'' and {{mvar|V}} is the potential.

In the coordinate notation, with the coordinates {{math|''Σ&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'' where ''n'' is the dimension of&amp;nbsp;''T'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}={1\over 2}g_{ab}(\Sigma) (\partial^\mu \Sigma^a) (\partial_\mu \Sigma^b) - V(\Sigma).&lt;/math&gt;

In more than two dimensions, nonlinear ''σ'' models contain a dimensionful coupling constant and are thus not perturbatively renormalizable.
Nevertheless, they exhibit a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point of the renormalization group both in the lattice formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zinn-Justin | first= Jean | title= Quantum Field Theory and Critical Phenomena | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last= Cardy | first= John L. | title = Scaling and the Renormalization Group in Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the double expansion originally proposed by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brezin|first=Eduard|date=|year=1976|title=Renormalization of the nonlinear sigma model in 2 + epsilon dimensions|url=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=36|issue=|pages=691–693|bibcode=1976PhRvL..36..691B|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.36.691|pmid=|access-date=|via=|author2=Zinn-Justin, Jean}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In both approaches, the non-trivial renormalization-group fixed point found for the [[n-vector model|''O(n)''-symmetric model]] is seen to simply describe, in dimensions greater than two, the critical point separating the ordered from the disordered phase. In addition, the improved lattice or quantum field theory predictions can then be compared to laboratory experiments on [[critical phenomena]], since the ''O(n)'' model describes physical [[Heisenberg ferromagnet]]s and related systems. The above results point therefore to a failure of naive perturbation theory in describing correctly the physical behavior of the ''O(n)''-symmetric model above two dimensions, and to the need for more sophisticated non-perturbative methods such as the lattice formulation.

This means they can only arise as [[effective field theory|effective field theories]]. New physics is needed at around the distance scale where the two point [[connected correlation function]] is of the same order as the curvature of the target manifold. This is called the [[UV completion]] of the theory. There is a special class of nonlinear σ models with the [[internal symmetry]] group&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;*. If ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] and ''H'' is a [[Lie subgroup]], then the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] ''G''/''H'' is a manifold (subject to certain technical restrictions like H being a closed subset) and is also a [[homogeneous space]] of ''G'' or in other words, a [[nonlinear realization]] of&amp;nbsp;''G''. In many cases, ''G''/''H'' can be equipped with a [[Riemannian metric]] which is ''G''-invariant. This is always the case, for example, if ''G'' is [[compact group|compact]]. A nonlinear σ model with G/H as the target manifold with a ''G''-invariant Riemannian metric and a zero potential is called a quotient space (or coset space) nonlinear {{mvar|σ}} model.

When computing [[functional integration|path integrals]], the functional measure needs to be "weighted" by the square root of the [[determinant]] of&amp;nbsp;''g'',
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\det g}\mathcal{D}\Sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

==Renormalization==
This model proved to be relevant in string theory where the two-dimensional manifold is named '''worldsheet'''. Appreciation of its generalized renormalizability was provided by [[Daniel Friedan]].&lt;ref name="Frie80"&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Friedan|first=D.|authorlink=Daniel Friedan|title=Nonlinear models in 2+ε dimensions | journal = PRL | volume = 45 | issue = 13| pages = 1057 |publisher=|location=| year = 1980 | url = http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1057 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.1057 | bibcode=1980PhRvL..45.1057F}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the theory admits a renormalization group equation, at the leading order of perturbation theory, in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\frac{\partial g_{ab}}{\partial\lambda}=\beta_{ab}(T^{-1}g)=R_{ab}+O(T^2)~,&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;''}} being the [[Ricci tensor]] of the target manifold.

This represents a [[Ricci flow]], obeying [[Einstein field equations]] for the target manifold as a fixed point. The existence of such a fixed point is relevant, as it grants, at this order of perturbation theory, that [[conformal field theory|conformal invariance]] is not lost due to quantum corrections, so that the [[quantum field theory]] of this model is sensible (renormalizable). 

Further adding nonlinear interactions representing flavor-chiral anomalies results in the [[Wess–Zumino–Witten model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Witten |title=Non-abelian bosonization in two dimensions |journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] |volume= 92| issue= 4 |year=1984 | pages= 455–472 | doi= 10.1007/BF01215276|bibcode = 1984CMaPh..92..455W }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which 
augments the geometry of the flow to include [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], preserving renormalizability and leading to an [[infrared fixed point]] as well, on account of [[teleparallelism]] ("geometrostasis").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braaten | first1 = E. | last2 = Curtright | first2 = T. L. | last3 = Zachos | first3 = C. K. | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(85)90053-7 | title = Torsion and geometrostasis in nonlinear sigma models | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 260 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 630 | year = 1985 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1985NuPhB.260..630B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|Ricci flow}}

==O(3) non-linear sigma model==
A celebrated example, of particular interest due to its topological properties, is the ''O(3)'' nonlinear {{mvar|σ}}-model in 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 dimensions, with the Lagrangian density
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L= \tfrac{1}{2}\ \partial^\mu \hat n \cdot\partial_\mu \hat n &lt;/math&gt;
where  ''n&amp;#770;''=(''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'') with the constraint  ''n&amp;#770;''⋅''n&amp;#770;''=1 and {{mvar|μ}}=1,2. 

This model allows for topological finite action solutions, as at infinite space-time the Lagrangian density must vanish, meaning  ''n&amp;#770;'' = constant at infinity. Therefore, in the class of finite-action solutions, one may identify the points at infinity as a single point, i.e. that space-time can be identified with a [[Riemann sphere]]. 

Since the  ''n&amp;#770;''-field lives on a sphere as well, the mapping  {{math|''S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;→ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is in evidence, the solutions of which are classified by the second [[homotopy group]] of a 2-sphere: These solutions are called the O(3) [[Instantons]].

This model can also be considered in 1+2 dimensions, where the topology now comes only from the spatial slices. These are modelled as R^2 with a point at infinity, and hence have the same topology as the O(3) instantons in 1+1 dimensions. They are called sigma model lumps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">In [[proof theory]], '''ordinal analysis''' assigns [[ordinal number|ordinals]] (often [[large countable ordinals]]) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. The field was formed when [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1934 used [[cut elimination]] to prove, in modern terms, that the '''proof-theoretic ordinal''' of [[Peano arithmetic]] is [[epsilon zero|&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Definition==
Ordinal analysis concerns true, effective (recursive) theories that can interpret a sufficient portion of arithmetic to make statements about ordinal notations. The '''proof-theoretic ordinal''' of such a theory  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest recursive ordinal that the theory cannot prove is [[Well-founded relation|well founded]]&amp;mdash;the supremum of all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for which there exists a [[Kleene's O|notation &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; in Kleene's sense]] such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; proves that &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; is an [[ordinal notation]]. Equivalently, it is the supremum of all ordinals &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists a [[Computable function|recursive relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (the set of natural numbers) that [[well-order]]s it with ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; proves [[transfinite induction]] of arithmetical statements for &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The existence of any recursive ordinal that the theory fails to prove is well ordered follows from the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; bounding theorem, as the set of natural numbers that an effective theory proves to be ordinal notations is a &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_1&lt;/math&gt; set (see [[Hyperarithmetical theory]]).  Thus the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory will always be a countable ordinal less than the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\omega_1^{\mathrm{CK}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory is a good measure of the strength of a theory. If theories have the same proof-theoretic ordinal they are often [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]], and if one theory has a larger proof-theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.

'''PH''' has a simple [[descriptive complexity|logical characterization]]: it is the set of languages expressible by [[second-order logic]].

'''PH''' contains almost all well-known complexity classes inside '''PSPACE'''; in particular, it contains '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', and '''[[co-NP]]'''. It even contains probabilistic classes such as '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' and '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36593">'''Purchasing power parity''' ('''PPP''') is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] [[economic theory]] that states that the [[exchange rate]] between two countries is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective [[purchasing power]]. Theories that invoke the purchasing power parity assume that in some circumstances (for example, as a long-run tendency) it would cost exactly the same number of, for example, [[US dollar]]s to buy [[euro]]s and then buy a market basket of goods as it would cost to directly purchase the market basket of goods with dollars. A fall in either currency's purchasing power would lead to a proportional decrease in that currency's valuation on the [[foreign exchange market]].

The concept of purchasing power parity allows one to estimate what the exchange rate between two currencies would have to be in order for the exchange to be at par with the purchasing power of the two countries' currencies. Using that PPP rate for hypothetical currency conversions, a given amount of one currency thus has the same purchasing power whether used directly to purchase a market basket of goods or used to convert at the PPP rate to the other currency and then purchase the market basket using that currency. Observed deviations of the exchange rate from purchasing power parity are measured by deviations of the [[real exchange rate]] from its PPP value of 1.

PPP exchange rates help [[costing]] but exclude profits and above all do not consider the different [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] among countries. The same product, for instance, can have a different level of quality and even safety in different countries.  Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, when the GDP of one country measured in its own currency is converted to the other country's currency using market exchange rates, one country might be inferred to have higher [[real GDP]] than the other country in one year but lower in the other; both of these inferences would fail to reflect the reality of their relative levels of production. But if one country's GDP is converted into the other country's currency using PPP exchange rates instead of observed market exchange rates, the false inference will not occur. Essentially GDP PPP controls for the different costs of living and price levels, usually relative to the United States dollar, thus enabling a more accurate depiction of a given nation's level of production.

==Concept==

The idea originated with the [[School of Salamanca]] in the 16th century, and was developed in its modern form by [[Gustav Cassel]] in 1916, in ''The Present Situation of the Foreign Trade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassel|first=Gustav|date=December 1918|title=Abnormal Deviations in International Exchanges|publisher=The Economic Journal|volume= 28, No. 112|issue=112|pages=413–415|jstor=2223329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=princetonenc&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cheung |first=Yin-Wong|editor-last=Reinert|editor-first=Kenneth A.|editor2-last=Rajan |editor2-first=Ramkishen S.|editor3-last=Glass|editor3-first=Amy Jocelyn|editor4-first=Lewis S. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Davis|title=purchasing power parity|encyclopedia=The Princeton Encyclopedia of the World Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnEDno1hTegC&amp;pg=PA942|accessdate=2 October 2011|volume=I|year=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-12812-2 |page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept is based on the [[law of one price]], where in the absence of [[transaction cost]]s and official [[trade barrier]]s, identical goods will have the same price in different markets when the prices are expressed in the same currency.&lt;ref name=Krugman2&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation is that the difference in the rate of change in prices at home and abroad—the difference in the inflation rates—is equal to the percentage depreciation or appreciation of the exchange rate.

Deviations from parity imply differences in purchasing power of a "basket of goods" across countries, which means that for the purposes of many international comparisons, countries' GDPs or other national income statistics need to be "PPP-adjusted" and converted into common units. The best-known purchasing power adjustment is the [[Geary–Khamis dollar]] (the "international dollar"). The [[Exchange rate#Nominal and real exchange rates|real exchange rate]] is then equal to the nominal exchange rate, adjusted for differences in price levels. If purchasing power parity held exactly, then the real exchange rate would always equal one. However, in practice the real exchange rates exhibit both short run and long run deviations from this value, for example due to reasons illuminated in the [[Balassa–Samuelson theorem]].

There can be marked differences between purchasing power adjusted incomes and those converted via market exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/36a2d566-ad82-11dc-9386-0000779fd2ac.html|title=China, India economies ‘40% smaller’|first=Scheherazade|last= Daneshkhu|date=18 December 2007|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[World Bank|World Bank's]] ''World Development Indicators 2005'' estimated that in 2003, one [[Geary-Khamis dollar]] was equivalent to about 1.8 [[Renminbi|Chinese yuan]] by purchasing power parity&lt;ref&gt;[http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Table5_7.htm 2005 World Development Indicators: Table 5.7 | Relative prices and exchange rates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223140429/http://devdata.worldbank.org/wdi2005/Table5_7.htm |date=2007-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—considerably different from the nominal exchange rate. This discrepancy has large implications; for instance, when converted via the nominal exchange rates [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]] in [[India]] is about [[United States dollar|US$]]1,965&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by past and future GDP (nominal)]]&lt;/ref&gt; while on a PPP basis it is about US$7,197.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by future GDP (PPP) per capita estimates]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the other extreme, for instance [[Denmark|Denmark's]] nominal GDP per capita is around US$53,242, but its PPP figure is US$46,602, in line with other [[developed nations]].

==Uses==
The purchasing power parity exchange rate serves two main functions. PPP exchange rates can be useful for making comparisons between countries because they stay fairly constant from day to day or week to week and only change modestly, if at all, from year to year. Second, over a period of years, exchange rates do tend to move in the general direction of the PPP exchange rate and there is some value to knowing in which direction the exchange rate is more likely to shift over the long run.

==Measurement==
The PPP exchange-rate calculation is controversial because of the difficulties of finding comparable [[Market basket|baskets of goods]] to compare purchasing power across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor and Taylor|first=Alan and Mark|date=Fall 2004|title=The Purchasing Power Parity Debate|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/taylor&amp;taylor_PPP_JEP.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18| issue = 4|pages=135–158|via=|doi=10.1257/0895330042632744}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Estimation of purchasing power parity is complicated by the fact that countries do not simply differ in a uniform [[price level]]; rather, the difference in food prices may be greater than the difference in housing prices, while also less than the difference in entertainment prices. People in different countries typically consume different baskets of goods. It is necessary to compare the cost of baskets of goods and services using a [[price index]]. This is a difficult task because purchasing patterns and even the goods available to purchase differ across countries.

Thus, it is necessary to make adjustments for differences in the quality of goods and services. Furthermore, the basket of goods representative of one economy will vary from that of another: Americans eat more bread; Chinese more rice. Hence a PPP calculated using the US consumption as a base will differ from that calculated using China as a base. Additional statistical difficulties arise with multilateral comparisons when (as is usually the case) more than two countries are to be compared.

Various ways of averaging bilateral PPPs can provide a more stable multilateral comparison, but at the cost of distorting bilateral ones. These are all general issues of indexing; as with other [[price index|price indices]] there is no way to reduce complexity to a single number that is equally satisfying for all purposes. Nevertheless, PPPs are typically robust in the face of the many problems that arise in using market exchange rates to make comparisons.

For example, in 2005 the price of a gallon of gasoline in Saudi Arabia was USD 0.91, and in Norway the price was USD 6.27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/global_gasprices/|title=CNN/Money: Global gas prices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant differences in price would not contribute to accuracy in a PPP analysis, despite all of the variables that contribute to the significant differences in price. More comparisons have to be made and used as variables in the overall formulation of the PPP.

When PPP comparisons are to be made over some interval of time, proper account needs to be made of [[inflation]]ary effects.

===Law of one price===
Although it may seem as if PPPs and the [[law of one price]] are the same, there is a difference: the law of one price applies to individual commodities whereas PPP applies to the general price level. If the law of one price is true for all commodities then PPP is also therefore true; however, when discussing the validity of PPP, some argue that the law of one price does not need to be true exactly for PPP to be valid. If the law of one price is not true for a certain commodity, the price levels will not differ enough from the level predicted by PPP.&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

The purchasing power parity theory states that the exchange rate between one currency and another currency is in equilibrium when their domestic purchasing powers at that rate of exchange are equivalent.

===Big Mac Index===
{{Main article|Big Mac Index}}
[[File:Big Mac hamburger - Japan (3).jpg|thumb|[[Big Mac]] [[hamburger]]s, like this one from [[Japan]], are similar worldwide.]]
Another example of one measure of the [[law of one price]], which underlies purchasing power parity, is the Big Mac Index, popularized by ''[[The Economist]]'', which compares the prices of a [[Big Mac]] burger in [[McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]] restaurants in different countries. The Big Mac Index is presumably useful because although it is based on a single consumer product that may not be typical, it is a relatively standardized product that includes input costs from a wide range of sectors in the local economy, such as agricultural commodities (beef, bread, lettuce, cheese), labor (blue and white collar), advertising, rent and real estate costs, transportation, etc.

In theory, the law of one price would hold that if, to take an example, the Canadian dollar were to be significantly overvalued relative to the U.S. dollar according to the Big Mac Index, that gap should be unsustainable because Canadians would import their Big Macs from or travel to the U.S. to consume them, thus putting upward demand pressure on the U.S. dollar by virtue of Canadians buying the U.S. dollars needed to purchase the U.S.-made Big Macs and simultaneously placing downward supply pressure on the Canadian dollar by virtue of Canadians selling their currency in order to buy those same U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index|title=The Big Mac index|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigmacindex.org/|title=The Big Mac Index|website=The Big Mac Index|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The alternative to this exchange rate adjustment would be an adjustment in prices, with Canadian McDonald's stores compelled to lower prices to remain competitive. Either way, the valuation difference should be reduced assuming [[perfect competition]] and a perfectly [[Tradability|tradable good]]. In practice, of course, the Big Mac is not a perfectly tradable good and there may also be capital flows that sustain relative demand for the Canadian dollar.  The difference in price may have its origins in a variety of factors besides direct input costs such as government regulations and [[product differentiation]].&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

In some emerging economies, Western fast food represents an expensive niche product priced well above the price of traditional staples—i.e. the Big Mac is not a mainstream 'cheap' meal as it is in the West, but a luxury import. This relates back to the idea of product differentiation: the fact that few [[substitute good|substitutes]] for the Big Mac are available confers [[market power]] on McDonald's. For example, in India, the costs of local fast food like [[vada pav]] are comparative to what the Big Mac signifies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anand|last= Narasimhan|first2=Aparna |last2=Dogra|title=The case study: Goli Vada Pav|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ce990f92-f2b1-11e1-86e0-00144feabdc0.html#axzz30MFTybRw|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, with countries such as Argentina that have abundant beef resources, consumer prices in general may not be as cheap as implied by the price of a Big Mac.

The following table, based on data from ''The Economist'''s January 2013 calculations, shows the under (−) and over (+) valuation of the local currency against the U.S. dollar in %, according to the Big Mac index. To take an example calculation, the local price of a Big Mac in Hong Kong when converted to U.S. dollars at the market exchange rate was $2.19, or 50% of the local price for a Big Mac in the U.S. of $4.37. Hence the Hong Kong dollar was deemed to be 50% undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar on a PPP basis.

===iPad Index===
Like the [[Big Mac Index]], the iPad index (elaborated by [[Commonwealth Securities|CommSec]]) compares an item's price in various locations.  Unlike the Big Mac, however, each iPad is produced in the same place (except for the model sold in Brazil) and all iPads (within the same model) have identical performance characteristics.  Price differences are therefore a function of transportation costs, taxes, and the prices that may be realized in individual markets.  An iPad will cost about twice as much in Argentina as in the United States.

===KFC Index===
{{Main article|KFC Index}}

Similar to the [[Big Mac Index]], the [[KFC Index]] measures PPP amongst African countries, created by Sagaci Research (a [[market research]] firm focusing solely on Africa). Instead of comparing a [[Big Mac]], this index compares a [[KFC]] Original 12/15 pc. bucket.

For example, the average price of KFC’s Original 12 pc. Bucket in the United States in January 2016 was $20.50; while in Namibia it was only $13.40 at market exchange rates. Therefore, the index states the Namibian dollar was undervalued by 33% at that time.

===Gasoline===
GlobalPetrolPrices has published two world rankings comparing [[gasoline]] prices with average income and minimum wages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/articles/38/ Global Gasoline Affordability Ranking] - GlobalPetrolPrices, 14 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/articles/54/ Buying gasoline on minimum wage] - GlobalPetrolPrices, 23 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===OECD comparative price levels===
Each month, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] measures the difference in price levels between its member countries by calculating the ratios of PPPs for [[household final consumption expenditure|private final consumption expenditure]] to exchange rates. The OECD table below indicates the number of US dollars needed in each of the countries listed to buy the same representative basket of consumer goods and services that would cost 100 USD in the United States

According to the table, an American living or travelling in Switzerland on an income denominated in US dollars would find that country to be the most expensive of the group, having to spend 62% more US dollars to maintain a standard of living comparable to the US in terms of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].

===Measurement issues===

In addition to methodological issues presented by the selection of a basket of goods, PPP estimates can also vary based on the statistical capacity of participating countries. The [[International Comparison Program]], which PPP estimates are based on, require the disaggregation of national accounts into production, expenditure or (in some cases) income, and not all participating countries routinely disaggregate their data into such categories.

Some aspects of PPP comparison are theoretically impossible or unclear. For example, there is no basis for comparison between the Ethiopian laborer who lives on teff with the Thai laborer who lives on rice, because teff is not commercially available in Thailand and rice is not in Ethiopia, so the price of rice in Ethiopia or teff in Thailand cannot be determined. As a general rule, the more similar the price structure between countries, the more valid the PPP comparison.

PPP levels will also vary based on the formula used to calculate price matrices. Different possible formulas include GEKS-Fisher, Geary-Khamis, IDB, and the superlative method. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

Linking regions presents another methodological difficulty. In the 2005 ICP round, regions were compared by using a list of some 1,000 identical items for which a price could be found for 18 countries, selected so that at least two countries would be in each region. While this was superior to earlier "bridging" methods, which do not fully take into account differing quality between goods, it may serve to overstate the PPP basis of poorer countries, because the price indexing on which PPP is based will assign to poorer countries the greater weight of goods consumed in greater shares in richer countries.

==Need for adjustments to GDP==

The exchange rate reflects transaction values for [[tradable goods|traded goods]] ''between'' countries in contrast to non-traded goods, that is, goods produced for home-country use. Also, currencies are traded for purposes other than trade in goods and services, ''e.g.'', to buy [[capital asset]]s whose prices vary more than those of physical goods. Also, different [[interest rate]]s, [[speculation]], [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] or interventions by [[central bank]]s can influence the [[foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange market]].

The PPP method is used as an alternative to correct for possible statistical bias. The [[Penn World Table]] is a widely cited source of PPP adjustments, and the associated [[Penn effect]] reflects such a [[systematic bias]] in using exchange rates to outputs among countries.

For example, if the value of the [[Mexican peso]] falls by half compared to the [[US dollar]], the Mexican [[Gross Domestic Product]] measured in dollars will also halve. However, this exchange rate results from international trade and financial markets. It does not necessarily mean that Mexicans are poorer by a half; if incomes and prices measured in pesos stay the same, they will be no worse off assuming that imported goods are not essential to the quality of life of individuals. Measuring income in different countries using PPP exchange rates helps to avoid this problem.

PPP exchange rates are especially useful when official exchange rates are artificially manipulated by governments. Countries with strong government control of the economy sometimes enforce official exchange rates that make their own currency artificially strong. By contrast, the currency's black market exchange rate is artificially weak. In such cases, a PPP exchange rate is likely the most realistic basis for economic comparison. Similarly, when exchange rates deviate significantly from their long term equilibrium due to speculative attacks or carry trade, a PPP exchange rate offers a better alternative for comparison.

===Extrapolating PPP rates===

Since global PPP estimates—such as those provided by the ICP— are not calculated annually, but for a single year, PPP exchange rates for years other than the benchmark year need to be extrapolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.oecd.org/std/prices-ppp/2078177.pdf |title=Purchasing power parities – measurement and uses |authors=Paul Schreyer and Francette Koechlin |date=March 2002 |number=3 |journal=Statistics Brief |publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way of doing this is by using the country's [[GDP deflator]]. To calculate a country's PPP exchange rate in Geary–Khamis dollars for a particular year, the calculation proceeds in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ICPINT/Resources/270056-1255977254560/6483625-1291755426408/18_ICPBook_Extrapolating_FINAL.pdf|title=Chapter 18: Extrapolating PPPs and Comparing ICP Benchmark Results|publisher=[[World Bank]]|work=[[International Comparison Program]]|author=Paul McCarthy|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\textrm{PPPrate}_{X,i}=\frac{\textrm{PPPrate}_{X,b}\cdot \frac{\textrm{GDPdef}_{X,i}}{\textrm{GDPdef}_{X,b}}}{\textrm{PPPrate}_{U,b}\cdot \frac{\textrm{GDPdef}_{U,i}}{\textrm{GDPdef}_{U,b}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where PPPrate&lt;sub&gt;X,i&lt;/sub&gt; is the PPP exchange rate of country X for year i, PPPrate&lt;sub&gt;X,b&lt;/sub&gt; is the PPP exchange rate of country X for the benchmark year, PPPrate&lt;sub&gt;U,b&lt;/sub&gt; is the PPP exchange rate of the [[United States]] (US) for the benchmark year (equal to 1), GDPdef&lt;sub&gt;X,i&lt;/sub&gt; is the GDP deflator of country X for year i, GDPdef&lt;sub&gt;X,b&lt;/sub&gt; is the GDP deflator of country X for the benchmark year, GDPdef&lt;sub&gt;U,i&lt;/sub&gt; is the GDP deflator of the US for year i, and GDPdef&lt;sub&gt;U,b&lt;/sub&gt; is the GDP deflator of the US for the benchmark year.

==Difficulties==
There are a number of reasons that different measures do not perfectly reflect standards of living.

===Range and quality of goods===
The goods that the currency has the "power" to purchase are a basket of goods of different types:
# Local, non-tradable goods and services (like electric power) that are produced and sold domestically.
# Tradable goods such as non-perishable [[Commodity|commodities]] that can be sold on the international market (like [[diamond]]s).

The more that a product falls into category 1, the further its price will be from the currency [[exchange rate]], moving towards the PPP exchange rate. Conversely, category 2 products tend to trade close to the currency exchange rate. (See also [[Penn effect]]).

More processed and expensive products are likely to be [[tradable]], falling into the second category, and drifting from the PPP exchange rate to the currency exchange rate. Even if the PPP "value" of the Ethiopian currency is three times stronger than the currency exchange rate, it won't buy three times as much of internationally traded goods like steel, cars and microchips, but non-traded goods like housing, services ("haircuts"), and domestically produced crops. The relative price differential between tradables and non-tradables from high-income to low-income countries is a consequence of the [[Balassa–Samuelson effect]] and gives a big cost advantage to labour-intensive production of tradable goods in low income countries (like [[Ethiopia]]), as against high income countries (like [[Switzerland]]).

The corporate cost advantage is nothing more sophisticated than access to cheaper workers, but because the pay of those workers goes farther in low-income countries than high, the relative pay differentials (inter-country) can be sustained for longer than would be the case otherwise. (This is another way of saying that the wage rate is based on average local productivity and that this is below the per capita productivity that factories selling tradable goods to international markets can achieve.) An equivalent [[cost]] benefit comes from non-traded goods that can be sourced locally (nearer the PPP-exchange rate than the nominal exchange rate in which receipts are paid). These act as a cheaper [[factor of production]] than is available to factories in richer countries. It's difficult by the GDP PPP to consider the different quality of goods among the different countries.

The Bhagwati–Kravis–Lipsey view provides a somewhat different explanation from the Balassa–Samuelson theory. This view states that price levels for nontradables are lower in poorer countries because of differences in endowment of labor and capital, not because of lower levels of productivity. Poor countries have more labor relative to capital, so marginal productivity of labor is greater in rich countries than in poor countries. Nontradables tend to be labor-intensive; therefore, because labor is less expensive in poor countries and is used mostly for nontradables, nontradables are cheaper in poor countries. Wages are high in rich countries, so nontradables are relatively more expensive.&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

PPP calculations tend to overemphasise the primary sectoral contribution, and underemphasise the industrial and service sectoral contributions to the economy of a nation.

===Trade barriers and nontradables===
The law of one price, the underlying mechanism behind PPP, is weakened by transport costs and governmental trade restrictions, which make it expensive to move goods between markets located in different countries. Transport costs sever the link between exchange rates and the prices of goods implied by the law of one price. As transport costs increase, the larger the range of exchange rate fluctuations. The same is true for official trade restrictions because the customs fees affect importers' profits in the same way as shipping fees. According to Krugman and Obstfeld, "Either type of trade impediment weakens the basis of PPP by allowing the purchasing power of a given currency to differ more widely from country to country."&lt;ref name=Krugman&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman and Obstfeld|title=International Economics|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|pages=394–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They cite the example that a dollar in London should purchase the same goods as a dollar in Chicago, which is certainly not the case.

Nontradables are primarily services and the output of the construction industry. Nontradables also lead to deviations in PPP because the prices of nontradables are not linked internationally. The prices are determined by domestic supply and demand, and shifts in those curves lead to changes in the market basket of some goods relative to the foreign price of the same basket. If the prices of nontradables rise, the purchasing power of any given currency will fall in that country.&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

===Departures from free competition===
Linkages between national price levels are also weakened when trade barriers and imperfectly competitive market structures occur together. Pricing to market occurs when a firm sells the same product for different prices in different markets. This is a reflection of inter-country differences in conditions on both the demand side (''e.g.'', virtually no demand for pork in Islamic states) and the supply side (''e.g.'', whether the existing market for a prospective entrant's product features few suppliers or instead is already near-saturated). According to Krugman and Obstfeld, this occurrence of product differentiation and segmented markets results in violations of the law of one price and absolute PPP. Over time, shifts in market structure and demand will occur, which may invalidate relative PPP.&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

===Differences in price level measurement===
Measurement of price levels differ from country to country. Inflation data from different countries are based on different commodity baskets; therefore, exchange rate changes do not offset official measures of inflation differences. Because it makes predictions about price changes rather than price levels, relative PPP is still a useful concept. However, change in the relative prices of basket components can cause relative PPP to fail tests that are based on official price indexes.&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

==Global poverty line==
The global poverty line is a worldwide count of people who live below an international [[poverty line]], referred to as the dollar-a-day line. This line represents an average of the national poverty lines of the [[least developed country|world's poorest countries]], expressed in international dollars.  These national poverty lines are converted to international currency and the global line is converted back to local currency using the PPP exchange rates from the ICP. PPP exchange rates include data from the sales of high end none poverty related items which skews the value of food items and necessary goods which is 70 percent of poor peoples' consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/briefings/data/000201 Thomas Pogge on Global Poverty]&lt;/ref&gt; Angus Deaton argues that PPP indexes need to be reweighted for use in poverty measurement; they need to be redefined to reflect local poverty measures, not global measures, weighing local food items and excluding luxury items that are not prevalent or are not of equal value in all localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/presidential%20address%2019january%202010%20all.pdf Price indexes, inequality, and the measurement of world poverty Angus Deaton, Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25200">In [[neurophysiology]], several mathematical models of the [[action potential]] have been developed, which fall into two basic types. The first type seeks to model the experimental data quantitatively, i.e., to reproduce the measurements of current and voltage exactly. The renowned [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] of the axon from the ''[[Loligo]]'' squid exemplifies such models.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" &gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]], [[Bernard Katz|Katz B]] |title = Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo | journal = Journal of Physiology | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 424&amp;ndash;448 | pmid = 14946713 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392213 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004717}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] |title = Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo|journal=Journal of Physiology | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 449&amp;ndash;472 | pmid = 14946713 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392213 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004717}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = The components of membrane conductance in the giant axon of Loligo | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages= 473&amp;ndash;496 | pmid = 14946714 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392209 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004718}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = The dual effect of membrane potential on sodium conductance in the giant axon of Loligo | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 116 | pages = 497&amp;ndash;506 | pmid = 14946715 | issue=4 | pmc=1392212 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004719}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin AL]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley AF]] | title = A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve | journal = J Physiol | year = 1952 | volume = 117 | pages = 500&amp;ndash;544 | pmid = 12991237 | issue = 4 | pmc = 1392413 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although qualitatively correct, the H-H model does not describe every type of excitable membrane accurately, since it considers only two ions (sodium and potassium), each with only one type of voltage-sensitive channel.

==Hodgkin–Huxley model==
{{main|Hodgkin–Huxley model}}

[[File:MembraneCircuit.svg|thumb|right|448px|Equivalent electrical circuit for the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the action potential. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the current through, and the voltage across, a small patch of membrane, respectively. The ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the capacitance of the membrane patch, whereas the four ''g'''s represent the [[electrical conductance|conductances]] of four types of ions. The two conductances on the left, for potassium (K) and sodium (Na), are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage, corresponding to the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive ion channels]].]]

In 1952 [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] developed a set of equations to fit their experimental voltage-clamp data on the axonal membrane.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson ME, Rinzel J | year= 1994|chapter= The Hodgkin–Huxley Model|title=The Book of GENESIS: Exploring Realistic Neural Models with the GEneral NEural SImulation System|veditors=Bower J, Beeman D | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York|pages= 29–49 | chapterurl=http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/chapt4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes that the membrane capacitance ''C'' is constant; thus, the transmembrane voltage ''V'' changes with the total transmembrane current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
C \frac{dV}{dt} = I_{\mathrm{tot}} = I_{\mathrm{ext}} + I_{\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\mathrm{K}} + I_{\mathrm{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are currents conveyed through the local sodium channels, potassium channels, and "leakage" channels (a catch-all), respectively. The initial term ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; represents the current arriving from external sources, such as [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s from the dendrites or a scientist's electrode.

The model further assumes that a given ion channel is either fully open or closed; if closed, its [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] is zero, whereas if open, its conductance is some constant value ''g''. Hence, the net current through an ion channel depends on two variables: the probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open&lt;/sub&gt; of the channel being open, and the difference in voltage from that ion's equilibrium voltage, ''V'' &amp;minus; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the current through the potassium channel may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
I_{\mathrm{K}} = g_{\mathrm{K}} \left( V - E_{\mathrm{K}} \right) p_{\mathrm{open, K}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to [[Ohm's law]]. By definition, no net current flows (''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) when the transmembrane voltage equals the equilibrium voltage of that ion (when ''V'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

To fit their data accurately, Hodgkin and Huxley assumed that each type of ion channel had multiple "gates", so that the channel was open only if all the gates were open and closed otherwise. They also assumed that the probability of a gate being open was independent of the other gates being open; this assumption was later validated for the inactivation gate.&lt;ref name="armstrong_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong CM, Bezanilla F, Rojas E | year = 1973 | title = Destruction of Sodium Conductance Inactivation in Squid Axons Perfused with Pronase |pmid=4755846 | journal = J.

Physiol. | volume = 262 | pages = 501&amp;ndash;531 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the voltage-sensitive potassium channel as having four gates; letting ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the probability of a single such gate being open, the probability of the whole channel being open is the product of four such probabilities, i.e., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the probability of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel was modeled to have three similar gates of probability ''m'' and a fourth gate, associated with inactivation, of probability ''h''; thus, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, Na&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''h''. The probabilities for each gate are assumed to obey [[rate equation|first-order kinetics]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dm}{dt} = - \frac{m - m_{\mathrm{eq}}}{\tau_{m}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where both the equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; and the relaxation time constant τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; depend on the instantaneous voltage ''V'' across the membrane. If ''V'' changes on a time-scale more slowly than τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''m'' probability will always roughly equal its equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;; however, if ''V'' changes more quickly, then ''m'' will lag behind ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. By fitting their voltage-clamp data, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to model how these equilibrium values and time constants varied with temperature and transmembrane voltage.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt; The formulae are complex and depend exponentially on the voltage and temperature. For example, the time constant for sodium-channel activation probability ''h'' varies as 3&lt;sup&gt;(θ&amp;minus;6.3)/10&lt;/sup&gt; with the Celsius temperature θ, and with voltage ''V'' as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\tau_{h}} = 0.07 e^{-V/20} + \frac{1}{1 + e^{3 - V/10}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In summary, the Hodgkin–Huxley equations are complex, non-linear [[ordinary differential equation]]s in four [[independent variable]]s: the transmembrane voltage ''V'', and the probabilities ''m'', ''h'' and ''n''.&lt;ref name="sato_2005" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sato S, Fukai H, Nomura T, Doi S | year = 2005 | chapter = Bifurcation Analysis of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations | title = Modeling in the Neurosciences: From Biological Systems to Neuromimetic Robotics | edition = 2nd |veditors=Reeke GN, Poznanski RR, Lindsay KA, Rosenberg JR, Sporns O | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | isbn = 978-0-415-32868-5 | pages = 459&amp;ndash;478}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general solution of these equations has been discovered.

==Fitzhugh-Nagumo model==

[[File:Negative differential resistance.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure FHN: To mimick the action potential, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and its relatives use a function ''g''(''V'') with [[negative differential resistance]] (a negative slope on the ''I'' vs. ''V'' plot).

This [[van der Pol oscillator|van der Pol]] equation has stimulated much research in the mathematics of nonlinear [[dynamical system]]s.

A hybrid of the Hodgkin–Huxley and FitzHugh–Nagumo models was developed by Morris and Lecar in 1981, and applied to the [[muscle]] fiber of [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name="morris_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris C, Lecar H | year = 1981 | title = Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;213 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84782-0 | pmc = 1327511 | pmid=7260316 | bibcode=1981BpJ....35..193M}}&lt;/ref&gt; True to the barnacle's physiology, the Morris–Lecar model replaces the voltage-gated sodium current of the Hodgkin–Huxley model with a voltage-dependent calcium current. There is no inactivation (no ''h'' variable) and the calcium current equilibrates instantaneously, so that again, there are only two time-dependent variables: the transmembrane voltage ''V'' and the potassium gate probability ''n''. The bursting, entrainment and other mathematical properties of this model have been studied in detail.&lt;ref name="rinzel_1989" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rinzel J, Ermentrout GB | year = 1989 | chapter = Analysis of Neural Excitability and Oscillations | title = Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks | editor = [[Christof Koch|C.

The simplest models of the action potential are the "flush and fill" models (also called "integrate-and-fire" models), in which the input signal is summed (the "fill" phase) until it reaches a threshold, firing a pulse and resetting the summation to zero (the "flush" phase).&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keener_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keener JP, Hoppensteadt FC, Rinzel J | year = 1981 | title = Integrate-and-fire models of nerve membrane response to oscillatory input | journal = SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume = 41 | pages = 503&amp;ndash;517 | doi = 10.1137/0141042 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these models are capable of exhibiting [[entrainment (physics)|entrainment]], which is [[entrainment (biomusicology)|commonly observed]] in nervous systems.&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;

Whereas the above models simulate the transmembrane voltage and current at a single patch of membrane, other mathematical models pertain to the voltages and currents in the ionic solution surrounding the neuron.&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" &gt;{{cite book | author = Stevens, Charles F. | year = 1966 | title = Neurophysiology: A Primer | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 161&amp;ndash;173 | lccn = 66015872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such models are helpful in interpreting data from extracellular electrodes, which were common prior to the invention of the glass pipette electrode that allowed intracellular recording.&lt;ref name="ling_1949" &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ling G, Gerard RW | year = 1949 | title = The normal membrane potential of frog sartorius fibers | journal = J.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''j''' and '''E''' are vectors representing the [[current density]] and [[electric field]], respectively, and where σ is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  Thus, '''j''' can be found from '''E''', which in turn may be found using [[Maxwell's equations]].  Maxwell's equations can be reduced to a relatively simple problem of [[electrostatics]], since the ionic concentrations change too slowly (compared to the [[speed of light]]) for [[magnetic field|magnetic effects]] to be important.  The [[electric potential]] φ('''x''') at any extracellular point '''x''' can be solved using [[Green's identities]]&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">In [[differential geometry]], a '''quaternion-Kähler symmetric space''' or '''Wolf space''' is a [[quaternion-Kähler manifold]] which, as a Riemannian manifold, is a [[Riemannian symmetric space]]. Any quaternion-Kähler symmetric space with positive Ricci curvature is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected]], and is a Riemannian product of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces associated to compact [[simple Lie group]]s.

For any compact simple Lie group ''G'', there is a unique  ''G''/''H'' obtained as a quotient of ''G'' by a subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; H = K \cdot \mathrm{Sp}(1).\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, Sp(1) is the compact form of the SL(2)-triple associated with the highest root of ''G'', and ''K'' its [[centralizer]] in ''G''. These are classified as follows.

The [[quaternion-Kähler manifold#Twistor spaces|twistor spaces]] of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are the homogeneous holomorphic [[contact manifold]]s, classified by Boothby: they are the [[adjoint variety|adjoint varieties]] of the complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s.

These spaces can be obtained by taking a [[projectivization]] of
a minimal [[nilpotent orbit]] of the respective complex Lie group.
The holomorphic contact structure is apparent, because
the nilpotent orbits of semisimple Lie groups 
are equipped with the [[Kirillov-Kostant form|Kirillov-Kostant]] holomorphic symplectic form. This argument also explains how one
can associate a unique Wolf space to each of the simple
complex Lie groups.

'''Raymond Edward Alan Christopher Paley''' (7 January 1907 – 7 April 1933) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]]. Paley was born in [[Bournemouth, England]]. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]]. From there he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he showed himself as a brilliant student.  He won a [[Smith's Prize]] in 1930 and was
elected a fellow of Trinity College.

His contributions include the [[Paley construction]] for [[Hadamard matrix|Hadamard matrices]] (closely related to the [[Paley graph]]s in [[graph theory]]) and his collaboration with [[Norbert Wiener]] in the [[Paley–Wiener theorem]] ([[harmonic analysis]]). He collaborated with [[Antoni Zygmund|A. Zygmund]] on [[Fourier series]] (see also [[Paley–Zygmund inequality]]) and worked with [[J. E. Littlewood]] on what became known as [[Littlewood–Paley theory]], an application of real-variable techniques in [[complex analysis]].

In 1932, he introduced the dyadic basis (the so-called '''Paley order'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;) with regard to [[Walsh functions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|pages=1072–1073|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 1933, Paley died in a [[skiing]] accident when skiing alone at an altitude of 9,600 ft in [[Banff, Alberta]]. He was killed by an avalanche at Deception Pass, [[Fossil Mountain (Alberta)|Fossil Mountain]], in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. His death was witnessed by companions lower down the mountainside. Park wardens and a member of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] recovered the body.  He is buried in the Banff town cemetery.

The values of the sums converge as the subintervals halve from top-left to bottom-right.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''Riemann sum''' is a certain kind of [[approximation]] of an integral by a finite sum. It is named after nineteenth century German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations. 

The sum is calculated by dividing the region up into shapes ([[rectangle]]s, [[trapezoid]]s, [[parabola]]s, or [[cubic function|cubics]]) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a [[definite integral]] even if the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] does not make it easy to find a [[Closed-form_expression|closed-form solution]].

Because the region filled by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the [[Riemann integral]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;f: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; be a function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; of the real numbers, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;P = \left \{[x_0,x_1],[x_1,x_2],\dots,[x_{n-1},x_n] \right \}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;#8288;,
be [[Partition of an interval|a partition of ''I'']], where
:&lt;math&gt;a=x_0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\cdots&lt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;.
A '''Riemann sum''' &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of ''f'' over ''I'' with partition ''P'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*)\, \Delta x_i&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i=x_i-x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;x_i^*\in[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hughes-Hallet |first1=Deborah |last2=McCullum |first2=William G. |displayauthors=etal |year=2005 |title=Calculus |edition=4th |publisher=Wiley |page=252}} (Among many equivalent variations on the definition, this reference closely resembles the one given here.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Notice the use of "an" instead of "the" in the previous sentence. Another way of thinking about this asterisk is that you are choosing some random point in this slice, and it does not matter which one; as the difference or width of the slices approaches zero, the only point we can pick is the point our rectangle slice is at. This is due to the fact that the choice of &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, so for any given function ''f'' defined on an interval ''I'' and a fixed partition ''P'', one might produce different Riemann sums depending on which &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; is chosen, as long as &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}\le x_i^* \le x_i&lt;/math&gt; holds true.

==Some specific types of Riemann sums==
Specific choices of &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; give us different types of Riemann sums:
* If &lt;math&gt;x_i^*=x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', then ''S'' is called a '''left rule'''&lt;ref name=rulenames&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hughes-Hallet |first1=Deborah |last2=McCullum |first2=William G. |displayauthors=etal |year=2005 |title=Calculus |edition=4th |publisher=Wiley |page=340 |quote=So far, we have three ways of estimating an integral using a Riemann sum: 1. The '''left rule''' uses the left endpoint of each subinterval. 2. The '''right rule''' uses the right endpoint of each subinterval. 3. The '''midpoint rule''' uses the midpoint of each subinterval.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rulenames2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostebee |first1=Arnold |last2=Zorn |first2=Paul |year=2002 |title=Calculus from Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View |edition=Second |page=M-33 |quote=Left-rule, right-rule, and midpoint-rule approximating sums all fit this definition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''left Riemann sum'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;x_i^*=x_i&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', then ''S'' is called a '''right rule'''&lt;ref name=rulenames/&gt;&lt;ref name=rulenames2/&gt; or '''right Riemann sum'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;x_i^*=(x_i+x_{i-1})/2&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', then ''S'' is called the '''midpoint rule'''&lt;ref name=rulenames/&gt;&lt;ref name=rulenames2/&gt; or '''middle Riemann sum'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;f(x_i^*) = \sup f([x_{i-1},x_i])&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the [[supremum]] of ''f'' over &lt;math&gt;[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt;), then ''S'' is defined to be an '''upper Riemann sum''' or '''upper Darboux sum'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;f(x_i^*) = \inf f([x_{i-1},x_i])&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the [[infimum]] of ''f'' over &lt;math&gt;[x_{i-1},x_i]&lt;/math&gt;), then ''S'' is defined to be an '''lower Riemann sum''' or '''lower Darboux sum'''.

All these methods are among the most basic ways to accomplish [[numerical integration]]. Loosely speaking, a function is [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrable]] if all Riemann sums converge as the partition "gets finer and finer".

While not technically a Riemann sum, the average of the left and right Riemann sum is the '''[[trapezoidal rule|trapezoidal sum]]''' and is one of the simplest of a very general way of approximating integrals using weighted averages. This is followed in complexity by [[Simpson's rule]] and [[Newton–Cotes formulas]].

Any Riemann sum on a given partition (that is, for any choice of &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;) is contained between the lower and upper Darboux sums. This forms the basis of the [[Darboux integral]], which is ultimately equivalent to the Riemann integral.

==Methods==
The four methods of Riemann summation are usually best approached with partitions of equal size. The interval [''a'', ''b''] is therefore divided into ''n'' subintervals, each of length 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The points in the partition will then be 

: &lt;math&gt;a, a + \Delta x, a + 2 \,\Delta x, \ldots, a + (n-2) \,\Delta x, a + (n-1)\,\Delta x, b.&lt;/math&gt;

===Left Riemann sum===
[[Image:LeftRiemann2.svg|thumb|right|Left Riemann sum of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions]]
For the left Riemann sum, approximating the function by its value at the left-end point gives multiple rectangles with base Δ''x'' and height ''f''(''a'' + ''i''Δ''x''). Doing this for ''i'' = 0, 1, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, and adding up the resulting areas gives

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \left[f(a) + f(a + \Delta x) + f(a + 2 \,\Delta x)+\cdots+f(b - \Delta x)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The left Riemann sum amounts to an overestimation if ''f'' is [[monotonically decreasing]] on this interval, and an underestimation if it is [[monotonically increasing]].

===Right Riemann sum===
[[Image:RightRiemann2.svg|thumb|right|Right Riemann sum of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions]]
''f'' is here approximated by the value at the right endpoint. This gives multiple rectangles with base Δ''x'' and height ''f''(''a'' + ''i''&amp;nbsp;Δ''x''). Doing this for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n'', and adding up the resulting areas produces 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \left[ f( a + \Delta x ) + f(a + 2 \, \Delta x)+\cdots+f(b) \right].&lt;/math&gt;

The right Riemann sum amounts to an underestimation if ''f'' is [[monotonically decreasing]], and an overestimation if it is [[monotonically increasing]].
The error of this formula will be 

:&lt;math&gt;\left \vert \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx - A_\mathrm{right} \right \vert \le \frac{M_1 (b-a)^2}{2n}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum value of the [[absolute value]] of &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the interval.

===Midpoint rule===
[[Image:MidRiemann2.svg|thumb|right|Midpoint Riemann sum of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions]]
Approximating ''f'' at the midpoint of intervals gives ''f''(''a'' + Δ''x''/2) for the first interval, for the next one ''f''(''a'' + 3Δ''x''/2), and so on until ''f''(''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Δ''x''/2). Summing up the areas gives

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x\left[f(a + \tfrac{\Delta x}{2}) + f(a + \tfrac{3\,\Delta x}{2}) + \cdots+f(b-\tfrac{\Delta x}{2})\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

The error of this formula will be 

:&lt;math&gt;\left \vert \int_a^b f(x) \, dx - A_\mathrm{mid} \right \vert \le \frac{M_2(b-a)^3}{24n^2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum value of the [[absolute value]] of &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the interval.

===Trapezoidal rule===
[[Image:TrapRiemann2.svg|thumb|right|Trapezoidal Riemann sum of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over [0,2] using 4 subdivisions]]
{{main|Trapezoidal rule}}
In this case, the values of the function ''f'' on an interval are approximated by the average of the values at the left and right endpoints. In the same manner as above, a simple calculation using the area formula 
:&lt;math&gt;A=\tfrac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)&lt;/math&gt; 
for a [[trapezoid|trapezium]]  with parallel sides ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and height ''h'' produces

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}\,\Delta x\left[f(a) + 2f(a+\Delta x) + 2f(a+2\,\Delta x) + 2f(a+3\,\Delta x)+\cdots+f(b)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

The error of this formula will be 

:&lt;math&gt;\left \vert \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx - A_\mathrm{trap} \right \vert \le \frac{M_2(b-a)^3}{12n^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum value of the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximation obtained with the trapezoid rule for a function is the same as the average of the left hand and right hand sums of that function.

==Connection with integration==
For a one-dimensional Riemann sum over domain &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, as the maximum size of a partition element shrinks to zero (that is the limit of the norm of the partition goes to zero), some functions will have all Riemann sums converge to the same value. This limiting value, if it exists, is defined as the definite Riemann integral of the function over the domain,

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \! f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\|\Delta x\|\rightarrow0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \,\Delta x_i.&lt;/math&gt;

For a finite-sized domain, if the maximum size of a partition element shrinks to zero, this implies the number of partition elements goes to infinity. For finite partitions, Riemann sums are always approximations to the limiting value and this approximation gets better as the partition gets finer. The following animations help demonstrate how increasing the number of partitions (while lowering the maximum partition element size) better approximates the "area" under the curve:

Since the red function here is assumed to be a smooth function, all three Riemann sums will converge to the same value as the number of partitions goes to infinity.

}}

Taking an example, the area under the curve of ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between 0 and 2 can be procedurally computed using Riemann's method. 

The interval [0, 2] is firstly divided into ''n'' subintervals, each of which is given a width of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;; these are the widths of the Riemann rectangles (hereafter "boxes").  Because the right Riemann sum is to be used, the sequence of ''x'' coordinates for the boxes will be &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the sequence of the heights of the boxes will be &lt;math&gt;x_1^2, x_2^2, \ldots, x_n^2&lt;/math&gt;. It is an important fact that &lt;math&gt;x_i = \tfrac{2i}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x_n = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

The area of each box will be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{n} \times x_i^2&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the ''n''th right Riemann sum will be: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
S &amp;= \frac{2}{n} \times \left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^2 + \cdots + \frac{2}{n} \times \left(\frac{2i}{n}\right)^2 + \cdots + \frac{2}{n} \times \left(\frac{2n}{n}\right)^2 \\
  &amp;= \frac{8}{n^3} \left(1 + \cdots + i^2 + \cdots + n^2\right)\\
  &amp;= \frac{8}{n^3} \left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\right)\\
  &amp;= \frac{8}{n^3} \left(\frac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{6}\right)\\
  &amp;= \frac{8}{3} + \frac{4}{n} + \frac{4}{3n^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the limit is viewed as ''n'' → ∞, it can be concluded that the approximation approaches the actual value of the area under the curve as the number of boxes increases. Hence:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} S = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{8}{3} + \frac{4}{n} + \frac{4}{3n^2}\right) = \frac{8}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

This method agrees with the definite integral as calculated in more mechanical ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^2 x^2\,  dx = \frac{8}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the function is continuous and monotonically increasing on the interval, a right Riemann sum overestimates the integral by the largest amount (while a left Riemann sum would underestimate the integral by the largest amount). This fact, which is intuitively clear from the diagrams, shows how the nature of the function determines how accurate the integral is estimated. While simple, right and left Riemann sums are often less accurate than more advanced techniques of estimating an integral such as the [[Trapezoidal rule]] or [[Simpson's rule]].

The example function has an easy-to-find anti-derivative so estimating the integral by Riemann sums is mostly an academic exercise; however it must be remembered that not all functions have anti-derivatives so estimating their integrals by summation is practically important.

==Higher dimensions==
The basic idea behind a Riemann sum is to "break-up" the domain via a partition into pieces, multiply the "size" of each piece by some value the function takes on that piece, and sum all these products. This can be generalized to allow Riemann sums for functions over domains of more than one dimension.

While intuitively, the process of partitioning the domain is easy to grasp, the technical details of how the domain may be partitioned get much more complicated than the one dimensional case and involves aspects of the geometrical shape of the domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swokowski |first=Earl W. |year=1979 |title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry |edition=Second |publisher=Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-87150-268-2 |pages=821–822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, the domain, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be divided into a number of cells, &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A = \cup_i A_i&lt;/math&gt;. In two dimensions, each cell then can be interpreted as having an "area" denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Delta A_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostebee |first1=Arnold |last2=Zorn |first2=Paul |year=2002 |title=Calculus from Graphical, Numerical, and Symbolic Points of View |edition=Second |page=M-34 |quote=We chop the plane region ''R'' into ''m'' smaller regions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, perhaps of different sizes and shapes. The 'size' of a subregion ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is now taken to be its ''area'', denoted by Δ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Riemann sum is
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*,y_i^*)\,\Delta A_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(x_i^*,y_i^*) \in A_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Three dimensions===
In three dimensions, it is customary to use the letter &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; for the domain, such that &lt;math&gt;V = \cup_i V_i&lt;/math&gt; under the partition and &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_i&lt;/math&gt; is the "volume" of the cell indexed by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The three-dimensional Riemann sum may then be written as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swokowski |first=Earl W. |year=1979 |title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry |edition=Second |publisher=Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-87150-268-2 |pages=857–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*,y_i^*,z_i^*) \,\Delta V_i&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;(x_i^*,y_i^*,z_i^*) \in V_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Arbitrary number of dimensions===
Higher dimensional Riemann sums follow a similar as from one to two to three dimensions. For an arbitrary dimension, n, a Riemann sum can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_i f(P_i^*)\, \Delta V_i&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P_i^*\in V_i&lt;/math&gt;, that is, it's a point in the n-dimensional cell &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; with n-dimensional volume &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Generalization===
In high generality, Riemann sums can be written
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_i f(P_i^*) \mu(V_i)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;P_i^*&lt;/math&gt; stands for any arbitrary point contained in the partition element &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the underlying set. Roughly speaking, a measure is a function that gives a "size" of a set, in this case the size of the set &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;; in one dimension, this can often be interpreted as the length of the interval, in two dimensions, an area, in three dimensions, a volume, and so on.

In [[control engineering]], a '''state-space representation''' is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order [[differential equation]]s or [[difference equation]]s. State variables are variables whose values evolve through time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and also depends on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variables’ values depend on the values of the state variables.

The "[[state space]]" is the [[Euclidean space]] in which the variables on the axes are the state variables. The state of the system can be represented as a vector within that space.

To abstract from the number of inputs, outputs and states, these variables are expressed as [[row and column vectors|vectors]]. Additionally, if the [[dynamical system]] is linear, time-invariant, and finite-dimensional, then the differential and [[algebraic equation]]s may be written in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form.&lt;ref&gt;

The state-space method is characterized by significant algebraization of general [[system theory]], which makes it possible to use Kronecker vector-matrix structures. The capacity of these structures can be efficiently applied to research systems with modulation or without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13866/modelirovanie_dinamicheskih_sistem_s_modulyacieys_ispolzovaniem_kronekerovskih_vektorno-matrichnyhpredstavleniy.htm|title=Modeling of dynamic systems with modulation by means of Kronecker vector-matrix representation.|author1=Vasilyev A.S. |author2=Ushakov A.V. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=839–848.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;         
The state-space representation (also known as the "[[time-domain]] approach") provides a convenient and compact way to model and analyze systems with multiple inputs and outputs. With &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs, we would otherwise have to write down &lt;math&gt;q \times p&lt;/math&gt; [[Laplace transform]]s to encode all the information about a system. Unlike the [[frequency domain]] approach, the use of the state-space representation is not limited to systems with linear components and zero initial conditions. The state-space model is used in many different areas. In [[econometrics]], the state-space model can be used for forecasting [[stock price]]s&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li,Kwong Wing Chau (2016) Econometric Analyses of International Housing Markets, Routledge, https://books.google.com.hk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xyneCwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Rita+yi+man+li%22&amp;ots=7YTLXxGi5z&amp;sig=1j-NKyZu1yGUbzUv_O84z2bysTc&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rita%20yi%20man%20li%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other variables.

== State variables ==

The internal [[state variable]]s are the smallest possible subset of system variables that can represent the entire state of the system at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nise |first1=Norman S. |year=2010 |title=Control Systems Engineering |edition=6th |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-0-470-54756-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. If the system is represented in transfer function form, the minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction. It is important to understand that converting a state-space realization to a transfer function form may lose some internal information about the system, and may provide a description of a system which is stable, when the state-space realization is unstable at certain points. In electric circuits, the number of state variables is often, though not always, the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit such as [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s. The state variables defined must be linearly independent, i.e., no state variable can be written as a linear combination of the other state variables or the system will not be able to be solved.

== Linear systems ==

[[Image:Typical State Space model.png|framed|Block diagram representation of the linear state-space equations]]

The most general state-space representation of a linear system with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inputs, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; outputs and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; state variables is written in the following form:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brogan |first1=William L. |year=1974 |title=Modern Control Theory |edition=1st |publisher=Quantum Publishers, Inc. |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + B(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C(t) \mathbf{x}(t) + D(t) \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "state vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "output vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is called the "input (or control) vector",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;; 
:&lt;math&gt;A(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "state (or system) matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[A(\cdot)] = n \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "input matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[B(\cdot)] = n \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "output matrix",&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[C(\cdot)] = q \times n&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the "feedthrough (or feedforward) matrix" (in cases where the system model does not have a direct feedthrough, &lt;math&gt;D(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the zero matrix),&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}[D(\cdot)] = q \times p&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) := \frac{\operatorname{d}}{\operatorname{d}t} \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

In this general formulation, all matrices are allowed to be time-variant (i.e. their elements can depend on time); however, in the common [[LTI system|LTI]] case, matrices will be time invariant. The time variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be continuous (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) or discrete (e.g. &lt;math&gt;t \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;). In the latter case, the time variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is usually used instead of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. [[Hybrid system]]s allow for time domains that have both continuous and discrete parts. Depending on the assumptions taken, the state-space model representation can assume the following forms:
{| cellpadding="4"
|- valign="top"
|'''System type''' || '''State-space model'''

|Continuous time-invariant || &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example: continuous-time LTI case ===

Stability and natural response characteristics of a continuous-time [[LTI system]] (i.e., linear with matrices that are constant with respect to time) can be studied from the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix '''A'''.  The stability of a time-invariant state-space model can be determined by looking at the system's [[transfer function]] in factored form. It will then look something like this:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = k \frac{ (s - z_{1})(s - z_{2})(s - z_{3})
                              }{ (s - p_{1})(s - p_{2})(s - p_{3})(s - p_{4})
                                }. &lt;/math&gt;

The denominator of the transfer function is equal to the [[characteristic polynomial]] found by taking the [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;sI - A&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\lambda}(s) = |sI - A|. &lt;/math&gt;
The roots of this polynomial (the [[eigenvalue]]s) are the system transfer function's [[complex pole|pole]]s (i.e., the [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] where the transfer function's magnitude is unbounded). These poles can be used to analyze whether the system is [[exponential stability|asymptotically stable]] or [[marginal stability|marginally stable]]. An alternative approach to determining stability, which does not involve calculating eigenvalues, is to analyze the system's [[Lyapunov stability]].

The zeros found in the numerator of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; can similarly be used to determine whether the system is [[minimum phase]].

The system may still be '''input&amp;ndash;output stable''' (see [[BIBO stability|BIBO stable]]) even though it is not internally stable. This may be the case if unstable poles are canceled out by zeros (i.e., if those singularities in the transfer function are [[removable singularity|removable]]).

=== Controllability ===
{{Main| Controllability}}

The state controllability condition implies that it is possible&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; by admissible inputs&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to steer the states from any initial value to any final value within some finite time window. A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''controllable''' [[iff|if and only if]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}B&amp; AB&amp; A^{2}B&amp; \dots &amp; A^{n-1}B\end{bmatrix} = n, &lt;/math&gt;
where [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] is the number of linearly independent rows in a matrix, and where ''n'' is the number of state variables.

=== Observability ===
{{Main| Observability}}

Observability is a measure for how well internal states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The observability and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, observability provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).

A continuous time-invariant linear state-space model is '''observable''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}\begin{bmatrix}C\\ CA\\ \vdots\\ CA^{n-1}\end{bmatrix} = n. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Transfer function ===

The "[[transfer function]]" of a continuous time-invariant linear state-space model can be derived in the following way:

First, taking the [[Laplace transform]] of 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  
yields
:&lt;math&gt;s\mathbf{X}(s)-\mathbf{x}(0) = A \mathbf{X}(s) + B \mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;
Next, we simplify for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt;, giving
:&lt;math&gt;(s\mathbf{I} - A)\mathbf{X}(s) =\mathbf{x}(0)+ B\mathbf{U}(s), &lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s) =(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the output equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C\mathbf{X}(s) + D\mathbf{U}(s),&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) = C((s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}\mathbf{x}(0)+ (s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B\mathbf{U}(s)) + D\mathbf{U}(s). &lt;/math&gt;

The [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ratio of the output to the input of a system considering its initial conditions to be zero (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0) =\mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;). However, the ratio of a vector to a vector does not exist, so we consider the following condition satisfied by the transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)\times\mathbf{U}(s) = \mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt;
comparison with the equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}(s) &lt;/math&gt; above gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s) = C(s\mathbf{I} - A)^{-1}B + D. &lt;/math&gt;
Clearly &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(s)&lt;/math&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; dimensionality, and thus has a total of &lt;math&gt;qp&lt;/math&gt; elements.
So for every input there are &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; transfer functions with one for each output.
This is why the state-space representation can easily be the preferred choice for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The [[Rosenbrock system matrix]] provides a bridge between the state-space representation and its [[transfer function]].

=== Canonical realizations ===
{{main|Realization (systems)}}

Any given transfer function which is [[strictly proper]] can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system):

Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{n_{1}s^{3} + n_{2}s^{2} + n_{3}s + n_{4}}{s^{4} + d_{1}s^{3} + d_{2}s^{2} + d_{3}s + d_{4}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                                0&amp;      1&amp;      0&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      1&amp;      0\\
                                0&amp;      0&amp;      0&amp;      1\\
                               -d_{4}&amp; -d_{3}&amp; -d_{2}&amp; -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1\\ \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}&amp; n_{3}&amp; n_{2}&amp; n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''controllable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).


The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp;  -d_{4}\\
                               1&amp;   0&amp;  0&amp; -d_{3}\\
                               0&amp;   1&amp;  0&amp; -d_{2}\\
                               0&amp;   0&amp;  1&amp;  -d_{1}
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} n_{4}\\ n_{3}\\ n_{2}\\ n_{1} \end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

This state-space realization is called '''observable canonical form''' because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).

=== Proper transfer functions ===

Transfer functions which are only [[proper transfer function|proper]] (and not [[strictly proper]]) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant. 
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \textbf{G}_\mathrm{SP}(s) + \textbf{G}(\infty). &lt;/math&gt;

The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially &lt;math&gt;\textbf{y}(t) = \textbf{G}(\infty)\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix ''D'' determined by the constant.

Here is an example to clear things up a bit:
:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{G}(s) = \frac{s^{2} + 3s + 3}{s^{2} + 2s + 1}
                      = \frac{s + 2}{s^{2} + 2s + 1} + 1&lt;/math&gt;
which yields the following controllable realization
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{x}}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
                               -2&amp; -1\\
                                1&amp;      0\\
                             \end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + 
                             \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \textbf{y}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp; 2\end{bmatrix}\textbf{x}(t) + \begin{bmatrix} 1\end{bmatrix}\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the &lt;math&gt;\textbf{G}(\infty)&lt;/math&gt; constant in the transfer function.

=== Feedback ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback.png|framed|Typical state-space model with feedback]]

A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix ''K'' and setting this as the input to the system: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since the values of ''K'' are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for [[negative feedback]].
The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D K \mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this is that the [[eigenvalues]] of ''A'' can be controlled by setting ''K'' appropriately through eigendecomposition of &lt;math&gt;\left(A + B K \left(I - D K\right)^{-1} C \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
This assumes that the closed-loop system is [[controllability|controllable]] or that the unstable eigenvalues of ''A'' can be made stable through appropriate choice of ''K''.

==== Example ====
For a strictly proper system ''D'' equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. ''y'' = ''x'', which yields ''C'' = ''I'', the [[Identity matrix]]. This would then result in the simpler equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A + B K \right) \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just &lt;math&gt;A + B K&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Feedback with setpoint (reference) input ===
[[Image:Typical State Space model with feedback and input.png|framed|Output feedback with set point]]

In addition to feedback, an input, &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt;, can be added such that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(t) = -K \mathbf{y}(t) + \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) - B K \mathbf{y}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) - D K \mathbf{y}(t) + D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

solving the output equation for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting in the state equation 
results in

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \left(I -  K \left(I + D K\right)^{-1}D \right) \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} C \mathbf{x}(t) + \left(I + D K\right)^{-1} D \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

One fairly common simplification to this system is removing ''D'', which reduces the equations to

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left(A - B K C \right) \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{r}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Moving object example ===
A classical linear system is that of one-dimensional movement of an object.
[[Newton's laws of motion]] for an object moving horizontally on a plane and attached to a wall with a spring

:&lt;math&gt;m \ddot{y}(t) = u(t) - b\dot{y}(t) - k y(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is position; &lt;math&gt;\dot y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is velocity; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; is an applied force
*&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the viscous friction coefficient
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the spring constant
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object

The state equation would then become

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{\dot{x}_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{\dot{x}_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right] + \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} \mathbf{x_1}(t) \\ \mathbf{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the position of the object
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = \ddot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object
*the output &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the position of the object

The [[controllability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} B &amp; AB \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] &amp; \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right]   \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 \\ \frac{1}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; \frac{1}{m} \\ \frac{1}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m^2} \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which has full rank for all &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[observability]] test is then

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \begin{matrix} C \\ CA \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \\ \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \end{matrix} \right] \left[ \begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ -\frac{k}{m} &amp; -\frac{b}{m} \end{matrix} \right] \end{matrix} \right] = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

which also has full rank.
Therefore, this system is both controllable and observable.

== Nonlinear systems ==
The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{h}(t, x(t), u(t))&lt;/math&gt;

The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation.
If the function &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above.
The &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs).

=== Pendulum example ===
A classic nonlinear system is a simple unforced [[pendulum]]

:&lt;math&gt;m\ell^2\ddot\theta(t)= - m\ell g\sin\theta(t) - k\ell\dot\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum with respect to the direction of gravity
*&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum (pendulum rod's mass is assumed to be zero)
*&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational acceleration
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is coefficient of friction at the pivot point
*&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the pendulum (to the center of gravity of the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;)
The state equations are then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) = - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;x_1(t) = \theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;x_2(t) = \dot{x}_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational velocity of the pendulum
*&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2 = \ddot{x}_1&lt;/math&gt; is the rotational acceleration of the pendulum

Instead, the state equation can be written in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \left( \begin{matrix} \dot{x}_1(t) \\ \dot{x}_2(t) \end{matrix} \right) = \mathbf{f}(t, x(t)) = \left( \begin{matrix} x_2(t) \\  - \frac{g}{\ell}\sin{x_1}(t) - \frac{k}{m\ell}{x_2}(t) \end{matrix} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]/[[stationary point]]s of a system are when &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and so the equilibrium points of a pendulum are those that satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{matrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} n\pi \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integers ''n''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">In [[differential calculus]], the '''domain-straightening theorem''' states that, given a [[vector field]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]], there exist local coordinates &lt;math&gt;y_1, \dots, y_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X = \partial / \partial y_1&lt;/math&gt; in a neighborhood of a point where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero. The theorem is also known as '''straightening out of a vector field'''.

The [[Frobenius theorem (differential topology)|Frobenius theorem]] in differential geometry can be considered as a higher-dimensional generalization of this theorem.

== Proof ==
It is clear that we only have to find such coordinates at 0 in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. First we write &lt;math&gt;X = \sum_j f_j(x) {\partial \over \partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is some coordinate system at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f = (f_1, \dots, f_n)&lt;/math&gt;. By linear change of coordinates, we can assume &lt;math&gt;f(0) = (1, 0, \dots, 0).&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(t, p)&lt;/math&gt; be the solution of the initial value problem &lt;math&gt;\dot x = f(x), x(0) = p&lt;/math&gt; and let
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \Phi(x_1, (0, x_2, \dots, x_n)).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; (and thus &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) is smooth by smooth dependence on initial conditions in ordinary differential equations. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial x_1} \psi(x) = f(\psi(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
and, since &lt;math&gt;\psi(0, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \Phi(0, (0, x_2, \dots, x_n)) = (0, x_2, \dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;, the differential &lt;math&gt;d\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the identity at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;y = \psi^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate system at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, since &lt;math&gt;x = \psi(y)&lt;/math&gt;, we have: &lt;math&gt;{\partial x_j \over \partial y_1} = f_j(\psi(y)) = f_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial y_1} = X&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7524">In the study of [[dynamical systems]], a '''delay embedding theorem''' gives the conditions under which a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] [[dynamical system]] can be reconstructed from a sequence of observations of the state of a dynamical system.   The reconstruction preserves the properties of the dynamical system that do not change under smooth coordinate changes (i.e., [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphisms]]), but it does not preserve the geometric shape of structures in phase space.

'''Takens' theorem''' is the 1981 delay embedding theorem of [[Floris Takens]].  It provides the conditions under which a smooth attractor can be reconstructed from the observations made with a [[Baire space|generic]] function.  Later results replaced the smooth attractor with a set of arbitrary [[box counting dimension]] and the class of generic functions with other classes of functions.

Delay embedding theorems are simpler to state for
[[Dynamical system#Types of dynamical systems|discrete-time dynamical system]]s.
The state space of the dynamical system is a ν-dimensional [[manifold]] ''M''. The dynamics is given by a [[smooth map]]

:&lt;math&gt;f: M \to M.&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that the dynamics ''f'' has a [[strange attractor]] ''A'' with [[box counting dimension]] ''d&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Using ideas from [[Whitney's embedding theorem]], ''A'' can be embedded in ''k''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] with

:&lt;math&gt;k &gt; 2 d_A.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, there is a [[diffeomorphism]] φ that maps ''A'' into '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; such that the [[derivative]] of φ has full [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]].

A delay embedding theorem uses an ''observation function'' to construct the embedding function.  An observation function α must be twice-differentiable and associate a real number to any point of the attractor ''A''. It must also be [[Baire space|typical]], so its derivative is of full rank and has no special symmetries in its components. The delay embedding theorem states that the function

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_T(x)=\left(\alpha(x), \alpha\left(f(x)\right), \dots, \alpha\left(f^{k-1}(x)\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is an embedding of the strange attractor ''A''.

==Simplified, slightly inaccurate version==

Suppose the ''d''-dimensional 
state vector x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; evolves according to an unknown but continuous
and (crucially) deterministic dynamic. Suppose, too, that the
one-dimensional observable ''y'' is a smooth function of ''x'', and “coupled”
to all the components of ''x''. Now at any time we can look not just at
the present measurement ''y(t)'', but also at observations made at times
removed from us by multiples of some lag &lt;math&gt;\tau: y_{t-\tau}, y_{t-2\tau} &lt;/math&gt;, etc. If we use
k lags, we have a k-dimensional vector. One might expect that, as the
number of lags is increased, the motion in the lagged space will become
more and more predictable, and perhaps in the limit &lt;math&gt; k \to \infty &lt;/math&gt; would become
deterministic. In fact, the dynamics of the lagged vectors become
deterministic at a finite dimension; not only that, but the deterministic
dynamics are completely equivalent to those of the original state space (More exactly, they are related by a smooth, invertible change of coordinates,
or diffeomorphism.) The magic embedding dimension ''k'' is
at most ''2d + 1'', and often less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shalizi|first1=Cosma R.|editor1-last=Deisboeck|editor1-first=ThomasS|editor2-last=Kresh|editor2-first=J.Yasha|title=Complex Systems Science in Biomedicine|date=2006|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-387-30241-6|pages=33–114|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-33532-2_2|accessdate=2014-11-03|chapter=Methods and Techniques of Complex Systems Science: An Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamara Eugenia Awerbuch-Friedlander''' is a [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|biomathematician]] and [[public health]] scientist who worked at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] (HSPH) in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/45989|title=Tamara Awerbuch-Friedlander {{!}} Harvard Catalyst Profiles {{!}} Harvard Catalyst|last=|first=|date=2014-04-07|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073457/http://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/45989|archive-date=7 April 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her primary research and publications focus on [[Biosocial theory|biosocial interactions]] that cause or contribute to disease. She also is believed to be the first female Harvard faculty member to have had a [[jury trial]] for a lawsuit filed against [[Harvard University]] for [[sex discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/issues/women-academic-profession AAUP 'Issues' page on Women in the Academic Profession], accessed 05/02/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discrimination2004"&gt;The American Association of University Women, Tenure Denied: Cases of Sex Discrimination in Academia. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tamara Awerbuch was born in [[Uruguay]], lived until the age of 12 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], then moved to [[Israel]] with her parents, where her grandparents and parents had lived after they had escaped Nazi Germany just before the Holocaust began. She studied and completed two degrees at [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]]. She studied chemistry and minored in biochemistry and completed the BSc degree in 1965. In 1967, she completed both the Master of Science (MSc) in [[Physiology]] and the Master of Education (MEd) degree from Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atiner.gr/bio/Awerbuch-Friedlander.pdf|title=CURRICULUM VITAE - TAMARA EUGENIA AWERBUCH FRIEDLANDER|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was certified to teach grades K–12 in [[Israel]], where she lectures and appears on panels and in workshops, as she does also in the United States and elsewhere. She also served for two years in the [[Israeli army]].

In October 1973, while visiting friends in America, she was offered employment at MIT in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to study chemical [[carcinogens]] in [[tissue culture]]s, then a recently developed technique. During this period, she worked in the lab studying carcinogenicity in tissue cultures, studied one course each semester, and lived frugally, sharing a house with MIT junior Faculty and graduate students. As one of her allotted courses per semester, in spring of 1974 she first started to study mathematics, taking mathematics and statistics. In summer 1975, she matriculated as a full-time student at MIT, where in 1979 she completed her doctorate in Nutrition and Food Science. She became a US citizen{{when|date=July 2018}} and has resided in the United States since that time. She was recruited in 1983 to the Biostatistics Department of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health by Department Chair [[Marvin Zelen]]. In 1993, she began a long career in the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Her two sons, Danny and Ari, were born in the 1980s and reared in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. She speaks English, Hebrew, and Spanish fluently and understands and reads German.

==Education==
* Undergraduate study at Hebrew University in Israel.
**BSc in Chemistry (minor in [[biochemistry]]) – 1965
**MSc in Physiology – 1967
**MEd – Education (certified to teach K–12) – 1967
* PhD, MIT, Department of Nutrition and Food Science, Major in Metabolism, 1979
**Thesis: "A [[diffusion]] [[bioassay]] for the quantitative determination of [[mutagenicity]] of chemical carcinogens" (a theoretical study for determining safe threshold concentrations of [[food additives]] re: [[carcinogenesis]])
*Postdoc, MIT, in Somatic Cell Genetics 1979-1981

==Career==
Since the beginning of this century, she has organized and carried out research on conditions that lead to the emergence, maintenance, and spread of [[epidemics]]. Her research encompasses [[sexually-transmitted diseases]] (STDs) such as [[HIV/AIDS]], as well as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne diseases]], such as [[Lyme disease]], [[dengue]], and [[Zika virus]] and [[Zika fever]]. Awerbuch-Friedlander recently researched the spread and control of [[rabies]] based on an eco-historical analysis. Her work is interdisciplinary, and some of her publications are co-authored with international scientists and members of different departments of the HSPH and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

Some of her analytical mathematical models led to fundamental epidemiological discoveries, for example, that oscillations are an intrinsic property of [[Tick-borne disease|tick dynamics]]. She presented her work in many international conferences and at the [[Isaac Newton Institute]] of Mathematical Sciences in [[Cambridge|Cambridge, England]], where she was invited to participate in the Program on Models of Epidemics.&lt;ref name="hsph.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tamara-awerbuchfriedlander/|title=Home {{!}} Tamara Awerbuch {{!}} Harvard T.H.

Awerbuch-Friedlander is a founding member of the New and Resurgent Disease Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c02/E6-03B-08-04.pdf Awerbuch-Friedlander, T., Levins, R., Mathematical Models of Public Health Policy, Mathematical Models, Volume III, EOLSS (Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems), Note: in Biographical Sketches, Accessed online 4/2/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptictank.org/treasure/GP3/INDCC.TXT Note 20 In "Health Impacts of Climate Change", ''Medical Journal of Australia'', vol.163, 1995, pp. 570–574.  By: Erwin Jackson, Climate Impacts Specialist, Greenpeace International, Accessed online 4/2/2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Within this context, she was involved in organizing a conference in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], on the emergence and resurgence of diseases, where she led the workshop on Mathematical Modeling. In addition, she established international collaborations, such as with Israeli scientists on emerging infectious diseases in the Middle East, with Cuban scientists on infectious diseases of plants and the development of general methodologies, and with Brazilian scientists on the development of concepts to guide effective surveillance.  In the late 1990s, Awerbuch-Friedlander was co-investigator in a project, "Why New and Resurgent Diseases Caught Public Health by Surprise and a Strategy to Prevent This" (supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation). At Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Awerbuch-Friedlander co-chaired the committee on Bio- and Public Health Mathematics. Some of her research papers were the result of collaboration with students through the course Mathematical Models in Biology, which had large portions dedicated to infectious diseases. She is indeed interested in public health education and has developed for high school adolescents educational software based on models for determining the risk that an individual with certain risky sexual behaviors actually would become infected with HIV. These models helped risk-prone youth, parents, educators, community health leaders, and public health researchers explore how changes in sexual behavior impact their probability of contracting HIV.&lt;ref name="hsph.harvard.edu"/&gt;

The University argued that no tenure track positions were open in her new department, after she had been reassigned from one department to another.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

A '''tape diagram''', also known as a '''bar model''', is a pictorial representation of [[ratio]]s. In [[mathematics education]], it is used to solve [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Lisa Watts-Lawton and Colleen Sheeron |title=Eureka Math Curriculum Guide: A Story of Units, Grade 2 yes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r5IvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 |year=2015 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-81261-7 |page=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So lets do this problem that has been given to us by teachers all around. ''A boy has won 15 games, for every 3 games that he wins, he loses 2, how many games has the little boy lost?''

==Example==

A math problem reads: A boy has won 15 games. His ratio for him is 3:2. The tape diagram would look something like this:

{| class="ckckck m 
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ccccff;" | ?
| style="background: #ffffff;" | &amp;nbsp;
|-
! colspan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}
Using the above diagram, it can be concluded that the boy has lost 10 playing times.{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}

==How does the tape diagram work==
The tape diagram works by showing different ratios. In the example before it shows how a boy has won 15 games. So if his win to loss ratio is 3:2 it would look like this. How many games has he lost?(3x5)

Now how did you get those three 5s you ask.
{|
! colsepan="4" | Total games won = 15
|-
! Win
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| 
| style="background: #ccccff;" | 5
| style="background: #ccccff;" |5
| style="background: #ffffff;" | fh&amp;nbsp;
|-
! colsepan="4" | Total games lost = ?
|}

So the answer to how many games did he lose is 10. Because 5+5=10

'''The Proteolysis MAP''' ('''PMAP''') is an integrated [[web resource]] focused on [[protease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Igarashi | first1 = Y | last2 = Heureux | first2 = E | last3 = Doctor | first3 = KS | last4 = Talwar | first4 = P | last5 = Gramatikova | first5 = S | last6 = Gramatikoff | first6 = K | last7 = Zhang | first7 = Y | last8 = Blinov | first8 = M | last9 = Ibragimova | first9 = SS | last10 = Boyd | first10 = S | last11 = Ratnikov | first11 = B | last12 = Cieplak | first12 = P | last13 = Godzik | first13 = A | last14 = Smith | first14 = JW | last15 = Osterman | first15 = AL | last16 = Eroshkin | first16 = AM | year = 2008 | title = PMAP: databases for analyzing proteolytic events and pathways | journal = [[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume = 37| issue = | pages = D611–D618| doi=10.1093/nar/gkn683 | pmid=18842634 | pmc=2686432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
PMAP is to aid the protease researchers in reasoning about [[proteolytic]] [[metabolic network|networks]] and [[metabolic pathways]].

==History and funding==
PMAP was originally created at the [[Burnham Institute for Medical Research]], La Jolla, California.  In 2004 the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) selected a team led by [[Jeffrey W. Smith]], to establish the Center on Proteolytic Pathways (CPP).  As part of the NIH Roadmap for Biomedical research, the center develops technology to study the behavior of proteins and to disburse that knowledge to the scientific community at large.

==Focal point==
Proteases are a class of [[enzymes]] that regulate much of what happens in the [[human body]], both inside the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and out, by cleaving [[peptide bonds]] in [[proteins]].  Through this activity, they govern the four essential cell functions: [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]], [[motility]], division and [[cell death]] — and activate important [[extracellular]] episodes, such as the [[biochemical cascade]] effect in [[blood clotting]].  Simply stated, life could not exist without them. Extensive on-line classification system for proteases (also referred as peptidases) is deposited in the [[MEROPS]] database.

==The goal==
Proteolytic pathways, or proteolysis, are the series of events controlled by proteases that occur in response to specific stimuli.  In addition to the clotting of blood, the production of [[insulin]] can be viewed as a proteolytic pathway, as the activation, regulation and inhibition of that protein is the result of proteases reacting to changing [[glucose]] levels and triggering other proteases downstream.

==Database content==
PMAP integrates five databases.
ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic ‘Molecule Pages’, rich in molecular information. CutDB&lt;ref&gt;Igarashi Y, Eroshkin A, Gramatikova S, Gramatikoff K, Zhang Y, Smith JW, Osterman AL, Godzik A. CutDB: a proteolytic event database. [[Nucleic Acids Research]]. 2007 D546-9&lt;/ref&gt; has information on more than 6,600 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] recognition specificity of proteases.  PathwayDB, just begun accumulation of [[metabolic pathways]] whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner.  Hypothetical networks are inferred by semi-automated culling from the literature.  Additionally, protease software tools are available for the analysis of individual proteases and [[proteome]]-wide data sets.

==Usage==
Popular destinations in PMAP are Protease Molecule Pages and Substrate Molecule Pages. Protease Molecule Pages show recent news in [[PubMed]] literature of the protease, known [[proteolytic events]], [[protein domain]] location and [[protein structure]] view, as well as a cross annotation in other [[bioinformatic]] databases section. Substrate Molecule Pages display protein domains and experimentally derived protease cut-sites for a given protein target of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11175">{{lowercase|title=μ-recursive function}}
In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the '''μ-recursive functions''' are a class of [[partial function]]s from [[natural number]]s to natural numbers that are "computable" in an intuitive sense. In [[Computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by [[Turing machine]]s.  The μ-recursive functions are closely related to [[primitive recursive function]]s, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every μ-recursive function is a primitive recursive function&amp;mdash;the most famous example is the [[Ackermann function]].

Other equivalent classes of functions are the [[lambda-recursive function|&amp;lambda;-recursive functions]] and the functions that can be computed by [[Markov algorithm]]s.

The set of all recursive functions is known as [[R (complexity)|R]] in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Definition==

The '''μ-recursive functions''' (or '''partial μ-recursive functions''') are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number.  They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the initial functions and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the [[μ operator]].

The smallest class of functions including the initial functions and closed under composition and primitive recursion (i.e. without minimisation) is the class of [[primitive recursive functions]].  While all primitive recursive functions are total, this is not true of partial recursive functions; for example, the minimisation of the successor function is undefined. The primitive recursive functions are a subset of the total recursive functions, which are a subset of the partial recursive functions. For example, the [[Ackermann function]] can be proven to be total recursive, but not primitive.

Initial or "basic" functions: (In the following the subscripting is per Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;219. For more about some of the various symbolisms found in the literature see [[#Symbolism|Symbolism]] below.)

#'''Constant function''': For each natural number &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = n\,&lt;/math&gt;.
#:Alternative definitions use compositions of the successor function and use a '''zero function''', that always returns zero, in place of the constant function.
# '''Successor function S:'''  
#: &lt;math&gt;S(x) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} x + 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Projection function''' &lt;math&gt;P_i^k&lt;/math&gt; (also called the '''Identity function''' &lt;math&gt;I_i^k&lt;/math&gt;): For all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;i, k\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:
#: &lt;math&gt;P_i^k(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} x_i \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Operators:

#  '''Composition operator''' &lt;math&gt;\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; (also called the '''substitution operator'''): Given an m-ary function &lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\ldots,x_m)\,&lt;/math&gt; and m k-ary functions &lt;math&gt;g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_k),\ldots,g_m(x_1,\ldots, x_k)&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;h \circ (g_1, \ldots, g_m) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} f \quad\text{where}\quad f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = h(g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_k),\ldots,g_m(x_1,\ldots,x_k))\,.&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Primitive recursion operator''' &lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt;: Given the k-ary function &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt; and k+2 -ary function &lt;math&gt;h(y,z,x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
             \rho(g, h) &amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} f \quad\text{where}\\
    f(0,x_1,\ldots,x_k) &amp;= g(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \\
  f(y+1,x_1,\ldots,x_k) &amp;= h(y,f(y,x_1,\ldots,x_k),x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
#'''Minimisation operator''' &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;: Given a (k+1)-ary total function &lt;math&gt;f(y, x_1, \ldots, x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          \mu(f)(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = z \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\iff}\ f(z, x_1, \ldots, x_k)&amp;=0\quad \text{and}\\
             f(i, x_1, \ldots, x_k)&amp;&gt;0 \quad \text{for}\quad i=0, \ldots, z-1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
#:Intuitively, minimisation seeks—beginning the search from 0 and proceeding upwards—the smallest argument that causes the function to return zero; if there is no such argument, the search never terminates.

The '''strong equality''' operator &lt;math&gt;\simeq&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compare partial μ-recursive functions.  This is defined for all partial functions ''f'' and ''g'' so  that
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \simeq g(x_1,\ldots,x_l)&lt;/math&gt; 
holds if and only if for any choice of arguments either both functions are defined and their values are equal or both functions are undefined.

== Equivalence with other models of computability ==

{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

In the [[Church's thesis|equivalence of models of computability]], a parallel is drawn between [[Turing machine]]s that do not terminate for certain inputs and an undefined result for that input in the corresponding partial recursive function.
The unbounded search operator is not definable by the rules of primitive recursion as those do not provide a mechanism for "infinite loops" (undefined values).

== Normal form theorem ==

A [[Kleene's T predicate#Normal form theorem|normal form theorem]] due to Kleene says that for each ''k'' there are primitive recursive functions &lt;math&gt;U(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(y,e,x_1,\ldots,x_k)\!&lt;/math&gt; such that for any μ-recursive function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\!&lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' free variables there is an ''e'' such that  
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \simeq U(\mu y\, T(y,e,x_1,\ldots,x_k))&lt;/math&gt;.
The number ''e'' is called an '''index''' or '''Gödel number''' for the function ''f''.  A consequence of this result is that any μ-recursive function can be defined using a single instance of the μ operator applied to a (total) primitive recursive function.

Minsky (1967) observes (as does Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95) that the U defined above is in essence the μ-recursive equivalent of the [[universal Turing machine]]:
:To construct U is to write down the definition of a general-recursive function U(n, x) that correctly interprets the number n and computes the appropriate function of x. to construct U directly would involve essentially the same amount of effort, ''and essentially the same ideas'', as we have invested in constructing the universal Turing machine. (italics in original, Minsky (1967) p. 189)

== Symbolism ==
A number of different symbolisms are used in the literature. An advantage to using the symbolism is a derivation of a function by "nesting" of the operators one inside the other is easier to write in a compact form. In the following we will abbreviate the string of parameters x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as '''x''':  
* '''Constant function''': Kleene uses " C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''') = q " and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (B-B-J) use the abbreviation " const&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;( '''x''') = n ": 
:: e.g. C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13
:: e.g. const&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13

* '''Successor function''': Kleene uses x' and S for "Successor". As "successor" is considered to be primitive, most texts use the apostrophe as follows: 
:: S(a) = a +1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; a', where 1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt;  0', 2 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; 0 ' ', etc.

* '''Identity function''': Kleene (1952) uses " U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; " to indicate the identity function over the variables x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; B-B-J use the identity function id&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; over the variables x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:
: U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;( '''x''' ) = id&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;( '''x''' ) = x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; 
: e.g. U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = id&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = t

* '''Composition (Substitution) operator''': Kleene uses a bold-face '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (not to be confused with his S for "successor" '''!''' ). The superscript "m" refers to the m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of function "f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;", whereas the subscript "n" refers to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; variable "x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;":
:If we are given h( '''x''' )= g( f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''), ... , f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') )
::  h('''x''') = '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(g, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; )

:In a similar manner, but without the sub- and superscripts, B-B-J write: 
:: h(''x''')= Cn[g, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ,..., f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;]('''x''')

* '''Primitive Recursion''': Kleene uses the symbol " '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(base step, induction step) " where n indicates the number of variables, B-B-J use " Pr(base step, induction step)('''x''')". Given:
:* base step: h( 0, '''x''' )= f( '''x''' ), and
:* induction step: h( y+1, '''x''' ) = g( y, h(y, '''x'''),'''x''' )
 
: Example: primitive recursion definition of a + b:
::* base step: f( 0, a ) = a = U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a)
::* induction step: f( b' , a ) = ( f ( b, a ) )' = g( b, f( b, a), a ) = g( b, c, a ) = c' = S(U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ))
::: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; { U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a), S [ (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) ] }
::: Pr{ U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a), S[ (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) ] }

'''Example''': Kleene gives an example of how to perform the recursive derivation of f(b, a) = b + a (notice reversal of variables a and b). He starts with 3 initial functions 
:# S(a) = a'
:# U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a) = a
:# U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) = c
:# g(b, c, a) = S(U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a )) = c'
:# base step: h( 0, a ) = U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a)
:: induction step: h( b', a ) = g( b, h( b, a ), a )

He arrives at:
:: a+b = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(S, U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ]
