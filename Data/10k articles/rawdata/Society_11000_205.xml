The [[pandit]] '''Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Das''' (31 August 1864 – 2 January 1945) is known as the versatile genius of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. He was a poet, musician, dancer, linguist and philosopher. He was born in [[Ajjada]] village, near [[Bobbili]], presently in [[Balijipeta]] mandal of [[Vizianagaram district]], Andhra Pradesh, India.

== Biography ==
Narayana Das was a linguist with proficiency in as many as eight languages (including Arabic and Persian), poet, philosopher, playwright, composer, dancer, actor and the creator of the unique art form, [[Hari Katha]].

Narayana Das was a scholar who had mastery over four classical languages (Sanskrit, Telugu, Arabic and Persian) and who translated from Persian and English into Sanskrit and Telugu; the only litterateur who wrote a comparative treatise on the works of Kalidas and Shakespeare; the only writer-composer who translated into Telugu and set to music [[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]] hymns and the only writer-composer who composed a geeta-malika comprising 90 Carnatic ragas. As a writer-composer who composed music in all the 72 Carnatic ragas he was next only to [[Tyagaraja]].

Enraptured by his rendering of the Hindusthani [[Bhairavi raga]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]] sought to introduce the curriculum followed by Narayana Das in his music college at [[Visva-Bharati University]].

He had mastery over several Indian and classical languages like Telugu, Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, English, Arabic and Persian. He was also a performer of [[Ashtavadhanam]]. He has written over a hundred books in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Sanskrit]]. His works ranged from children's literature to philosophical treatises.

His literary output was extensive. He wrote original [[Kavyas]] and [[Prabandhas]] that reflect a rare creative genius, erudition and great felicity of expression. He wrote over fifty books in Telugu, Sanskrit and Atcha-Telugu (Desyandhramu or Telugu unmixed of Sanskrit). His works included original story-poems (Kavyas and Prabndhas), Harikathas, prose works, musical works, dramas, translations, treatises in philosophy and Vedic studies and children's literature.

He felt that [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s English translations did not do justice to the Persian poet [[Omar Khayyam]]'s poetry. To demonstrate his viewpoint he translated both the original [[quatrains]] of Omar Khaiyam and Edward Fitzgerald's English translation into two languages – Sanskrit and ''Atcha'' Telugu in different metres. The work entitled ''[[The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' (1932)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Omar Khayyam |author2=Edward FitzGerald |author3=Azzada Adibhatla Narayana Das |title=Rubāʻiyāt-i ʻUmar Khayyām = Rubâiyât of Omar Khaiyâm |oclc=498612579 |year=1932 |location=Mazgon |publisher=British India Press }}, reprinted 1936 {{OCLC|2836529}}&lt;/ref&gt; was acclaimed as a rare literary feat by the literati of his time. In a rare tribute, a leading newspaper reviewed the book as an editorial entitled ''A Monument of Scholarship''.

In another voluminous display of scholarship he compared the works of the Sanskrit dramatist [[Kālidāsa]] with those of [[Shakespeare]]. Entitled ''[[Nava Rasa Tarangini]]'' (1922) the book annotates passages consisting of the nine rasas or moods from the dramas of both the dramatists by translating them into Telugu.

His magnum opus was a two volume philosophical work entitled ''Jagadjyoti'', in which he recorded his musings on various Indian philosophies, even accommodating atheist viewpoints.

His Sanskrit works include ''Harikathamrutam'' a compilation of three [[Harikatha|Hari Kathas]], ''[[Tarakam]]'' an original allegorical poem and two Shatakas ''Ramachandra Shatakam'' and ''[[Kashi Shatakam]]''. A Satakam usually consists of 100 verses written in the same prosody.

He composed a lyric, entitled ''Dasha Vidha Raga Navati Kusuma Manjari'' employing 90 ragas in the [[Manjari (raga)|Manjari]] metre. Such a composition has never been attempted and is a testimony to his rare mastery over poetry and music. He set to musical notation 300-odd select '''ruks''' from the [[Rigveda]] in a work entitled ''Ruksangraham'' and taught playing them on the veena to students but also translated them as poems in Telugu.

His musical accomplishments left him peerless in his time. Maestros of the musical world honoured him with titles like ''Laya Brahma'' and ''Panchamukhi Parameshwara'' for his ability to sing to five different Talas, beat with the two arms, two feet and the head. Five different musicians used to keep time with him when he performed ''[[Panchamukhi]]''.

The literary and musical elite of his time joined to honour him with the title ''Sangita Sahitya Sarvabhauma''.

Fusing the sister realms of poetry, music and dance he created a new art form which he called the [[Harikatha]]. Harikatha has a divine mythological core with poetry and music as the medium. Dance and histrionics form the visual expression.

The exponent of [[Harikatha]] should be able to compose and recite extempore the objective of the performance being to entertain and educate both the layman and the erudite scholar. Having invented the vehicle, he wrote twenty one [[Harikatha]]s, seventeen in Telugu, three in Sanskrit.

He was the first principal of the [[Maharajah's Government College of Music and Dance]] (Vijayarama Gana Pathasala) established by the Maharajah of [[Vizianagaram]] in 1919. The Maharajah in fact established the Music College, which was among the first few in South India, to honour the Pundit and enable enthusiasts to learn music from him. [[Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu]] the well-known Violin maestro was a lecturer in the college during the Pandit's tenure and succeeded him as principal.

He entranced [[Rabindranath Tagore]] with his rendering of ''Hindusthani [[Bhairavi]]''. Tagore sought the curriculum of the Vizianagaram Music College to be introduced in ''Shantiniketan''.

A characteristic trait we notice in a number of instances in the life of Narayana Das is a compulsive urge to excel in everything he did. The conception and renunciation of 'Naa Eruka', his autobiography is an example that provides insight into his complex personality. He began writing what would have been the first autobiography in Telugu and sent the initial chapters, narrating his life story from birth to the age of about thirty, to the printers. There was a delay at the printers due to pressure of work and in the meantime another famous writer's autobiography came out. Narayana Das called off the project because of his obsessive desire to be 'second to none'. Thus was lost to the public not only an opportunity to read the great man's life story told in his own words with remarkable candour, but also his perspective of his literary output and the literary and cultural zeitgeist of his time.

In the parlance of modern behavioural sciences the term [[self-actualisation]] is defined as a fundamental tendency to maximum realisation and fulfilment of one's potential. In the case of an artiste this means he tends to write, compose or perform to satisfy an inner urge oblivious to the environment. He competes only with himself. He sets his own standards of performance and after achieving them keeps raising them to a higher level. It is a continual upward spiral.

Self-actualization was the leitmotif of Narayana Das' life in all the fields he worked in, be it literature, music or other performing arts such as Avadahanam, and Hari Katha. He brushed aside fame and fortune. For example, it was said that he did not approve of a move to nominate him for the Nobel literary prize. The philosopher in him made him decline offers to be made court musician by the [[Maharajah of Mysore]] and later by the [[Maharaja of Vizianagaram]], instead preferring an independent life lead in the service of God.

Even when he consented to head 'Shri Vijayarama Gana Pathashala', the music college the Maharajah of Vizianagaram founded for the express purpose of honouring him, he insisted that it be treated as a temple for Sri Rama and him as His servant. The only vanity he permitted himself was that he wanted to be second to none!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9127">Arab immigration to the [[Honduras|Republic of Honduras]] began in the 19th century with the liberal reforms of President [[Marco Aurelio Soto]] (1876-1883), who saw immigration as a determining factor in the development of [[capitalism]] in Central America, and sought to establish an attractive environment for foreign investment. At present, the largest Arab community is the 250,000 people of Palestinian descent, the majority of whom (95%) are Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Estimates place the [[Islam in Honduras|Muslim population]] at about 5,000-6,000.

== History ==
Relatively few Arabs immigrated to Honduras during the 19th century. Under conservative General Captain [[José María Medina]] (1862-1876), the National Congress issued the first immigration law on February 26, 1866, allowing willing foreigners to reside in the country. Afterwards, the liberal reformer Dr. [[Marco Aurelio Soto]] (1876-1883) published the Political Constitution of 1876, which reflected the importance he placed on immigration for national development, including those from North America (many displaced by the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]), [[European diaspora|Europe]], the Middle East and Asia, etc. The government of General [[Luis Bográn]] (1883-1891) also emphasized immigration as a means to increase the national population, develop the labor force, further exploit the country's natural resources; in Honduras he offered foreigners the opportunity to treat with an equal, a cordial welcome, security, and especially an influence on the Honduran national identity. Constantino Nini is cited as the first Arab to settle in Honduras in 1893,&lt;ref name=Luxner /&gt; even before Christians were legally allowed to leave the Ottoman Empire in 1895.&lt;ref name=Gonz&gt;{{cite book|last1=González|first1=Nancie L. Solien|title=Dollar, Dove, and Eagle: One Hundred Years of Palestinian Migration to Honduras|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472064940|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Dollar_Dove_and_Eagle.html?id=6df1x3SvLoUC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century saw a major increase in Arab immigration to Honduras following [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|crisis in the Ottoman Empire]] and [[World War I]]. Since then, Arabs have been a force in Honduran economics and politics; the Arab influence on businesses and political life has arguably been stronger in Honduras than any other place in the Western Hemisphere. In the early 20th century, Gonzalo "Chalo" Luque noted the names of many Palestinian-Arab heads-of-household in [[San Pedro Sula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luque|first1=Chalo|title=Memorias de un sampedrano|date=1915|publisher=G.R. Luque|pages=61–64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNAWAAAAYAAJ|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mario Posas made a similar list for the developing banana plantations near [[La Ceiba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posas|first1=Mario|title=Breve historia de la ciudad de La Ceiba (A Brief History of La Ceiba)|date=1993|publisher=Alcaldía Municipal de La Ceiba, Secretaría de Cultura|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3kSAQAAIAAJ|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Palestinian Arabs made up just 0.5% of the Honduran population according to documents from the Ministry of Foreign Relations,&lt;ref&gt;''Ley de Inmigración, Decreto No. 101'' (Decree #101: Immigration Law) Honduras Gazette, No. 7,860, 2 Apr 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1935 census showed just 47 "Turks" and 721 Palestinians out of a total population of 960,000. (Because many immigrants had passports from the Ottoman Empire, Arab Hondurans acquired the generic nickname of "Turcos".)&lt;ref name=RMG&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marín Guzmán|first1=Roberto|title=A Century of Palestinian Immigration Into Central America: A Study of Their Economic and Cultural Contributions|date=2001|publisher=Editorial Universidad de Costa Rica|location=San José, C.R.: Ed. de la Univ. de Costa Rica|isbn=9789977675879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pv-HzTRQPQsC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several researchers suggest that there had been a wave of Middle Eastern immigrants to Central America in the 1920s and 1930s; hundreds of families settled primarily in Honduras,&lt;ref name=RMG /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gonz /&gt; with nearly 25,000 Arabs in [[San Pedro Sula]] alone by 1930, and over 40,000 by 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Euraque|first1=Darío A.|title=The Arab‐Jewish economic presence in San Pedro Sula, the industrial capital of Honduras: Formative years, 1880s–1930s|journal=Immigrants &amp; Minorities|date=21 June 2010|volume=16|issue=1-2|pages=94–124|doi=10.1080/02619288.1997.9974905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these immigrants were well-educated, and many came from [[Bethlehem, Israel|Bethlehem]] or surrounding villages which allowed them to easily form cohesive and supportive social networks.&lt;ref name=Gonz /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lopez, Sharon|author2=Speer, Catherine S.|authorlink1=Arabs in Honduras|editor1-last=Zabel|editor1-first=Darcy|title=Arabs in the Americas: Interdisciplinary Essays on the Arab Diaspora|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820481111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxppXy22NbkC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluency in English allowed early coffee grinders to establish trade relationships with Belize and North America, and by the early 20th century, Arab families owned over 40% of local businesses according to one survey.&lt;ref name=Luxner /&gt;

In 1939 the [[Tegucigalpa]] Arab community organized the "Society Union Arab Youth" under the leadership of Gabriel Kattán and Nicolás Larach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Semanario|work=Rumbos|issue=1(16)|date=1 Jul 1939|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the founding of similar associations in [[Cuba]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]] and [[Nicaragua]]. This organization published a weekly newspaper called ''Rumbos'' ("Directions") and produced an exclusive radio program for Radio HRN.&lt;ref&gt;The Arabs and Palestinians in Honduras, 1900-1950, Publisher Guaymuras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 2000. (Page 78)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, eight Arab-Honduran members of this Society purchased six acres in a suburb of [[San Pedro Sula]] where they built a swimming pool. This eventually grew into the US$15 million Arab-Honduran Social Center complex, which included some 1,600 families as club members by 2001.&lt;ref name=Luxner /&gt;

Estimates placed the [[Palestinian Arab]] population at between 150,000 and 200,000 at the beginning of the 21st century, a percentage second only to [[Chile]] in the Americas.&lt;ref name=Luxner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luxner|first1=Larry|title=The Arabs of Honduras|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200104/the.arabs.of.honduras.htm|work=Saudi Aramco World|date=July–August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evidence law}}

In the law of the United States, '''attorney–client privilege''' or '''lawyer–client privilege''' is a "client's right privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications between the client and the attorney."&lt;ref&gt;"Attorney–client privilege", ''Black's Law Dictionary'', p. 1391 col. 2 (Bryan A. Garner 10th ed. 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is one of the oldest recognized privileges for confidential communications.&lt;ref name="Swidler"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States |vol=524 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=399 |pinpoint=[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15126544245741859873#p403 403] |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make "full and frank" disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Upjohn Co. v. United States,'' 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

==General requirements under United States law==
Although there are minor variations, the elements necessary to establish the attorney client privilege generally are:

# The asserted holder of the privilege is (or sought to become) a client; and
# The person to whom the communication was made:
## is a member of the bar of a court, or a subordinate of such a member, and
## in connection with this communication, is acting as an attorney; and
# The communication was for the purpose of securing legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Colton v. United States'', 306 F.2d 633, 637 (2d Cir. 1962), ''cert. denied'', 371 U.S. 951, 83 S. Ct. 505 (1963), ''citing'' ''United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp.'', 89 F. Supp. 357, 358–59 (D. Mass. 1950).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most jurisdictions, chief among them:
#the communication was made in the presence of individuals who were neither attorney nor client, or was disclosed to such individuals,
#the communication was made for the purpose of committing a crime or tort,
#the client has waived the privilege (for example by publicly disclosing the communication).

A corollary to the attorney–client privilege is the [[joint defense privilege]], which is also called the [[common interest rule]].&lt;ref name=Laforest3&gt;''LaForest v. Honeywell International Inc.'', 2004 WL 1498916, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The common interest rule "serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to another party where a joint defense or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel."&lt;ref name=Laforest3/&gt;

An attorney speaking publicly in regard to a client's personal business and private affairs can be reprimanded by the bar and/or disbarred, regardless of the fact that he or she may be no longer representing the client. Discussing a client's or past client's criminal history, or otherwise, is viewed as a breach of confidentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html |title= Client-Lawyer Relationship Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information |website=www.americanbar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attorney–client privilege is separate from and should not be confused with the [[work-product doctrine]].

==When the privilege may not apply==
When an attorney is not acting primarily as an attorney but, for instance, as a business advisor, member of the Board of Directors, or in another non-legal role, then the privilege generally does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;''North Pacifica, LLC v. City of Pacifica,'' 274 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1127 (N.D. Cal 2003); ''Handguards, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,'' 69 F.R.D. 451, 453 (N.D. Cal 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

The privilege protects the confidential communication, and not the underlying information.  For instance, if a client has previously disclosed confidential information to a third party who is not an attorney, and then gives the same information to an attorney, the attorney–client privilege will still protect the communication to the attorney, but will not protect the communication with the third party.

The privilege may be waived if the confidential communications are disclosed to third parties.

Other limits to the privilege may apply depending on the situation being adjudicated.

===Disclosure in case of a crime, tort, or fraud===
The crime-fraud exception can render the privilege moot when communications between an attorney and client are themselves used to further a crime, [[tort]], or fraud. In ''Clark v. United States'', the [[US Supreme Court]] stated that "A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told."&lt;ref&gt;''Clark v. United States'', 289 U.S. 1, 15 (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; The crime-fraud exception also ''does'' require that the crime or fraud discussed between client and attorney be carried out to be triggered.&lt;ref&gt;In re Grand Jury Subpoena of Francis D. Carter, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19597 (citing In re Sealed Case, 107 F.3d 46, 49, 51 (D.C. Cir. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; US Courts have not yet conclusively ruled how little knowledge an attorney can have of the underlying crime or fraud before the privilege detaches and the attorney's communications or requisite testimony become admissible.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''United States v. Bauer'' 132 F.3d 504 (9th Cir. 1997) vs. ''In re Grand Jury Proceedings'' (1996) (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disclosure ostensibly to support lawyer's own interests===
Lawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.

Lawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates  proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness—a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such action.

===Disclosure for the purpose of probate===
{{see also|Probate court|Surrogate's court}}
Another case is for the [[probate]] of a [[last will and testament]]. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and [[testator]] may be disclosed in order to prove that a will represented the intent of the now deceased [[decedent]]. In many instances, the will, [[codicil (will)|codicil]], or other parts of the [[Estate planning|estate plan]] require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.

In certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the will may leave a [[legacy (property law)|legacy]] to a [[paramour]] or a [[natural child]].

Courts have occasionally revoked the privilege after the death of the client if it is deemed that doing so serves the client's intent, such as in the case of resolving testamentary disputes among heirs.

==Tax practice==
In the United States, communications between accountants and their clients are usually not privileged. A person who is worried about accusations of questionable accounting, such as [[tax evasion]], may decide to work only with an attorney or only with an accountant who is also an attorney; some or all of the resulting communications may be privileged provided that all the requirements for the attorney–client privilege are met. The mere fact that the practitioner is an attorney will not create a valid attorney–client privilege with respect to a communication, for example, that involves business or accounting advice rather than legal advice.

Under Federal tax law in the United States, for communications on or after July 22, 1998, there is a limited Federally authorized [[accountant–client privilege]] that may apply to certain communications with non–attorneys.

==In the federal courts==
If a case arises in the federal court system, the federal court will apply Rule 501 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] to determine whether to apply the privilege law of the relevant state or federal common law.  If the case is brought to the federal court under [[diversity jurisdiction]], the law of the relevant state will be used to apply the privilege.  If the case involves a [[federal question]], the federal court will apply the federal common law of attorney–client privilege; however, Rule 501 grants flexibility to the federal courts, allowing them to construe the privilege "in light of experience and reason".

[[File:Colectividad Bielorrusa de Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Belarusians of Argentina on the Immigrant Day, [[Buenos Aires]], 2010]]
'''Belarusian Argentines''' ({{lang-be|Беларусы ў Аргенціне}}, {{lang-ru|Белорусы в Аргентине}}, {{lang-es|Bielorrusos en Argentina}}) — a part of the [[Belarusian diaspora]] that consists of the [[Belarusians]] who emigrated to [[Argentina]] and their descendants. The community was formed in the [[20th century]], now it accounts for 7,000 people&lt;ref name="BelarusTimes"/&gt; and about  50,000 descendants. The largest Belarusian community in [[Latin America]] is in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cervantes.es/imagenes/File/cidic/informe_sobre_el_espanol_en_bielorrusia.pdf Informe sobre el español en BIELORRUSIA] Centro de Investigación y Documentación del Instituto Cervantes (CIDIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before World War I==
Presumably the first [[Emigration|emigrants]] from Belarus came to Argentina after [[French invasion of Russia]] (1812). A part of the Belarusians, who fought for [[Napoleon]] in the Lithuanian military unit (under the command of Knishevich and Rynkevich Generals), moved to [[First French Empire|France]] after the defeat. There were Argentinian agencies at that time that recruited military and civilian specialists. Some [[Poles]] and Belarusians further moved to Argentina to join the Argentinian army.&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Tyavlovski|first=Emil|url=http://pdf.kamunikat.org/download.php?item=13633-1.pdf|script-title=be:Беларусы ў Аргентыне|trans-title=Belarusians in Argentina|language=be|journal=Records: Belarusian Institute of Science and Art|publisher=Belarusian Institute of Science and Art in the USA|date=2009|volume=32|pages=75–85|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of emigration from Belarus to Argentina before the [[World War I]] is insufficiently explored. The statistical immigration service in Argentina is recorded only since 1857. From that time and until 1915 161,422 people left the [[Russian Empire]] for Argentina.&lt;ref name="ShKh1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheĭnbaum|first1=Lina Solomonovna|author2=I. F. Khoroshaeva|title=Аргентинский этнос: этапы формирования и развития|trans-title=Argentinian ethnos: stages of formation and development|language=ru|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7cKAQAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Nauka}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}} However, this statistic data does not contain any information concerning the ethnicity, only the country of origin. This is known for now that most of the emigrants were [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref name="BSUMessenger"&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Shabeltsev|first=S. V.|url=http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/6209/1/pages%2015-19%20from%20Вестник_БГУ_Ноябрь_2008_Серия3_№3.pdf|script-title=ru:Адаптация белорусских иммигрантов в Аргентине в 1900-1950-х гг.|trans-title=Adaptation of Belarusian immigrants in Argentina in 1900-1950s|language=ru|journal=BSU Messenger|publisher=Belarusian State University|volume=3|issue=3|pages=15–19|date=2008|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar period==
[[File:Conjunto musical de obreros bielorrusos en Comodoro Rivadavia ca.1930.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Musical ensemble of workers Belarusians, [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], 1930s]]
During the [[interwar period]] only the emigration from [[West Belarus]] was possible.
The emigration included mostly single men-peasants who were traveling to work, although there were also soldiers who fought together with [[Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz|Stanislav Bulak-Balakhovich]].&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt; The number of Belarusians who emigrated during this period accounts for about 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|format=PDF|last=Shabeltsev|first=Sergei Vasilevich|url=http://www.bsmu.by/files/91b3bee601e054647b8d2e03e5544ddc/|script-title=ru:Уроженцы брестчины в Аргентине: идентификация эмигрантов межвоенного периода|trans-title=Natives of Brest in Argentina: identification of the immigrants in the interwar period|language=ru|journal=Брестчина: история и современность. Сборник материалов республиканской научно-практической конференции|publisher=Belarusian State Medical University|location=Brest|volume=94|issue=82|pages=144–149|date=June 2012|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Polish consulate was not interested in the problems of Belarusians, emigrants began to create associations. In 1934 "The Belarusian Cultural and Educational Association" was founded, in 1937 — "Belarusian Association "Culture"", and "Iwan Luckiewicz Belarusian Library" in 1938 — "The Belarusian Cultural Association "Belavezh"" ("[[Yakub Kolas]]" after the war). In 1939 the combination of all these unions created the "Belarusian Federation of associations in Argentina", to which later two more new associations joined.  A theatrical group was organized there under the library, the group staged performances on the local scene and in neighboring [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt;

When in 1939 [[Invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded by Germany]] 1,140 former Polish citizens (Poles, [[Ukrainians]], Belarusians and Jews) volunteered for the Polish army.&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt;

==After World War II==
In 1945 the Soviet Embassy in Uruguay was opened, and in 1946 — in Argentina. Soviet diplomats called  the former citizens of the [[Western Ukraine]] and Western Belarus to take the old Polish passport in return for Soviet documents, according to which these people were promised to be taken back home. Many emigrants believed that Soviet propaganda. The fact was that those people were leaving [[Second Polish Republic]] and never lived under the Soviet regime, that was why they had idealistic idea about the [[Soviet Union]]. In addition there was a kind of euphoria associated with the end of the [[World War II|war]] and the victory of the Soviet Union in it.&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt; Moreover, part of old emigrants felt animosity towards new refugees from the post-war Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="BSUMessenger"/&gt;
 
By 1950 the Belarusian community in Argentina reached its high point, there lived more than 30,000 Belarusians at that time.&lt;ref name="BSUMessenger"/&gt;

In 1949 "Slavic Union in Argentina" — [[Communism|pro-communist]] [[Slavs|Slavic]] organization created in 1941 and supported by the Soviet Union — increased its activities. The members of the "Union" held their demonstration, carried out provocations and organized assaults on the members of other Slavic national organizations. 14 members of the "Union" were later deported by the Argentine authorities to their homeland. Meanwhile, under the influence of the Soviet embassy propaganda Belarusian associations switched to the communist ideas.&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt; Under President [[Juan Perón]] however persecution of communists started and all pro-communist associations were prohibited.

[[File:Colectividad bielorrusa, rusa y ucraniana - Dia del Inmigrante en el Planetario Galileo Galilei.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Immigrant Day, [[Buenos Aires]], 2010]]
Later Soviet international societies emerged, they combined all the Soviet nations and people sympathetic with the Soviet regime. Such organizations were often called "cultural-sports clubs". The work of such organizations was periodically cut short as before 1983 there were [[National Reorganization Process|military juntas]] that ruled in Argentina intermittently.&lt;ref name="BSUMessenger"/&gt;

In 1955 the "amnesty law" was enacted in the Soviet Union, according to the law the citizens of interwar Poland were allowed to return to the Soviet Union. Around 2,000 Belarusians have taken the advantage of this opportunity, but about 200 of them came back to Argentina in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="kamunikat75"/&gt;

==Modern times==
In 2010  "[[Konstanty Kalinowski|Kastus Kalinouski]] Belarusian Cultural Center" was opened in [[Llavallol]] ([[Greater Buenos Aires]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarus.kz/aktueller/all/853/348 |script-title=be:Новы Цэнтр беларускай культуры |trans-title=New Belarusian Culture Center |language=be |publisher=Belarus.kz |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://argentina.mfa.gov.by/ru/bilateral_relations/compatriots/|script-title=ru:Сотрудничество с белорусской диаспорой|trans-title=Cooperation with the Belarusian diaspora|language=ru|work=Republic of Belarus Embassy in the Argentine Republic|date=|accessdate=17 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213184001/http://argentina.mfa.gov.by/ru/bilateral_relations/compatriots/|archivedate=13 December 2014|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert A. Ley'''&lt;ref name="regents"/&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː}}; born March 16, 1955) is an American sports anchor and reporter for [[ESPN (United States)|ESPN]]. A multiple [[Emmy Award]]-winner, he is the longest-tenured on-air employee of the network, having joined ESPN just three days after the network's 1979 launch.&lt;ref name="octagon"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ley grew up in [[Bloomfield, New Jersey]], where he attended [[Bloomfield High School (New Jersey)|Bloomfield High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandomir, Richard. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EFD7163AF934A35755C0A96E958260 "TV SPORTS; Disney Making a Commitment to Complete Soccer Coverage"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 7, 1998; accessed December 25, 2007. "''The American games are important,'' said Ley, who became a soccer enthusiast when he attended Bloomfield High School in New Jersey during the North American Soccer League's heyday."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Conor. [http://www.nj.com/soccer-news/index.ssf/2010/06/after_all_this_time_soccer_sti.html "Bloomfield native Bob Ley will be the face of the World Cup for ESPN"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', June 9, 2010; accessed July 18, 2011. "Unfortunately for Bob Ley, he was the first of the two team managers to show up at Bloomfield High's soccer practice on that fall afternoon in 1971. His best friend and co-manager Bob Longo disagrees on the circumstances, but remembers vividly the sight of the future ESPN anchor in a compromising position after the team's players stuffed Ley into the wire equipment cart and rolled him straight into the pond near the field."&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start in broadcasting as a sportscaster and program director at [[WSOU]] at [[Seton Hall University]], and interned as a production staffer at WOR-AM in New York City. After graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]'' with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Communications, Ley worked several minor broadcasting jobs, including public address announcer with the [[New York Cosmos (1971–1985)|New York Cosmos]] [[football (soccer)|soccer]] team, before landing his first major position with ESPN just three days after the network's launch in 1979.&lt;ref name="octagon"&gt;[http://www.octagon.com/news/press_releases/iconic_espn_broadcaster_bob_ley_signs_with_octagon Bob Ley signs with Octagon, octagon.com; accessed May 8, 2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226233632/http://www.octagon.com/news/press_releases/iconic_espn_broadcaster_bob_ley_signs_with_octagon |date=December 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4965">Investigation on charges of corruption against [[Indonesia]]n [[President of Indonesia|second president]] [[Soeharto]] mainly focused on [[corruption]] he was made during his 32-years rule. In ''Global Transparency Report'' made by [[Transparency International]] in 2004, he was ranked first on the most corrupt leader, causing loss of 15-25 billion [[US$]] of state fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf Global Transparency Report], [[Transparency International]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasional.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/hukum/14/07/04/n85dwn-soeharto-diktator-terkorup-sedunia-abad-ke20 Suharto, Diktator terkorup dunia abad ke-20] (in Indonesian), [[Republika (Indonesian newspaper)|Republika]], 04-07-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Soeharto headed several organisations that continuously established during his rule, with various functions those foundations had, including to provide [[scholarship|educational]], [[health]], and support for [[veteran]]s fought in [[Trikora]]. All of those organisations suspected to receiving money that was embezzled from state funds.&lt;ref name="tempoco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasional.tempo.co/read/news/2015/08/11/063690940/yayasan-supersemar-dan-5-yayasan-soeharto-dibidik-kejaksaan|title=Yayasan Supersemar dan 5 Yayasan Soeharto Dibidik Kejaksaan|work=Tempo Nasional}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After the [[fall of Soeharto]], calls for arrest of Suharto after corruption charges emerged. [[People's Consultative Assembly]] decree no. XI/1998 declares that any attempts on eradicating corruption must be done thoroughly, including against president Suharto that was mentioned explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menpan.go.id/jdih/permen-kepmen/lainnya/file/3848-tap-mpr-no-xi-tahun-1998 TAP MPR no XI/1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite of ongoing investigation on alleged corruption case, in 2006 [[Attorney general#Indonesia|Attorney-general]] Abdul Rachman Saleh said that he had authorized the issuance of "Termination of Criminal Persecution Decree" ''(Surat Keputusan Penghentian Penuntutan Pidana, SKP3)'', which suspends all attempt to prosecute [[Soeharto]] on ground that his physical and mental health unfit to attend court session. The decision was overturned by [[South Jakarta]] state court under grounds that physical and mental fitness wasn't a valid reason to suspend prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikorupsi.org/id/content/skp3-soeharto-tidak-sah-secara-hukum|title=SKP3 Soeharto Tidak Sah Secara Hukum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revocation on the decree allowed the process to prosecute Suharto to continue.

[[Soeharto]]'s death in January 2008 doesn't stop the investigation of the corruption case, with his children replaced him as defendant on his corruption case just shortly before his death.

== Foundations ==

===Supersemar===
Established by Soeharto in 1974, this organisation providing [[scholarships]] for Indonesian students. Income of this foundation was mainly from state-owned banks, with Decree no. 15/1976 legitimizes state-owned banks income to be deposited to Supersemar Foundation.

In 2015, Supersemar Foundation was founded guilty after several failed attempt on cassations in 2015, which forced the organisation to pay 4.4. trillion [[rupiah]].&lt;ref name="detikcom"&gt;[http://news.detik.com/berita/2988088/babak-baru-keluarga-mantan-presiden-soeharto-dihukum-rp-44-triliun?single=1 Babak baru, keluarga mantan presiden Soeharto dihukum 4,4 triliun]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation had their income of 420 million [[US$]] and 185 billion [[rupiah]], which was initially arranged for scholarships but instead was delivered among [[Soeharto]] and his crony companies. 420 million [[US$]] was distributed to [[Bank Danamon|Bank Duta]], 13 billion [[rupiah]] to [[Sempati Air]], and the rest was to other companies and cooperatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20150813160057-15-71997/catatan-dana-yayasan-supersemar-soeharto-yang-diselewengkan/ Catatan dana Yayasan Supersemar yang Diselewengkan] (in Indonesian), [[CNN Indonesia]], 2015-08-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dana Sejahtera Mandiri===
In 1995, Soeharto issued presidential decree no. 90 which recommends all [[taxpayer]]s with income above 100 million [[rupiah]] to "donate" 2% of their income to this organisation. This decree was revised by decree no. 92/1996, which makes the donation compulsory. The decree legitimate losses of 1,4 trillion rupiah that was distributed among Soeharto families, with 112 billion rupiah distributed to his son's bank.&lt;ref name="tempoco"/&gt;

=== Trikora ===
The foundation was formed to support sons and daughters of [[Trikora]] veterans who lost their lives. In year 2000, Indonesian [[attorney general]] had accused this organisation to contribute to losses of 7 billion [[rupiah]] which was allocated to unrelated affairs of the organisation.&lt;ref name="tempoco" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">{{Political corruption sidebar|image=[[File:Flag of Montenegro.svg|150px]]}}In recent years, [[Montenegro]] has increased its efforts to implement preventive and legislative measures needed to curb corruption. For example, anti-bribery provisions in the Criminal Code, as well as laws on money laundering, [[conflict of interest]], access to information, and political funding have all been strengthened, while awareness-raising activities and training of public officials in integrity standards have been intensified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montenegro Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/montenegro/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, corruption remains a serious problem in the country. The European Commission finds in its Progress Report 2013 that efficiency in the fight against corruption is constrained by frequent legislative changes and the lax attitude among law enforcement authorities to investigate corruption allegations, especially those involving high-level officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montenegro 2013 Progress Report|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/4000093/EU_montenegro_2013.pdf|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas ==
=== Business ===
In the World Economic Forum’s [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014, surveyed business executives rank access to financing, corruption and inefficient bureaucracy as the most problematic factors for doing business in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=The World Economic Forum|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active and passive bribery is prohibited by the Montenegrin Criminal Code, and government officials are subject to more stringent requirements under the Law on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest, which stipulates that they may only receive appropriate gifts of small value (not exceeding the amount of EUR 50).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montenegro Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/montenegro/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 64th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crime''' is present in various forms in [[the Philippines]], and remains a serious issue throughout the country. [[Illegal drug trade]], [[human trafficking]], [[murder]], [[corruption]] and [[domestic violence]] remain significant concerns. The Philippines has a high rate of murder cases, which is the highest in [[Southeast Asia]] as of 2014. Most major cities are plagued with high prevalence of crimes.

== Crime by type ==

===Organized crime===  
Organized crime in the Philippines can be linked to certain families or barkadas (groups) who perpetrate crimes ranging from [[extortion]], sale of illegal narcotics and [[loan sharking]] to [[robbery]], [[kidnapping]], and [[contract killing|murder-for-hire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Kowalzki, Eugene|date=12 July 2010|title=Filipino Gangs in the Philippines|publisher=Zimbio|url=http://www.zimbio.com/The+Philippines/articles/PR2SNUkbmGf/Filipino+Gangs+Philippines|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714163338/http://www.zimbio.com/The%2BPhilippines/articles/PR2SNUkbmGf/Filipino%2BGangs%2BPhilippines|archivedate=14 July 2010|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Illegal drug trade====
{{main|Illegal drug trade in the Philippines}}
[[Illegal drug trade]] is common all around the Philippines, and is a major concern. [[Methamphetamine]] ("shabu") and [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] ("weeds" or "damo"), are the most common drugs accounting most drug-related arrests. Most of the illegal drug trade involved members of large [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Triad (organized crime)|triad groups]] operating in the Philippines, owing to its location on drug smuggling routes.

===Petty crime===
Petty crime, which includes pick-pocketing, is a problem in the Philippines. It takes place usually in locations with many people, ranging from shopping hubs to churches. Traveling alone to withdraw cash after dark is a risk, especially for foreigners.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safety.worldnomads.com/Philippines/73433/Crime-in-the-Philippines |title=Crime in the Philippines |publisher=World Nomads |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violent crime ===
{{See|Violence against women in the Philippines}}
Violent crime is high in the country; foreigners are usually the victims. As many Filipinos are stricken with poverty, one alternative they take is to kidnap others for money.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
====Rape====
{{main|Rape in the Philippines}}
====Murder====
In 2014, the Philippines has a murder rate of 9.84 per 100,000 people, with a number of 9,784 recorded cases. The country also has the highest rate of murder cases in Southeast Asia in 2013, with a rate of 8.8, followed by Thailand.{{sfn|UNODC|2014|p=24}} The murder rate in the Philippines reached its peak in 2002 and 2010, with rates of 8.1 (6,553 cases) and 9.5 (8,894 cases). {{Sfn|UNODC|2014|p=128}}

===Human trafficking===

In an effort to deal with the problem, the Philippines passed Republic Act (R.A.) 9208, the [[Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003]], a penal law against [[human trafficking]], [[sex tourism]], [[sex slavery]] and [[Prostitution of children|child prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9208.html|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9208 - AN ACT TO INSTITUTE POLICIES TO ELIMINATE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN, ESTABLISHING THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR THE PROTECTION AND SUPPORT OF TRAFFICKED PERSONS, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR ITS VIOLATIONS, AND FOR OTHER|author=RONALD ECHALAS DIAZ, Office Manager|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, enforcement is reported to be inconsistent.&lt;ref name="IrishRevealed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revealed: In Cities and Towns All Over the Philippines, Irishmen Pay to Have Sex with Children|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article.tvt?_scope=TribuneFTF&amp;id=77709|date=2006-09-24|work=[[The Sunday Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Newspapers PLC|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5OzhDYYFa?url=http://www.tribune.ie/article.tvt?_scope=TribuneFTF&amp;id=77709|archivedate=2007-05-21|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Prostitution====
{{Main|Prostitution in the Philippines}}
[[Prostitution in the Philippines]] is illegal. It is a serious crime with penalties ranging up to [[life imprisonment]] for those involved in [[Human trafficking|trafficking]].

===Corruption and police misconduct===
{{Main|Corruption in the Philippines}}

Corruption is a great problem in the Philippines. In May 2013, during the country's elections, some 504 political candidates were accused mostly of corruption and some of violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pcij.org/stories/sandiganbayan-files-256-poll-winners-have-graft-crime-cases-17-convicted/ |title=Sandiganbayan files: 256 poll winners have graft, crime cases; 17 convicted |newspaper=The Philippines Centre of Investigative Journalism |date=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police misconduct is a known issue in the country; in April 2013, a short video, titled ''Like a BOSS'', showcasing the assault on an unarmed individual by three police officers went viral online, prompting the [[Philippine National Police]] to investigate the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/2013/04/08/928358/pnp-probes-brutality-viral-video |title=PNP probes 'brutality' in viral video |date=April 8, 2013 |last=Diola |first=Camille |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eliot Spitzer.jpg|thumb|175px|Eliot Spitzer in 2004]]
On March 10, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] had patronized an elite escort service run by [[Emperors Club VIP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/nyregion/07prostitution.html |title=Four Charged With Running Online Prostitution Ring |first=Alan |last=Feuer |date=March 7, 2008 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing scandal led to him receiving criticism and ridicule in the media, and eventually Spitzer resigned as Governor a week later on March 17. 

==The scandal==
===Investigations===
The investigation of Spitzer was initiated after [[North Fork Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;Richburg, Keith B.; Schmidt, Susan; Johnson, Carrie (March 11, 2008). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/11/AR2008031100380.html "FBI Watched Spitzer Before February Incident"]. ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; reported the suspicious transactions to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department's]] [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] as required by the [[Bank Secrecy Act]], which was enhanced by [[Patriot Act]] provisions, enacted to combat terrorist activity such as money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;Hosenball, Mark (March 15, 2008). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/03/15/unintended-consequences.html "Unintended consequences: Spitzer got snagged by the fine print of the Patriot Act"]. ''Newsweek''.&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer had at least seven liaisons with prostitutes from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000 for their services. Federal agents had him under surveillance twice in 2008.&lt;ref name=determinationCNN&gt;{{cite news |title=Sources: Spitzer used call-girl service at least 8 times |publisher=CNN|date=March 12, 2008 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/12/spitzer.investigation/index.html |accessdate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, Robert.

[[File:Emperors Club Screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of the website of [[Emperors Club VIP]].]]
According to ''[[Newsday]]'', Spitzer wanted to transfer more than $10,000 to a front company for the prostitution ring. However, he [[Structuring|broke up the transactions]] into smaller slices due to federal law requiring the reporting of any transfer of $10,000 or more. When he tried to get his name taken off the wires, the bank refused, saying that the money had already been wired out and that it would be improper to do so in any case. The [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division]] then began a probe, initially fearing that Spitzer was the victim of either [[extortion]] or [[identity theft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert E. |last=Kessler |authorlink= |title=Eliot Spitzer's bank turned him in to the IRS |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/state/ny-stspitzerbank0312,0,4637246.story |work=[[Newsday]] |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emperors Club Pricelist.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of the website of [[Emperors Club VIP]] showing list of prices for escort services.]]
North Fork's report in July 2007 went largely unnoticed until [[HSBC]] filed a report in the fall that the transactions were going to QAT International and QAT Consulting Group, which were offshore [[Shell (corporation)|shell companies]] operating as a front for the [[Emperors Club VIP]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/nyregion/13legal.html "Spitzer Fall Began With Bank Reports"]. ''The New York Times''. March 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the IRS contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate possible political corruption. The investigation led federal authorities to link the money transfers to the Emperors Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4424507&amp;page=1 |title=It Wasn't the Sex; Suspicious $$ Transfers Led to Spitzer |first=Brian |last=Ross |date=March 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-Arena"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/11/spitzer.money/index.html |title= Sources: Money transfers spurred Spitzer probe |accessdate= March 11, 2008 |last=Arena |first=Kelli |date=March 11, 2008 |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors charged the four people operating the [[escort service]] with violations of the [[Mann Act]] a week prior to the revelations of Spitzer's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Eric. "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88104308 The Long, Colorful History of the Mann Act]". [[NPR]]. March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 2007, Republican operative [[Roger Stone]] sent a letter to the [[FBI]] saying that Spitzer "used the service of high-priced [[call girl]]s" while in Florida. Stone provided detail saying that Spitzer wore calf-length black socks while having sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/03232008/news/regionalnews/eliot_tipster_a_gop_swinger_103165.htm "Spitzer Tipster A GOP 'Swinger' Told FBI of Hooker Habit Back In Nov"], ''New York Post'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"I cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the people's work," Spitzer said at a news conference in New York City. "Over the course of my public life, I have insisted – I believe correctly – that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor."&lt;ref name=SAlberts/&gt;

In November 2008, the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Spitzer for violating the Mann Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/nyregion/07spitzer.html "No Federal Prostitution Charges for Spitzer"], DANNY HAKIM, WILLIAM K.

===Reactions===
After Spitzer's initial press conference, [[New York State Assembly]] Republican Minority Leader [[James Tedisco]] and Republican New York Congressman [[Peter T.

According to [[Nell Minow]], a corporate-governance expert, [[Wall Street]] reaction to the scandal has been largely positive, due to a general dislike of Spitzer amongst investment professionals.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;

He had prosecuted several prostitution rings in his career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E1D91438F93BA35757C0A9629C8B63 |title=18 Arrested in Lucrative Prostitution Ring out of Staten Island |last=Rashbaum |first=William K |date=April 8, 2004 |accessdate=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his connection with a prostitution ring was felt as a betrayal by some women's rights and anti-human trafficking groups that had previously worked with him.&lt;ref name="NYT-foes-of-sex-trade"&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/nyregion/12prostitute.html?ex=1363060800&amp;en=62e2c73b61a86fa8&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title=Foes of Sex Trade Are Stung by the Fall of an Ally |last=Bernstein |first=Nina |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial reflecting on the scandal, political writer [[Martha Nussbaum]] wrote "Spitzer's offense was an offense against his family. It was not an offense against the public. If he broke any laws, these are laws that never should have existed and that have been repudiated by sensible nations."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, "[http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/2008/03/13/spitzered_0314.html Trading on America's puritanical streak]", ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political impact===
Spitzer announced on March 12, 2008 that he would resign his post as Governor effective noon on March 17 amid threats of his [[impeachment]] by state lawmakers.&lt;ref name=resignationCNN&gt;{{cite news
| title = 'Deeply sorry,' Spitzer to step down by Monday

| url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/12/spitzer/index.html
| accessdate = March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lt. Gov. [[David Paterson]] succeeded him on March 17, 2008. By resigning, Spitzer lost his status as a [[superdelegate]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic nomination for President]], depriving [[Hillary Clinton]], whom he supported, of a superdelegate vote. This also reduced the total number of superdelegate votes available. Spitzer discussed his status as a superdelegate on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on February 12, 2008, the day before Spitzer met his escort at the Mayflower Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=156307 Gov.

[[Kristin M. Davis]], a competing madam who was involved in the scandal, served four months of jail time on [[Rikers Island]] as a result of the scandal, and later announced a run for Spitzer's old seat in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010]]. Davis finished in last place among those on the ballot.

Overseas, [[Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster]] was a high-profile casualty of the scandal when Emperors Club prostitutes alleged that he had been a client. The allegations were followed by Grosvenor stepping down in March 2007 as [[Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Reserves and Cadets)]] in the British Ministry of Defence, a position he had held for four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-456505/Duke-joins-rank-file.html Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff steps down], Daily Mail, Retrieved 2012-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Comptroller Election===
Both Spitzer and Davis ran in the [[New York City Comptroller Election, 2013|2013 election]] to become the [[New York City Comptroller]]. There was some debate as to whether or not Spitzer's name recognition would help him in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barbaro, Michael|first=Chen, David W.|title=Spitzer Rejoins Politics, Asking for Forgiveness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/nyregion/spitzer-seeks-ballot-for-city-comptrollers-race.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer lost.

The '''Elizabethan Club''' is a social club at [[Yale University]] named for [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and her era. Its profile and members tend toward a literary disposition, and conversation is one of the Club's chief purposes.

The Elizabethan Club's collection of 16th and 17th Century books and artifacts include [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespearean folios]] and [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|quartos]], first editions of [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]'', and [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''Essayes'', all locked in the Club's famous vault. The collection is only available for inspection at certain times, or to researchers upon request at Yale's [[Beinecke Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/BeinCatM/elizabethan.html Beinecke Cataloging Manual - Elizabethan Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501040348/http://www.library.yale.edu/BeinCatM/elizabethan.html |date=1 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea is served daily during the semester and members may invite guests on specified days. The Club accepts female and male undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff.

== History ==
[[Image:YaleElizabethanClubBorosonGarden.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Architect Kenneth Boroson, 1995-6, Elizabethan Club Garden. Engraved under the bust of Shakespeare: "I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, Quite over-canopied with lush woodbine, With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine..."]] The Club was founded in 1911 by [[Alexander Smith Cochran]], a member of the Yale Class of 1896 and [[Wolf's Head (secret society)|Wolf's Head Society]]. As an undergraduate he had regretted the lack of a congenial atmosphere in which to discuss literature and the arts with classmates and faculty. In 1910 he began to assemble a small but exceptional collection of first and early editions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean plays that he had studied with [[William Lyon Phelps]], and in 1911 he offered the collection to Yale as the central point of interest for a club where conversation – and tea — would be available every afternoon. Mr. Cochran also provided a Clubhouse, with quarters for a resident steward, and a generous endowment of $100,000. His portrait hangs above the fireplace in the Vault Room, and his birthday (28 February) is marked by an annual Founder’s Dinner.  The life portrait of the [[Queen Elizabeth I|''Virgine Queene'']] in the Tea Room, attributed to [[Federico Zuccari]], came with the founder’s original gift.  Began during the literary renaissance at the university between 1909 and 1920, the club attracted such book collectors as [[William Lyon Phelps|Phelps]], [[Chauncey Brewster Tinker]], and [[John Berdan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h9EYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22elizabethan+club%22&amp;as_brr=1 A magnificent farce: and other ... - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yale Elizabethan Club Phoenix Motif.jpg|left|thumb|100px|The [[falcon]] motif of Yale's Elizabethan Club, from a badge of Queen Elizabeth I]]

Mr. Cochran’s gift of 141 folios and quartos includes, among other important volumes, the first four Shakespeare Folios, one of the three known copies of the 1604 Hamlet, and the copy of [[Ben Jonson|Ben Jonson’s]] Works (1616) inscribed by the author to his friend Francis Young. Over the years additional volumes of equal importance, such as first or early quartos of all the major dramatists, have been acquired by gift and purchase, and the entire collection now numbers around 300 volumes. A catalogue of this collection, ''The Elizabethan Club of Yale University and Its Library'', prepared by Yale's Stephen Parks, was published in 1986 and considerably expanded in a 2011 edition. The club vault also holds a sample of 16th Century documents, manuscripts (for example, a letter of condolence from Queen Elizabeth to her friend Lady Southwell, 15 October 1598) and medals (one celebrating the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588), as well as various artefacts (a lock of [[Lord Byron|Byron’s]] hair; a snuff box carved from a mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare at New Place, his home at Stratford; and a guest book signed by many of the Club's visitors&lt;ref&gt;[http://mssa.library.yale.edu/madid/showzoom.php?id=ru&amp;ruid=36&amp;pg=3&amp;imgNum=10672 The Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.yale.edu/Campus/Building1.asp?lstBldg=1960 |accessdate=1 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Documents relating to the club's organization and activities, including a tradition of formal correspondence written in Latin to the [[Signet Society]] at Harvard, are viewable at the online Yale Manuscripts and Archives Collection:&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.yale.edu/madid/oneItem.aspx?id=1773533 The Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activity ==
The club is dedicated to conversation, tea, the art of the book, and literature, focused on—but not exclusively of—the Elizabethan era.  During the academic year the Clubhouse is open daily for the use of its members from 8 in the morning until 10 in the evening.  Tea is served every afternoon during termtime from 4 until 6.  A 1920 observer noted among "certain hopeful signs of the times, current British and American periodicals are neatly lined up on tables, configurations of other little tables, sofas and chairs provide many nooks for quiet discussion or reading, and upstairs even includes a room dedicated almost entirely to archives of [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']], the former English magazine of humor and satire.  Outside, the club has a deep back garden with a pavilion, understated elegant plantings, and featuring a bust of the Bard himself, to facilitate the enjoyments of finger sandwiches, cookies and croquet."

From time to time, the Club sponsors special events such as Club Nights with a speaker and discussion; seasonal parties and teas; and an annual lecture honoring Maynard Mack (1909-2001), former president of the Club, longtime faculty member and illustrious Shakespeare scholar.  Mack lecturers have included [[Joanne Akalaitis]], [[John Barton (director)|John Barton]], [[Tony Church (actor)|Tony Church]], [[Lisa Harrow]], [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]], [[Mark Lamos]], Carey Perloff, [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] and [[Sam Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/97-04-16-02.all.html Sam Waterston to Deliver Maynard Mack Lecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000919003239/http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/97-04-16-02.all.html |date=19 September 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club also has underwritten the production of a small series of books, published by the Yale University Press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?series=30 Elizabethan Club Series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, publishing specialized works relating to the Club's mission has been a practice dating back to its early years.

== Membership ==
Membership in the Elizabethan Club, by invitation only, includes undergraduates (15 members are elected per class year; however, freshmen are not admitted; accordingly there are at most 45 current undergraduates at any time), graduate students, University staff, and faculty.  The affairs of the Club are managed by a self-perpetuating Board of Incorporators (6 members of the University) that meets twice a year in October and May and by an elected Board of Governors that meets monthly. It is not a 'final society,' in that membership in another Yale secret society, association or club is not a bar to also having club membership.

==Books==

* The Lizzie informally fosters appreciation for the Art of the Book and of fine printing and typography, befitting a campus with a number of working old fashioned undergraduate presses.
* Guests sign in upon entering; consequently, the Lizzie's collection of these guestbooks includes autographs of prominent literary, arts, and other prominent figures who have visited.  Among these are [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Edward Heath]], [[Robert Frost]], (a frequent visitor) [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[W.B. Yeats]], [[Eva Le Gallienne]], [[Diana Rigg]],  [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Dr. Ruth Westheimer]], and [[Kenneth Branagh]].
* On the second floor, the Map Room contains a collection of books about Shakespeare and the Elizabethan period, most of them published in the middle of the twentieth century.  In the Study Room there are bound copies of Punch from 1847 to 1985, and in the Governors Room numerous bound sets of British and European authors, plus a small collection of books presented to the Club by authors who are members.

==Notable members==

* Club founder Alexander Smith Cochran, heir to a carpet manufacturer, led an eventful life.  Referred to on the eve of his 'secret' marriage to the Polish opera singer Mme. Ganna Walska as "New York's Richest Bachelor",&lt;ref&gt;[http://mssa.library.yale.edu/madid/showzoom.php?id=ru&amp;ruid=36&amp;pg=2&amp;imgNum=10668 The Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; within a short period, he was contesting the marriage (he was her third of six husbands) as illegal, claiming her first husband was still living when Cochran married her, and they separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mssa.library.yale.edu/madid/showzoom.php?id=ru&amp;ruid=36&amp;pg=2&amp;imgNum=10666 The Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cochran's exploits socially, financially and in sailing (he headed Americas Cup syndicates) were widely covered in newspapers of the day.
* [[Cole Porter]], a member himself, made reference to the Club in two of his songs: "A Member of the Yale Elizabethan Club", a satirical description of a self-absorbed "Lizzie" member, and "Since We've Met," in which he satirizes a prudish couple, writing "We shrink at any oath except a soft 'Beelzebub.' / We're out-Elizabething the Elizabethan Club."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AJWKS3w0BNAC&amp;dq The complete lyrics of Cole Porter - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) considers food distribution as a subset of the [[Food systems|food system]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W0078e/w0078e04.htm|title=Chapter 3 - The food system and factors affecting household food security and nutrition|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.fao.org|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process and [[methodology]] behind food distribution varies by location. Food distribution has been a defining characteristic of [[human behavior]] in all societies, and recordings of food distribution date back for thousands of years.

One clear and defined documentation of historical food distribution comes from the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Many Roman rulers and emperors sought to determine the best method of distributing food throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and as the demands of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Roman people]] changed in time, so too did their leaders’ plans. In the few centuries after the death of [[Jesus|Christ]], the ''annona'' became a prominent aspect in Roman food distribution. As the Empire expanded and the accessibility to certain foods changed, the demand for grain and wine drastically increased, and became a defining aspect of Roman [[food culture]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food for Rome|last=Sirks|first=Boudewijn|publisher=J.C. Gieben|year=1991|isbn=90-5063-069-3|location=Amsterdam|pages=1–13, 303, 361, 388–391|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies prominent after the fall of the Romans continued to deal with the ever-present dilemma of food distribution. The distribution systems of the [[United States]] and [[Latin America]] have developed in unique ways, and faced different problems in the past century. The United States' food distribution system is vast in size and strength, and is dominated by corporations and industry. Current methods of food distribution in the US rely on the country's advanced network of [[infrastructure]] and [[Transportation of goods|transportation]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|last=Statler|first=Matthew|last2=Penuel|first2=Bradley|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4129-7101-0|location=United States of America|pages=225–228|quote=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cases in Food Distribution|last=McNair|first=Malcolm|last2=Applebaum|first2=William|last3=Salmon|first3=Walter|publisher=Richard D.

There are a multitude of risk factors that can affect food distribution. War, [[Economy|economic failure]], [[Politics|political problems]], and weather conditions all play a role in determining the efficiency of any food system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two recent examples of war and [[Economy|economic failure]] impacting food distribution includes the decline of food distribution in [[Empire of Japan|Japan during World War II]] and food [[recession]] in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both cases, food distribution was hindered and the [[population]] in these areas consequently suffered.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Recession and the Food Crisis in Africa|last=Lawrence|first=Peter|publisher=James Currey|year=1986|isbn=0-85255-309-9|location=London|pages=6–7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Food Management in World War II|last=Johnston|first=B.

Special organizations exist today to prevent any total collapses in food distribution, assist in developing food distribution and food systems in underdeveloped areas, and respond to food distribution crises. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) plays a key role in facilitating the growth of food distribution systems all over the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/about/what-we-do/so1/en/|title=What we do|last=|first=|date=2016|website=www.fao.org|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of federal, [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]], and volunteer organizations function in the United States to safeguard the well-being of the US food distribution system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[American Red Cross]] is one key example of a volunteer organization is the US that has an international presence.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief|title=Disaster Relief|last=|first=|date=2016|website=American Red Cross|publisher=The American National Red Cross|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rome ==
The traditional Roman diet consisted of grain, fruits, olive oil, meat and wine. Of all these, grain was extremely important to the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Roman people]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During Rome's height, it is estimated that the city itself needed 150,000 tons of grain and millions of liters of water and wine every year to survive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brlsi.org/events-proceedings/proceedings/25021|title=Feeding Ancient Rome|last=Morley|first=Neville|date=2005|publisher=Bath Royal Literacy and Scientific Institution|access-date=2016-10-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was traditionally the responsibility of the Roman government to guarantee that there was enough food for distribution among the people. In times of shortages, bad harvests, or interference by pirates, the government made sure to fulfill its obligation to food distribution. Officials would sometimes buy food themselves and then sell it back to the people at little to no cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Rome eventually established its Empire, foreign lands would send taxes in grain to Rome, which helped decrease the chance of a food distribution crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The ''Annona'' ===
The first indication of a collective, organized food distribution system within the [[Roman Republic]] comes from the ''annona''. Originally meaning "yearly return", the ''annona'' became the administrative term for governmental bread and grain distribution. Over time, ''annona'' came to represent the distribution of all pertinent foods in the [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman diet]]. The ''annona'' was originally organized between 500 and 50 BCE, and gained increasing influence in the centuries to come. The practice of specifically distributing grain to the [[Plebs|plebeian]] class, known as ''frumentationes'', gained prominence around 120 BCE and supplemented the efforts of the ''annona'' to feed the Roman people. [[Augustus|Emperor Augustus]] officially changed the ''annona'' system between 8 and 14 CE. He established the position of ''praefectus annonae'', Prefect of the Annona. Up to this point in time, the ''annona'' was handled by local government officials called [[aedile]]s. Augustus’ Prefect of the ''Annona'' oversaw all transportation, weighing, [[Inspection (medicine)|inspection]], and storing of state foods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The physical distribution of foods throughout the Roman Empire varied by location and type of food. Some foods were shipped by boat and then distributed once they reached port.  Others, specifically meat, were transported by land and brought into urban areas. Special regulations were put in place for the distribution of olive oil, as the Empire made contracts with olive oil producers all over the Mediterranean. Free daily distributions of olive oil were enacted by [[Severus Alexander|Emperor Severus]] during his reign from 192 to 211 CE. His distribution policy lasted for at least a few centuries, but scholars are unsure if the policy continued thereafter. Wine was not as freely distributed as olive oil, but was sold for a very low price starting around 300 CE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Food Distribution in the 20th and 21st centuries ==

=== US Food Distribution from 1900 to 1960 ===
The United States' food distribution system has experienced major changes in the past hundred years.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Food distribution primarily relied on small, local farms in the 1940s, but quickly grew to become a large business in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=&amp;displayGroupName=Magazines&amp;currPage=&amp;dviSelectedPage=&amp;scanId=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;mode=view&amp;catId=&amp;limiter=&amp;display-query=&amp;displayGroups=&amp;contentModules=&amp;action=e&amp;sortBy=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CA352603575&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;activityType=&amp;failOverType=&amp;commentary=&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=temple_main&amp;jsid=6f206dadcd18b21868a424846f374a10|title=Meal deal; American food distribution|last=|first=|date=2013|work=The Economist|access-date=2016-10-20|via=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three economic advances that allowed for the growth in food distribution between 1910 and 1960 were the establishment of [[chain store]]s, [[Retailers' cooperative|retail cooperatives]], and [[supermarket]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Chain Stores ====
Chain stores did not become popular in the United States until the end of [[World War I]]. It was reported in 1929 that chain stores accounted for 39% of all grocery sales in the United States. Chain stores' success is related to their ability to undersell smaller distributors. An anti-chain movement arose in response to the success of the [[chain store]]s during the [[Great Depression]], but caused little detriment to the success and profitability of the chains.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Retail Cooperatives ====
Another response to the success of the chain stores was the development of [[Retailers' cooperative|retail cooperatives]]. These organizations were founded by groups of individual food distributors who saw the benefits of using chain-style pricing. [[Retailers' cooperative|Retail cooperatives]] accounted for 7% to 8% of the food market in 1930, and an increase in their popularity with independent food distributors rose retail cooperative's market share to 13% by 1958.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Supermarkets ====
The third and final change to US food distribution in the first half of the 20th century involved the establishment of supermarkets. The [[Ford Motor Company]] performed the first experiment regarding the [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of large-scale supermarkets after the end of World War I. Supermarkets officially began gaining prominence in the 1930s and steadily continued their growth into the post-WWII era.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Modern US Food Distribution ===
[[File:Food_and_Drug_Administration_logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the Food and Drug Administration]]
Modern food distribution in the United States is a result of continued growth since the 1960s. In an increasingly connected world, food distribution efforts in the US reach from coast to coast. A network of [[infrastructure]], warehouses, factories, and commercial retailers comprise the bulk of US food distribution. It is estimated that food served in the United States may travel close to 1,500 miles between growers and consumers. While many products, specifically meat and grain, are distributed in different fashions, there are common trends to the distribution of most modern foods. An increase in the use of technology for farming has transformed the small local farm of the 1940s in to large production facilities.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Several federal agencies, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture|US Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]], manage and sustain the productivity of the US food distribution system.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Food Distribution in Latin America ===
Food distribution in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts have been made to compete with the [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, [[Consumers' co-operative|consumer cooperatives]], voluntary chains, and retailer purchasing associations. Consumer purchasing organizations are groups of families who buy food together. The benefits of joining one of these organizations are the reduced [[cost]] and improved variety in diet that comes from purchasing food with other families. Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices. The cooperatives are analogous to a food [[Trade union|union]] that actively works to secure the rights of its consumers. Voluntary chains are organizations of privately owned retailers and [[food]] [[Wholesaling|wholesalers]] who operate as one economic body. These groups form contracts to work under, but are economically independent of one another. Retailer purchasing organizations are groups of retailers who purchase products as though they were a single buyer. Members within these organizations are all involved in the purchasing of goods, but do not form contracts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Risk factors affecting food distribution and examples of failed policy ==
Prominent risk factors that can affect the food distribution within a society include war, [[Economics|economic failure]], [[Politics|political instability]], and weather conditions. Each of these factors affects individual groups of people differently, but all share the common attribute of being detrimental to local food distribution and [[food systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two prominent examples of risk factors' negative effect on a society's food distribution system are the situation in Japan during World War II and Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japanese food distribution drastically decreased from the effects of World War Two and the country's economic shortcomings. The need for food during the 1920s and 1930s rose drastically as Japan's population and average lifestyle increased. Japan was importing large amounts of rice, sugar, soybeans, and wheat from its [[Colony|colonies]] by 1935, and had a dependence on colonial possessions to distribute food to her people. 95% of Japanese rice between 1936 and 1938, just a few years before major conflict arose with the United States, was imported from its colonies in [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. Only 2% of Japan's rice came from foreign countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As war engulfed Japan after 1941, food distribution efforts began to suffer. Japan lost a tremendous amount of [[cargo ship]]s and was surrounded by an effective US [[blockade]] for most of the war. [[Import]]s were down, which cut off Japan from its primary source of food. [[Rationing]] programs, ran by Japan's Central Foodstuff Corporation and Local Foodstuff Corporations, were an attempt to distribute food equally among the general population. Changes in tax collection and [[Price controls|price control]] were also created to feed [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], but these measures ultimately did not supply the Japanese people with enough food for survival. The average ration allowance consisted of a flour mixture which was often unhealthy and barely edible. Normal consumers age 16 to 60 received an average 330 g of ration per day in May 1943, and the situation only became more desperate as the war progressed. [[Rationing|Rationing programs]] were reduced even further in July 1945, just before the war's end.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
In [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Sharan Africa]], the food distribution crisis of the 1970s and 1980s was a result of a multitude of food distribution risk factors including [[Politics|political problems]], [[Economics|economic failures]], and [[Weather|weather conditions]]. The heart of the [[Politics|political problems]] and [[Economics|economic failures]] affecting food distribution included poor [[Agricultural policy|agricultural pricing]] and a lack of state involvement with rural development. Some of the [[Politics|political problems]] can be traced back to the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial period]]. Colonial policy supported the exportation of goods, even if it meant decreasing the amount of food for the local economy. Components of these colonial policies continued to be used after [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|African countries]] gained their freedom from European nations. The usage of these failed policies caused malignant consequences on the economic situation of the [[peasant]] class, including the exploitation of peasant agriculture and in removal of peasants from their land. The weather and environmental issues regarding the Sub-Saharan African food distribution crisis also have roots in failed colonial policy. Labor migration cycles used during colonial times were ecologically damaging to the local environment and failed to create new areas for growing crops. As a result, [[desertification]] and a loss of [[soil fertility]] hurt the local [[Agriculture|agricultural sector]], which then in turn negatively affected food distribution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Food Distribution Organizations ==

=== The FAO ===
[[File:FAO_logo.svg|thumb|136x136px|Logo of the Food and Agriculture Organization.]]

One of the largest organizations working to avoiding food distribution crises on the global stage in the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]). The FAO is a branch of the [[United Nations]], and actively works to improve food distribution in countries that need support&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Organizations within the United States ===

==== Federal and Large-Scale ====
Several different organizations exist to mitigate and respond to food distribution crises in the United States. Prominent contributors to large-scale food distribution effort in the US include the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), [[United States Department of Agriculture|United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)]], and [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]]. FEMA and the USDA work together during food distribution crises to coordinate the procurement and transportation of [[Food preservation|nonperishable food]], [[water]], and other [[resource]]s to afflicted areas. The Salvation Army often receives federal supplies from FEMA and the USDA, and then works on the local level to distribute necessary goods. All food given to civilians during a crisis is typically distributed at mass emergency feeding stations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Volunteer and Local ====
[[File:FEMA_-_35275_-_American_Red_Cross_booth_at_FEMA_Hurricane_Awareness_Day.jpg|thumb|An American Red Cross volunteer explains a program to people visiting their display during FEMA's Hurricane Awareness Day.]]

Groups like FEMA, the USDA, and the Salvation Army could not operate without help from individuals and small [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] groups. Prominent contributors to local food disaster efforts include groups like [[Emergency Communities]] and the American Rainbow Rapid Response (ARRR). These organizations typically focus on supplying [[Rural area|rural]] and lower income areas that do not receive priority from large food distribution groups during a crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== The American Red Cross ====
{{main article|American Red Cross}}

Another group that works out of the United States is the [[American Red Cross]].  The American Red Cross is part of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]], and 95% of all workers within the American Red Cross are volunteers. In the case of all crises, whether food related or not, the American Red Cross in engaged in relieving disaster victims. The Red Cross coordinates with local communities to provide essentials such as food, water, and hot meals for those in need during a crisis.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4599">'''Foreign official''' or '''foreign public official''' refers to a person who acts in an official capacity for a foreign government. The term is chiefly used in connection with international conventions and national laws against corruption in international trade.

==International law==
Members of the ''Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development'' ([[OECD]]) agreed the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] in 1999 and this treaty has been ratified by 39 countries.&lt;ref name="oecd_ratification"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/briberyininternationalbusiness/anti-briberyconvention/russia-oecdanti-briberyconvention.htm Russia - OECD Anti-Bribery Convention], OECD&lt;/ref&gt; The document&lt;ref name="oecd_convention"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/briberyininternationalbusiness/anti-briberyconvention/38028044.pdf CONVENTION ON COMBATING BRIBERY  OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS and Related Documents], OECD&lt;/ref&gt; defines a foreign public official as follows:



And expands the definition as such:

{{quote|text=''"Public function" includes any activity in the public interest, delegated by a foreign country, such as the performance of a task delegated by it in connection with public procurement.''}}

{{quote|text=''A "public agency" is an entity constituted under public law to carry out specific tasks in the public interest.''}}

{{quote|text=''A "public enterprise" is any enterprise, regardless of its legal form, over which a government, or governments, may, directly or indirectly, exercise a dominant influence. This is deemed to be the case, inter alia, when the government or governments hold the majority of the enterprise's subscribed capital, control the majority of votes attaching to shares issued by the enterprise or can appoint a majority of the members of the enterprise's administrative or managerial body or supervisory board.''}}

The definition of a foreign official defined in the OECD agreement is now referenced in enforcement actions by the United States Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcpablog.com/blog/2011/3/15/majority-report.html|title='Majority' Report - The FCPA Blog - The FCPA Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National jurisdictions==

===US Department of Justice definition===
According to the [[US Department of Justice]], the term "foreign official" is defined as:

{{quote|text=''any officer or employee of a foreign government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, or of a public international organization, or any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such government or department, agency, or instrumentality, or for or on behalf of any such public international organization.''|sign=&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/opinion/1997/9702.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The intent of the law is to stop the [[bribing]] of foreign officials so that the actual providing of funds to foreign governments directly would not constitute a violation.

The FCPA applies to US companies and foreign organisations or persons doing business within the borders of the [[United States]]. This definition also applies to issuers of publicly traded securities (companies traded on US stock exchanges and in other US markets).

==Risks of business with foreign officials==
The process of recognising if an entity is doing business with an individual who would be considered a foreign official is not only necessary from a compliance perspective, but also necessary when evaluating the risks in a company's business model. This process can be very simple or may be quite complex depending on how many relationships an entity has in place.  The process of identifying foreign officials is typically carried out by the comparisons of client or third-party lists with lists of foreign officials that contain the names and positions of such officials, as well as unique identifiers such as dates of birth, photos, and contact numbers.

The term foreign official should not be confused with the term "[[politically exposed person]]", as this term relates to the financial sector and its clients. The term "foreign official" relates to all industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcompliance.com/global-pep-list.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14270">The '''Froggatt Award''' is presented to people who have made a major contribution to protecting Australia’s native plants and animals, ecosystems, and people from dangerous new [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="abc151218"/&gt;

The Froggatt Awards are named in honour of Australian entomologist [[Walter Froggatt]], who, when the [[cane toad]] was released into Australia in the 1930s to control [[cane beetle|beetle]] infestations in the sugar cane industry, was a lone voice, lobbying the federal government to exercise caution.&lt;ref name="isc2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abcrnt050923"/&gt;

==History==
The Froggatt Awards were first presented in 2003, by the [[Invasive Species Council]].&lt;ref name="iscfh6"/&gt;

From 2003 to 2006 there was only one award per year.

No awards were issued from 2007 to 2014.

From 2015 there have been multiple awards presented, one each for various categories of activity determined each year.&lt;!--

The Froggatt Awards are again being bestowed annually.&lt;ref name="tg151217"/&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- It seems not despite the source - noting for 2016 for example--&gt;

The original trophy was a stuffed [[cane toad]],&lt;ref name="abcrnt050923"/&gt; but is now a framed certificate.

===Name===
In 2006 the award was temporarily renamed from the Froggatt Award to the Biosecure Australia Award,&lt;ref name="iscfh13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biosec" group="Note"&gt;Not to be confused with [http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/public-awareness/aba/aba-booklet Australian Biosecurity Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed back to the Froggatt Award in 2015 when the awards recommenced.

The Biosecure Australia Award was to be presented annually in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the eradication, early warning, preventative action, awareness raising or management of an invasive species in Australia.&lt;ref name="iscfh13"/&gt;

===Coverage===
The award received exceptionally extensive coverage within Australia, and also international coverage, when one was awarded to the Australian Federal [[Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources]], [[Barnaby Joyce]], in part for the Minister's action in regard to pet dogs incorrectly brought to Australia by [[Johnny Depp]] and his partner.&lt;ref&gt;A small sample of the Barnaby Joyce coverage:

[[Image:Ghetto (Venice) Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright 1.5|The main square of the [[Venetian Ghetto]]]]

A '''ghetto''' ({{IPA-it|ɡetˈto}}) is a part of a city in which members of a [[minority group]] live, typically as a result of social, legal, or economic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ghetto|title=Definition of GHETTO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have originally been used in [[Venice]] to describe [[Venetian Ghetto|the part of the city]] to which [[Jews]] were [[Residential segregation|restricted]] and [[Religious segregation|segregated]]. However, early societies may have formed their own versions of the same structure; words resembling "ghetto" appear in the Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, Germanic, Old French, and Latin languages. Ghettos in many cities have also been nicknamed "the hood", colloquial slang for [[neighborhood]].&lt;ref name="Kelefa"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kelefa | first = Sanneh | title = There Goes the Neighborhood | publisher = [[The New Yorker]] | date = July 18, 2016 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/is-gentrification-really-a-problem | accessdate = 2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of ghettos appear across the world, each with their own names, classifications, and groupings of people.

==Etymology==
The word "ghetto" comes from the Jewish area of Venice, the [[Venetian Ghetto]] in [[Cannaregio]], traced to a special use of Venetian ''getto'', or "foundry" (there was one near the site of that city's ghetto in 1516).&lt;ref&gt;see [[Riccardo Calimani|Calimani, Riccardo]] (1987) ''The Ghetto of Venice''. New York: M. Evans &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0871314843}} pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt; By 1899 the term had been extended to crowded urban quarters of other minority groups. 

The etymology of the word is uncertain, as there is no agreement among etymologists about the origins of the [[Venetian language]] term. Theories include that it comes from the above-mentioned Venetian ghèto (foundry); from [[Hebrew]] ''get'' ("bill of divorce", "deed of separation"), from the Yiddish ''gehektes'' (enclosed), from Latin ''Giudaicetum'', (Jewish), from the Italian ''borghetto'' (little town) "small section of a town" (diminutive of ''borgo'', which is of Germanic origin; see ''[[borough]]''), from the Old French ''guect'' (guard).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web    |last = Domonoske |first = Camila |title = Segregated From Its History, How 'Ghetto' Lost Its Meaning |publisher = NPR |date = April 27, 2014 |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/04/27/306829915/segregated-from-its-history-how-ghetto-lost-its-meaning |accessdate = 20 November 2017 |quote = The word "ghetto" is an etymological mystery. Is it from the Hebrew get, or bill of divorce? From the Venetian ghèto, or foundry? From the Yiddish gehektes, "enclosed"? From Latin Giudaicetum, for "Jewish"? From the Italian borghetto, "little town"? From the Old French guect, "guard"?...In his etymology column for the Oxford University Press, Anatoly Liberman took a look at each of these possibilities. He considered ever more improbable origins — Latin for "ribbon"? German for "street"? Latin for "to throw"? — before declaring the word a stubborn mystery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is a form of ''Egitto'' ("[[Egypt]]"), from Latin ''Aegyptus'', possibly in memory of exile.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/ghetto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

===Sydney===
Among the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, are various suburbs inhabited by various ethnic groups on a large scale, examples include: [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] with [[Arab Australians|Arabs]], [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] with [[Italian Australians|Italians]], [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]] with [[Greek Australians|Greeks]] and [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] with [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]]. Most of these suburbs, such as Leichhardt, have received their Italian identity as a result of it being a popular immigration hotspot, others such as Redfern, have received their Indigenous identity via designated housing during a period of [[White Australia policy|discrimination]] which drew in a large population of the designated ethnic group, most of them being impoverished.

In [[Northern Ireland]], towns and cities have long been [[Segregation in Northern Ireland|segregated along ethnic, religious and political lines]]. Northern Ireland's two main communities are its [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]]-[[Irish republicanism|republican]] community (who mainly self-identify as [[Irish people|Irish]] or [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) and its [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]-[[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] community (who mainly self-identify as [[British people|British]] or [[Protestant]]). Ghettos emerged in [[Belfast]] during the [[riot]]s that accompanied the [[Irish War of Independence]]. For safety, people fled to areas where their community was the majority.

Many more ghettos emerged after the [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|1969 riots]] and beginning of the "[[The Troubles|Troubles]]". In August 1969 the [[British Army]] was deployed to restore order and separate the two sides. The government built barriers called "[[peace lines]]". Many of the ghettos came under the control of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] such as the (republican) [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the (loyalist) [[Ulster Defence Association]]. One of the most notable ghettos was [[Free Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumoffreederry.org/history-battle01.html |title=History Battle of the Bogside |last= |first= |date=2015-07-31 |website=The Museum of Free Derry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731031114/http://www.museumoffreederry.org/history-battle01.html |archive-date=2015-07-31 |dead-url=bot: unknown |access-date=2017-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In [[France]], a ''banlieue'' ({{IPA-fr|bɑ̃ljø|lang}}) is a [[suburb]] of a large [[city]]. Banlieues are divided into autonomous administrative entities and do not constitute part of the [[city proper]]. For instance, 80% of the inhabitants of the [[Paris Metropolitan Area|Paris area]] live outside the city of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parisbynumbers.com/2008/04/28/paris-suburbs-les-banlieues/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203928/http://parisbynumbers.com/2008/04/28/paris-suburbs-les-banlieues/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the city centre, suburbs may be rich, middle-class or poor—[[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]], [[Le Vésinet]], [[Maisons-Laffitte]] and [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] are affluent banlieues of [[Paris]], while [[Clichy-sous-Bois]], [[Bondy]] and [[Corbeil-Essonnes]] are less so. However, since the 1970s, ''banlieues'' increasingly means, in [[French of France]], low-income housing projects ([[HLM]]s) in which mainly [[Immigration to France|foreign immigrants]] and French of foreign descent reside, often in perceived [[poverty trap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lepoutre, David.

[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Fay-BADAFAMNDN-Heft 21-Nr 245-1904-Die Judengasse Suedseite.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the Jewish ghetto, Frankfurt, 1868]]
A Jewish quarter is the area of a city traditionally inhabited by [[Jews]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]. Jewish quarters, like the Jewish ghettos in Europe, were often the outgrowths of [[Geographical segregation|segregated]] ghettos instituted by the surrounding authorities. A [[Yiddish]] term for a Jewish quarter or neighborhood is ''Di yiddishe gas'' ({{lang-yi|די ייִדדישע גאַס }} ), or "The Jewish street". Many [[Europe]]an and [[Middle East]]ern cities once had a historical Jewish quarter.

Jewish ghettos in Europe existed because Jews were viewed as alien. As a result, Jews were placed under strict regulations throughout many European cities.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;[http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/ghetto.htm GHETTO] Kim Pearson {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224090832/http://kpearson.faculty.tcnj.edu/Dictionary/ghetto.htm |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of ghettos has varied through times.

In some cases, the ghetto was a Jewish quarter with a relatively affluent population (for instance the [[Venetian Ghetto|Jewish ghetto in Venice]]). In other cases, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos (as [[Roman Ghetto|that of Rome]]), had narrow streets and tall, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system.

==== Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe ====
{{Main article|Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|Warsaw Ghetto Uprising}}
[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising BW.jpg|thumb|link=A Jewish boy surrenders in Warsaw |Liquidation of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], 1943]]
During [[World War II]], ghettos were established by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] to confine Jews and [[Romani people]] into tightly packed areas of the cities of [[Eastern Europe]]. The Nazis most often referred to these areas in documents and signage at their entrances as "Jewish quarter". These Nazi ghettos sometimes coincided with traditional Jewish ghettos and Jewish quarters, but not always. On June 21, 1943, [[Heinrich Himmler]] issued a decree ordering the dissolution of all ghettos in the East and their transformation into [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ghetto in Flames'' Yitzhak Arad, pp. 436–437&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
{{Main article|Mellah}}
A ''[[mellah]]'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] ملاح, probably from the word ملح, Arabic for "salt") is a walled Jewish quarter of a city in [[Morocco]], an analogue of the European ghetto. Jewish populations were confined to ''mellahs'' in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a [[fortified gateway]]. Usually, the Jewish quarter was situated near the royal palace or the residence of the governor in order to protect its inhabitants from recurring riots. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.

=== Israel ===
According to Jewish writer Robert Gessner, who travelled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s, [[Tel Aviv]] had a ghetto for poorer Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Gessner, ''[http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1930s_antisemitism_pdf Some of my best friends are Jews]'' (New York, 1936), p. 81; Matthias Hambrock&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shanghai ghetto ===
The [[Shanghai Ghetto]] was an area of approximately one square mile in the [[Hongkou District]] of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese-occupied]] [[Shanghai]] to which about 20,000 [[Jewish refugees]] were relocated by the Japanese-issued ''Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees'' after having fled from [[German-occupied Europe]] before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm Shanghai Jewish History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813151839/http://www.chinajewish.org/JewishHistory.htm |date=2006-08-13 }} (Shanghai Jewish Center)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people refer to the [[Gaza Strip]] as a ghetto, which is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/crisisingaza/2009/02/20092191518941246.html|title=Gaza is no Warsaw Ghetto|first=Mark|last=LeVine|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.719953|title=It's Been a Decade.

The development of ghettos in the United States is closely associated with different [[History of immigration to the United States|waves of immigration]] and internal urban migration. The [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and [[German Americans|German]] immigrants of the mid-19th century were the first ethnic groups to form [[ethnic enclave]]s in United States cities. This was followed by large numbers of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including many [[Italian Americans|Italians]] and [[Polish Americans|Poles]] between 1880 and 1920. These later European immigrants were more segregated than blacks in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;''[http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/nerr/rr1997/spring/glsr97_2.htm Ghettos: The Changing Consequences of Ethnic Isolation]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these remained in their established immigrant communities, but by the second or third generation, many families were able to relocate to better housing in the [[suburb]]s after [[World War II]].

These ethnic ghetto areas included the [[Lower East Side#Culture|Lower East Side]] in [[Manhattan, New York]], which later became notable as predominantly [[Jewish]], and [[East Harlem#History|East Harlem]], which became home to a large [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] community in the 1950s. [[Little Italy]]s across the country were predominantly Italian ghettos. Many Polish immigrants moved to sections like [[Lower West Side, Chicago|Pilsen]] of Chicago and [[Polish Hill (Pittsburgh)|Polish Hill]] of [[Pittsburgh]]. [[Brighton Beach]] in [[Brooklyn]] is the home of mostly Russian and Ukrainian immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

During the Great Depression, many people would congregate in large open parking lots. They built shelters out of whatever materials they could find at the time. These congregations of shelters were also called "ghettos".{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===African-American or Black ghettos===
{{see also|Racial segregation in the United States}}
A commonly used definition of a ghetto is a community distinguished by a homogeneous [[Race (human categorization)|race]] or [[ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Additionally, a key feature that developed throughout the [[postindustrial]] era and continues to symbolize the demographics of American ghettos is the prevalence of poverty. [[Poverty]] constitutes the separation of ghettos from other, suburbanized or private neighborhoods. The high percentage of poverty partly justifies the difficulty of [[out-migration]], which tends to reproduce constraining social opportunities and inequalities in society.&lt;ref name="Darity, William A. 2008"&gt;Darity, William A., Jr., ed. "Ghetto." ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences 3.2'' (2008): 311–14. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. October 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chicago ghetto.jpg|thumb|Chicago ghetto on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], May 1974]]
Urban areas in the U.S. can often be classified as "black" or "white", with the inhabitants primarily belonging to a homogenous racial grouping.&lt;ref name="SethiSomanathan2004"/&gt; Forty years after the [[Civil Rights Movement]], most of the United States remains a [[residential segregation in the United States|residentially segregated]] society in which blacks and whites inhabit different neighborhoods of significantly different quality.&lt;ref name="SethiSomanathan2004"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inequality and Segregation |first=Rajiv |last=Sethi |first2=Rohini |last2=Somanathan |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=112 |year=2004 |issue=6 |pages=1296–1321 |doi=10.1086/424742 |citeseerx=10.1.1.19.6596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Douglas Massey |last=Massey |first=Douglas S. |title=Segregation and Stratification: A Biosocial Perspective |journal=[[Du Bois Review]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=7–25 |doi=10.1017/S1742058X04040032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these neighborhoods are located in Northern cities where African-Americans moved during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (1914–1950), a period when over a million&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/aaworld/reference/articles/great_migration.html|title=Retired Site – PBS Programs – PBS|website=Retired Site – PBS Programs – PBS|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African Americans|African-Americans]] moved out of the rural [[Southern United States]] to escape the widespread racism of the South, to seek out employment opportunities in urban environments, and to pursue what was widely perceived to be a better quality of life in the North.&lt;ref name="pbs" /&gt;

Two main factors ensured further separation between races and classes, and ultimately the development of contemporary ghettos: the relocation of industrial enterprises, and the movement of middle to upper class residents into suburban neighborhoods. Between 1967 and 1987, economic restructuring resulted in a dramatic decline of manufacturing jobs. The once thriving northern industrial cities directed a shift to service occupations and in combination with the movement of middle-class families and other businesses to the [[suburb]]s, left much economic devastation in the inner cities. Consequently, African-Americans were disproportionately affected and became either unemployed or underemployed with little wage and reduced benefits. Accordingly, a concentration of African-Americans was established in the [[inner city]] neighbourhoods of places such as [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]] and [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Darity, William A. 2008"/&gt;

It is also significant to compare the demographic patterns between blacks and European immigrants, according to the [[labor market]]. European immigrants and African-Americans were both subject to an ethnic division of labor, and consequently African-Americans have predominated in the least secure division of the labor market. David Ward refers to this stagnant position in African-American or Black ghettos as the 'elevator' model, which implies that each group of immigrants or migrants takes turns in the processes of social mobility and suburbanization; and several groups did not start on the ground floor. The inability of blacks to move from the ground floor, as Ward suggests, is dependent upon [[racism|prejudice]] and [[racial segregation|segregationist]] patterns experienced in the South prior to World War I. After the [[wikt:exodus|exodus]] of African-Americans to the North, the range of occupations in the North was further altered by the settlement of European immigrants; thus, African-Americans were diminished to unskilled jobs. The slow rate of advancement in black communities outlines the rigidity of the labor market, competition and conflict, adding another dimension to the prevalence of poverty and social instability in African-American or Black ghettos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ward |first= David |title=The Ethnic Ghetto in the United States: Past and Present |journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |series=ns |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1982 |pages=257–75 |jstor=621990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== World War II's Effect on the Development of Ghettos ====

In the years following [[World War II]], many [[white American]]s began to move away from inner cities to newer suburban communities, a process known as [[white flight]]. White flight occurred, in part, as a response to black people moving into white urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Keating"&gt;{{cite book |last=Keating |first=William Dennis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0bnHQAACAAJ |title=The Suburban Racial Dilemma: Housing and Neighborhoods |publisher=Temple University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-56639-147-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=William H. |title=Central City White Flight: Racial and Nonracial Causes |journal=[[American Sociological Review]] |volume=44 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=425–448 |jstor=2094885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discriminatory practices, especially those intended to "preserve" emerging white suburbs, restricted the ability of blacks to move from inner cities to the suburbs, even when they were economically able to afford it. In contrast to this, the same period in history marked a massive suburban expansion available primarily to whites of both wealthy and working-class backgrounds, facilitated through highway construction and the availability of federally subsidized home mortgages ([[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|FHA]], [[HOLC]]). These made it easier for families to buy new homes in the suburbs, but not to rent apartments in cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html "Racial" Provisions of FHA Underwriting Manual] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229152840/http://www.public.asu.edu/~wplotkin/DeedsWeb/fha38.html |date=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States began restructuring its economy after World War II, fueled by new [[globalizing]] processes, and demonstrated through technological advances and improvements in efficiency. The structural shift of 1973, during the postfordist era, became a large component to the racial ghetto and its relationship with the labor market. [[Sharon Zukin]] declares the designated stratum of African-Americans in the labor force was placed even below the working class; low-skill urban jobs were now given to incoming immigrants from [[Mexico]] or the [[Caribbean]]. Additionally, Zukin notes, "Not only have social services been drastically reduced, punitive and other social controls over the poor have been increased," such as law enforcement and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Zukin 514&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zukin, Sharon 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zukin |first=Sharon |title=How 'Bad' Is It?: Institutions and Intentions in the Study of the American Ghetto |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |volume=22 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=511–20 |doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as the "urban crisis" during the 1970s and 1980s, the transition stressed regional divisions according to differences in income and racial lines&amp;nbsp;– white "donuts" around black holes.&lt;ref name="Fischer, Claude S. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=Claude S. |first2=Gretchen |last2=Stockmayer |first3=Jon |last3=Stiles |first4=Michael |last4=Hout |title=Distinguishing the Geographical Levels and Social Dimensions of U.S. Metropolitan Segregation, 1960–2000 |journal=Demography |volume=41 |issue=7 |year=2004 |pages=37–59 |doi=10.1353/dem.2004.0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardly coincidental, the steady separation occurred during the period of civil rights laws, urban riots and [[Black Power]]. In addition, the ''International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences'' stresses the various challenges developed by this "urban crisis", including:
{{quote|poorly underserviced infrastructures, inadequate housing to accommodate a growing urban populace, group conflict and competition over limited jobs and space, the inability for many residents to compete for new technology-based jobs, and tensions between the public and private sectors left to the formation and growth of U.S. ghettos.&lt;ref name="Darity, William A. 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darity 313&lt;/ref&gt;}} The cumulative economic and social forces in ghettos give way to social, political and economic isolation and inequality, while indirectly defining a separation between superior and inferior status of groups.

In response to the influx of black people from the South, banks, insurance companies, and businesses began denying or increasing the cost of services, such as [[bank]]ing, [[insurance]], access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130210614/http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |date=November 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarket]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition |first=Elizabeth |last=Eisenhauer |journal=[[GeoJournal]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=125–133 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1015772503007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;Thabit, Walter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC ''How East New York Became a Ghetto'']. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. The most devastating form of [[redlining]], and the most common use of the term, refers to [[mortgage discrimination]]. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by non-blacks to exclude blacks from outside neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cutler |first=David M. |authorlink=David Cutler |first2=Edward L. |last2=Glaeser |authorlink2=Edward Glaeser |first3=Jacob L. |last3=Vigdor |title=The Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=107 |issue=3 |year=1999 |pages=455–506 |doi=10.1086/250069 |citeseerx=10.1.1.587.8018 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:2770033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Racial" Provisions of the FHA Underwriting Manual of 1936 included the following guidelines which exacerbated the segregation issue:
{{quote|Recommended restrictions should include provision for: prohibition of the occupancy of properties except by the race for which they are intended ... Schools should be appropriate to the needs of the new community and they should not be attended in large numbers by inharmonious racial groups.&lt;ref name="Keating" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Housing Administration]], ''Underwriting Manual: Underwriting and Valuation Procedure Under Title II of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] with Revisions to February, 1938'' (Washington, D.C.), Part II, Section 9, Rating of Location.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This meant that [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] could secure [[mortgage loan]]s only in certain areas, and it resulted in a large increase in the residential [[racial segregation]] and [[urban decay]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite crabgrass}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of new highways in some cases divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, [[Birmingham, Alabama]]'s interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial boundaries that had been established by the city's 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated with an increase in neighborhood racial segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Connerly |first=Charles E. |title=From Racial Zoning to Community Empowerment: The Interstate Highway System and the African American Community in Birmingham, Alabama |journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=99–114 |year=2002 |doi=10.1177/0739456X02238441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential segregation was further perpetuated because whites were willing to pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Some social scientists suggest that the historical processes of [[suburbanization]] and decentralization are instances of [[white privilege]] that have contributed to contemporary patterns of [[environmental racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pulido |first=Laura |title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=90 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=12–40 |doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182 |hdl=10214/1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the emergence of anti-discrimination policies in housing and labor sparked by the [[civil rights movement]], members of the [[black middle class]] moved out of the ghetto. The [[Fair Housing Act]] was passed in 1968. This was the first federal law that outlawed discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion and later sex, familial status, and disability. The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] was charged with administering and enforcing the law. Since housing discrimination became illegal, new housing opportunities were made available to the black community and many left the ghetto. Urban sociologists frequently title this historical event as "black middle class exodus" (also see [[black flight]]). [[Elijah Anderson]] describes a process by which members of the black middle class begin to distance themselves socially and culturally from ghetto residents during the later half of the twentieth century, "eventually expressing this distance by literally moving away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Anderson| first=Elijah| title=Streetwise: Race, Class, and Change in an Urban Community| year=1990| publisher=The University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-226-01816-4| pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the exodus of black working-class families.&lt;ref name=Disadvantaged&gt;{{cite book| last=Wilson| first=William Julius| title=The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy| year=1987| publisher=The University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-226-90131-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}} As a result, the ghetto becomes primarily occupied by what sociologists and journalists of the 1980s and 1990s frequently title the "[[underclass]]." [[William Julius Wilson]] suggests this exodus worsens the isolation of the black underclass&amp;nbsp;– not only are they socially and physically distanced from whites, they are also isolated from the black middle class.&lt;ref name=Disadvantaged/&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

==== Race-Based vs. Class-Based Theories on the Development of U.S. Ghettos ====
Two dominant theories arise pertaining to the production and development of U.S. ghettos. First are the race-based theorists who argue the importance of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] in ghettos. Their analysis consists of the dominant racial group in the U.S. ([[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s) and their use of certain racist tactics in order to maintain their [[hegemony]] over blacks and lengthen their spatial separation. Race-based theorists offset other arguments that focus on the influence of the [[economy]] on segregation. More contemporary research of race-based theorists is to frame a range of methods conducted by white Americans to "preserve race-based residential inequities" as a function of the dominantly white, state-run government. Involving uneven development, mortgage and business discrimination and disinvestment&amp;nbsp;– U.S. ghettos then, as suggested by race-based theorists, are conserved by distinctly racial reasoning. The more dominant view, on the other hand, is represented by [[social class|class-based]] theorists. Such theories confirm class to be more important than race in the structuring of U.S. ghettos. Although racial concentration is a key signifier for ghettos, class-based theorists emphasize the role and impact of broader societal structures in the creation of African-American or Black ghettos. Dynamics of low-wage service and unemployment triggered from [[deindustrialization]], and the [[intergenerational]] diffusion of status within families and neighborhoods, for instance, prove the rise in socioeconomic polarization between classes to be the creator of American ghetto; not [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelton, Jason E. "Ghetto." ''Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society''. 2008. SAGE Knowledge. Web. 25 Oct. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[culture of poverty]] theory, first developed by [[Oscar Lewis]], states that a prolonged history of poverty can itself become a cultural obstacle to socioeconomic success, and in turn can continue a pattern of socioeconomic polarization. Ghettos, in short, instill a cultural adaptation to social and class-based inequalities, reducing the ability of future generations to mobilize or [[Human migration|migrate]].&lt;ref name="Fischer, Claude S. 2000" /&gt;

An alternative theory put forward by [[Thomas Sowell]] in ''[[Black Rednecks and White Liberals]]'' asserts that modern urban black ghetto culture is rooted in the white [[Cracker (pejorative)|Cracker]] culture of the [[North Briton]]s and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] who migrated from the generally lawless [[Border country|border]] regions of Britain to the American South, where they formed a [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] culture common to both blacks and whites in the [[antebellum South]].  Characteristics of this culture included lively music and dance, violence, unbridled emotions, flamboyant imagery, illegitimacy, religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, and a lack of emphasis on education and intellectual interests.&lt;ref name="Sowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sowell | first = Thomas | date = May 16, 2015 | title = Black Rednecks and White Liberals | url = http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2005/05/black-rednecks-and-white-liberals/ | journal = Capitalism Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because redneck culture proved counterproductive, "that culture long ago died out...among both white and black Southerners, while still surviving today in the poorest and worst of the urban black ghettos",&lt;ref name="Nordlinger"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nordlinger | first = Jay | date = September 9, 2005 | title = "Black Rednecks and White Liberals", by Thomas Sowell | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215370/chewing-nails-jay-nordlinger | journal = National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Sowell described as being characterized by "brawling, braggadocio, self-indulgence, [and] disregard of the future",&lt;ref name="Nordlinger"/&gt; and where "belligerence is considered being manly and crudity is considered cool, while being civilized is regarded as 'acting white'."&lt;ref name="Sowell"/&gt; Sowell blames liberal Americans who since the 1960s have embraced black ghetto culture as the only "'authentic' black culture and even glamorize it" while they "denounce any criticism of the ghetto lifestyle or any attempt to change it".&lt;ref name="Sowell"/&gt; Sowell asserts that white liberal Americans have perpetuated this "counterproductive and self-destructive lifestyle" among black Americans living in urban ghettos through "the welfare state, and look-the-other-way policing, and smiling at 'gangsta rap'."&lt;ref name="Nordlinger"/&gt;

==== Characterizations of "Ghetto" in the United States ====
Contemporary African-American or Black ghettos are characterized by an overrepresentation of a particular ethnicity or race, vulnerability to crime, social problems, governmental reliance and political disempowerment. Sharon Zukin explains that through these reasons, society rationalizes the term "bad neighborhoods". Zukin stresses that these circumstances are largely related to "racial concentration, residential abandonment, and deconstitution and reconstitution of communal institutions."&lt;ref name="Zukin, Sharon 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zukin 516&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars diagnose this poorly facilitated and fragmented view of the United States as the "age of extremes". This term argues that inequalities of wealth and power reinforce spatial separation; for example, the growth of [[gated communities]] can be interconnected with the continued "ghettoization" of the poor.&lt;ref name="Fischer, Claude S. 2000" /&gt;

Another characteristic to African-American or Black ghettos and spatial separation is the dependence on the state, and lack of communal [[autonomy]]; Sharon Zukin refers to [[Brownsville, Brooklyn]], as an example. This relationship between racial ghettos and the state is demonstrated through various push and pull features, implemented through government subsidized investments, which certainly assisted the movement of white Americans into the suburbs after World War II. Since the 1960s, after the deconstitution of the inner cities, African-American or Black ghettos have attempted to reorganize or reconstitute; in effect, they are increasingly regarded as public- and state-dependent communities. Brownsville, for instance, initiated the constitution of community-established public housing, anti-poverty organizations, and social service facilities&amp;nbsp;– all, in their own way, depend on state resources. However, certain dependence contradicts society's desires to be autonomous actors in the market. Moreover, Zukin implies, "the less 'autonomous' the community&amp;nbsp;– in its dependence on public schools, public housing and various subsidy programs&amp;nbsp;– the greater the inequity between their organizations and the state, and the less willing residents are to organize."&lt;ref name="Zukin, Sharon 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zukin 517&lt;/ref&gt; This should not, on the other hand, undermine local development corporations or social service agencies helping these neighborhoods. The lack of autonomy and growing dependence on the state, especially in a [[neoliberal]] economy, remains a key indicator to the production as well as the prevalence of African-American or Black ghettos, particularly due to the lack of opportunities to compete in the global market.&lt;ref name="Zukin, Sharon 2002" /&gt;

Despite mainstream America's use of the term "ghetto" to signify a poor, culturally or racially homogenous urban area, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The black ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African-Americans, the ghetto was "home": a place representing authentic [[African-American culture|blackness]] and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from rising above the struggle and suffering of being black in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smitherman |first=Geneva |title=Black Talk: Words and Phrases from the Hood to the Amen Corner |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-395-96919-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Langston Hughes]] relays in the "Negro Ghetto" (1931) and "The Heart of Harlem" (1945): "The buildings in [[Harlem]] are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem's much more than these alone,/Harlem is what's inside." Playwright [[August Wilson]] used the term "ghetto" in ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'' (1984) and ''Fences'' (1987), both of which draw upon the author's experience growing up in the [[Hill District]] of Pittsburgh, a black ghetto.&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt;

The concept of 'the ghetto' and 'underclass' has faced criticism both theoretically and empirically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Symposium on the ''Ghetto'' |year=2008 |journal=City &amp; Community |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=305–407 |doi=10.1111/cico.2008.7.issue-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Small |first=Mario L. |last2=McDermott |first2=Monica |year=2006 |title=The Presence of Organizational Resources in Poor Urban Neighborhoods: An Analysis of Average and Contextual Effects |journal=Social Forces |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=1697–1724 |doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Historical Era of Food Deserts|first=Jarrett|last=Thibodeaux |year=2015|journal=Social Currents|volume=3|issue=2|pages=186–203|doi=10.1177/2329496515604639}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income or racial minority populations. The cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Logan |first=John |first2=Harvey |last2=Molotch |year=1987 |title=Urban Fortunes : The Political Economy of Place |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06341-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thibodeaux |first=Jarrett |year=2016 |title=City racial composition as a predictor of African American food deserts |journal=Urban Studies |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=2238–2252 |doi=10.1177/0042098015587848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To a large extent the problem with the 'ghetto' and 'underclass' concepts stem from the reliance on case studies (in particular case studies from Chicago), which limit social scientist understandings of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.

==== Modern Usage and Reinterpretations of "Ghetto" ====
Recently the word "ghetto" has been used in [[slang]] as an [[adjective]] rather than a noun. It is used to indicate an object's relation to the inner city or black culture, and also more broadly to denote something that is shabby or of low quality. While "ghetto" as an adjective can be used derogatorily, the African-American or Black community, particularly the [[hip hop]] scene, has taken the word for themselves and begun using it in a more positive sense that transcends its derogatory origins.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1973, ''Geographical Review'' claimed "The degree of residential segregation of the black community is greater than for any other group in urban America, yet the blacks have not had the political power necessary to exercise any significant degree of control over the improvement of the basic services necessary for their health, education, and welfare."&lt;ref name="Geographical Review 107"&gt;''Geographical Review'' 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Geographical Record |journal=Geographical Review |volume=63 |issue=1 |year=1973 |pages= 106–17 |jstor=213241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have been interested in the study of African-American or Black ghettos precisely for the concentration of disadvantaged residents and their vulnerability to social problems. American ghettos also bring attention to geographical and political barriers, and as [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]] highlights, that racial segregation in African-American or Black ghettos challenge America's democratic foundations.&lt;ref name="Fischer, Claude S. 2000" /&gt; However, it is still advocated that "One solution to these problems depends on our ability to use the political process in eliminating the inequities... geographical knowledge and theory to public-policy decisions about poor people and poor regions is a professional obligation."&lt;ref name="Geographical Review 107" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt;

===Gay ghetto===
A [[gay village]] (also known as a gay neighbourhood or 'gayborhood', gay enclave, gay village, gaytto, "Boystown") is a geographical area with generally recognized boundaries, inhabited or frequented by a large number of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people. Unlike other ghettos, gay villages can be created by the LGBT community as an act of self-protection or even [[gentrification]]. Gay villages often contain a number of gay-oriented establishments, such as [[gay bars]] and pubs, [[gay nightclub|nightclubs]], [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouse]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[boutique]]s and [[bookstore]]s.&lt;ref name="Kelefa"/&gt;

'''Global Wind Day''' is a [[international observance|worldwide event]] that occurs annually on [[15 June]].  It is organised by EWEA ([[European Wind Energy Association]]) and GWEC ([[Global Wind Energy Council]]).
&lt;ref&gt;[http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1102949362881&amp;ca=e882c25a-f468-49fe-b235-801f5a25f67a GWEC Media Release: The local impact of wind energy in the spotlight on Global Wind Day]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a day when [[wind power|wind energy]] is celebrated, information is exchanged and adults and children find out about wind energy, its power and the possibilities it holds to change the world. 
In association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==2007==
The inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people.

==2008==
Wind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people.

==2009==
This was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people.

In 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June–July 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment.

==2010==
In this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7&amp;nbsp;ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the [[European Commission]] and [[European Council]]. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/topics/m/video/56693102/global-wind-day-2010.htm|title=Global Wind Day 2010|date=2010-06-15|publisher=renewableenergyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Global Wind Day Wind Parade.jpg|thumb|Global Wind Day Wind Parade, Brussels 2011]] --&gt;

In [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in [[Place de Luxembourg]] educated people working in the [[European Union|EU]] area on the benefits and importance of wind energy.

Global Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include:
In [[France]] there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. 
In [[Austria]], journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. 
In [[Japan]] there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. 
In [[Australia]], an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. 
In [[Mexico]], a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history.

==2012==

Global Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from
photo exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in
[[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]] and [[South Africa]].
Global Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors,who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‘We need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‘Global Wind Day’ on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG’s Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalwindday.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GWD_report_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The ‘Wind in Mind’ photo competition saw 2,300 photos from over 40 countries submitted.

==2018==
For 2018, WindEurope and GWEC launched a global photo competition to capture the power of wind in the run up to Global Wind Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/photo-competition/ Global Wind Day Photo Competition “Wind Vision” 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://globalwindday.org/wind-vision-photo-competition-winners/ Wind Vision Photo Competition Winners (in all 3 categories)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CommodeStoolcirca1650.jpg|thumb|upright|A Close-Stool c.1650. Hampton Court collection]]
The '''Groom of the Stool''' (formally styled: "Groom of the King's [[Close stool|Close Stool]]") was the most intimate of an [[List of English monarchs|English monarch]]'s [[Courtier|courtiers]], responsible for assisting the king in [[excretion]] and [[Hygiene|ablution]].

The physical intimacy of the role naturally led to him becoming a man in whom much confidence was placed by his royal master and with whom many royal secrets were shared as a matter of course. This secret information—while it would never have been revealed, to the discredit of his honour—in turn led to him becoming feared and respected and therefore powerful within the royal court in his own right. The office developed gradually over decades and centuries into one of administration of the royal finances, and under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the Groom of the Stool became a powerful official involved in setting national fiscal policy, under the "chamber system".&lt;ref&gt;For the role of the Groom of the Stool on the fiscal policy of Henry VII see: Starkey, D. ''The Virtuous Prince'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Re. the "Chamber System" and "Chamber Finance" see: Grummitt, D. "Henry VII, Chamber Finance and the 'New Monarchy': some New Evidence". ''Journal of the Institute of Historical Research'', vol.72, no.179, pp.229-243. Published online 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The Groom of the Stool was, in the earliest times, a male servant in the household of an English monarch who was responsible for assisting the king in excretion and ablution, whilst maintaining an aura of royal decorum over the proceedings. The appellation "Groom of the Close Stool" derived from the [[close stool|item of furniture used as a toilet]]. It also appears as "Grom of the Stole" as the word "Groom" comes from the [[Old Low Franconian]] word "Grom".&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, E. Cobham. "Grom of the Stole" ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable''. Philadelphia: Henry Altemus, 1898; Page 369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of the English Language''. By Noah Webster, Chauncey Allen Goodrich, John Walker. Page 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Tudor era===
By the [[Tudor period|Tudor age]], the Groom of the Stool was a substantial figure like [[Hugh Denys of Osterley|Hugh Denys]] (d.1511) who was a member of the Gloucestershire gentry, married to an aristocratic wife, and who died possessing at least four manors. The function was transformed into that of a virtual minister of the royal treasury, being then an essential figure in the king's management of fiscal policy.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, David. The Virtuous Prince, 2004, chap. 16 discusses the important fiscal role of Hugh Denys, Groom of the Stool to Henry VII; &amp; an article in the ''Independent'' newspaper (28/6/2004) by the same author, who states that the position effectively became neutralised on the accession of Elizabeth I&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Boehrer.

In the early years of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s reign, the title was awarded to court companions of the king who spent time with him in the [[privy chamber]]. These were generally the sons of noblemen or important members of the gentry. In time they came to act as virtual personal secretaries to the king, carrying out a variety of administrative tasks within his private rooms. The position was an especially prized one, as it allowed unobstructed access to the king.&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;{{cite book | last = Weir | first = Alison |title = Henry VIII: The King and His Court | publisher = Random House | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JW-seRfZ9toC&amp;pg=PA42 |isbn = 978-0-345-43708-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|42}} [[David Starkey]] writes: "The Groom of the Stool had (to our eyes) the most menial tasks; his standing, though, was the highest&amp;nbsp;...

===Evolution and discontinuation===
The office was exclusively one serving male monarchs, so on the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1558, it was replaced by the [[First Lady of the Bedchamber]], first held by [[Kat Ashley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brimacombe | first = Peter | title = All the Queen's Men: The World of Elizabeth I | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2000 | location = | page = 25 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sB3MM0b4zo8C&amp;pg=PA25 | isbn = 978-0-312-23251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office effectively came to an end when it was "neutralised" in 1559.&lt;ref name="Nicholls" /&gt; On the accession of [[James VI and I|James I]], the male office was revived as the senior [[Lord of the Bedchamber]], who always was a great nobleman who had considerable power because of its intimate access to the king. During the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the term "stool" appears to have lost its original signification of ''chair''. 

The office fell into disuse with the accession of [[Queen Victoria]], though her husband, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]], and their son, [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] employed similar courtiers{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, now renamed "Groom of the Stole", from the Latin ''stola'', a long outer garment or robe worn by Roman ladies.&lt;ref&gt;''Cassell's Latin Dictionary'', rev. by Marchant, J. &amp; Charles, J.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tudor historian David Starkey classes this change as classic [[Victorian morality|Victorianism]]: "When the Victorians came to look at this office, they spelt it s-t-o-l-e, and imagined all kinds of fictions about elaborate robes draped around the neck of the monarch at the coronation."&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, D. "Monarchy in all its Magnificence", ''Daily Telegraph'' 21/12/2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3633793/Majesty-in-all-its-magnificence.html]&lt;/ref&gt; When Edward acceded to the throne as Edward VII in 1901, he discontinued the office.

===Royal ablution today===
Often when the visit of a modern monarch is planned, for example during the construction of a new building, a special royal lavatory pavilion is built for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Boehrer, "The Privy and Its Double: Scatology and Satire in Shakespeare's Theatre," in Dutton, R. &amp; Howard, J.

[[Belarus]] is a source, destination, and transit country for women, men, and children subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically [[forced prostitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sipb.pl.tl/%26%231041%3B%26%231083%3B%26%231091%3B%26%231076%3B-%26%231087%3B%26%231103%3B%26%231085%3B%26%231077%3B%26%231078%3B%26%231085%3B%26%231099%3B--k1-%26%231087%3B%26%231088%3B%26%231072%3B%26%231089%3B%26%231090%3B%26%231099%3B%26%231090%3B%26%231091%3B%26%231094%3B%26%231099%3B%26%231103%3B-k2-.htm Блуд за грошы (пянезі) існуе на Беларусі даўно.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[forced labor]]. The majority of identified Belarusian victims were females forced into [[prostitution]] abroad, including in: [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], other European countries, [[Turkey]], [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and the [[UAE]]. There were reports that women from low-income families in Belarus’ regions were subjected to forced prostitution in [[Minsk]]. Belarusian men, women, and children continued to be subjected to forced [[begging]], as well as forced labor in the [[construction]] industry and other sectors in Russia. According to the Ministry of Interior, Belarusian single, unemployed females between the ages of 16 and 30 were most at risk of being trafficked. [[Human trafficker]]s often used informal social networks to approach potential victims.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Belarus". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Belarus]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government’s response to trafficking is difficult to gauge due to the closed nature of the government, sparse [[Independent press|independent reporting]], and general fear of government retaliation for criticism of the ruling regime. However, based on available information, the government appeared to have sustained its efforts to [[prosecution|prosecute]] and punish trafficking offenders in 2009. While the government appeared to continue positive steps toward improved treatment of victims and support of the anti-trafficking [[NGO]] community, the overall [[Political climate|political climate]] of intimidation was a natural obstacle to authentic government partnerships with victims and anti-trafficking organizations. Funding for victim assistance programs codified into law in 2005 remained unrealized.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The [[U.S. State Department]]'s [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed Belarus in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 3"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government sustained [[law enforcement]] efforts during the reporting period. Belarusian [[law]] prohibits trafficking in persons for both [[sexual exploitation]] and [[labor exploitation]] under Article 181 of its [[criminal code]], which prescribes penalties ranging from two to 15 years’ imprisonment in addition to [[asset forfeiture]]. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious [[crime]]s. The government reported 219 human trafficking investigations in 2009, including at least 10 labor trafficking investigations. Authorities reportedly prosecuted 61 cases under Article 181, and convicted 15 trafficking offenders under the same statute in 2009, down from 17 convictions in 2008. The government did not report how many of the convictions were for forced labor versus forced prostitution. Officials reported that the majority of convicted trafficking offenders were given imposed sentences of over eight years’ imprisonment, in addition to the forfeiture of assets.

While reports indicated that officials engaged in [[corruption|corrupt]] practices, there were no reports of government [[complicity]] in human trafficking during the reporting period – such information may have been limited because of lack of [[freedom of the press|press freedom]] and imprisonment of citizens for criticizing government officials in Belarus. In general, the [[judiciary]] lacked [[Independent judiciary|independence]], [[trial]] outcomes usually were predetermined, and many trials were conducted behind closed doors. The Ministry of Interior continued to provide at least partial funding for its anti-trafficking training center, which has trained 47 Belarusian [[police officer|law enforcement officers]] and officials from other governments as trafficking specialists since 2007. Courses at the center reportedly focused on anti-trafficking law enforcement techniques and victim assistance, and were developed in partnership with [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], other [[international organization]]s, and NGOs. The government reported partnerships with the following governments on trafficking cases: Poland, Germany, the [[Czech Republic]], Israel, and Turkey.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government demonstrated minimal progress in protecting victims of trafficking during the reporting period, including a significant decrease in the number of victims identified. In 2009, authorities identified 369 victims of [[sex trafficking]], including 35 children, and 29 labor trafficking victims in 2009, a significant decrease from a total of 591 victims identified in 2008. The government reported referring only 131 victims to service providers for assistance, raising concerns that the formal, national trafficking victim referral mechanism was not successfully implemented. Law enforcement officials generally referred trafficking victims to IOM or NGO shelters – which relied on donor funding – to provide short and longer term protection and rehabilitation; the government referred [[child trafficking]] victims to NGOs for assistance.

The government again failed to provide funding for specialized victim assistance programs pledged in a 2005 presidential decree, but provided some in-kind donations to NGOs. Victims could seek state [[medical care|medical assistance]] and some other services, such as [[vocational training]], free of charge, but most victims declined assistance from government facilities. Government sources acknowledged that victims were more likely to trust NGOs than government sources of assistance. Anti-trafficking NGOs reported little government interference in their operations; they also reported improved communication with government officials during past year. In some instances during the reporting period, the government permitted NGO specialists to attend [[police]] interviews and closed court hearings upon victims’ requests.

The government claimed to have encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. The anti-trafficking training center reportedly emphasized the need to avoid [[coercion|coercing]] victims, which had been reported as a problem in the past. There were no reports of identified victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Belarusian law allows for authorities to grant [[Temporary resident|temporary residency]] status to foreign victims, though no victims chose this [[immigration]] relief during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government demonstrated modest progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. Citizens, the media, and NGOs in Belarus are often subjected to government intimidation and strict control, which limited open discussion about the trafficking situation in the country. Officials continued to conduct [[press conference]]s and briefings on the anti-trafficking situation in Belarus, focusing primarily on forced prostitution, during the reporting period. The government aired IOM-sponsored anti-trafficking public service announcements on [[state television]] and on television screens in subway stops, which resulted in an increased number of calls to IOM’s hotline. The Ministry of Interior continued to run a hotline offering information regarding the licensing status and legitimacy of [[marriage]], [[modeling agency|modeling agencies]], and agencies involved in work and [[study abroad]]. NGO's reported cooperation between the government [[hotline]] and their own hotlines, as well as partnerships with authorities in distributing NGO-funded public awareness materials. There were reports that some policies described by the Belarusian government as anti-trafficking measures were responsible for restricting Belarusian citizens’ ability to [[Freedom of travel|travel abroad]] for legitimate purposes. The government’s national action plan on trafficking, which expired in 2010, focused on [[illegal immigration|illegal migration]] which may lead to confusion between trafficking and [[smuggling]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

'''Interservice rivalry''' is the rivalry between different branches of a country's [[armed forces]], in other words the competition for limited resources among a nation's [[army|land]], [[navy|naval]], and [[air force]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the U.S. Military|publisher=Berkley Books|date=2001|series=Oxford Reference Online|chapter=Interservice rivalry|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.rp.nla.gov.au:2048/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t63.e4075|accessdate=2008-12-07}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also applies to the rivalries between a country’s intelligence services (e.g. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in the United States), or between the police and fire services of a city, such as the [[NYPD]] and [[FDNY]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the opinion of one of the ESU officers, some of these firefighters essentially refused to take orders from cops. At least one firefighter who was in the North Tower has supported that assessment, stating that he was not going to take an evacuation instruction from a cop that morning.

==Overview==
Interservice rivalries occur at all levels of the military, from the vying for key posts such as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the United States, [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] in the United Kingdom, or [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Spain)|Jefe del Estado Mayor de la Defensa]] in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Interservice rivalry can occur over such topics as the appropriation of the [[military budget]], prestige or the possession of certain types of weapons.&lt;ref name="Oxford_dictionary" /&gt; The latter case can arise, for example, when the navy operates an [[aircraft carrier]], which may be viewed by the [[air force]] as an infringement of its traditional responsibilities. Another case was the dispute between the [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Air Force]], which erupted when these two branches fought over the ownership of [[AH-64D Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow]] helicopters in 2012.&lt;ref name="timesofindia"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-02/india/38217610_1_22-heavy-duty-apache-helicopters-22-apache-helicopters-attack-helicopters IAF, not Army, will get Apache attack helicopters]: Govt - [[Times Of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such rivalries are often seen as negative influences on the effectiveness of a country's armed forces. However, they also serve as a balancing factor, introducing some of the desirable effects of competition to an otherwise traditionally very closed and [[Centralisation|centralized]] institution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Cases==
===Germany===
Many military analysts consider the [[Wehrmacht]], [[Nazi Germany]]'s armed forces, pioneers of "jointness" (''integrierter Kriegführung'', in German). They point out that [[Blitzkrieg]], the war-fighting style that brought the Wehrmacht stunning victories between 1939 and 1941, depended upon the close integration of ground and air (and sometimes naval) forces and that even after the Blitzkrieg campaigns gave way to a drawn-out [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], the Wehrmacht routinely conducted operations in a way that would today be called "joint". That is, elements of two or more services participated in close cooperation with mutually agreed goals, relatively little inter-service rivalry, and a [[Command hierarchy|command structure]] that, at least at the "sharp end" of operations, promoted, rather than inhibited, a spirit of jointness. Consequently, the analysts  assert, the Wehrmacht enhanced its capabilities and improved its combat effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hitler certainly understood the value of integrating his land, sea and air forces and placing them under a unified command, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (first under Field Marshal [[Werner von Blomberg]]'s command; later his own). He also saw the benefit of placing them under operational commanders who possessed at least a rudimentary understanding of the tactics, techniques, needs, capabilities and limitations of each of the services functioning in their combat zone.&lt;ref name=Jointness&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was thus innovative and several years ahead of his peers in the democracies, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Yet, largely because of Hitler's unusual and autocratic command style and difficulties with delegation, the Wehrmacht lacked elements that today's theorists consider essential to the attainment of truly productive jointness (a single joint commander or Joint Chief of Staff, a proper joint staff, a joint planning process, and an absence of inter-service rivalry) and that, as a result, it often suffered needless difficulties in combat.&lt;ref name=Jointness/&gt;

===India===
Infighting between the [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF) over [[armed helicopter]]s has existed for a decade; this came to light during the [[Kargil War]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-set-to-get-11-apache-helicopters/article18526987.ece|title=Army set to get 11 Apache helicopters|last=Peri,|first=Dinakar|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesofindia" /&gt;

In response to the request for Army-owned attack helicopters from General [[Bikram Singh (general)|Bikram Singh]], Chief of Army Staff, the Indian government made an agreement about the transfer of IAF [[AH-64D Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow]]s to the Army in 2012. The IAF, however, offered stiff resistance against the decision, and insisted that all attack and medium-lift helicopters be under its control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2013, Air Chief Marshal [[Norman Anil Kumar Browne|NAK Browne]], who faced against the Army for the helicopter issue, said that the AH-64Ds would be kept in the Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|en|[http://indianmilitarynews.wordpress.com/tag/inter-services-rivalry/ Army Chief contests IAF’s claims over Apache helicopters Inter Services Rivalry] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
The long-term discord between the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] was one of the most notorious examples of inter-service rivalry. The situation, with its origin traced back to the [[Meiji period]], came with both [[Geopolitics|geo-political]] and military consequences leading to Japan's involvement in [[World War II]]. The IJA/IJN rivalry expressed itself in the early 1930s as the “strike north” (''[[Hokushin-ron]]'') and “strike south” (''[[Nanshin-ron]]'') factions. The goal of both factions was to seize territories which possessed the raw materials, especially [[petroleum]], which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. The strike north faction advocated the taking of the [[Siberian natural resources|natural resources of Siberia]], by way of [[Manchuria]], a scenario in which the prime role would be taken by the Army, the strike south faction advocated the taking of the oil-rich [[Dutch East Indies]], a scenario in which the Navy would predominate.

In order to further their own faction, relatively junior officers resorted to the assassinations of members of the rival faction and their supporters in government. With both factions being opposed to the peace faction, this period has become known as the era of government by assassination. [[Insubordination]] by the [[Kwantung Army]] led first to the [[Mukden Incident|occupation of Manchuria]], and later the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] following the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. However, at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]], any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour.

With the loss of Army prestige, that followed the failure of the [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts]], the Navy faction gained the ascendency, supported by a number of the powerful industrial [[zaibatsu]]s, that were convinced that their interests would be best served fulfilling the needs of the Navy, and this paved the way to the [[Pacific War]].

The IJA and IJN rivalry also saw both services developing air arms, the Army creating its own amphibious infantry units and running ships and submarines, including [[submarine chaser]]s and aircraft carriers, the Navy meanwhile would create its [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|own infantry]] and [[Japanese marine paratroopers of World War II|marine paratroopers]].

Other examples of this rivalry include the Japanese Navy taking several weeks to inform the Army of the disastrous results of the [[Battle of Midway]].

===Pakistan===
The [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani Armed Forces]] used to fight over a number of issues. One in particular was predominantly between the [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]] and the [[Pakistan Army|Army]] over budget distribution. A key point of friction was the induction of the cruiser [[PNS Babur (1956)|PNS ''Babur'']]. This was resolved, however, when Pakistani think tanks realized the need for interservice harmony and established the Joint Services Headquarters. This unified headquarters has almost eliminated the friction between the services.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===United Kingdom===
A case in point is the rivalry between the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[Royal Marines]], which are part of the [[British Army|Army]] and the [[Royal Navy]], respectively, in the UK. Since some of their capabilities overlap, pressure can be put on the political or civilian decision makers to choose one or the other.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Another form of rivalry within the United Kingdom is between certain forces of the Cadets: the [[Sea Cadets (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]], the [[Army Cadet Force]], and the [[Air Training Corps]]; and between the [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Grenadier Guards]], over the issue of seniority.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===United States===
The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] was originally created to provide overall coordination for the various branches of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]], whose infighting, particularly between the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], was seen as detrimental to military effectiveness during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The rivalries are also based on services' individual philosophies for rules and behavior. An author wrote in 2012 about the differing cultures of the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Air Force]]'s pilots:&lt;ref name="davies2012"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sChUwqxkb0IC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=Red Eagles: America's Secret Migs | publisher=Osprey Publishing | author=Davies, Steve | year=2012 | pages=205 | isbn=1846039703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There was some truth in the old saying that the Air Force had a book for all the things you were allowed to do in the air, and anything not specifically written down was prohibited; whereas the Navy's rule book contained all the things you were not allowed to do, and anything not written down was perfectly legal.{{r|davies2012}}}}

[[File:USMC-120914-M-PE262-001.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and sailors compete in a [[Strongman competition|Strong-Man Competition]].]]

Various mechanisms are used to manage or curb interservice rivalries. In the United States Armed Forces, for example, an officer must complete at least one joint tour in another service to reach the level of [[Flag officer|Flag]] or [[General Officer]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Such officers may be described as "wearing purple," a reference to the [[United States Army|Army]]'s green, the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]' navy blue, the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]'s blue, the [[United States Navy|Navy]]'s white, and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]'s blue uniforms.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

One well-known encounter, the [[Revolt of the Admirals]], took place after the end of World War II. The newly created United States Air Force, sought to create a doctrine which relied heavily on [[Strategic bombing|strategic long-range bombing]] and the Army a large number of [[reservist]] troops. Both the Air Force and the Army claimed that the future of warfare depended on the issue of [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrent]], and as such the use of [[naval gunfire support]], as well as the [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] doctrine of the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], was outdated and would never be used again. The Secretary of Defense [[Louis A. Johnson]] succeeded to strip the Navy of funds on its first [[supercarrier]], the [[USS United States (CVA-58)|''United States'']]. This cancellation caused multiple high ranking Navy personnel to resign. The aftermath backfired against the Navy, and caused [[United States Congress|Congress]] to review, and after investigation enabled the implementation of the creation of a Strategic Air Force supporting a nuclear mission.

===Special Forces===
Interservice rivalries are often played out at divisional or regimental level or between [[special forces]] that are part of different services. The rivalry between special-forces units led to the creation of [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] in the United Kingdom, and [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]] in the United States to put them all under a unified command, putting an end to the "[[Iron rice bowl#Other uses|rice-bowl]]" doctrine which created absurd situations in [[Operation Eagle Claw|Iran]], [[US invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] and [[United States invasion of Panama|Panama]] in the 1980s. In the United Kingdom it has put an end to members of the [[Special Boat Service]] being recruited solely from the [[Royal Marines]] and it is now a tri-service branch.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''Joanes Leizarraga''' (1506–1601) was a 16th-century [[Basque people|Basque]] priest. He is most famous for being the first to attempt the [[standardisation]] of the [[Basque language]] and for the translation of religious works into Basque, in particular the first Basque translation of the [[New Testament]].

French spellings of his name are often encountered in older works, for example ''Ioannes Leiçarraga'' and ''Jean de Liçarrague'' and various other  spellings of his surname such as ''Leissarrague'' or ''Leiçarraga''. or in Spanish '''Juan de Lizárraga'''.

==Life==
[[File:Briscous-mairie-004.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Leizarraga in [[Briscous|Beskoitze (Briscous)]] near Bayonne]]
[[File:Leizarraga biblia 01.png|thumb|Cover of the New Testament's translation, ''IESVS CHIST GVRE IAVNAREN TESTAMENTV BERRIA'' (1571)]]

===Early years===
Leizarraga was born in the [[Northern Basque Country]] in the province of [[Labourd]] in a village called [[Briscous]] in 1506. Although the village was in Labourd, it fell within the area of the [[Lower Navarrese]] dialect of Basque. His family's farmhouse bore the family's name, Leizarraga, and stood in Briscous until it was destroyed in 1944. Very little is known about Leizarraga's early years beyond these few facts.

===Priesthood===
Leizarraga was baptised a [[Catholic]]. Although it is not known where he trained, he was trained as a priest and converted to [[Protestantism]] in 1560. By 1563, his name is mentioned in the records of the Protestant Synod of [[Béarn]].

In his dedication of the New Testament to [[Jeanne d'Albret]] he mentions having spent time in prison but again, it is not known which prison he was in, what the charge was or how long he was imprisoned for.

He was instituted as [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church in [[La Bastide-Clairence|Bastide]] in [[Lower Navarre]] in 1567 by Jeanne d'Albret. By the time Leizarraga came to Bastide, the majority of inhabitants were not speaking Basque but [[Gascon language|Gascon]], since it had come to be populated by a Gascon colony. Nonetheless, Leizarraga was even in his time renowned as a great scholar of the Basque language, the very reason he would later be entrusted with the translation of the New Testament. It is also known that various Basque shepherds in the area sent their children to him so that he would teach them Basque.

He was married but it is not known when or to whom.

In March 1563 Leizarraga was instructed by [[Jeanne d'Albret]], the Queen of [[Navarre]] at the Synod of Béarn to produce a Basque translation of the New Testament. Having negotiated the tricky issue of translating into a language which by then had no great written tradition, common standard or spelling system, he persevered with some help from four old Catholic colleagues: Piarres Landetxeberri from [[Espès-Undurein]], Sanz de Tartas from [[Charritte-de-Bas]] (both in [[Soule]]), Joanes Etxeberri from [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and a Mr Tardets who was a minister in [[Ostabat]]. Finally, in 1571, the printer Pierre Hautin based in [[La Rochelle]] printed three works by Leizarraga, amongst them is translation of the New Testament.

It is indicative of the respect he commanded that in 1582 he was visited by [[Jacques Auguste de Thou]], the man who would later negotiate the [[Edict of Nantes]] on religious tolerance. In his writings, Thou mentions Leizarraga and the copy of the Basque translation of the New Testament he had been given as a gift during his visit. This copy today is in the [[National Library of France]].

It is also Thou who mentions the exceptionally harmonious relationship between Protestants and Catholics in Bastide where according to him both faiths were worshipped in the church, something that was rare in 16th century France which is known for its [[French Wars of Religion|religious wars]].

By 1594 Leizarraga was no longer attending the Synod of Béarn, the record stating ''Monsieur de Lissarrague, ministre de Labastide de Clarence, excusé pour sa vieillesse et pour son indisposition'' "Mr Liazarraga, minister of Bastida, makes his excuse due to old age and being indisposed''.&lt;ref&gt;Urbistondo-Picavea, M. ''Les Basques et le protestantisme en Basse-Navarre et en Soule entre 1563 et 1623 à travers de l’étude comparative et l’analyse des manuscrits Ms 1J1387 et Ms 422/4 des Synodes du Béarn'' Faculté Pluridisciplinaire de Bayonne: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
He died in Bastide in 1601 at the age of 95.

==Leizarraga's work==
Leizarraga published three books, all in 1571: 
*''Iesus Christ Gure Iaunaren Testamentu Berria'' (The New Testament of Jesus Christ our Lord)
*''Kalendrera'' (a calendar of religious holiday)
*''ABC edo Christinoen instructionea'' (ABC or the Christian's Instruction)
The most famous of these undoubtedly is the ''Testamentu Berria'' which even today is known as "Leizarraga's New Testament". Apart from the New Testament's main text, his translation also includes the following addenda:
*''Testamentu Berrian diraden icen propri Hebraico eta Greco batzuén declarationeo'' ("Listing of some of the Hebrew and Greek proper names contained in the New Testament"), 3 pages
*''Testamentu Berrico hitz eta mincatzeco manera difficil bakoitz batzu bere declarationéquin'' ("Listing with explanations of a number of difficult words and expressions of the New Testament"), 13 pages
*''Çuberoaco herrian usançatan eztiraden hitz bakoitz batzu hango ançora itzuliac'' ("Some words not used in [[Zuberoa]] with their local equivalents"), 2 pages
*''Testamentu Berrico materien erideteco taulá'' ("A table for finding topics of the New Testament"),  48 pages
*a long section on how to conduct ecclesiastical ceremonies:
**''Othoitza ecclesiasticoen forma'' ("The way of ecclesiastical prayer"), 15 pages
**''Baptismoaren administratzeco form'' ("The way of administering baptism"), 6 pages
**''Cenaren celebratzeco forma'' ("The way of celebrating mass"), 5 pages
**''Ezconcaren celebratzeco forma'' ("The way of celebrating a wedding"), 5 pages
**''Erien visitatzeaz'' ("On visiting the ill"), 2 pages
**''Catechismea, cein erran nahi baita, Iesus Christen doctrinán haourrén iracasteco formá...'' ("The [[Catechism]], meaning the way of teaching the doctrine of Jesus Christ to children..."), a 62-page section in a question and answer format
*a short treatise on the life of a Christian

The ''Kalendrera'' is short, 15 page calendar with monthly listings of religious events and holidays, the ''ABC'' a short collection of common prayers and instructions on how to conduct daily worship.

===Critical appraisal===
The main criticism that has been made of his work is that he often used Romance loanwords where native terms exist. For example, he translates "fisher of men" as ''giza pescadorea'' rather than ''giza arrantzalea''. At the same time, he uses grammatical forms which were most likely archaic even in his period.

The other main criticism was, that as an over-regional standard, he based his standard too much on his native [[Lapurdian|Lapurdian dialect]] and the two other Northern dialects with very little regard to the Southern dialects. However, it must be remembered that he was the first to tackle standardisation and that there was no previous work he could build upon and that with his limited resources he had to carry out most of the work himself.

Overall, the quality of his translations and the thoroughness of his effort at standardising Basque were and are recognised today, and have in no small way contributed to the formation of [[Standard Basque]].

===Leizarraga as a source===
Leizarraga's texts provide a wealth of data on the Basque of his time.
*His work includes one of the few documented tripersonal verb forms where the direct object is not in the third person: ''gommendatzen cerauzquiotet'' "I recommend you to them", which is a type of [[Basque verbs|Basque verb formation]] no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
*He is one of the first known authors to have used the term ''heuscal herria'' ([[Euskal Herria]] in modern spelling, meaning "Basque Country").

As an example, the following is a comparison between Leizarraga's version and the modern version of the Lord's prayer (in Leizarraga's orthography):

==Standardisation of Basque==
Leizarraga's work represents the first documented effort to bring together the various [[Basque dialects]] in a single standard. His form of Basque was largely based on the Northern dialects [[Lapurdian]], [[Zuberoan]] and [[Lower Navarrese]] which at the time were considered the prestigious varieties of Basque.

He discusses the issue of dialectal divergence in the foreword and says:
{{quote|''...batbederac daqui heuscal herriã quasi etche batetic bercera-ere minçatzeco manerán cer differentiá eta diuersitatea den...'' [everyone knows how the manner of speaking almost changes from one house to the next in the Basque Country]}}

In the 20th century, [[Federico Krutwig]] proposed to [[Euskaltzaindia|the Basque Academy]] Leizarraga's language as the basis for Modern Standard Basque, but his ideas did not get enough support.

'''Kedahan Malay''' ([[Malaysian language|Malay]]: ''Melayu Kedah'', [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: ''ﻤﻼﻴﻮ ﻗﺪﺡ '') or commonly known as '''Orang Utara'''  is a sub-group of [[Ethnic Malay|Malays]] that is native to northern Malaysia (in the states [[Kedah]], [[Penang]] and [[Perlis]] as well northernmost parts of [[Perak]]) and in southernmost parts of [[Thailand]] (in the provinces of [[Phuket]], [[Trang Province|Trang]] and [[Satun]]) and [[Burma]] (in [[Mergui Archipelago]]). They are among the earliest settlers in the [[Malay peninsula]]. Kedahan Malays comprised at least 15% of the total [[Malaysian Malay]] population.

== History ==
According to history, Kedah was very popular among Arabian traders. Thus, this has led to interracial marriages between Arabs and Malays. Due to Arabic influences in the Kedahan Malay language, some Kedahan Malay are of Arab descent. However some of the Kedahan Malays that resided on the island-state of [[Penang]] might have Indian and/or Chinese blood and some who lived in [[Thailand]] might have Thai blood.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/3297366/Genetic_flow_from_Indians_to_Malays&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kedah Valley  ==
Kedah Valley is an area where the majority inhabitants are Kedahan Malays. The valley covered the [[Satun]] province of Thailand and the three northern states of Malaysia ([[Perlis]], [[Kedah]], [[Pulau Pinang]]) with at least an area of 25,908&amp;nbsp;km square.

== Demonym ==
Nowadays, most Kedahan Malays known themselves as ''Orang Utara'' or People Of The Northern Region instead of Kedahan Malay since that they resided the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. So are their language, which is called ''Pelat Utara'' or Northern Dialect.

== Language ==
[[File:An Old House of Kedah (3334750015).jpg|thumb|right|An old traditional Kedahan Malay style house.]]
{{main|Kedah Malay}}

The Kedahan Malays have their own unique variety of [[Malayan languages|Malay]] known as Kedah Malay or ''Pelat Utagha'' (northern dialect) as known by its native speakers. It is related to other varieties of Malay spoken in the peninsular but has its own unique pronunciation and also vocabulary. Kedahan Malay language can be divided into several sub-dialects, namely Kedah Persisiran (standard) or Kedah Hulu, Kedah Utara, Perlis-Langkawi, Penang and some others (sub-dialects spoken in [[Satun]] and [[Burmese Malays|Southern Myanmar]]). For instance instead of using ''kamu'' to denote as 'you', ''hang'' (English pronunciation: ''hung'') is used instead and ''cek'' for 'i/me' instead of ''aku'' in other Malay varieties in the peninsular. Besides proper Kedah Malay, another variety of Malay spoken is Baling Malay, which is distinct from Kedah Malay and more closely related to varieties of Malay spoken in [[Southern Thailand]] and [[Peninsular Malaysia#East Coast and West Coast|East Coast]] of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. Kedah Malay is considered distinct enough to have its own [[ISO 639-3|ISO code]] that is '''meo'''.

== Customs and culture ==
[[File:Wanita Kedah.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Kedahan Malay woman in traditional attire, 1930.]]

'''Ligurian''' (''ligure'' or ''lengua ligure'') is a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic]] language spoken in [[Liguria]] in [[Northern Italy]], parts of the Mediterranean coastal zone of France, [[Monaco]] and in the villages of [[Carloforte]] and [[Calasetta]] in [[Sardinia]]. It is part of the Gallo-Italic and [[Western Romance]] [[dialect continuum]]. The [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] (''Zeneize''), spoken in [[Genoa]], the capital of Liguria, is the language's prestige dialect on which the standard is based.

There is a long literary tradition of Ligurian poets and writers that goes from the 13th century to the present, such as [[Luchetto Gattilusio|Luchetto]] (the Genoese Anonym), [[Martin Piaggio]] and [[Gian Giacomo Cavalli]].

== Geographic extent and status==
Ligurian does not enjoy an official status in Italy.  Hence, it is not protected by law.&lt;ref&gt;Legge 482, voted on Dec 15, 1999 does not mention Ligurian as a regional language of Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Genoese (the dialect spoken in the city of Genoa) is the written ''[[Koiné language|koine]]'', owing to its semi-official role as language of the [[Republic of Genoa]], its traditional importance in trade and commerce and its vast literature.

Like other regional languages in Italy, the use of Ligurian and its dialects is in rapid decline. ISTAT&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/136496|title=L’uso della lingua italiana, dei dialetti e di altre lingue in Italia|date=2018-03-09|website=www.istat.it|language=it|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Italian central service of statistics) claims that in 2012, only 9% of the population used other than standard Italian with friends and family, which decreases to 1.8% with strangers. Furthermore, according to ISTAT, regional languages are more commonly spoken by uneducated people and the elderly, mostly in rural areas. Liguria is no exception. One can reasonably suppose the age pyramid to be strongly biased toward the elderly who were born before [[Italy during World War II|World War II]], with proficiency rapidly approaching zero for newer generations. On a more positive note, Ligurian has not experienced in recent years as strong a decline in number of native speakers as other regional languages. That could be a consequence of its status or the early, catastrophic decline it underwent in the past. The language itself is actively preserved by various groups.

Notable native speakers of Ligurian include [[Niccolò Paganini]], [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Eugenio Montale]], [[Giulio Natta]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Fabrizio De André]]. There is also a popular musical group, [[Buio Pesto]], who compose songs entirely in the language.

Because of the importance of Genoese trade, Ligurian was once spoken well beyond the borders of the modern province. It has since given way to standard varieties, such as [[Italian language|Standard Italian]]  and [[French language|French]]. In particular, the language is traditionally spoken in coastal, northern [[Tuscany]], southern [[Piedmont]] (part of the [[province of Alessandria]]), western extremes of [[Emilia-Romagna]] (some areas in the [[province of Piacenza]]), in a small area of southern [[Sardinia]] (the so-called Tabarchino), where its use is ubiquitous and increasing. Until recently, it was also spoken in the department of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] of [[France]] (mostly the [[Côte d'Azur]] from the Italian border to and including [[Monaco]]), in a township at the southern tip of the French island of [[Corsica]] ([[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]]) and by a large community in [[Gibraltar]] ([[UK]]). It has been adopted formally in Monaco as the [[Monégasque dialect]]; or locally, ''Munegascu'', without the status of official language (that is French). Monaco is the only place where a variety of Ligurian is taught in school.

The Mentonasc dialect, spoken in the East of the [[County of Nice]], is considered to be a transitional [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect to Ligurian; conversely, the Roiasc and Pignasc spoken further North in the Eastern margin of the County are Ligurian dialects with Occitan influences.

== Description ==
As a Gallo-Italic language, Ligurian is most closely related to [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] and [[Emilian-Romagnol language]], all of which are spoken in neighboring provinces. Unlike the aforementioned languages, however, it exhibits distinct [[Italian language|Italian]] features. No link between Romance Ligurian and the [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian language of the ancient Ligurian populations]], in the form of a substrate or otherwise, can be demonstrated by linguistic evidence. Only the toponyms are known to have survived from ancient Ligurian, the name ''Liguria'' being the most obvious example.

==Variants==
Variants of the Ligurian language are:
*[[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] (main Ligurian variant, spoken in [[Genoa]])
*[[Spezzino]] (in [[La Spezia]])
*[[Monégasque dialect|Monégasque]] (in [[Monaco]])
*[[Intemelio]] (in [[Sanremo]] and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]])
*[[Brigasc]] (in [[La Brigue]] and [[Briga Alta]])
*[[Royasc]] (in Upper [[Roya River|Roya]] Valley, between Italy and France)
*[[Tabarchino]] (in [[Calasetta]] and [[Carloforte]], Sardinia)
*[[Bonifacino]] (in [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]], Corsica)
*[[Noveize|Novéize]] or Oltregiogo Ligurian (North of Genoa, mainly in [[Val Borbera]] and [[Novi Ligure]])

== Alphabet ==
The Ligurian alphabet has:
* 7 vowels: '''a''', '''e''', '''i''', '''ò''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[ɔ]}}), '''o''' {{IPA|[u]}}, '''u''' [{{IPA|y}}], '''æ''' {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, plus the group '''eu''' {{IPA|[ø]}}.
* 19 consonants: '''b''', '''c''', '''ç''', '''d''', '''f''', '''g''', '''h''', '''l''', '''m''', '''n''', '''ñ''' (or '''nn-''' like in ''singing''), '''p''', '''q''', '''r''', '''s''', '''t''', '''v''', '''x''', '''z'''.
* It uses the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] (¨), [[circumflex]] (ˆ), [[acute (diacritic)|acute]] (´), and [[grave (accent)|grave]] (`) accents on most vowels when the full pronunciation key is given in the official spelling. It also uses the [[c-cedilla]] (ç).

'''Livonian''' (Livonian: ''līvõ kēļ'' or ''rāndakēļ'') is a [[Finnic language]]. It is a [[Language death|dead language]], with its last native speaker having died in 2013.&lt;ref name="thetimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/linguistic-geography/obituary-last-native-speaker-of-the-livonian-language-died-age-103 |title=Obituary: Last Native Speaker of the Livonian Language Died Age 103 |publisher=GeoCurrents |date= |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026031125/http://www.geocurrents.info/cultural-geography/linguistic-geography/obituary-last-native-speaker-of-the-livonian-language-died-age-103 |archivedate=October 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. The native land of the [[Livonian people]] is the [[Livonian Coast]] of the [[Gulf of Livonia]], located in [[Latvia]] in the north of the [[Courland|Kurzeme]] peninsula.

Some ethnic Livonians are learning or have learned Livonian in an attempt to revive it, but because ethnic Livonians are a small minority, opportunities to use Livonian are limited. The Estonian newspaper ''[[Eesti Päevaleht]]'' erroneously announced that Viktors Bertholds, who died on 28 February 2009, was the last native speaker who started the Latvian-language school as a monolingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{et icon}} [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/460898 ''Eesti Päevaleht''] "{{lang|lv|Suri viimane vanema põlve emakeelne liivlane}}" ("The last native speaker of Livonian from the older generation has died"), March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other Livonians had argued, however, that there were some [[native speaker]]s left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=3215 |title=Latvia's tiny Livonian minority struggles to keep its language alive &amp;#124; Baltic States news &amp; analytics |publisher=The Baltic Course |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Viktors Bertholds' cousin, [[:lv:Grizelda Kristiņa|Grizelda Kristiņa]]. Kristiņa died in 2013.&lt;ref name="thetimes1"/&gt; An article published by the [[Foundation for Endangered Languages]] in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. In a 2009 conference proceeding, it was mentioned that there could be "at best 10 living native" speakers of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The promotion of the Livonian language as a living language has been advanced mostly by the Livonian Cultural Centre (''{{lang|lv|Līvõ Kultūr Sidām}}''), an organisation of mostly young Livonians. Livonian as a [[lesser used language]] in Latvia – along with [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] – is represented by the Latvian Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (LatBLUL), formerly a national branch of the [[EBLUL|European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages]] (EBLUL).

The language is taught in universities in Latvia, Estonia and [[Finland]], which constantly increases the pool of second-language speakers who do not constantly reside in Latvia.

== History ==
[[File:Matthai.gif|thumb|Title page in German of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in Livonian, 1863]]
In the 19th century, about 2,000 people still spoke Livonian; in 1852, the number of Livonians was 2,394.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ariste|1981|loc=p. 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various historical events have led to the near total [[language death]] of Livonian:
* In the 13th century, speakers of Livonian numbered 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schätzung Vääri|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German invasion: around the year 1200, the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] and the [[Teutonic knights]] conquered [[Livonia]], leading to contention of rule of the area between these orders and the [[Archbishopric of Riga]].
* 1522: The introduction of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. 
* 1557: The Russian invasion, also known as the [[Russo-Swedish War (1554–57)|Russo-Swedish War.]]
* 1558–1583: [[Livonian War]]. Russians, Swedes, Danes, Lithuanians and Poles fought over the area.
* 1721: The [[Treaty of Nystad]]. Northern Livonia became provinces of Tsarist Russia.
* 1918: The founding of Latvia; the Livonian language re-blossomed.
* [[World War II]] and [[Soviet Union]]: marginalisation of Livonian.
* Declared extinct on 6 June 2013.

In the 13th century, the native Livonians inhabited the [[Estonia]]n counties [[Alempois]], [[Jogentagana]] [[Järvamaa|Järva]], [[Läänemaa]], [[Mõhu]], [[Nurmekund]], [[Sakala County|Sakala]], [[Ugandi]], and [[Vaiga]] in the north, and by the Daugava in the south. The Livonian settlement of [[Curonia]] was also begun then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Moseley|2002|loc=p. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th-13th centuries the Livonian lands were conquered by the [[Teutonic Order]]. The conquest led to a strong decrease in the number of speakers of the Livonian language, empty Livonian lands inhabited by the Latvians, which contributed to the replacement of the Livonian language in favor of Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=P.A.|last=Ariste|title=Известия АН Латвийской ССР: Ливы и ливский язык|year=1958|number=11|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at the time of the German colonization, there were 30,000 Livonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=de Sivers|first=F.|title=Parlons live: une langue de la Baltique|place=Paris; Budapest; Torino|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2001|pages=16|isbn=2-7475-1337-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the number of speakers of the Couronian dialect is estimated as follows: 2,074 people in 1835, 2,324 people in 1852, 2,390 people in 1858, 2,929 people in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Moseley|2002|loc=p. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet Census of 1989]], 226 people were Livonian, and almost half of them spoke Livonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viitso|first= Т.-Р.|title=Ливский язык: Языки мира. Уральские языки|place=Moscow|publisher=Наука|year=1993|pages=76–77|isbn=5-02-011069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to estimates of the Liv Culture Center in 2010, only 40 people spoke Livonian in everyday life. In 2013, there were none who spoke Livonian in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livones.net/44atbildes/?raksts=8680|title=Lībiešu valoda|author=|date=2011-11-11|publisher= livones.net|language=lv|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early literature===
The first Livonian words were recorded in the [[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schätzung Vääri|1966|loc=p. 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written sources about Livonian appeared in the 16th century. The collection of [[Livonian people|Livonian]] poems "Mariners sacred songs and prayers" ({{lang-lv|Jūrnieku svētās dziesmas un lūgšanas}}) was translated to [[Latvian language|Latvian]] by Jānis Prints and his son Jānis Jr. was published in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;Juhrneeku svehtas dseesmas un luhgschanas, sadomahtas no zitkahrtiga Pises basnizas ķestera Jahņa Prinz, un viņņa vezzaka dehla Jahņa. Jelgavā pee Jahņa Wridriķķa Steffenhagen un dehla. 1845&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latvian encyclopedia . Volume 4. Riga: Valery Belokon's Publishing. 2007 p. 832-833 {{ISBN|978-9984-9482-4-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book in Livonian was the [[Gospel of Matthew]], and was published in 1863 in London in both the eastern and western Courland dialects.&lt;ref name="Laanest 1975 loc=p. 21"&gt;{{harv|Laanest|1975|loc=p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated to eastern Couronian by Nick Pollmann, and to western Couronian by Jānis Prints and Peteris. The plan with the book was to establish a standard orthography by F. Wiedemann, which consisted of 36 letters with many diacritics. The total circulation was 250 copies.&lt;ref name="Moseley 2002 loc=p. 8"&gt;{{harv|Moseley|2002|loc=p. 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Livonians received only one copy of each dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Uralica|loc=p. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second book in Livonian was the same [[Gospel of Matthew]], published in 1880 in [[St. Petersburg]], with an orthography based on Latvian and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="Moseley 2002 loc=p. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Uralica|loc=p. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[interwar period]], there were several dozen books published in Livonian, mainly with the help of Finnish and Estonian organizations.&lt;ref name="Laanest 1975 loc=p. 21"/&gt; In 1930, the first newspaper in Livonian, ''"Līvli"'', was published. In 1942, a translation of the [[New Testament]] was published in [[Helsinki]]. It was translated by [[Kōrli Stalte]], with help from the Finnish linguist Lauri Kettunen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Moseley|2002|loc=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II|the war]], books in Livonian were no longer published,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schätzung Vääri|1966|loc=p. 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Latvian SSR|Latvia was in the Soviet Union]].

After Latvia regained its independence, the newsletter ''"Õvâ"'' was published in Livonian in 1994, dedicated to the Livonian culture, art and figures of the national movement, and in 1998 with the support of the "Open Society", the first collection of poetry anthology in Livonian ''"Ma akūb sīnda vizzõ, tūrska!"'' was published and presented in Finland and Estonia, and it combines the works of famous Livonian poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livones.net/44atbildes/?raksts=8678|title=Lībiešu literatūra|author=|quote=Tā ir 1998. gadā Rīgā iznākusī lībiešu dzejas antoloģija „Es viltīgāks par tevi, menca”, kurā apkopoti visu zināmāko lībiešu dzejnieku – pavisam 24 – darbi.|date=2011-12-12|publisher= livones.net|language=lv|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/kultura/news/books/kulturas-centra-noass-notiks-libiesu-valodas-dienas-svinesana.d?id=17898433|title=Kultūras centrā 'Noass' notiks Lībiešu valodas dienas svinēšana|author=|date=2007-05-17|publisher=www.DELFI.lv|language=lv|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the only Livonian media outlet is  trilingual (English-Latvian-Livonian) [http://www.livones.net livones.lv (livones.net)] operated by the Liv Culture Center.&lt;ref name=d /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/423880|script-title=ru:Латыши без ливов — как суп без соли: настоящий лив живет в… Канаде|author=|date=2011-03-09|publisher=D-PiLS.LV. Информационно-развлекательный портал Даугавпилса|language=ru|accessdate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speakers of Livonian in the twenty-first century===
Viktors Bertholds (July 10, 1921 &amp;ndash; February 28, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfk.lv/Suvcane-Bertholds.jpg Picture of V. Bertholds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222232245/http://www.lfk.lv/Suvcane-Bertholds.jpg |date=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.voila.fr/tangyra/eng.html|title=The last Livonian is dead|last=Laakso|first=Johanna |work=Tangyra|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the last Livonian speakers of the generation who learnt Livonian as first language in a Livonian-speaking family and community, died on February 28, 2009. Though it was reported that he was the last native speaker of the language, Livonians themselves claimed that there are more native speakers still alive, albeit very few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=3215 "Latvia's tiny Livonian minority struggles to keep its language alive"], ''Baltic Course'', 6 June 2013 (retrieved 6 June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in the Estonian newspaper ''[[Eesti Päevaleht]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{et icon}} [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/460898 ''Eesti Päevaleht''] "Suri viimane vanema põlve emakeelne liivlane″ ("The last native speaker of Livonian from the older generation has died"), March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Viktors Bertholds was born in 1921 and probably belonged to the last generation of children who started their (Latvian-medium) primary school as Livonian monolinguals; only a few years later it was noted that Livonian parents had begun to speak Latvian with their children. During World War II, Bertholds, unlike most Livonian men, managed to avoid being mobilized in the armies of either occupation force [[Forest brothers|by hiding in the woods]]. After the war, Bertholds worked in various professions and shared his knowledge of Livonian language with many field linguists; in the 1990s, he also taught Livonian in children’s summer camps.

Bertholds' Livonian-speaking brother and wife died in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, many other prominent "last Livonians" also died, such as Poulin Klavin (1918–2001), keeper of many Livonian traditions and the last Livonian to reside permanently on the Courland coast, and Edgar Vaalgamaa (1912–2003), clergyman in Finland, translator of the New Testament and author of a book on the history and culture of the Livonians.&lt;ref&gt;''Valkoisen hiekan kansa'', Jyväskylä 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/muistot/a1364354824709 Edgar Vaalgamaa - Muistokirjoitus - Muistot], [[Helsingin Sanomat|hs.fi]], Retrieved 2 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supposedly the last native speaker of Livonian was Grizelda Kristiņa, née Bertholds (1910–2013), who lived in Canada beginning in 1947. According to Valts Ernštreits, she spoke Livonian as well "as if she had stepped out of her home farm in a Livonian coastal village just yesterday".&lt;ref&gt;[[Raimu Hanson]]. [http://www.tartupostimees.ee/663344/teadusdoktor-kaib-mooda-liivi-radu/ Teadusdoktor käib mööda liivi radu]. ''[[Postimees]]'', 09.12.2011. (Accessed December 9, 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a  member of the Bertholds family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fennougria.ee/index.php?id=20292 |title=Maailma viimane emakeelne liivlane sai 100-aastaseks |author=Tapio Mäkeläinen |publisher=FennoUgria |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and qualified as the last living native speaker of the Livonian language of her generation. She died on June 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Charter |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article3782596.ece |title=Death of a language: last ever speaker of Livonian passes away aged 103 |publisher=The Times |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of the Livonian language now depends on young Livonians who learned Livonian in their childhood from grandparents or great-grandparents of the pre-war generations. There are not very many of them, but all in all, there are a few hundred ethnic Livonians in Latvia now who are interested in their Livonian roots. Some young Livonians not only sing folk-songs in Livonian but even strive at actively using Livonian in everyday communication.  One such younger generation Livonian speaker is Julgī Stalte, who performs with the Livonian-Estonian World Music group [[Tuļļi Lum]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Phonology ==

Livonian, like [[Estonian language|Estonian]], has lost vowel harmony, but unlike Estonian, it has also lost [[consonant gradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Laanest|1975|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsypanov|first= Е. А.|title=[http://www.finnougoria.ru/pdf%20izdania/sravnitelnyi%20obzor1.pdf Сравнительный обзор финно-угорских языков]|place=Syktyvkar|publisher=Kola|year=2008|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
Livonian has 8 [[vowels]] (2 vowels, marked in parentheses, were present in earlier generations but merged with other vowels in later generations; These were present as late as 1997):

{| class="wikitable"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! Front Rounded
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align=center
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{lang|lv|i}} {{IPA|/i/}}
| ({{lang|lv|y}} {{IPA|/y/}})
| {{lang|lv|õ}} {{IPA|/ɨ/}}
| {{lang|lv|u}} {{IPA|/u/}}

|- align=center
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| {{lang|lv|ä}} {{IPA|/æ/}}
|
| {{lang|lv|a}} {{IPA|/ɑ/}}
| 
|}

# Unstressed {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ə]}}.

All vowels can be [[Vowel length|long or short]]. Short vowels are written as indicated in the table; long vowels are written with an additional [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] ("ˉ") over the letter, so, for example, {{IPA|[æː]}} = {{lang|lv|ǟ}}. The Livonian vowel system is notable for having a ''[[stød]]'' similar to Danish. As in other languages with this feature, it is thought to be a vestige of an earlier [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]].

Livonian has also a large number of [[diphthong]]s, as well as a number of [[triphthong]]s. These can also occur short or long.

The two opening diphthongs {{IPA|/ie/}} and {{IPA|/uo/}} vary in their stress placement depending on length: short ''ie'', ''uo'' are realized as rising {{IPA|[i̯e]}}, {{IPA|[u̯o]}}, while long ''īe'', ''ūo'' are realized as falling {{IPA|[iˑe̯]}}, {{IPA|[uˑo̯]}}. The same applies to the triphthongs ''uoi'' : ''ūoi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lauri|last=Posti|chapter=Alustava ehdotus liivin yksinkertaistetuksi transkriptioksi|title=FU-transkription yksinkertaistaminen|year=1973|series=Castrenianumin toimitteita|volume=7|ISBN=951-45-0282-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alphabet ==
The Livonian [[alphabet]] is a hybrid which mixes Latvian and Estonian orthography.

{{lang|lv|A/a, Ā/ā, Ä/ä, Ǟ/ǟ, B/b, D/d, Ḑ/ḑ, E/e, Ē/ē, F/f, G/g, H/h, I/i, Ī/ī, J/j, K/k, L/l, Ļ/ļ, M/m, N/n, Ņ/ņ, O/o, Ō/ō, Ȯ/ȯ, Ȱ/ȱ, (Ö/ö), (Ȫ/ȫ), Õ/õ, Ȭ/ȭ, P/p, R/r, Ŗ/ŗ, S/s, Š/š, T/t, Ț/ț, U/u, Ū/ū, V/v, (Y/y), (Ȳ/ȳ), Z/z, Ž/ž}}
The letters in parentheses were used for phonemes that were unrounded in later generations; these were used as late as 1997.

== Language contacts with Latvians and Estonians ==
Livonian has for centuries been thoroughly influenced by [[Latvian language|Latvian]] in terms of grammar, phonology and word derivation etc. The [[dative case]] in Livonian, for example, is very unusual in a Finnic language.&lt;ref&gt;Gyula Décsy: ''Einführung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 81. Wiesbaden 1965&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 2,000 Latvian and 200 German loanwords in Livonian and most of the German words were adopted through Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;Gyula Décsy: ''Einführung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 82. Wiesbaden 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian, however, was influenced by Livonian as well. Its regular syllable stress based on Livonian is very unusual in a Baltic language. In both languages the letter ''h'' is silent, unlike other Finnic and Baltic languages.  Especially as of the end of the nineteenth century there was a great deal of contact with Estonians, namely between ([[Courland|Kurzeme]]) Livonian fishers or mariners and the Estonians from [[Saaremaa]] or other islands.  Many inhabitants of the islands of Western Estonia worked in the summer in Kurzeme Livonian villages.  As a result, a knowledge of Estonian spread among those Livonians and words of Estonian origin also came into Livonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ariste|1981|loc=p. 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 800 Estonian loanwords in Livonian, most of which were borrowed from the Saaremaa dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Gyula Décsy: ''Einführung in die finnisch-ugrische Sprachwissenschaft'', page 83. Wiesbaden 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John chapter 1 verse 1 to 10'''

'''English:'''

1) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2) He was with God in the beginning. 3) Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4) In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 5) The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. 6) There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7) He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8) He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9) The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. 10) He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.

'''Livonian:'''

1) Ȳrgandõksõs voļ Sõna ja Sõna voļ Jumal jūs ja Jumal voļ Sõna. 2) Ȳrgandõksõs ta voļ Jumal jūs. 3) Amad ažad āt leb täm tiedõt ja ilm tǟnda äb ūo mittõ midagist tiedõt, mis um tiedõt. 4) Täms voļ jelami ja jelami voļ rovz sieldõm aga. 5) Ja sieldõm pāistiz pimdõms ja pimdõm iz võta tǟnda vastõ. 6) Ykš rišting, nimtõt Jān, sai Jumalst kaimdõt. 7) Ta tuļ tapartõks pierast, āndam tapartõkst yļ sieldõm, laz amad uskõgõd leb täm. 8) Ta iz ūo sieldõm, aga tämmõn voļ sieldõm tapartõmõst. 9) Se voļ õigi sieldõm, mis āndab sieldõmt amad rovstõn, kis māilmõ tulbõd.

'''Estonian:'''

1) Alguses oli Sõna ja Sõna oli Jumala juures ja Sõna oli Jumal. 2) Seesama oli alguses Jumala juures. 3) Kõik on tekkinud tema läbi ja ilma temata ei ole tekkinud midagi. Mis on tekkinud 4) tema kaudu, oli elu, ja elu oli inimeste valgus. 5) Ja valgus paistab pimeduses, ja pimedus ei ole seda omaks võtnud. 6) Oli Jumala läkitatud mees, nimega Johannes, 7) see pidi tunnistust andma, tunnistama valgusest, et kõik hakkaksid tema kaudu uskuma. 8) Tema ise ei olnud valgus, vaid ta pidi tunnistama valgusest. 9) Tõeline valgus, mis valgustab iga inimest, oli maailma tulemas. 10) Ta oli maailmas, ja maailm on tekkinud tema läbi, ja maailm ei tundnud teda ära.

'''Finnish:'''

1) Alussa oli Sana, ja Sana oli Jumalan tykönä, ja Sana oli Jumala. 2) Hän oli alussa Jumalan tykönä. 3) Kaikki on saanut syntynsä hänen kauttaan, ja ilman häntä ei ole syntynyt mitään, mikä syntynyt on. 4) Hänessä oli elämä, ja elämä oli ihmisten valkeus. 5) Ja valkeus loistaa pimeydessä, ja pimeys ei sitä käsittänyt. 6) Oli mies, Jumalan lähettämä; hänen nimensä oli Johannes. 7) Hän tuli todistamaan, todistaaksensa valkeudesta, että kaikki uskoisivat hänen kauttansa. 8) Ei hän ollut se valkeus, mutta hän tuli valkeudesta todistamaan. 9) Totinen valkeus, joka valistaa jokaisen ihmisen, oli tulossa maailmaan. 10) Maailmassa hän oli, ja maailma on hänen kauttaan saanut syntynsä, ja maailma ei häntä tuntenut.

Durrani had previously served as [[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Qudssia Akhlaque, [http://www.thenews.com.pk/print1.asp?id=103652 "Ambassador Durrani likely to be made security adviser"] ''The News'', 29 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and military career==
Durrani was born in 1941 in [[Abbottabad]], which is in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province (formerly [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]]) of [[Pakistan]]. He is an ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] from the [[Durrani]] tribe. After graduating from [[Pakistan Military Academy]] in 1961 in the 24th PMA Long Course (same batch as General [[Jehangir Karamat]] who later became the Army chief) and winning the sword of honour,&lt;ref name="Ayaz"&gt;Ayaz Amir. [http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=156327 "A second Junejo in the making?"] ''The News'', 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; he served in various command, staff and instructional posts for about 16 years. From 1977 to 1982 he was [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] attaché in Washington, D.C. He then served as military secretary to the president of Pakistan until 1986.

Durrani was the posted as the commander the 1st Armoured Division in Multan, and being the former MS to the president persuaded the then Army chief and president General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] to witness the tank exercise in [[Bahawalpur]] desert on 17 August 1988. It was on its way back to Islamabad, that the C-130 carrying the presidential and higher military entourage crashed right after taking off from Bahawalpur airport killing everyone on board.&lt;ref&gt;Ayaz Amir. [http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=130088 "For God's sake, leave"] ''The News'', 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also suspected by, then United States Ambassador to India, John Gunther Dean for being ''extraordinarily insistent'' with President Zia to visit the demonstration. From many circles within Pakistan he is considered to be the prime suspect in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;John Gunther Dean.{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/library/oralhistory/clohproject/dean.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601133900/http://jimmycarterlibrary.org/library/oralhistory/clohproject/dean.phtml |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Oral history at jimmycarterlibrary&lt;/ref&gt; Durrani could prevail on Gen Zia because he had been his most trusted military secretary. Indeed, after Gen Zia's death, Begum Zia continued to repose trust in Gen Durrani, as narrated in ''Khaki Shadows'' by General [[Khalid Mahmud Arif]] the Chief of Staff (COS) under Zia, published in 2001.&lt;ref name="Najam"&gt;Najam Sethi. [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\01\10\story_10-1-2009_pg3_1 "Editorial: Good decision, bad implementation"] ''Daily Times'', 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 to 1998 Durrani was the chairman of the [[Pakistan Ordnance Factories]] Board.&lt;ref name=WD&gt;[http://www.washdiplomat.com/September%202006/a2_09_06.html New Pakistani Envoy Staunchly Denies Country Is Terrorist Breeding Ground] ''[[The Washington Diplomat]]'', September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud He retired as a [[Major General]] of the [[Pakistan Army]].

==Academic and diplomatic career==
Durrani was also an advisor in the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] in London, which he served from 2001 to 2004. After retiring from the Pakistani Army, he was actively involved in the peace efforts between Pakistan and [[India]]. As part of a process sponsored by the United Nations, he also worked with former senior officials from the United States, Russia and [[Iran]] to find a peaceful resolution to the Afghan crisis.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;

Durrani was appointed as [[Pakistan Ambassador to the United States]] by [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] in June 2006, replacing another General [[Jehangir Karamat]]. They both belong to the Armoured corps of Pakistan Army, with Durrani being the third Armoured Corps officer to take the helms of ambassadorship at Washington, D.C.; the first one was Lt Gen Ejaz Azim, who was ambassador during General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid Hasan.

Durrani was also called "General Shanti" by an Indian newspaper for his effort in trying to promote peace with India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Khalid Hasan.

==National Security Adviser==
Durrani was appointed National Security Adviser to Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] in April 2008 at the behest of [[Asif Ali Zardari]] who at the time only held the post of co-chairman [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (he became the President in September 2008). This was partly the reason why Durrani was fired from his job as NSA by Gillani for not "taking Prime Minister into confidence" about Kasab's nationality, even though Durrani had consulted the ISI chief who had in turn consulted the President Zardari before announcing that [[Ajmal Amir|Ajmal Kasab]] was a Pakistani national.&lt;ref name="Ayaz"/&gt;

==Books==
His book ''India and Pakistan: The Cost of Conflict and the Benefits of Peace'' and ''Pakistan’s Security Imperatives: Year 2000 and Beyond'' argued that in the process of Indo-Pakistan normalisation, based on the Balusa Group's recommendations, Pakistan should take the initiative in "re-engaging" India after the [[Kargil War|1999 Kargil operation]] and subsequent negative events associated with Pakistan policies. Strikingly, the stages of engagement outlined in the book were followed closely by President [[Pervez Musharraf]] after 2001: "Preliminary Secret Contacts, Stage Two Secret Meetings, Summit, Follow-up Meetings."&lt;ref name="Najam"/&gt;

He is the father of three children.&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;

'''Marion Coates Hansen''' (''née'' '''Coates'''; 3 June 1870 – 2 January 1947) was an English feminist and women's suffrage campaigner, an early member of the militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) and a founder member of the [[Women's Freedom League]] (WFL) in 1907. She is generally credited with having influenced [[George Lansbury]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician and future party leader, to take up the cause of votes for women when she acted as his agent in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election campaign of 1906]]. Lansbury became one of the strongest advocates for the women's cause in the pre-1914 era.

Hansen spent her almost her whole life in [[Middlesbrough]], and was an active member of the local [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP). Born into the well-to-do Coates family, she was drawn to socialism through her association with [[Joseph Fels]], the American industrialist and social reformer for whom she worked as a nanny in [[Philadelphia]] in the early 1890s. She was one of a group who left the WSPU in protest against the increasingly autocratic attitudes of [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her family towards the organisation's general membership. After the [[First World War]] she took up local politics in Middlesbrough, became a [[Councillor#United Kingdom|local councillor]] in Middlesbrough, and was involved in housing reform and [[slum clearance]]. Her contributions to the cause of women's rights has largely been overlooked by historians, who have tended to concentrate on higher profile figures.

==Early life==

Little information has been published about Hansen's early life, education and upbringing. She was born Marion Coates in 1870 or 1871, in [[Osbaldwick]], Yorkshire. While she was still a young child, the family moved to the [[Linthorpe]] district of [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name= census81&gt;{{cite web|title= All 1881 UK Census Collection results for Marion Coates|url= http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=1881UKI&amp;rank=1&amp;new=1&amp;so=3&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msT=1&amp;gss=ms_f-70&amp;gsfn=Marion&amp;gsln=Coates&amp;msbdy=1870&amp;msbpn__ftp=Middlesbrough%2C+Yorkshire%2C+England&amp;msbpn=1682149&amp;msbpn_PInfo=8-|publisher= ancestry.co.uk|accessdate= 6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her siblings were two older brothers: Charles  and Walter, who became successful businessmen, and were associated with the American industrialist and social reformer [[Joseph Fels]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 61 and p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= interview/&gt; Through the Fels connection Hansen travelled to [[Philadelphia]], probably in the late 1880s or early 1890s, where she worked for a time as a nanny in the Fels household.&lt;ref name= S84&gt;Shepherd 2002, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

During her American sojourn Hansen discovered and was inspired by the poetry and democratic philosophy of [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref name= S84/&gt; On her return to England she became an active proponent of socialism and women's rights, using the pages of the radical socialist journal ''Justice'' to attack the standard Victorian male prejudices concerning the roles of women in society.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; When one leading socialist opined that women ought to be "captivated and charmed by the beauties and possibilities of socialism", Hansen wrote a condemnatory reply in   ''Justice'' magazine:  "We women are not going to be bought like goodies ... We are coming as comrades, friends, warriors to a state worthy of us, not to dolldom".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 she married Frederick Hansen, a member of a well-to-do Middlesbrough family with socialistic beliefs. The Hansen and the Coates families were influential members of the local [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), in which Marion Hansen, as branch secretary, was the driving force; she, her family and their associates were known in local socialist circles as "the Linthorpe set". From time to time this group's influence and their paternalistic attitudes, in particular their permanent control over the branch's executive committee, caused resentment among the more working class membership. Another point of contention was the conflict of interest between Hansen's ILP duties and her growing interest in the politics of feminism.&lt;ref name= S84/&gt; In 1903, when the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] was founded to promote the cause of women's suffrage, Hansen became an early member.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;

==Suffragist==

===Background===
[[File:Suffragettes, England, 1908.JPG|thumb|A WSPU meeting, circa 1908]]
The WPSU, founded in 1903, was a breakaway movement from the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) which, led by [[Millicent Fawcett]], promoted the cause of women's suffrage by gradualist, law-abiding methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Certain NUWSS members, led by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her family, wanted a more active strategy and a more specific goal: to secure voting rights for women on the same basis as for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Purvis|first= June|title= Pankhurst (née Goulden), Emmeline|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35376?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 6 March 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; They founded the WPSU with the motto "Deeds not Words", and the new body began to build an activist membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Women and the Vote: Start of the suffragette movement|url= http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/electionsvoting/womenvote/overview/startsuffragette-/|publisher= Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the WPSU did not promote the kinds of disruptive actions which later became its hallmark; the change in tactic occurred in 1905, when it appeared that reform via the parliamentary route was doomed to failure. In February 1905 the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] opposition MP, [[Bamford Slack]], introduced a bill to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], which would give votes to women in parliamentary elections. When the bill was debated on 12 May, it was [[Filibuster|"talked out"]] by its opponents and was not put to the vote. Sensing that the Liberals would soon become the governing party, the WSPU sought assurances from the party's spokesmen that they would, when in power, legislate on votes for women. The failure of the Liberal leadership to give this commitment led to the adoption by the WSPU of more aggressive tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Purvis 2002, pp. 72–75&lt;/ref&gt; From the autumn onwards Liberal party meetings were regularly heckled and harassed; [[Christabel Pankhurst]] and [[Annie Kenney]] were imprisoned after disrupting a meeting in Manchester, obstructing the police and refusing to pay the fine.&lt;ref name= CP&gt;{{cite web|last= Purvis|first= June|title= Pankhurst, Dame Christabel Harriette|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35375?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 8 March 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with George Lansbury===
[[File:Photo 7 Council 1938, WRI George Lansbury head crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|George Lansbury in old age (1938). Under Hansen's influence he became an ardent supporter of women' suffrage after 1906.]]
Hansen's first recorded contribution to the WSPU cause came in September 1905. Anticipating that a general election would be held in the near future, she secured the candidacy of the socialist activist [[George Lansbury]] in the [[Middlesbrough (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesbrough]] constituency, on a programme that included a specific commitment to votes for women.&lt;ref name= S84/&gt; Lansbury was a local councillor and [[Board of guardians|Poor Law guardian]] in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], a tireless worker among the poor and disadvantaged of the East End of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Shepherd|first= John|title= Lansbury, George|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34407?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|date= January 2011|accessdate= 2 February 2013}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known to Hansen through the Coates family's connection with Joseph Fels, who had worked with Lansbury in the organisation of work schemes to assist the unemployed. In 1889 Lansbury had acted as agent for [[Jane Cobden]] when she was elected to the [[London County Council]],&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, pp. 71–75&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to Emmeline Pankhurst who had campaigned for him at [[Newington Walworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Walworth]] during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Cobden election, Lansbury's priorities had shifted to poverty and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the local ILP was bound by a secret election pact with the Liberals to support the Liberal candidate, [[Joseph Havelock Wilson]], they could not endorse Lansbury.  Hansen tried without success to bypass this restriction. She wrote to [[Ramsay MacDonald]], the secretary of the [[Labour Party (UK)#History|Labour Representation Committee]], pointing out the advantages for the Labour movement in supporting a candidate such as Lansbury, but MacDonald was unable to help; Lansbury stood as an independent socialist. Hansen persuaded Lansbury to include in his election address not only a commitment to women's enfranchisement but other radical socialist policies: Irish Home Rule, state pensions, full employment and trade union recognition. Her close involvement with Lansbury's campaign—she acted as his agent—angered some in her local party, but she fulfilled her duties with calm efficiency; according to Shepherd she "displayed the essential quality of any agent ... to maintain optimism in all situations, whatever the daunting difficulties". Her husband Frederick acted as campaign treasurer, and most of costs was borne  by Fels and Walter Coates.  Nevertheless, when the election came in January 1906, Lansbury's socialist brew proved too much for what his biographer John Shepherd describes as "the mainly working-class, all-male electorate", and Lansbury was heavily defeated. Wilson received 9,227 votes, his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] opponent 6,846 and Lansbury 1,484—less than 9 percent of the total vote.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, pp. 86–88&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen was primarily responsible in introducing Lansbury to and educating him in the issue of women's suffrage, a fact that he acknowledged when writing to her in October 1912. Shepherd writes that in due course, "gender was to replace social class at the head of his concerns and preoccupations" and votes for women became for him the overwhelming question of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 89 and p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; After Lansbury finally entered parliament in 1910 he expressed to Hansen his lack of faith in the ability of his fellow-Labour MPs to secure women's enfranchisement, despite the party by then having a formal policy commitment. In 1912 Lansbury resigned his parliamentary seat—against Hansen's passionate pleas against such action—to fight for it on the single issue of votes for women;&lt;ref name= S121&gt;Shepherd 2002, pp. 121–22&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen was devastated when he lost the ensuing by-election: "a more unhappy time I have never lived through".&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1913 Lansbury was imprisoned for incitement, after publicly supporting the militant tactics of the suffragist bodies which had by then passed well beyond the threshold of lawfulness. Although he was quickly released, Hansen wrote to him with approval: "You have done a big thing for us. It ... shows how far in the dark ages we still are, especially in matters concerning the welfare of women".&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen's concerns for Lansbury extended to his family, especially to his wife Bessie with whom she formed a warm and lasting friendship. She felt that Bessie needed a break from her responsibilities for her large family, and invited her to stay in Middlesbrough for a holiday: "The boys can look after the [younger] children, the girls can cook dinner and Mr Lansbury can darn his socks".&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd 2002, pp. 352–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===WSPU activist===
[[File:Christabel Pankhurst.jpg|thumb|upright|Christabel Pankhurst, a leading WSPU activist, photographed on graduation in 1905]]
In the year following the January 1906 general election, won by the Liberals with a large majority, the WSPU was active in a number of by-election contests. Hansen took part in several of these campaigns. At [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in August 1906, a divergence of view arose within the WSPU over whether Robert Smillie, the ILP candidate, should be supported. Smillie favoured women's suffrage in a general way, but was not a declared supporter; he shared with most Labour MPs the view that trade union reforms should take precedence over women's issues. Christabel Pankhurst and others decided on a separate campaign against all three declared candidates, and accordingly arranged rival meetings. This created difficulties for those such as Hansen and [[Mary Gawthorpe]], who had strong ILP loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, pp. 69–71&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gawthorpe spoke on behalf of Smillie, Hansen followed Christabel's line, a course of action that further antagonised her local ILP and caused her temporary resignation from the secretaryship.&lt;ref name= S84/&gt;

In her memoirs written many years later, the suffragist [[Hannah Mitchell]] provides a number of glimpses of Hansen during the 1906–10 period. Mitchell remembers her campaigning during a by-election at [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield]] in November; a little later, while leading a series of meetings, Mitchell caught a chill: "I became so ill that my hostess, Mrs Coates-Hanson{{sic}}, put me to bed at once ... Thanks to her kindness I managed to get through all the meetings, and she insisted on my staying a few days to rest. The Hanson home was lovely, and it was the first time in my life I had ever been waited on, and nursed, while the beautiful courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Hanson to each other, and to their guests, made those few days like a glimpse of Paradise".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 35 and pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSPU continued to grow rapidly, but many members were become increasingly dissatisfied by the organisation's lack of democracy and its detachment from the Labour movement. The historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] remarks that to many, "[the WSPU] represented no more than a small central coterie that took little notice of its members' opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; When in September 1907 Emmeline Pankhurst abandoned the constitution and appointed an executive committee of her own nominees a number of members, including Hansen, left the WSPU and formed the [[Women's Freedom League]] (WFL). The WFL, while fully committed to the activist struggle, adopted a democratic constitution. It collected many of the WSPU's working class members and promoted better relations with the Labour movement in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, pp. 163–67&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen, together with [[Charlotte Despard]] and [[Teresa Billington-Greig]] joined the WFL's initial executive committee.&lt;ref name= C721&gt;Crawford, pp. 721–22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Freedom League===
Despite her role in the formation of the WFL, there are few records of Hansen's activities on its behalf, although her correspondence with Lansbury in the years up to 1914 indicates that she remained passionately committed to the cause of women's suffrage. She may have been one of the WFL members who attempted to petition [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] at the [[State Opening of Parliament]] on 29 January 1908, and may have participated in the mass pickets of the House of Commons and [[10 Downing Street]], organised by the WFL in the summer of 1909.&lt;ref name= C721/&gt; Hansen's future sister-in-law Alice Schofield (she married Charles Coates in 1910) had greater visibility; an active WFL organiser, she was imprisoned in 1909 for her part in a demonstration at the House of Commons.&lt;ref name= Crawford&gt;Crawford, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two women shared common political and ideological concerns, they were not close; Alice Coates's daughter Marion Johnson, interviewed in 1975, revealed that the two disliked each other, and where possible kept their distance.&lt;ref name= interview&gt;{{cite web|title= Johnson, Mrs Marion|url= http://calmarchive.londonmet.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=%28PersonCode==%27NA1600%27%29|publisher= The Women's Library|date= 12 April 1975|accessdate= 6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
After the [[First World War]], during which the women's suffrage campaign was largely suspended, Hansen does not appear to have resumed her WFL activities. In 1919 she and Alice Coates became the first women elected to Middlesbrough Borough Council–Coates was elected a week before Hansen. The two were among the very few active suffragists who took up local politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Challenge and Change: A Brief History of Women Councillors in Yorkshire &amp; the Humber|url= http://www.cfwd.org.uk/uploads/ChallengeChangeWeb.pdf|publisher= Center for Women &amp; Democracy|year= 2011|accessdate= 12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen's main concerns as a councillor were related to slum clearance and housing; during the 1930s she spoke against the indiscriminate destruction of properties in the historic district of St Hilda's, maintaining that many houses scheduled for demolition "possessed fine elevations and interiors which make fault finding a difficult task".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Delplanque|first=Paul|title= Over the Border|url= http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/06/over-the-border.html|publisher= gazettelive.co.uk|date= 11 June 2010|accessdate= 12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1911 Hansen, who was childless, lived with her husband in the [[Nunthorpe]] district of the town.&lt;ref name= Nunthorpe&gt;{{cite web|title= Famous people of Nunthorpe|url= http://nunthorpehistorygroup.org/nunthorpe_history__general.htm#Marian%20Coates%20Hansen|publisher= Nunthorpe History Group|accessdate= 12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after Frederick Hansen's death, Hansen lived in [[Great Ayton]], outside Middlesbrough, where she died on 2 January 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Name of deceased (surname first)|url= http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/38004/pages/3038/page.pdf|journal= The London Gazette|date= 1 July 1947|pages= 3038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shepherd quotes Lansbury's description of Hansen as "a very slightly built woman: her frail body possesses an iron will and a courageous spirit. The freedom for which she strove was one which would emancipate body, soul and spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, pp. 117–18&lt;/ref&gt; Shepherd also remarks on Hansen's relative invisibility after her active life was over: "[H}er name is rarely even mentioned in the standard histories of the suffragette movement".&lt;ref name= S84/&gt; the local history society at Nunthorpe refers to her as "an extraordinary feminist whom historians have forgotten".&lt;ref name= Nunthorpe/&gt;

'''Northern Bavarian''' is a [[dialect]] of the [[Bavarian language]], together with [[Central Bavarian]] and [[Southern Bavarian]]. The language is mostly spoken in the [[Upper Palatinate]], although not in [[Regensburg]], which is a primarily Central Bavarian–speaking area, according to a linguistic survey done in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="tdomg"&gt;{{cite book | last = Russ | first = Charles V. J. | year = 1990 | title = The Dialects of Modern German | isbn = 0-415-00308-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, Northern Bavarian is also spoken in [[Upper Franconia]], as well as in some areas in [[Upper Bavaria|Upper]] and [[Lower Bavaria]], such as in the areas around [[Eichstätt]] and [[Kelheim]]. Few speakers remained in the [[Czech Republic]], mostly concentrated around [[Aš]] and [[Železná Ruda]], at the time of the survey, but considering the time which has passed since the survey, the dialect may be extinct in those places today. If it still exists there, it would include the ''ostegerländische Dialektgruppe''.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Erich Schmitt (ed.): ''Germanische Dialektologie''. Franz Steiner, Wiesbaden 1968, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.uni-marburg.de/sprache-in-hessen/flash/dt.swf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610230611/http://web.uni-marburg.de/sprache-in-hessen/flash/dt.swf |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologue estimates that there were 9,000 speakers of Bavarian [[Czech Republic]] in 2005, but does not clarify if these were Northern Bavarian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bar Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the same linguistic survey,&lt;ref name="tdomg" /&gt; the dialect is flourishing in the areas where it is spoken, despite the fact that most speakers actively use [[German language|Standard German]]. In the south of the area where Northern Bavarian is spoken, Central Bavarian is said to have higher prestige, and Northern Bavarian characteristics are therefore not as visible as in the north, where speakers even tend to use a heavy Northern Bavarian accent when speaking [[German language|German]].

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Northern Bavarian has 8 [[vowel]]s:

{| class="wikitable"
|- align=center
! rowspan="2" |
! colspan="1" | [[Front vowel|Front]]
! colspan="2" | [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align=center
! &lt;small&gt;Unrounded&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Unrounded&lt;/small&gt;
! &lt;small&gt;Rounded&lt;/small&gt;
|- align=center
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
|{{IPA|i}}

|{{IPA|ɛ}}
|
|{{IPA|ɔ}}
|- align=center
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
|{{IPA|a}}
|{{IPA|ɑ}}
|
|}

And 11 [[diphthong]]s:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Ending with {{IPA|/i/}}
! Ending with {{IPA|/u/}}
! Ending with {{IPA|/ə/}}
|-
| {{IPA|ɛi̯}}
| {{IPA|ɔu̯}}
| {{IPA|eə̯}}
|-
| {{IPA|ei̯}}
| {{IPA|ou̯}}
| {{IPA|iə̯}}
|-
| {{IPA|ai̯}}
| {{IPA|au̯}}
| {{IPA|uə̯}}
|-
| {{IPA|oi̯}}
| 
| {{IPA|oə̯}}
|}

Before {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/i, e, ɛ/}} are rounded to {{IPA|[ʏ, ø, œ]}}.

In southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the diphthongs {{IPA|/iə̯, uə̯/}} are realized with an opener offset, i.e. {{IPA|[iɐ̯, uɐ̯]}}.

An interesting aspect of the diphthongs are the so-called ''reversed diphthongs'', or in German, ''gestürzte Diphthonge''. They are called so because the [[Middle High German]] diphthongs {{IPA|[ie̯, ye̯, uo̯]}} became {{IPA|[ei̯, ou̯]}} ({{IPA|[y]}} became {{IPA|[i]}} after unrounding) in Northern Bavarian, while they generally became {{IPA|[iː, yː, uː]}} in [[Standard German]]. Compare Standard German ''Brief'' {{IPA|[briːf]}}, ''Bruder'' {{IPA|[ˈbruːdɐ]}}, ''Brüder'' {{IPA|[ˈbryːdɐ]}} and Northern Bavarian {{IPA|[ˈb̥rei̯v̥]}}, {{IPA|[ˈb̥rou̯d̥ɐ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈb̥rei̯d̥ɐ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Renn | first = Manfred  | last2 = König | first2 = Werner | year = 2006 | title = Kleiner Bayerischer Sprachatlas | isbn = 3-423-03328-2 | pages = 62–64, 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Bavarian diphthong {{IPA|[ɔu̯]}} corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German {{IPA|[oː, aː]}}. Compare Standard German ''Schaf'' {{IPA|[ʃaːf]}}, ''Stroh'' {{IPA|[ʃtroː]}} and Northern Bavarian {{IPA|[ʒ̊ɔu̯v̥]}}, {{IPA|[ʒ̊d̥rɔu̯]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Renn | first = Manfred  | last2 = König | first2 = Werner | year = 2006 | title = Kleiner Bayerischer Sprachatlas | isbn = 3-423-03328-2 | pages = 40–41, 44–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Northern Bavarian diphthong {{IPA|[ɛi̯]}} corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German {{IPA|[eː]}} and by unrounding to {{IPA|[øː]}}. Compare Standard German ''Schnee'' {{IPA|[ʃneː]}}, ''böse'' {{IPA|[ˈbøːzə]}} with Northern Bavarian {{IPA|[ʒ̊n̥ɛi̯]}}, {{IPA|[b̥ɛi̯z̥]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Renn | first = Manfred  | last2 = König | first2 = Werner | year = 2006 | title = Kleiner Bayerischer Sprachatlas | isbn = 3-423-03328-2 | pages = 46–47, 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Northern Bavarian variants, [[nasalization]] is increasingly common.

=== Consonants ===
Northern Bavarian has about 33 [[consonant]]s:

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===

==== Gender ====
All [[noun]]s in Northern Bavarian one of have three [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: feminine, masculine and neuter. Many nouns have the same gender as in [[Standard German]], but there are many exceptions. An example is ''Benzin'', which is neuter in Standard German, but masculine in Northern Bavarian. Another example is ''Butter'', which is feminine in Standard German, but can be all three genders in Northern Bavarian depending on where in the Northern Bavarian–speaking you are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zehetner | first = Ludwig | year = 1985 | title = Das bairische Dialektbuch | isbn = 3-406-30562-8 | pages = 121–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Case ====
As in Standard German there are four cases in Northern Bavarian: [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative]]. The genitive case, however, is uncommon and is commonly replaced either with the dative and a [[possessive pronoun]] or with the [[preposition]] ''von'' {{IPA|[v̥ə, v̥ən, v̥əm]}} and the dative, e.g. {{IPA|[m̩̩ v̥ɑtɐ z̥ãi haːu̯z̥]}}, or {{IPA|[s̩ haːu̯z̥ v̥om v̥ɑtɐ]}} ''father's house''.  An exception is the genitive instead of the dative after the singular possessive pronouns, e.g. {{IPA|[hintɐ mai̯nɐ]}}, which is as correct as {{IPA|[hintɐ miɐ̯]}} ''behind me''. Prepositions take the dative or the accusative, but not the genitive, e.g. {{IPA|[d̥rots n̩ reːŋ]}} (formally {{IPA|[d̥rots m̩ reːŋ]}}) ''despite the rain''. The dative ending -m often sounds like the accusative ending -n (see the previous example), so that these two cases are not distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zehetner | first = Ludwig | year = 1985 | title = Das bairische Dialektbuch | isbn = 3-406-30562-8 | pages = 106–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merkle | first = Ludwig | year = 2005 | title = Bairische Grammatik | isbn = 3-86520-078-8 | pages = 96–99, 184–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inflection ====
Nouns in Northern Bavarian are [[Inflection|inflected]] for number, and to a lesser extent, case. Inflecting for number is common across all three genders, and especially [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] is productive, in particular in masculine nouns. The most common plural marker in feminine nouns is {{IPA|[n]}}, while it is {{IPA|[ɐ]}} with most neuter nouns. Many nouns, across the genders, are the same in the [[plural]] as in the [[grammatical number|singular]].

:[[English language|English]] ''head'', Standard German ''Kopf'', Northern Bavarian sg. m. {{IPA|[kʰoːb̥͡v]}} &gt; pl. {{IPA|[kʰep͡f]}}
:[[English language|English]] ''cat'', Standard German ''Katze'', Northern Bavarian sg. f. {{IPA|[kʰɑt͡s]}} &gt; pl. {{IPA|[kʰɑt͡sn̩]}}
:[[English language|English]] ''house'', Standard German ''Haus'', Northern Bavarian sg. n. {{IPA|[haːu̯z̥]}} &gt; pl. {{IPA|[haːi̯z̥ɐ]}}

Weak masculine nouns are inflected in the accusative and dative case, most commonly with [[suffixation]] of a nasal consonant, such as {{IPA|[m]}} or {{IPA|[n]}}, while the other cases remain uninflected. Many weak feminine nouns have the ending {{IPA|[n]}} in most cases, though not to be confused with the plural ending. Weak neuter nouns have almost been lost, with only strong remaining, and therefore inflection for case is basically nonexistent.

:[[English language|English]] ''boy'', Standard German ''Bube'', Northern Bavarian m. nom. {{IPA|[dɐ bou̯]}} &gt; m. acc./dat. {{IPA|[n̩ bou̯m]}}

=== Adjectives ===
The [[inflection]] of [[adjective]]s in Northern Bavarian differ depending on whether the adjective is preceded by a [[definite article]] or a [[demonstrative]], or if it is preceded by an [[indefinite article]] or a [[possessive]], or if it is used as a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], of which the latter is only present in some varieties. Adjectives without any [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] rarely occur.

Below can the inflectional paradigms be seen, with the adjective {{IPA|[ɔːld̥]}} serving as an example. This is also the form used in all situations, when the adjective is used as a predicate, and therefore no paradigm is needed. Compare Northern Bavarian {{IPA|[ɔːld̥]}} with the Standard German ''alt'', in [[English language|English]] ''old''.

The predicate form of an adjective differ from the other forms, not only because it is the basic form, but also because it has a long vowel, unlike the other forms, as in {{IPA|[ɔːld̥]}} above. Other examples include {{IPA|[ɡ̊rɔːu̯z̥]}} and {{IPA|[b̥rɔːɐ̯d̥]}}, which become {{IPA|[ɡ̊rou̯s]}} and {{IPA|[b̥roi̯t]}}, respectively. Compare with the Standard German ''gross'' and ''breit'', in [[English language|English]] ''big'' and ''broad''.

Comparative adjectives are formed by suffixing {{IPA|[ɐ]}}, and superlative adjectives are formed by suffixing {{IPA|[st]}}. Vowel changes often take place when the suffixation happens. An example is {{IPA|[hɔːu̯ɣ̊]}}, which becomes {{IPA|[ˈhɛi̯xɐ]}} when comparative and {{IPA|[ˈhɛi̯kst]}} when superlative. Compare with the Standard German ''hoch'', ''höher'' and ''höchsten'', in English ''high'', ''higher'' and ''highest''.

=== Pronouns ===
The [[pronoun]]s of Northern Bavarian differ slightly from variety to variety. Furthermore, there are two pairs of pronouns, one used when in stressed position and the other used when unstressed.

There is no gender distinction in the plural.

The ending {{IPA|[j]}} in the stressed first person singular nominative and -accusative and in stressed the second person singular accusative is only present in northern- and western varieties of Northern Bavarian.

At the time of a linguistic survey carried out in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="tdomg" /&gt; pronouns also existed for unstressed first person plural accusative and unstressed second person plural accusative, {{IPA|[iz]}} and {{IPA|[iç]}}, respectively, but they have probably fallen out of usage today.

=== Verbs ===
[[Verb]]s in Northern Bavarian are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. The Northern Bavarian verbs are also subject to both vowel change and [[apophony]].

==== Non-finite forms ====
The [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms have one three endings: {{IPA|[∅]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} and {{IPA|[ɐ]}}. The first ending is rare, and is only present in some few monosyllabic verbs, such as {{IPA|[za͡i]}}, Standard German ''sein'', [[English language|English]] ''to be''; {{IPA|[ɡ̊ɛi]}}, Standard German ''gehen'', [[English language|English]] ''to go''; {{IPA|[ʒ̊d̥ɛi]}}, [[Standard German]] ''stehen'', [[English language|English]] ''to stand''; and {{IPA|[d̥o͡u]}}, Standard German ''tun'', [[English language|English]] ''to do''. The second ending is the most common ending found on most verbs, such as {{IPA|[b̥itn̩]}}, Standard German ''bitten'', [[English language|English]] ''to ask''. The third ending is used with verbs having a certain stem-final consonant, such as {{IPA|[z̥iŋɐ]}}, Standard German ''singen'', [[English language|English]] ''to sing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kranzmayer | first = E. | year = 1956 | title = Historische Lautgeographie des gesamtbairischen Dialektaumes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Present tense ====
The personal endings for the [[present tense]] differ slightly from variety to variety, but are largely uniform. The endings in the scheme below are attached to the stem, and not the non-finite form. The stem is found by removing the non-finite ending, if it is {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[ɐ]}}.

{| class="wikitable"

! rowspan="1" |
! [[Grammatical number|Singular]]
! [[Plural]]
|- align=center
! [[Grammatical person|First person]]

| ''nf.''

| -{{IPA|[z̥d̥]}}
| -{{IPA|[t͡s]}}
|- align=center
! [[grammatical person|Third person]]
| -{{IPA|[d̥]}}
| ''nf.''
|}

As can be seen in the scheme above, the first person singular is basically the same as the stem, and the first- and third persons plural are the same as the non-finite form. Furthermore, the third person singular is realized as -{{IPA|[d̥]}} when occurring before a fortis obstruent, and that in some southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the first person plural has the ending -{{IPA|[mɐ]}}, and therefore isn't the non-finite form.

The singular imperative is the same as the first person singular, and the plural imperative is the same as the second person plural. Only one exception exists, which is the imperative of {{IPA|[z̥a͡i]}}, Standard German ''sein'', [[English language|English]] ''to be'', which is {{IPA|[b̥iː]}}.

==== Past tense ====
Only one verb with a distinct [[simple past|simple past tense]] form remains, {{IPA|[z̥ai̯]}}, Standard German ''sein'', [[English language|English]] ''to be'', with the simple past tense form {{IPA|[βoə̯]}}, Standard German ''war'', [[English language|English]] ''was''. The [[past tense]] of other verbs is formed in the same way as Standard German uses ''haben'' or ''sein'', [[English language|English]] ''to have'' and ''to be'', respectively, and the [[past participle]].

The past participle in Northern Bavarian is formed by the [[prefix]] {{IPA|[ɡ̊]}}-, although not on verbs beginning with a [[plosive consonant]], where the prefix is left out. Thus we see {{IPA|[ɡ̊ʒ̊it]}}, Standard German ''geschüttet'', [[English language|English]] ''shaken''; {{IPA|[ɡ̊numɐ]}}, Standard German ''genommen'', [[English language|English]] ''taken''; {{IPA|[b̥rɑxd̥]}}, Standard German ''gebracht'', [[English language|English]] ''brought''; and {{IPA|[d̥roŋ]}}, Standard German ''getragen'', [[English language|English]] ''carried''.

The verbs {{IPA|[hɔm]}} and {{IPA|[z̥ai̯]}}, Standard German ''haben'' and ''sein'', [[English language|English]] ''to have'' and ''to be'', can be seen conjugated in the scheme below in the present, as they are [[irregular verb|irregular]]. They have the past participles, {{IPA|[ɡ̊hɔt]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ̊βeːn]}}, respectively. Compare with Standard German ''gehaben'' and ''gewesen'', [[English language|English]] ''had'' and ''been''.

|}

Examples can be seen below:
* {{IPA|[iː hoː ɡ̊ʒ̊it]}}, Standard German ''Ich habe geschüttet'', [[English language|English]] ''I have shaken''
* {{IPA|[eɐ̯ hɔu̯d̥ b̥rɑxd̥]}}, Standard German ''Er hat gebracht'', [[English language|English]] ''He has brought''

==== Subjunctive ====
It is quite straightforward to form the [[subjunctive]] in Northern Bavarian. The subjunctive of verbs is formed with the suffix -{{IPA|[ɐd̥]}}, as in {{IPA|[βisn̩]}} &gt; {{IPA|[βisɐd̥]}}, Standard German ''wissen'' &gt; ''wüßte'', [[English language|English]] ''to know'' &gt; ''I would know''.

==== Apophony ====
Both [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s and [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s may undergo [[apophony]]. The strong verbs can be split into two groups: the first group where the vowel in the non-finite form is the same as in the past participle; and the second group where the vowel in the non-finite form is different from the vowel in the past participle. The most common vowel gradations in the second group can be seen below:

* {{IPA|[ai̯]}} &gt; {{IPA|[i(ː)]}}: {{IPA|[ʒ̊nai̯n]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡ̊ʒ̊niːn]}}, Standard German ''schneiden'' &gt; ''geschnitten'' - [[English language|English]] ''to cut''
* {{IPA|[ei̯]}} &gt; {{IPA|[o]}}, {{IPA|[uɐ̯]}}: {{IPA|[b̥ei̯n]}} &gt; {{IPA|[b̥uɐ̯n]}}, Standard German ''bieten'' &gt; ''geboten'' - [[English language|English]] ''to offer''
* {{IPA|[i]}} &gt; {{IPA|[u]}}: {{IPA|[ziŋɐ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[ɡ̊z̥uŋɐ]}}, Standard German ''singen'' &gt; ''gesungen'' - [[English language|English]] ''to sing''
* {{IPA|[ɛ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[o]}}: {{IPA|[d̥rɛʃn̩]}} &gt; {{IPA|[d̥roʃn̩]}}, Standard German ''dreschen'' &gt; ''gedroschen'' - [[English language|English]] ''to thresh''

Apophony is not as common with weak verbs as in Standard German. However, the number of weak verbs with [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] variations is high, especially change in [[vowel length]] is common.

== Example ==

'''Pakistanis in Switzerland''' consist of migrants from [[Pakistan]] to [[Switzerland]] and their descendants. As of 2004, there were 3,000 Pakistani nationals living in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opf.org.pk/download/anual/YEARBK.pdf Yearbook 2004-2005: Overseas Pakistanis Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524170403/http://www.opf.org.pk/download/anual/YEARBK.pdf |date=2010-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The community is one of the largest among [[Islam in Switzerland|Muslims in Switzerland]]. Many Pakistani expatriates entered the country as political asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chowk.com/articles/11316 Meeting the Pakistani-Swiss: Chowk Travel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702140636/http://www.chowk.com/articles/11316 |date=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are concentrated predominately in [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]]. There are a small number of Pakistani scientists working at [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28934 CERN and Pakistan: A Personal Perspective (CERN Courier)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/928713 CERN and Pakistan consolidate their partnership: CERN DS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Pakistan maintains an important diplomatic presence in Switzerland through its embassy as well as a Permanent Mission to the United Nations in [[Geneva]]. There is a ''Swiss Pakistan Society'', a non-political and non-denominational organisation of Pakistani nationals living in Switzerland.

The small [[Ahmadiyya in Switzerland|Ahmadiyya movement in Switzerland]] was initially established and run by founders from Pakistan. There are a number of Pakistanis working as high-tech experts in information technology and the health sector. In 2008, while discussing the launch of the Swiss art and film festival in [[Karachi]], the Swiss ambassador to Pakistan praised the contributions of the community and conversed on extending more opportunities in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daily.pk/swiss-art-and-film-festival-on-its-way-to-karachi-5425/ Swiss art and film festival on its way to Karachi: Pakistan Daily] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161154/http://www.daily.pk/swiss-art-and-film-festival-on-its-way-to-karachi-5425/ |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal data services''' or '''personal data stores''' (PDS) are services to let an individual store, manage and deploy their key personal data in a highly secure and structured way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=|date=|url=https://mydex.org/understand-pds/|title=UNDERSTANDING PERSONAL DATA STORES (PDS)|work=|publisher=mydex|accessdate=2016-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001065833/https://mydex.org/understand-pds/|archivedate=2015-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They give the user a central point of control for their personal information (e.g. interests, contact information, affiliations, preferences, friends). The user's data attributes being managed by the service may be stored in a co-located repository, or they may be stored multiple external distributed repositories, or a combination of both. Attributes from a PDS may be accessed via an API. Users of the same PDS instance may be allowed to selectively share sets of attributes with other users.

'''Project Guardian''' is a joint initiative between [[British Transport Police]] (BTP), the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] ("the Met"), the [[City of London Police]], and [[Transport for London]] (TfL), which aims to combat and increase reporting of sexual harassment on [[public transport]] in [[London]]. The initiative was inspired by a similar operation in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and began after a TfL survey revealed that 15% of women who used London's public transport had experienced some form of unwanted sexual behaviour, but that the overwhelming majority of incidents were not reported to the police. Project Guardian aimed to increase reporting and reduce instances of such behaviour.

As part of the project, the police created a confidential hotline and text-messaging service and used social media to raise awareness and encourage reporting. They also staged several "weeks of action", involving increased patrolling of public transport by both uniformed and plain-clothed police officers, including a joint initiative with police officers in several cities in North America, several of which resulted in multiple arrests. In August 2014, the BTP recorded a 21% increase in sex offences, a rise which was attributed partially to increased reporting as result of Project Guardian.

==Background==
Project Guardian was launched in April 2013, after a survey conducted by [[Transport for London]] (TfL) reported widespread fear of sexual harassment among women who use London's public transport, and that 15% of female respondents had encountered unwanted sexual behaviour while using public transport, though around 90% of incidents went unreported.&lt;ref name="gruniad I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gruniad II"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/oct/01/project-guardian-public-transport-safer-women|title=Project Guardian: making public transport safer for women|last=Bates|first=Laura|authorlink=Laura Bates|date=1 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a joint venture between [[British Transport Police]] (BTP), which polices the rail and metro networks; the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s [[Safer Transport Command]], which is responsible for policing of buses in most of London; the [[City of London Police]]; and TfL.&lt;ref name="btp I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btp.police.uk/advice_and_information/how_we_tackle_crime/project_guardian.aspx|title=Project Guardian|publisher=[[British Transport Police]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btp II"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btp.police.uk/advice_and_info/how_we_tackle_crime/sexual_offences.aspx|title=Sexual offences|publisher=[[British Transport Police]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was launched with the aim of encouraging the reporting of incidents and creating an atmosphere on public transport which does not tolerate sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="gruniad I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gruniad II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gruniad III"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/25/four-10-women-sexually-harassed|title=Four in 10 young women sexually harassed in public spaces, survey finds|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=25 May 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/business/2013/08/sexual-harassment-public-transport-not-just-london|title=Sexual harassment on public transport: not just London|last=Lo|first=Chris|date=19 August 2013|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the issue of "victim blaming" (in which victims are held partially or entirely responsible for their harassment) BTP Inspector Ricky Twyford, manager of Project Guardian, stated "We don't want anyone to have to change their behaviour to prevent becoming a victim; the only people whose behaviour should change are those who are perpetrating this activity".&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;

The project, reported to be the largest campaign of its kind, was inspired by a similar initiative run by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) in [[Boston]] which doubled the level of reporting of sexual offences on the MBTA's network.&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt;

==History==
Project Guardian began with the BTP giving its 2,000 London-based officers specialist training in handling reports of sexual offences, with guidance from three of the UK's leading women's rights groups, the [[End Violence Against Women Coalition]], [[Hollaback!]], and the [[Everyday Sexism Project]].&lt;ref name="btp I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gruniad I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/world/europe/charting-the-impact-of-everyday-sexism-across-the-world.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Charting the Impact of Everyday Sexism Across the World|last=Gardiner|first=Beth|date=31 May 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public launch of the project was with a week-long Twitter chat, hosted by the BTP and the Everyday Sexism Project using the [[hashtag]] "#ProjGuardian", which was intended to raise awareness of Project Guardian and to encourage greater reporting of sexual offences, including reporting incidents in real time via Twitter. The police set up a dedicated, confidential telephone hotline and text-messaging service, which were widely publicised to encourage reporting.&lt;ref name="btp I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gruniad I"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/22/sexual-harassment-london-transport|title=Police act to halt sex harassment on London buses and trains|last=Martinson|first=Jane|date=22 July 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Guardian also covers police attempts to deter unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport, including increased patrols by highly visible and plain-clothed officers.&lt;ref name="btp I"/&gt;

In early April 2014, officers from Project Guardian were involved in a trans-Atlantic initiative known as "Global Guardian", in which police in Vancouver, Washington DC, Boston, and London all increased patrols on public transport networks and attempted to raise awareness of the initiative among passengers.&lt;ref name="btp III"/&gt;  

Among the tactics police use to deter and detect sexual offences as part of Project Guardian are "weeks of action", which involve large numbers of additional police officers, both high-visibility and in plain clothes, patrolling the transport network in order to raise awareness, gather intelligence, and detect offences.&lt;ref name="btp III"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btp.police.uk/docs/newsletter/Platform%20June%202014.pdf|title=Project Guardian|date=June 2014|work=Platform|publisher=[[British Transport Police]]|pages=4–5|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first, in August 2013, involved 185 police officers and resulted in nine arrests.&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/features/feature-project-guardian-sexual-harassment-public-transport/|title=Project Guardian: standing up to sexual harassment|last=Lo|first=Chris|date=15 August 2013|work=Railway Technology|publisher=Cognitive Publishing Ltd|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a week of action in September 2013, police used Twitter to raise awareness of the initiative, and the crackdown resulted in 15 people being arrested.&lt;ref name="gruniad II"/&gt; Another, held in March 2014, resulted in 16 arrests.&lt;ref name="met I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.met.police.uk/News/16-arrests-for-sexual-offences-during-Project-Guardian-week-of-action/1400023099899/1257246745756|title=16 arrests for sexual offences during Project Guardian week of action|date=18 March 2014|publisher=[[Metropolitan Police Service]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Project Guardian was largely praised by campaigners, but shortly after its launch there were calls for the initiative to be extended beyond London.&lt;ref name="ns"/&gt;
  
In October 2013, seven months after the public launch of Project Guardian, the police recorded a 20% increase in reporting of sexual offences on public transport, and a 32% increase in detections.&lt;ref name="gruniad II"/&gt; By August 2014, the BTP had recorded a 21% increase in recorded sexual offences across the British railway network, which the chief constable, [[Paul Crowther (police officer)|Paul Crowther]], attributed partly to increased reporting as a result of Project Guardian.&lt;ref name="beeb I"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28874345|title=Railways sex offences rise by 21%|date=21 August 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pullapää crisis''' of 1993 was a series of events involving military [[rebellion]], possible [[vigilantism]], firefight(s) and resignation of two [[Estonia]]n ministers.

== Chronology ==
On 6 July 1993, [[Läänemaa Vabatahtlike Jäägerkompanii]], a volunteer formation of the [[Estonian Army]] led by [[Asso Kommer]], was ordered to requarter from [[Haapsalu]] to [[Paldiski]]. Concerned about an inevitable confrontation with much larger Russian military units who were still quartered on the base, he refused the order on behalf of his company. On 23 July, [[Aleksander Einseln]] issued an order relieving Kommer from duty and directing him to take a training course for officers, but Kommer also refused this order. On 25 July, the company expressed their support for Kommer and announced they'd "withdraw" from Estonian military command structure.

Estonian government responded by demobilising the whole unit on 27 July, but once again, the company refused the order. The next day, the company left the facilities of [[Paldiski]] and went to [[Pullapää]]. Estonian military moved the [[Kuperjanov's Partisan Battalion|Kuperjanov battalion]], complete with [[armour]] units, to [[Jägala]], and, by all appearance, prepared for an attack, but this didn't, in the end, happen. However, Kommer's company, who had received a [[rumour]] that the President, [[Lennart Meri]], had ordered an attack to begin at 16:00 on 31 July, prepared for such attack, and a number of members of the [[Estonian Defence League|Defence League]], as well as several women, joined the company in the preparations. The rumour's source has not been tracked down.

On 2 August, [[Estonian Internal Security Service]] arrested [[Jaak Mosin]], a deputy leader of the (by then, demobilised) company Kommer was leading. As a response, the company withdrew its 25 June statement. On 3 August, [[Hain Rebas]], the [[minister of defence]], resigned. The military opposition wound down, and the crisis was further handled as a criminal rather than military matter.

On 12 August, a [[criminal investigation]] was launched against Asso Kommer and [[Jaak Mosin]], on suspicion of [[abuse of power]].

On 4 September, [[Asso Kommer]] and two other men took a businessman, [[Pavel Kalmõkov]], into their car in [[Tallinn]], and Kalmõkov ended up missing. (Later, on 9 December, Kommer directed the investigators to the place of Kalmõkov's burial.) On 12 September, Jaak Mosin, who had been released pending investigation, fled to [[Sweden]] and requested [[political asylum]]. On 26 November, a firefight between Kommer and police occurred, under unclear circumstances, and [[Koit Pikaro]] and [[Argo Aunapuu]], two police officials, end up wounded by bullets fired by Kommer. However, Kommer was successfully arrested the same day. On the next day, however, [[Lagle Parek]], [[Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs]], resigned over the incident.

On 26 November 1993, [[Asso Kommer]] was convicted of several crimes of these events, and sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment.

== Analysis ==
Comparable incidents of military insurrections also happened in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] around the same time. Accordingly, [[Johannes Kert]], an Estonian [[general]], has expressed his conclusion that these were incited by a common foreign agent. No foreign involvement in any of these incidents has been proven; however, it is known that a member of [[Russia|Russian Federation]]'s army had offered Russian citizenship to the whole company, "should the need arise".

A commonly cited background for the incident is Estonian military administrators' inability to organise acceptable living standards, and an approach, considered by some provocative or overly bureaucratic, towards the soldiers' petitions and complaints. (At least two such petitions by members of the Jäägrikompanii had gone unanswered, and a third had been answered on basis of [[insubordination]] rather than addressing the issues presented.) These problems might have ended triggering the active rebellion when the restationing order was issued.

However, the restationing order itself is surrounded by obscurity. Several months later, [[Hain Rebas]], the [[Estonian Minister of Defence]] who resigned over the incident, testified to a governmental commission that he didn't know who had initiated the restationing. [[Asso Kommer]] has declared that the order was a provocation by the [[Estonian Army]]'s [[staff of generals]], and that it is this provocation that led to the unit's withdrawal from Estonian military command structure.

It is also generally accepted, and explicitly stated by [[Lagle Parek]], the [[Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs]] who resigned over the incident, that several [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] politicians used the incident's background in an [[opportunist]] manner, to deliberately incite the conflict. [[Jüri Pihl]] has traced Kommer's support to [[Tiit Made]], [[Kalle Eller]], [[Jüri Toomepuu]], [[Katrin Linde]], and noted the company's contacts with [[Hardo Aasmäe]], [[Tiit Madisson]] and [[Jüri Põld]].

[[Hain Rebas]] has implied that the incident was masterminded by [[Tiit Made]], who, according to him, might have been plotting a military [[coup]]. This was supported by circumstantial evidence collected during the criminal investigation; however, this evidence didn't lead to any further convictions. Made, nor any other politician (of 1993) has never been officially charged with the rebellion, or incitement to rebellion. ([[Asso Kommer]]'s official political career began only in 2006, when he applied for membership of [[Keskerakond]], but the application has been stalled for more than a year.)

On the other hand, [[Jüri Toomepuu]], who publicly supported activities of Jäägrikompanii, claimed that [[Trivimi Velliste]]'s activities were influenced by a foreign power or foreign powers.

[[Kalle Kulbok]], a member of [[Riigikogu]] during the time and a leader of the [[Independent Royalist Party of Estonia]], has said that the military preparations were centered on [[containment]] rather than attack, and Estonian army would only have fired if the Jäägrikompanii would have fired first.

== Aspects of vigilantism ==
In the 1990s, police suspected that members of the Jäägrikompanii were involved in murdering and burial of about 30 ethnic Russians involved with the (now probably defunct) Perm mafia group. The company might have considered itself one of few forces capable of avoiding a supposed invasion by Russian [[organised crime]] interests. The company might in this context have behaved largely as a mere military arm of the [[Linnuvabriku mafia group]] consisting mostly of ethnic Estonians. (The Linnuvabriku group and the Perm mafia group were involved in the so-called "metal war" over possession of large coloured metal shipments. In particular, a shipment of [[cobalt]] has been implicated.)

For an example, an incident involving Jäägrikompanii members forcing to stop several members of the Perm mafia group, whose corpses were later found in [[Jõgevamaa]], buried in a farm belonging to a Linnuvabriku [[:wikt:Mafioso|mafioso]]'s mother.

{{Portal|Christianity in China}}
The '''Ricci Institutes''', named after the sinologist [[Matteo Ricci]], are research and publication centers directed towards the studies of Chinese ancient and modern culture as well as towards the intercultural dialogue between the Chinese World and the others spiritual traditions in the world. They were directly preceded by the “Bureau d’Études Sinologiques" that pioneered modern sinological research, an organization created by French [[Jesuits]] at the end of the 19th century in Shanghai.

There are four institutes in the world:

* The [[Taipei Ricci Institute]], founded in 1966 by Father Yves Raguin, S.J.
* The [[Paris Ricci Institute]], founded in 1972 by Father Claude Larre, S.J.
* The [[Ricci Institute for Chinese-Western Cultural History]] at the [[University of San Francisco]], founded in 1984 Edward Malatesta, S.J.
* The [[Macau Ricci Institute]], founded in 1999 by Yves Camus, S.J. and Luis Sequeira, S.J.

These institutes are juridically independent and foster different research and publication programs, while cooperating on occasional projects. Although the Ricci Institutes are Jesuit-led works, directors and staff may also be lay persons, cooperating with Chinese or foreign sinologists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">'''''Ruijan Suomenkielinen Lehti''''' was a [[Finnish language]] [[weekly newspaper]] published in [[Vadsø]] in [[Norway]].

==History and profile==
''Ruijan Suomenkielinen Lehti'' was started in 1877 as a weekly newspaper for the Finnish-speaking immigrants in Vadsø and [[Sør-Varanger]]. The editor wanted citizens of Finland to buy it as well. The paper was published by the [[kven people|Kven]] merchant Israel Bergström, with assistance from teacher J. G. Cajan from [[Helsinki]]. It had a mix between news, information directed towards Kvens and advertisements.&lt;ref name=finske&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eriksen|first1=Knut Einar|authorlink1=Knut Einar Eriksen|last2=Niemi|first2=Einar|authorlink2=Einar Niemi|title=Den finske fare. Sikkerhetsproblemer og minoritetspolitikk i nord 1860–1944|year=1981|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-00-05574-4|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ruijan Suomenkielinen Lehti'' was very controversial in its time. The paper was boycotted by most Norwegian advertisers in the district. Official people in the district, among others the priest and sextion, reportedly vowed to counteract the newspaper. One of the few Norwegians who publicly supported the newspaper's existence was the local politician (later [[Parliament of Norway|MP]]) [[Karl Akre]]. ''Ruijan Suomenkielinen Lehti'' went defunct later in 1877 after 26 issues.&lt;ref name=finske/&gt;

Finnish speakers in the area later imported the magazine ''Kaiku'', published in [[Oulu]].&lt;ref name=finske/&gt;

'''South Sudanese Australians''' are people of [[South Sudan]]ese ancestry or birth who live in Australia. Following South Sudan's independence in July 2011, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) included the country amongst the country of birth and ancestry options in the [[Census in Australia|2011 Census]] that took place in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/vic-32?opendocument&amp;navpos=620|title=South Sudan recognised on the Australian Census|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This census recorded 3,487 people born in South Sudan in Australia. However, the ABS note that "South Sudan-born were previously included in the Census count of the Sudan-born, and this is highly likely with a large number in the 2011 Census". Of the 3,487, the largest number were living in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (1,118), followed by [[Queensland]] (715), then [[New South Wales]] (561) and [[Western Australia]] (489). A total of 4,825 people indicated that they were of partial or full South Sudanese ancestry.&lt;ref name=Born&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dss.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/02_2014/south_sudan.pdf|title=Community Information Summary: South Sudan-born|publisher=Department of Immigration and Citizenship|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''''' is a 2016 documentary and comedy film by Nicholas Tana that attempts to explain why most people are afraid to discuss [[masturbation]]. The movie is one of the first documentaries to address the myths and social taboos around masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexpert.com/sextainment/sticky-self-love-story-first-documentary-masturbation/|title=Sticky, A (Self) Love Story; The First Documentary on Masturbation - Sexpert.com|first=Anka|last=Radakovich|website=Sexpert.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer for ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/01/watch-things-get-sticky-in-exclusive-trailer-for-nsfw-masturbation-doc-38861|title=Watch: Things Get ‘Sticky’ in Exclusive Trailer for NSFW Masturbation Doc|first=Mike|last=Lown|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected as top trailers of the week by [[IndieWire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-best-trailers-of-the-week-high-rise-masturbation-doc-and-tilda-swinton-make-a-splash-20160108|title=The Best Trailers of The Week... |author=Zach Sharf|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/director-nicholas-tana-sticky-a-self-love-story-interview|title=Director Nicholas Tana Breaks Down The Taboos Of Masturbation In 'Sticky: A Self Love Story'|date=February 3, 2016|website=Uproxx.com|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on sex education==
The feature-length documentary has received positive reviews in national media for its controversial stance in favor of [[masturbation]] as part of [[sex education]]. The filmmaker Nicholas Tana was paid to speak during a screening of his film at the 47th. annual [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists|American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT)]] conference in Minneapolis in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aasect.org/sites/default/files/AASECT%202015%20Annual%20Conference%20Final%20Program%20(Minneapolis,%20MN).pdf|format=PDF|title=47TH AASECT ANNUAL CONFERENCE|website=Aasect.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time an early educational cut of the film was screened in front of over a hundred certified sex educators. 

The AASECT screening resulted in invitations to conduct educational screenings at [[Arizona State University]] sponsored by VOX Voices For Planned Parenthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/this-asu-grad-made-a-masturbation-doc-called-sticky-because-of-course-8194179|title=This ASU Grad Made a Masturbation Doc Called Sticky, Because of Course|author=Lauren Cusimano|work=The Phoenix New Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Wisconsin]] sponsored by Sex Outloud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://union.wisc.edu/events-and-activities/event-calendar/event/sticky-2016|title=Sticky (2016)|website=Wisc.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eastern Michigan University]] spearheaded by Pam Landau of the Psychology department&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emich.edu/psychology/special-events/HSM_2016_sticky.php|title=Eastern Michigan University: Psychology Department|website=Emich.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2016 and ending in May 2016 in honor of international Masturbation Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-zombeck/get-to-know-yourself-its-_b_3290255.html|title=Get to Know Yourself -- It's Masturbation Month|first=Richard|last=Zombeck|date=May 20, 2013|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film addresses the need for sex education that discusses masturbation in a healthy manner to students; it includes interviewees with sex educators who express concerns about not properly educating children around sex and masturbation. The [[Harvard University]] screened ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' on campus in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on April 4, 2017, as part of Harvard's Sex week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/4/11/sex-weekend-stimulates-discussion|title='Sex Weekend' Seeks to Stimulate Discussion - News|website=Thecrimson.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting viewpoints on health==
Full of interviews from sex educators, religious figures, and psychologists, the documentary offers often contrasting opinions about the health benefits both physically and psychologically of masturbation. Among those interviewed who belief masturbation could be harmful is Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a popular Reddit masturbation abstinence group called [[NoFap]]. The movie also includes health findings associated with a Cambridge Study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090126082343.htm|title=Frequent Sex And Masturbation In 20s And 30s Linked To Higher Prostate Cancer, But Risks Diminish With Age|website=Sciencedaily.com|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that link masturbation to prostate cancer, and a Chinese medical doctor's warning about the impact too much masturbation could have on a men's health and vitality.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

These perspectives are contrasted with sex-positive statements from notable sex educators who speak in favor of the health benefits of [[masturbation]]. The film also references a medical study written in [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] indicating that masturbation might help to prevent prostate cancer.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Sex-positive feminism==
The film contains interviews with some of the founding members of the [[Sex-positive feminism|sex positive feminism]] movement.

''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' traces societal shame and guilt affiliated with [[masturbation]] to events in history and religious beliefs, and calls into question how this may influence politics and scientific study. {{cn|date=September 2017}} Among the issues discussed in the film is the [[Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act|Anti-Obscenity Act]] that bans the sale of sex toys in the state of Alabama, and the contradictory stances of four major religions surrounding [[masturbation]], which include [[Catholicism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Judaism]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other topics include the controversial firing of the first African American [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] by former U.S. President Bill Clinton; the career damaging fall out after [[Paul Reubens]] (Pee-Wee Herman) arrest in an adult theater for masturbating in public; current debates concerning sex education; the billion dollar sex toy industry; contradictory prostate cancer studies linked to male masturbation; the media obsession with sex addiction and sexual compulsion; the FBI study that links compulsive masturbation to serial killers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfYFYEWb62AC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;lpg=PA280&amp;dq=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EtBe5Bqga4&amp;sig=DoxQo82Na5DxH6GALXLzlMfsOOY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkoJS_2u_QAhUDzWMKHYwbC8AQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FBI+Study+compulsive+masturbation+to+serial+killers&amp;f=false|title=Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters|first=Peter|last=Vronsky|date=5 October 2004|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of pornography on relationships; opinions as to the future of masturbation.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Masturbation in film, TV, and music==
The impact of masturbation on the media is explored through a series of movie clips and music. [[Film Threat]] founder and film critic, [[Chris Gore]], states in the documentary that most instances of masturbation depicted in movies or television are seen as either grotesque or as something one wouldn't want to be caught doing. This comment is substantiated by clips from movies like ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film series)|American Pie]]'' shown in the film. 

Television clips from the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode called "The Contest" and a clip from ''[[Sex and the City|Sex in the City]]'' are also discussed, along with songs that make reference to masturbation in some way. A section in the film on Masturbation and Media includes interviews with comedian [[Ant (comedian)|ANT]], and [[Keith Morris]], singer/songwriter formerly of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Circle Jerks|The Circle Jerks]]. The movie features an acoustic performance of the song "[[I Touch Myself|Touch Myself]]" played by songwriter Billy Steinberg who is also interviewed in the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdcitybeat.com/article-17814-keith-morris-sticky-a-(self)-love-story-and-the-radvocate.html|title=Keith Morris, ''Sticky: A (Self) Love Story'' and The Radvocate|author=Citybeat Staff|work=San Diego City Beat|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tonga''' (''Chitonga''), also known as ''Zambezi'', is a [[Bantu language]] primarily spoken by the [[Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe|Tonga people]] who live mainly in the Southern and Western provinces of [[Zambia]], and in northern [[Zimbabwe]], with a few in [[Mozambique]]. The language is also spoken by the [[Tokaleya|Iwe, Toka and Leya people]], and perhaps by the [[Kafwe Twa]] (if they are not [[Ila language|Ila]]), as well as many bilingual Zambians and Zimbabweans.

It is one of the major [[lingua franca]]s in Zambia, together with [[Bemba language|Bemba]], [[Lozi language|Lozi]] and [[Nyanja]]. The [[Tonga language (Malawi)|Tonga of Malawi]], which is classified by [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie]] as belonging to zone N15, is not particularly close to Zambian Tonga, which is classified as zone M64, and can be considered a separate language.

The Tonga-speaking inhabitants are the oldest Bantu settlers, with the [[Tumbuka people|Tumbuka]], a small ethnic group in the east, in what is now known as Zambia. There are two distinctive dialects of Tonga; Valley Tonga and Plateau Tonga.  Valley Tonga is mostly spoken in the [[Zambezi]] valley and southern areas of the Batonga (Tonga people) while Plateau Tonga is spoken more around [[Monze District]] and the northern areas of the Batonga.&lt;ref&gt;A Practical Introduction to Chitonga, C.R. Hopgood, 1992 Edition, Zambia Educational Publishing House, p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Tonga (Chitonga or iciTonga) developed as a spoken language and was not put into written form until missionaries arrived in the area. The language is not standardized, and speakers of the same dialect may have different spellings for the same words once put into written text.&lt;ref&gt;Mweenzu Wafwulwe Ulalila Bowa (An Advanced Chitonga Language Course), R.N. Moonga and F.W. Wafer, Zambia Educational Publishing House, 1997, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

At least some speakers have a [[bilabial nasal click]] where neighboring dialects have /mw/, as in ''mwana'' 'child' and ''kumwa'' 'to drink'.&lt;ref&gt;Norval Smith, [[Harry van der Hulst]], 1988. ''Features, Segmental Structure &amp; Harmony Processes,'' vol. 1 p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Maho (2009) removes [[Shanjo language|Shanjo]] as a separate, and not very closely related, language.

==Verbs==
Tonga follows the standard [[Bantu languages#Language structure|Bantu language structure]]. A single word may incorporate a subject-marker, a tense-marker, a direct object, and even an indirect object, combined with the verb root itself.

==Tonal system==
Tonga is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language, with high and low-toned syllables. The placement of the tones is complex and differs from that of other Bantu languages; for example, a syllable which is low in Tonga may be high in the cognate word in other Bantu languages and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;Goldsmith, John (1984) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248111984_Tone_and_accent_in_Tonga "Tone and Accent in Tonga"]. In Clements, G. N. and John Goldsmith ''Autosegmental Studies in Bantu Tone''. Dordrecht, Foris Publications, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Several scholars, beginning with [[A. E. Meeussen]] in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;Meeussen, A.E. (1963) "Morphotonology of the Tonga Verb", ''Journal of African Linguistics'' Vol.2, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; have tried to discover the rules for where to place the tones. 

One feature of the tonal system is that high tones tend to get disassociated from their original place and move to the left, as is illustrated in these examples:&lt;ref&gt;Pulleyblank (1983) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36089880_Tone_in_lexical_phonology ''Tone in Lexical Phonology''], Massachusetts Institute of Technology, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''í'''b'''ú'''si'' 'smoke'
*''ibusu'' 'flour'

In these words, the original high tone of the root ''-sí'' has moved to the prefix ''ibu-'', whereas the low tone of ''-su'' has not affected the prefix.

The above example of a noun is relatively easy to explain. However, the tones of the verbal system are more complex. An example of one of the puzzles discussed by both [[A. E. Meeussen|Meeussen]] and [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|Goldsmith]] can be seen below:

*''ndi-la-lang-a'' 'I look at'
*''ba-la-lang-a'' 'they look at'
*''ndi-la-bon-a'' 'I see'
*''ba-l'''á'''-bon-a'' 'they see'

The high tone on the tense-marker ''la'' in the fourth verb is puzzling. If it comes from the verb root ''bon'', it is hard to see why it does not also appear in the 1st person ''ndi-la-bon-a''. 

Some scholars, such as [[Hazel Carter (linguist)|Carter]]&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Hazel (1971) and (1972). "Morphotonology of Zambian Tonga: Some Developments of Meeussen's System". ''African Language Studies'' 12: 1-30 and 14: 36-52.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Goldsmith (linguist)|Goldsmith]],&lt;ref name=Gold /&gt; have analysed Tonga as having both tones and accents (the accents in Tonga being mainly on low-toned syllables). Others, such as Pulleyblank, analyse the same data purely in terms of tonal rules, without the need to introduce accents.

These Scots migrated to Ireland in large numbers both as a result of the government-sanctioned [[Plantation of Ulster]], a [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|planned process of colonisation]] which took place under the auspices of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] on land confiscated from members of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland]] who [[Flight of the Earls|fled Ulster]] and as part of a larger migration or unplanned wave of settlement.

Ulster Scots emigrated onwards from Ireland in significant numbers to what is now the [[United States]] and to all corners of the then-worldwide [[British Empire]]—what are now [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the [[West Indies]], to [[British India]] and to a lesser extent to [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] (or Scots-Irish) is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who emigrated to North America.&lt;ref&gt;The term has usually been Scotch-Irish in America, as evident in Merriam-Webster dictionaries, where the term Scotch-Irish is recorded from 1744.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Scots-Irish was recorded in 1972.

The first major influx of border English and Lowland Scots into Ulster came in the first two decades of the 17th century.

First, before the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and even before the [[Flight of the Earls]], there was the 1606 independent Scottish settlement in east [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]]. It was led by adventurers [[James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye|James Hamilton]] and [[Sir Hugh Montgomery]], two Ayrshire [[laird]]s. Montgomery was granted half of Conn O'Neill's land as a reward for helping him escape from prison. Hamilton forced himself in on this deal when he discovered it and, after three years of bickering, the final settlement gave Hamilton and Montgomery each one-third of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencastlemuseum.org/Ulsterscots/001/The_Settlement_Story.pdf|title=Greencastle Museum|work=greencastlemuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1609, Scots began arriving into state-sponsored settlements as part of the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. This scheme was intended to confiscate all the lands of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland|Gaelic Irish nobility]] in Ulster and to settle the province with Protestant Scottish and English colonists. Under this scheme, a substantial number of Scots were settled, mostly in the south and west of Ulster, on confiscated land. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

While many of the Scottish planters in Ulster came from southwest Scotland, a large number came from the southeast, including the unstable regions right along the border with England (the [[Scottish Borders]] and [[Northumberland]]). These groups were from the Borderers or [[Border Reivers]] culture, which had familial links on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border. 
Contrary to popular misinformation and due mainly to the simplification of Irish history for political agenda purposes, these Reivers were not all Protestants, many if not a majority would have been at least nominally Roman Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyireland.com/early-modern-history-1500-1700/sheep-stealers-from-the-north-of-england-the-riding-clans-in-ulster-by-robert-bell/|title='Sheep stealers from the north of England’: the Riding Clans in Ulster by Robert Bell|date=24 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan was that moving these Borderers to Ireland would both solve the Borders problem and tie down Ulster. This was of particular concern to [[James VI of Scotland]] when he became King of England, since he knew Scottish instability could jeopardise his chances of ruling both kingdoms effectively.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. 608–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], the native Irish [[gentry]] attempted to extirpate the English and Scottish settlers in revenge for being driven off their ancestral land, resulting in severe violence, massacres and ultimately leading to the deaths of between four and six thousand settlers over the winter of 1641–42.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Macrory, ''The Siege of Derry'', Oxford University Press, 1980, pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Native Irish civilians were massacred in return.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Kenyon, Jane Ohlmeyer, ''The Civil Wars: A Military History of England, Scotland and Ireland 1638–1660'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1642, native Irish were in ''de facto'' control of much of the island under a [[Confederate Ireland]], with about a third under the control of the opposition. However, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians joined with the Irish in rebellion and aided them in driving the English out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caldwellgenealogy.com/additional-research/irish-rebellion/|title=Irish Rebellion {{!}} Caldwell Genealogy|website=caldwellgenealogy.com|access-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rebellion of 1641, R. Barry O'Brien. From The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, 4th Series, Vol. XVII, No. 449, May 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}}

The Ulster-Scottish population in Ireland was quite possibly{{weasel inline|date=March 2016}} preserved from complete annihilation{{peacock term|date=March 2016}} during the subsequent [[Irish Confederate Wars]], when a Scottish [[Covenanter]] army was landed in the province to protect the Ulster-Scottish settlers from native Irish landowners.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The war itself, part of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], ended in the 1650s, with the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]. At the head of the army, [[Oliver Cromwell]] conquered all of Ireland. Defeating the Irish Confederates and [[Cavalier|English Royalists]] on behalf of the [[Roundhead|English Parliamentarians]], he and his forces employed methods and inflicted casualties among the civilian Irish population that have long been commonly considered by contemporary sources, historians and the popular culture to be outside of the accepted military ethics of the day (see more on the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland#Historical debate|debate here]]). After the Cromwellian war in Ireland was over, many of their soldiers settled permanently in eastern Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Canny]], ''Making Ireland British'', p. 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Act of Settlement 1652]], all Catholic-owned land was confiscated and the [[British Plantations in Ireland]], which had been destroyed by the rebellion of 1641, were restored. However, due to the Scots' enmity to the English Parliament in the final stages of the [[English Civil War]], English settlers rather than Scots were the main beneficiary of this scheme.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

There was a generation of calm in Ireland until another war broke out in 1689, again due to political conflict closely aligned with ethnic and religious differences. The [[Williamite war in Ireland]] (1689–91) was fought between [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] who supported the restoration of the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] to the throne of England and [[Williamite]]s who supported the Protestant [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The majority of the [[Plantation of Ulster|Protestant colonists]] throughout Ireland but particularly in Ulster, fought on the Williamite side in the war against the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]]. The fear of a repeat of the massacres of 1641, fear of retribution for religious persecution, as well as their wish to hold on to lands which had been confiscated from Catholic landowners, were all principal motivating factors.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The Williamite forces, composed of British, Dutch, [[Huguenot]] and Danish armies, as well as troops raised in Ulster,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Tim. ''Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720''. Allen Lane (2006). pp. 435–436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, David. ''Ruling Ireland, 1685–1742: Politics, Politicians and Parties''. Boydell Press (2004). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; ended Jacobite resistance by 1691, confirming the Protestant minority's monopoly on power in Ireland. Their victories at [[siege of Derry|Derry]], [[battle of the Boyne|the Boyne]] and [[battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]] are [[Orange walk|still commemorated]] by the [[Orange Order]] into the 21st century.

Finally, another major influx of Scots into northern Ireland occurred in the late 1690s, when tens of thousands of people fled a famine in Scotland to come to Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.aol.co.uk/aol/redir?src=eu_websearch&amp;requestId=null&amp;clickedItemRank=2&amp;userQuery=scotland+famine+1690s&amp;clickedItemURN=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fbritish%2Fplantation%2Fulsterscots%2Findex.shtml&amp;title=BBC+-+History+-+Wars+and+Conflicts+-+Plantation+of+Ulster+-+Ulster+%3Cb%3E...%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;moduleId=matchingsites_uk.jsp.M&amp;clickedItemPageRanking=-8&amp;clickedItemPage=2&amp;clickedItemDescription=WebResults|title=AOL UK - Search|publisher=aol.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.aol.co.uk/aol/redir?src=eu_websearch&amp;requestId=null&amp;clickedItemRank=9&amp;userQuery=scottish+migration+ulster+1690s&amp;clickedItemURN=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fhistory%2Fbritish%2Fplantation%2Ftranscripts%2Fes11_t01.shtml&amp;title=BBC+-+History+-+Wars+and+Conflicts+-+Plantation+of+%3Cb%3EUlster%3C%2Fb%3E+%3Cb%3E...%3C%2Fb%3E&amp;moduleId=matchingsites_uk.jsp.M&amp;clickedItemPageRanking=9&amp;clickedItemPage=1&amp;clickedItemDescription=WebResults|title=AOL UK - Search|publisher=aol.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only after the 1690s that Scottish settlers and their descendants, the majority of whom were [[Presbyterian]], gained numeric superiority in Ulster, though still a minority in Ireland as a whole. Along with [[Catholics]], they were legally disadvantaged by the [[Penal Laws]], which gave full rights only to members of the [[Church of Ireland]] (the [[Anglican]] [[state church]]), who were mainly [[Anglo-Irish]] (themselves often [[absentee landlord]]s), native Irish [[Protestant Ascendancy|converts or the descendants of English settlers]]. For this reason, up until the 19th century, there was considerable disharmony between [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]] and the ruling [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland. With the enforcement of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] 1703 [[Test Act]], which caused further discrimination against all who did not participate in the [[established church]], considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots migrated to the colonies in [[British America]] throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Maldwyn Jones, "Scotch-Irish", in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 895-908&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, these 'Scots-Irish' from Ulster and Lowland Scotland comprised the most numerous group of immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland to the American colonies in the years prior the [[American Revolution]], with an estimated 150,000 leaving northern Ireland at the time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians ignored religious differences and, along with many Catholic Gaelic Irish, joined the [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]] to participate in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] in support of [[republicanism|republican]] and [[egalitarian]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ulsterscotstrail.com/taxonomy/term/5|title=1798 Rebellion|publisher=ulsterscotstrail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|[[Andrew Jackson]], seventh [[President of the United States]], was the first of Scots-Irish extraction.]]

Just a few generations after arriving in Ulster, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to [[British America|the North American colonies of Great Britain]]. Between 1717 and 1775, an estimated 200,000 migrated to what became the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fischer, David Hackett]], ''Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America'' Oxford University Press, USA (14 March 1989), p. 606; [[Parke S. Rouse, Jr.]], ''The Great Wagon Road'', Dietz Press, 2004, p. 32, and Leyburn, James G., ''The Scotch-Irish: A Social History'', Univ of NC Press, 1962, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the British took control of the territory of [[New France]], allowing many Ulster-Scots to migrate to these areas as well. These people are known as the [[Scotch-Irish Canadians]].

In the [[United States Census]] of 2000, 4.3 million Americans (1.5% of the population of the United States) claimed [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] ancestry. Author and former [[United States Senator]] [[Jim Webb]] suggests that the true number of people with some Scots-Irish heritage in the United States is more - over 27 million - possibly because contemporary Americans with some Scotch-Irish heritage may regard themselves as either Irish, Scottish, or simply [[American ethnicity|American]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2004/edition_10-03-2004/featured_0 Why You Need To Know The Scotch-Irish].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780767916899-1|title=Born Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America|author=James H Webb|work=powells.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nitakeacloserlook.gov.uk/index/american-connections/scots-irish.htm Scots-Irish] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216090343/http://www.nitakeacloserlook.gov.uk/index/american-connections/scots-irish.htm |date=16 February 2009 }} By Alister McReynolds, writer and lecturer in Ulster-Scots studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{refimprove|date=August 2018}}
Over the centuries, Ulster Scots culture has contributed to the unique character of the counties in Northern Ireland. The [[Ulster Scots Agency]] points to industry, language, music, sport, religion and myriad traditions brought to Ulster from the Scottish lowlands. In particular, the origin of [[country and Western music]] was extensively from Ulster Scots folk music. 

The cultural traditions and aspects of this culture including its links to country music are articulated in [[David Hackett Fischer]]'s book, ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''. In 2010's documentary ''The Hamely Tongue'', filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today's Ireland. The film's title refers to James Fenton's book, ''The Hamely Tongue: A personal record of Ulster-Scots in County Antrim.'' 

Most Ulster Scots speak [[Ulster English]] as a [[first language]]. [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] is the local dialect of the [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] language which has, since the 1980s, also been called "Ullans", a [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] popularised by the physician, amateur historian and politician [[Ian Adamson|Dr Ian Adamson]],&lt;ref&gt;Falconer G. (2006) The Scots Tradition in Ulster, Scottish studies review, Vol. 7, Nº 2. p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; merging ''Ulster'' and ''[[Lallans]]''—the Scots for "Lowlands" &lt;ref&gt;Hickey R.

'''Urban theory''' describes the city formation phenomenon where economic priorities prevail to facilitate the city’s propensity to generate and accumulate wealth. Such city formation involves some irreversible spatial investments, massive resource allocations and financial investments recoverable only if anticipated future income transpires. Consequently, it is a pertinent concept in urban planning. Though related, this is not to be confused with urban economics where economic principles and tools are applied at macro and micro levels. Urbanomics is to be understood as a paradigm to understand impact of the globalization process on urban development.&lt;ref name=Friedmann&gt;Friedmann J. &amp; Wolff, G. (1986), “The World City Hypothesis” in Development and Change, Vol. 17(1) pp.69-84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, P. G. (1966) ''The World Cities'', London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. Hanley, N. Moffat, I. Faichney, R. and Wilson, M. (1999) “Measuring Sustainability: A Time Series of Alternative Indicators for Scotland” in Ecological Economics, 28(1) pp.55-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sassen&gt;Sassen, S. (1991) The Global City: New York, London and Tokyo, Princeton: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban theory is an agglomeration of [[social theories]] - classical, neo-classical and modern&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Reference to social theory assumes the indivisibility of political, social and economic forces.  Sustainability is increasingly becoming the lynch-pin of urban studies with triple-line accountability (social, environment and economics) given more emphasis though not necessarily translated to practice. Here, urbanomics, by default, renders environmental and social concerns to subservience.

==Urban theory==
Theoretical discourse has often polarized between [[economic determinism]]&lt;ref name=Marx&gt;Marx, K. (1976) Capital Vol 1Harmondsworth: Penguin (Original work published in 1867)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cultural determinism]]&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;Weber, M. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, London: Allen &amp; Unwin (Originally published in 1905)&lt;/ref&gt; with scientific or [[technological determinism]] adding another contentious issue of reification. Studies across eastern and western nations have shown that certain cultural values promote [[economic development]] and that the economy in turn changes cultural values.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;Allen, M. W. Ng, S. H. Ikeda, K. Jawan, J. A. Sufi, A. H. Wilson, M. &amp; Yang, K. S. “Two Decades of Change in Cultural Values and Economic Development in Eight East Asian and Pacific Island Nations” in Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology Vol. 38: pp. 247-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban historians were among the first to acknowledge the importance of technology in the city.&lt;ref name=Hommels&gt;Hommels, A. “Studying Obducracy in the City: Toward a Productive Fusion between Technology Studies and Urban Studies” in Science Technology and Human Values, Vol. 30 No. 3: pp.323-51&lt;/ref&gt; It embeds the single most dominant characteristic of a city; its networked character perpetuated by information technology.&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;Graham, S. &amp; Marvin, S. (1996) Telecommunications and the City: Electronic Spaces, Urban Places, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the deterministic stance (economic, cultural or technological), in the context of [[globalization]], there is a mandate to mold the city to complement the global economic structure and urbanomics gains ascendancy.

The notion of urban’ is derived from ‘urbs’ which refers to the built city and ‘civitas’ which refers to feelings, rituals and convictions that define urban life.&lt;ref name=Sennett&gt;Sennett, R. 1990 The Conscience of the Eye, the Design and Social Life of Cities, London: Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; It connotes a dialectic relationship between materialism and ideas. This can be related to the ‘sense of place’ that Bourdieu refers to as ‘habitus’. He makes reference to symbolic capital – an appropriation of how things should be; that can be individualistic or collectively expressed. This concept has been well received in urban theory.&lt;ref name=Bounds&gt;Bounds, M. (2004) Urban Social Theory: City Self and Society, New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Architects focus on symbolism, engineers on quality standards, urban planners on land use and zoning and landscape artists on aesthetics, environmentalists on depletion of natural resources and climatic consequences, social-cause groups on the economically marginalized and residents on saving suburbs from degradation of neighborhood character. Symbolism has many facets but its cumulative capital does not provide a convincing wealth generation (economic capital) model as an alternative to prosper the city.

==Economic sustainability==
In fact, urbanomics can spillover beyond the city parameters. The process of globalization extends its territories into global city regions. Essentially, they are territorial platforms (metropolitan extensions from key cities, chain of cities linked within a state territory or across inter-state boundaries and arguably; networked cities and/or regions cutting across national boundaries) interconnected in the globalized economy. Some see global city-regions rather than global cities as the nodes of a global network.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott, A. J. (ed.) (2001) Global City-Regions, Oxford: Oxford University Press Sennett, R. 1990 The Conscience of the Eye, the Design and Social Life of Cities, London: Norton &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of engagement are built on economic sustainability – the ability to continuously generate wealth. The cornerstones of this economic framework are the following ‘4C’ attributes: (1) currency flow for trading, (2) commoditization of products and services in supply chain management, (3) command centre function in orchestrating interdependency and monitoring executions and (4) consumerization. Unless, decoupling the economy from these attributes can be demonstrated; symbolic capital expressions as legitimate as they may be; must accept the domineering status of urbanomics.

==Revisiting economic measurements==
Arguably, the culprit of this economic entrapment is the high consumption lifestyle synonymous with affluence.  The resolve may well be that ‘less is more’ and that true welfare lies not in rise in production and income. As such, [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) is increasingly being questioned as inaccurate and inadequate. GDP includes things that do not contribute to sustainable growth and excludes non-monetary benefits that improve the welfare of the people.  In response, alternative measures have been proposed such as the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]] (GPI)&lt;ref name=Talbert&gt;Talberth, J. Cobb, C. &amp; Slattery, N. (2006) “The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006 – Executive Summary” in Redefining Progress http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2007/GPI2006_ExecSumm.pdf Accessed 16 May 09&lt;/ref&gt; and the Index of Sustainable Welfare - ISEW.&lt;ref name=Hanley&gt;Hanley, N. Moffat, I. Faichney, R. and Wilson, M. (1999) “Measuring Sustainability: A Time Series of Alternative Indicators for Scotland” in Ecological Economics, 28(1) pp.55-73&lt;/ref&gt;
