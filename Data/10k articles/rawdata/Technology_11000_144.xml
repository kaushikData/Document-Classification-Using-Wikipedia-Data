[[File:DO &amp; CO Catering - 8968355090.jpg|thumb|A [[Do &amp; Co]] à la carte meal as served aboard [[Austrian Airlines]] flights]]

An '''airline meal''', '''airline food''', or '''in-flight meal''' is a [[meal]] served to passengers on board a commercial [[airliner]]. These meals are prepared by specialist [[airline]] [[catering]] services and normally served to passengers using an [[airline service trolley]].

These meals vary widely in quality and quantity across different airline companies and classes of travel. They range from a simple snack or beverage in [[short-haul]] [[economy class]] to a seven-course gourmet meal in a [[First class (aviation)|first class]] [[long-haul]] flight.  When ticket prices were [[Airline deregulation|regulated]] in the American domestic market, food was the primary means airlines differentiated themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ronalds-Hannon|first=Elizabeth|title=Free peanuts on airplanes started out as a marketing ploy|url=http://qz.com/112310/free-peanuts-on-airplanes-started-out-as-a-marketing-ploy/|work=Quartz|publisher=[[The Atlantic Media Company]]|accessdate=August 6, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103105856/http://qz.com/112310/free-peanuts-on-airplanes-started-out-as-a-marketing-ploy/|archivedate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first airline meals were served by [[Handley Page Transport]], an airline company founded in 1919, to serve the [[London]]–[[Paris]] route in October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/history-of-aviation-timeline/interactive-aviation-timeline/british-civil-aviation/1919.aspx | title = British Civil Aviation in 1919 – Part 1 | work = Interactive aviation timeline | publisher = Royal Air Force Museum | location = London NW9 5LL, United Kingdom | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131011094751/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/history-of-aviation-timeline/interactive-aviation-timeline/british-civil-aviation/1919.aspx | archivedate = October 11, 2013 | deadurl = no | accessdate = October 11, 2013 | quote = 11 October: The first airline meals are served by Handley Page Transport, when passengers are offered a pre-packed lunch-box, costing 3 shillings, on their London to Paris service.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers could choose from a selection of sandwiches and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Haigh| first = Gideon| title = The Tencyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=iwUCBzMHAuwC| accessdate = February 7, 2013| year = 2004| publisher = Text Publishing| isbn = 978-1-920885-35-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:United Airlines International Economy Meal.JPG|thumb|A [[United Airlines]] international economy meal.]]
The type of food varies depending upon the airline company and class of travel. Meals may be served on one tray or in multiple courses with no tray and with a tablecloth, metal cutlery, and glassware (generally in first and business classes). Often the food is reflective of the culture of the country the airline is based in.

The airline dinner typically includes [[meat]] (most commonly [[Chicken as food|chicken]] or [[beef]]), [[Fish (food)|fish]], or pasta; a [[salad]] or [[vegetable]]; a small [[roll (food)|bread roll]]; and a [[dessert]]. [[Condiments]] (typically [[edible salt|salt]], [[black pepper|pepper]], and [[sugar]]) are supplied in small [[sachet (package)|sachets]] or [[Salt and pepper shakers|shakers]].

Caterers usually produce alternative meals for passengers with restrictive diets. These must usually be ordered at least 24 hours in advance, sometimes when buying the ticket. Some of the more common examples include:
* Cultural diets, such as [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[French cuisine|French]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], or [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] style.
* [[Baby food|Infant and baby meals]]. Some airlines also offer [[Kids' meal|children's meals]], containing foods that children will enjoy such as [[baked beans]], mini-[[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s.
* Medical diets, including low/high [[Dietary fiber|fiber]], low [[fat]]/[[cholesterol]], [[Diabetic diet|diabetic]], [[Peanut allergy|peanut free]], [[Lactose intolerance#Avoiding lactose-containing products|non-lactose]], low [[salt]]/[[Low sodium diet|sodium]], [[Gout#Lifestyle|low-purine]], [[Calorie restriction|low-calorie]], [[Low-protein diet|low-protein]], bland (non-spicy), and [[Gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] meals.
* Religious diets, including [[kosher]], [[halal]], and [[Vegetarianism in Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Buddhist vegetarianism|Buddhist]], and [[Jain vegetarianism|Jain]] vegetarian.
* [[ovo-lacto vegetarian|Vegetarian]] meals, typically further defined as either lacto-ovo or [[vegan]] meals. These meals may follow a particular cuisine such as Asian cuisine or Western cuisine.

===Halal food===

For several Islamic airlines (e.g. [[EgyptAir]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[Batik Air]], [[Malindo Air]], [[Flydubai]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Iran Air]], [[Mahan Air]], [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], [[Oman Air]], [[Yemenia]], [[Royal Jordanian]], [[Kuwait Airways]], [[Iraqi Airways]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Saudia]], [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Royal Brunei Airlines]], [[Royal Air Maroc]], [[Libyan Airlines]], [[Afriqiyah Airways]], [[Tunisair]], [[Jazeera Airways]], [[Air Algérie]], [[Air Arabia]], and [[Turkish Airlines]]), in accordance with Islamic customs, all classes and dishes on the plane are served a Muslim meal with [[Halal]] certification – without [[pork]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]. While Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar still provide bottles of wine to non-Muslim passengers, the cabin crew does not deliver alcoholic beverages lest to violate Islamic customs, unless those non-Muslim passengers request it. [[Turkish Airlines]] does not serve any meals with pork or lard, but especially during international flights, a variety of alcoholic beverages are served upon request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://liveandletsfly.boardingarea.com/2017/04/14/turkish-airlines-economy-class-meals/|title=What Kind of Food Does Turkish Airlines Serve in Longhaul Economy? - Live and Let's Fly|date=2017-04-15|work=Live and Let's Fly|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Iran and Saudi Arabia apply strict [[Sharia]] regulations, those countries' airlines do not deliver pork or alcoholic beverages, and all airlines flying to or from Iran or Saudi Arabia are prohibited from serving either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.halalguide.me/news/halal-friendly-airlines-with-halal-menu-options|title=Halal-friendly airlines with halal menu options|publisher=|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Garuda Indonesia still serves alcoholic beverages (whiskey, beer, champagne, and wine) to non-Muslim passengers.

===Kosher food===
[[File:Kosher BethDin.jpg|thumb|Inflight kosher meal approved by the [[Beth din]] of [[Johannesburg]]]]
In the case of [[Israel]]i airlines [[El Al]], [[Arkia]], and [[Israir]], all meals served are [[kosher]]-certified by [[Rabbi]]s. Even at destinations outside Israel, sky chefs must be supervised by rabbis to make kosher meals and load their planes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Cutlery and tableware===
Before the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, first class passengers were often provided with full sets of metal cutlery. Afterward, common household items were evaluated more closely for their potential use as weapons on aircraft, and both [[first class travel|first class]] and [[Economy class|coach class]] passengers were restricted to plastic utensils. Some airlines switched from metal to all-plastic or plastic-handled cutlery during the [[SARS]] outbreak in 2003, since the SARS virus transfers from person to person easily, and [[plastic cutlery]] can be thrown away after use. Many airlines later switched back to metal cutlery. However, [[Singapore Airlines]] and [[Swiss International Air Lines]] continue to use metal utensils even in economy class as of 2018.

In May 2010, concerns were raised in Australia and New Zealand over their respective flag carriers, [[Qantas]] and [[Air New Zealand]], reusing their plastic cutlery for international flights between 10 and 30 times before replacement. Both airlines cited cost saving, international quarantine, and environmental as the reasons for the choice. Both have also said that the plastic cutlery is commercially washed and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] before reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10645963 |title= Airlines use plastic cutlery up to 10 times |first= Beck |last= Vass |newspaper= The New Zealand Herald |date = May 19, 2010 |accessdate= May 8, 2011}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/airlines-reusing-plastic-cutlery-3557516 |title= Airlines reusing plastic cutlery |publisher= Television New Zealand |date = May 19, 2010 |accessdate= May 8, 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130701061811/http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/airlines-reusing-plastic-cutlery-3557516 |archivedate= July 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Airline 'reuses plastic cutlery 30 times' |url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/airline-reuses-plastic-cutlery-30-times/story-e6frfq80-1225867534732 |first=Caroline |last=Marcus |newspaper=The Sunday Telelgraph |date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520010122/http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/airline-reuses-plastic-cutlery-30-times/story-e6frfq80-1225867534732 |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reusing [[Tableware|plastic tablewares]] though is a regular practice among many airliners and [[Food service|food caterers]].
{{Clear}}

For cleanliness, most meals come with a [[napkin]] and a [[wet wipe|moist towelette]]. First and business class passengers are often provided with hot towels.

===Breakfast===
[[File:Aeroflot meal 2007.JPG|thumb|Breakfast served on a short-haul [[Aeroflot]] flight]]
During morning flights a cooked [[breakfast]] or smaller [[continental breakfast|continental-style]] may be served. On long haul flights (and short/medium haul flights within Asia) breakfast normally includes an [[entrée]] of pancakes or eggs, traditional [[Full breakfast|fried breakfast]] foods such as [[sausage]]s and grilled [[tomato]]es, and often [[muffin]]s or [[pastry|pastries]], fruits, and [[breakfast cereal]] on the side. On shorter flights a continental-style breakfast, generally including a miniature box of [[breakfast cereal]], [[fruits]] and either a [[muffin]], [[pastry]], or [[bagel]]. [[Coffee]] and [[tea]] are offered as well, and sometimes [[hot chocolate]].

==Cost==
[[File:Airline In-flight meal in Spicejet Airways (1).jpg|thumb|In-flight meal on India's [[SpiceJet]], a low cost airline]]
Food on board a flight is usually free on full-service Asian airlines and on almost all long-distance flights, while they might cost extra on [[low-cost airlines]] or European full-service airline flights. Quality may also fluctuate due to shifts in the economics of the airline industry.

On long-haul international flights in [[First class travel|first class]] and [[business class]], most Asian and European airlines serve gourmet meals, while legacy carriers based in the US tend to serve multicourse meals including a cocktail snack, appetizer, [[soup]], [[salad]], [[entrée]] (chicken, beef, fish, or pasta), cheeses with fruit, and [[ice cream]]. Some long-haul flights in first and business class offer such delicacies as [[caviar]], [[champagne]], and [[sorbet]] (intermezzo).

The cost and availability of meals on US airlines has changed considerably in recent years, as financial pressures have forced some airlines to either begin charging for meals, or abandon them altogether in favor of small snacks, as in the case of [[Southwest Airlines]]. Eliminating free pretzels saved Northwest $2 million annually.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Nowadays, the main US legacy carriers ([[American Airlines|American]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], and [[United Airlines|United]]) have discontinued full meal service in economy class on short-haul US domestic and North American flights, while retaining it on most intercontinental routes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/duringFlight/dining/dining.jsp |title=American Airlines Inflight Dining, Recipes, Menus And More On |publisher=Aa.com |date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122184814/https://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/duringFlight/dining/dining.jsp |archivedate=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/in-flight-services/products/dining.html |title=Airline Meals &amp; Delta Dining &amp;#124; Delta Air Lines |publisher=Delta.com |date=November 10, 2013 |accessdate=December 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426101200/http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/in-flight-services/products/dining.html |archivedate=April 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/dining/default.aspx |title=United Airlines – Inflight dining |publisher=United.com |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420135620/http://www.united.com/web/en-us/Content/travel/inflight/dining/default.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one European carrier, [[Icelandair]], follows this policy on intercontinental runs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icelandair.us/information/ |title=Icelandair information: flights to Iceland, destinations, schedules &amp; more – Icelandair |publisher=Icelandair.us |date= |accessdate=December 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213114053/http://www.icelandair.us/information/|archivedate=February 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, all 4 major U.S. legacy airlines now offer free snacks on board in economy class. United Airlines re-introduced free snacks in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.united.com/2015-12-09-Free-Snacks-are-Back-United-Airlines-to-Introduce-New-Signature-Snacks|title=News Releases|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April 2016, American Airlines fully restored free snacks on all domestic flights in economy class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.halalguide.me/news/halal-friendly-airlines-with-halal-menu-options|title=Halal-friendly airlines with halal menu options|publisher=|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free meals will also be available on certain domestic routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160201/NEWS10/160209995/free-checked-baggage-no-but-have-some-pretzels|title=Free checked baggage?

[[Hawaiian Airlines]] is the only remaining major US airline that offers complimentary in–flight meals on its domestic flights.

[[Air China]] has reported that each domestic flight's meal requires [[RMB]]50 (US$7.30) while international flights require RMB70 (US$10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Li| first = Jiaxiang| title = My Way The Eight Strategies of Air China Towards Success| year = 2008| publisher = Cengage Learning| location = China| isbn = 978-981-4239-58-5| page = 241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this figure varies from airline to airline, as some have reported costs to be as low as US$3.50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/TravelForLess/TheDeathOfTheAirlineMeal.aspx "The Death of the Airline Meal"] [http://moneycentral.msn.com MSN Money].

In 1958 [[Pan Am]] and several European airlines entered into a legal dispute over whether certain airline food sandwiches counted as a "meal".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F11F63554127B93C0A8178FD85F4C8585F9 Airline Says Rivals Violate Rule By Epic, Epicurean Sandwiches; Smorgasbord on Bread Hardly a Tidbit, Pan American Protests, Citing Pact Against Meals on Cut-Rate Flights]."

==Preparation==
[[File:Airline catering.JPG|thumb|Food being delivered to a [[Boeing 767]]]]
Meals must generally be prepared on the ground before takeoff. Guillaume de Syon, a history professor at [[Albright College]] who wrote about the history of airline meals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Syon|first=Guillaume|chapter=Is it Really Better to Travel than to Arrive? Airline Food as a Reflection of Consumer Anxiety|editor-last=Rubin |editor-first=Lawrence C. |title=Food for Thought: Essays on Eating and Culture | year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |pages=199–209 |url= https://www.academia.edu/1293652/Airline_Food_-_5-09gds }}&lt;/ref&gt;  said that the higher [[altitude]]s alter the taste of the food and the function of the [[taste bud]]s; according to de Syon the food may taste "dry and flavorless" as a result of the pressurization and passengers, feeling thirsty due to pressurization, many drink alcohol when they ought to drink water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/04/29/airlines.gourmet.food.ap/index.html |date=April 29, 2008 |title=Airlines enlist gourmet chefs to draw first-class fliers |publisher=Associated Press/CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915061654/http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/04/29/airlines.gourmet.food.ap/index.html |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that the perception of saltiness and sweetness drops 30% at high altitudes. The low humidity in airline cabins also dries out the nose which decreases olfactory sensors which are essential for tasting flavor in dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Daily Mail]] |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2604107/The-REAL-reason-airplane-food-tastes-bad-chef.html |dead-url=no |date=April 14, 2014 |title=The Real Reason Airline Food Tastes so Bad |author=travelmail reporter |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140509212241/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2604107/The-REAL-reason-airplane-food-tastes-bad-chef.html |archive-date=May 9, 2014 |access-date=May 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food safety is paramount in the airline catering industry. A case of mass [[food poisoning]] amongst the passengers on an airliner could have disastrous consequences. For example, on February 20, 1992, [[shrimp]] tainted with [[cholera]] was served on [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]] [[Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 386|Flight 386]]. An elderly passenger died and other passengers fell ill. For this reason catering firms and airlines have worked together to provide a set of industry guidelines specific to the needs of airline catering. The World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering is offered free of charge by the International Flight Service Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering |url=http://www.ifsachoices.com/WFSG_2010(updated).pdf |year=2010 |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |publisher=International Flight Service Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228042052/http://www.ifsachoices.com/WFSG_2010%28updated%29.pdf |archivedate=December 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Appropriate technology''' is a movement (and its manifestations) encompassing [[technology|technological]] choice and application that is small-scale, [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]], [[environmentally sound]], and [[localism (politics)|locally autonomous]].&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally articulated as '''intermediate technology''' by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher|Dr. Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher]] in his work ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasize the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|accessdate=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appropriate technology has been used to address issues in a wide range of fields. Well-known examples of appropriate technology applications include: bike- and hand-powered water pumps (and other [[self-powered equipment]]), the [[Universal Nut Sheller|universal nut sheller]], self-contained [[solar lamp]]s and [[Solar street light|streetlights]], and [[passive solar building design]]s. Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;A.

Appropriate technology is most commonly discussed in its relationship to [[economic development]] and as an alternative to [[technology transfer]] of more [[Capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive technology from [[industrialized nations]] to [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Akubue/&gt;&lt;ref name=Todaro&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development|year=2003|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=Boston|isbn=0-273-65549-3|pages=252–254|author=Todaro, M.|author2=Smith, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, appropriate technology movements can be found in both developing and developed countries. In developed countries, the appropriate technology movement grew out of the [[energy crisis of the 1970s]] and focuses mainly on environmental and [[sustainability]] issues.&lt;ref name="NCAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncat.org/history|title=The History of NCAT|last=The National Center for Appropriate Technology|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the idea is multifaceted; in some contexts, appropriate technology can be described as the simplest level of technology that can achieve the intended purpose, whereas in others, it can refer to engineering that takes adequate consideration of social and environmental ramifications. The facets are connected through [[robustness]] and [[sustainable living]].

==Background==

===History===

====Predecessors====
Indian ideological leader [[Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] is often cited as the "father" of the appropriate technology movement. Though the concept had not been given a name, Gandhi advocated for small, local and predominantly village-based technology to help India's villages become self-reliant. He disagreed with the idea of technology that benefited a minority of people at the expense of the majority or that put people out of work to increase profit.&lt;ref name=Akubue /&gt; In 1925 Gandhi founded the All-India Spinners Association and in 1935 he retired from politics to form the All-India Village Industries Association. Both organizations focused on village-based technology similar to the future appropriate technology movement.&lt;ref name=mkgandhi&gt;{{cite web|authors=Bombay Sarvodaya Mandal/Gandhi Book Centre and Gandhi Research Foundation|title=Complete Information on Gandhi: Timeline|url=http://www.mkgandhi.org/chrono/under3.htm|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China also implemented policies similar to appropriate technology during the reign of [[Mao Zedong]] and the following [[Cultural Revolution]]. During the Cultural Revolution, development policies based on the idea of "walking on two legs" advocated the development of both large-scale factories and small-scale village industries.&lt;ref name=Akubue /&gt;

====E. F. Schumacher====
Despite these early examples, [[E. F. Schumacher|Dr. Ernst Friedrich "Fritz" Schumacher]] is credited as the founder of the appropriate technology movement. A well-known economist, Schumacher worked for the British National Coal Board for more than 20 years, where he blamed the size of the industry's operations for its uncaring response to the harm [[Black lung disease|black-lung disease]] inflicted on the miners.&lt;ref name=Akubue /&gt; However it was his work with developing countries, such as [[India]] and [[Burma]], which helped Schumacher form the underlying principles of appropriate technology.

Schumacher first articulated the idea of "intermediate technology," now known as appropriate technology, in a 1962 report to the Indian Planning Commission in which he described India as long in labor and short in capital, calling for an "intermediate industrial technology"&lt;ref name=mcrobie&gt;{{cite book|last=McRobie|first=George|title=Small Is Possible|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=0-06-013041-5|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; that harnessed India's labor surplus. Schumacher had been developing the idea of intermediate technology for several years prior to the Planning Commission report. In 1955, following a stint as an economic advisor to the government of Burma, he published the short paper "Economics in a Buddhist Country," his first known critique of the effects of Western economics on developing countries.&lt;ref name=mcrobie /&gt; In addition to Buddhism, Schumacher also credited his ideas to Gandhi.

Initially, Schumacher's ideas were rejected by both the Indian government and leading development economists. Spurred to action over concern the idea of intermediate technology would languish, Schumacher, George McRobie, [[Mansur Hoda]]&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/05/guardianobituaries2], [[The Guardian]] obituary, 5 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Julia Porter brought together a group of approximately 20 people to form the [[Intermediate Technology Development Group]] (ITDG) in May 1965. Later that year, a Schumacher article published in the [[Observer newspaper|Observer]] garnered significant attention and support for the group. In 1967, the group published the ''Tools for Progress: A Guide to Small-scale Equipment for Rural Development'' and sold 7,000 copies. ITDG also formed panels of experts and practitioners around specific technological needs (such as building construction, energy and water) to develop intermediate technologies to address those needs.&lt;ref name=mcrobie /&gt; At a conference hosted by the ITDG in 1968 the term "intermediate technology" was discarded in favor of the term "appropriate technology" used today. Intermediate technology had been criticized as suggesting the technology was inferior to advanced (or high) technology and not including the social and political factors included in the concept put forth by the proponents.&lt;ref name=Akubue /&gt; In 1973, Schumacher described the concept of appropriate technology to a mass audience in his influential work, ''Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered.''...

====Growing trend====
[[Image:RachelAndMachine.jpg|thumb|The [[Universal Nut Sheller]] in use in Uganda, an example of appropriate technology]]
Between 1966 and 1975 the number of new appropriate technology organizations founded each year was three times greater than the previous nine years. There was also an increase in organizations focusing on applying appropriate technology to the problems of industrialized nations, particularly issues related to energy and the environment.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Appropriate Technology|year=1983|publisher=Development Center of the OECD|location=Paris|author=Jequier, N.|author2=Blanc, G.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the OECD identified in its ''Appropriate Technology Directory'' 680 organizations involved in the development and promotion of appropriate technology. By 1980, this number had grown to more than 1,000. International agencies and government departments were also emerging as major innovators in appropriate technology, indicating its progression from a small movement fighting against the established norms to a legitimate technological choice supported by the establishment. For example, the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] created a Committee for the Application of Intermediate Technology in 1976 and the [[World Health Organization]] established the Appropriate Technology for Health Program in 1977.&lt;ref name=OECD /&gt;

Appropriate technology was also increasingly applied in developed countries. For example, the energy crisis of the mid-1970s led to the creation of the [[National Center for Appropriate Technology]] (NCAT) in 1977 with an initial appropriation of 3 million dollars from the U.S. Congress. The Center sponsored appropriate technology demonstrations to "help low-income communities find better ways to do things that will improve the quality of life, and that will be doable with the skills and resources at hand." However, by 1981 the NCAT's funding agency, Community Services Administration, had been abolished. For several decades NCAT worked with the US departments of Energy and Agriculture on contract to develop appropriate technology programs. Since 2005, NCAT's informational web site is no longer funded by the US government.&lt;ref name=ncathistory&gt;{{cite web|last=National Center for Appropriate Technology|title=The History of NCAT|url=http://www.ncat.org/about_history.php|accessdate=24 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514133844/http://www.ncat.org/about_history.php|archivedate=14 May 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline====
In more recent years, the appropriate technology movement has continued to decline in prominence. Germany's German Appropriate Technology Exchange (GATE) and Holland's Technology Transfer for Development (TOOL) are examples of organizations no longer in operation. Recently, a study looked at the continued barriers to AT deployment despite the relatively low cost of transferring information in the internet age. The barriers have been identified as: AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology, technical transferability and robustness of AT, insufficient funding, weak institutional support, and the challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.&lt;ref&gt;I. Zelenika  and J.M. Pearce, "Barriers to Appropriate Technology Growth in Sustainable Development", ''Journal of Sustainable Development'' '''4'''(6), 12–22 (2011). [http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jsd/article/view/12176/9085 free open access].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[free market]]-centric view has also begun to dominate the field. For example, [[Paul Polak]], founder of [[International Development Enterprises]] (an organization that designs and manufactures products that follow the ideals of appropriate technology), declared appropriate technology dead in a 2010 blog post.&lt;ref name=polak&gt;{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=THE DEATH OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY I : IF YOU CAN’T SELL IT DON’T DO IT|url=http://blog.paulpolak.com/?p=376|work=Out of Poverty|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polak argues the "[[design for the other 90 percent]]" movement has replaced appropriate technology. Growing out of the appropriate technology movement, designing for the other 90 percent advocates the creation of low-cost solutions for the 5.8 billion of the world's 6.8 billion population "who have little or no access to most of the products and services many of us take for granted."&lt;ref name=cooperhewittabout&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper–Hewitt Museum|title=Design for the other 90%|url=http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/about/|accessdate=24 April 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070616090946/http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/about/|archive-date=16 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ideas integral to appropriate technology can now be found in the increasingly popular "[[sustainable development]]" movement, which among many tenets advocates technological choice that meets human needs while preserving the environment for future [[generation]]s.&lt;ref name=worldbank1&gt;{{cite web|last=World Bank|title=What is Sustainable Development?|url=http://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/sd.html|accessdate=24 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110506000538/http://www.worldbank.org/depweb/english/sd.html| archivedate= 6 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the OECD published the results of an extensive survey of appropriate technology organizations titled, ''The World of Appropriate Technology,'' in which it defined appropriate technology as characterized by "low investment cost per work-place, low capital investment per unit of output, organizational simplicity, high adaptability to a particular social or cultural environment, sparing use of natural resources, low cost of final product or high potential for employment."&lt;ref name=OECD /&gt; Today, the OECD web site redirects from the "Glossary of Statistical Terms" entry on "appropriate technology" to "environmentally sound technologies."&lt;ref name=OECD2&gt;{{cite web|last=OECD|title=Appropriate Technology|url=http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=122|work=Glossary of Statistical Terms|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations' "Index to Economic and Social Development" also redirects from the "appropriate technology" entry to "sustainable development."&lt;ref name=UNdefinition&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=Appropriate Technology|url=https://www.un.org/esa/subindex/wd15.htm|work=Index to Economic and Social Development|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Potential resurgence====

Despite the decline, several appropriate technology organizations are still in existence, including the ITDG which became [[Practical Action]] after a name change in 2005.&lt;ref name=practicalactionname&gt;{{cite web|last=Practical Action|title=Practical Action is the new name for ITDG|url=http://practicalaction.org/history?id=practicalaction|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://wwws.skat.ch Skat]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Schwierzerische Kontaktstelle für Angepasste Technology) adapted by becoming a private consultancy in 1998, though some Intermediate Technology activities are continued by [https://web.archive.org/web/20131019041042/http://www.skat.ch/foundation Skat Foundation] through the [http://www.rural-water-supply.net/ Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN)]. Another actor still very active is the charity [https://www.ceas.ch CEAS (Centre Ecologique Albert Schweitzer)]. Pioneer in food transformation and solar heaters, it offers vocational training in West Africa and Madagascar. There is also currently a notable resurgence as viewed by the number of groups adopting [[open source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) because of the enabling technology of the Internet. These OSAT groups include: [[Akvo Foundation]], [[Appropedia]], [[Appropriate Technology Collaborative]], [[Catalytic Communities]], [[Centre for Alternative Technology]], Center For Development Alternatives, [[Engineers Without Borders]], [[Open Source Ecology]], [[Practical Action]], and [[Village Earth]]. Most recently [[ASME]], Engineers Without Borders(USA) and the [[IEEE]] have joined together to produce [[Engineering for Change]], which facilitates the development of affordable, locally appropriate and sustainable solutions to the most pressing humanitarian challenges.

===Terminology===
Appropriate technology frequently serves as an umbrella term for a variety names for this type of technology. Frequently these terms are used interchangeably; however, the use of one term over another can indicate the specific focus, [[bias]] or agenda of the technological choice in question. Though the original name for the concept now known as appropriate technology, "intermediate technology" is now often considered a subset of appropriate technology that focuses on technology that is more productive than "inefficient" traditional technologies, but less costly than the technology of industrialized societies.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology in Third World Development|year=1984|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=London|isbn=0-313-24150-3|author=Evans, D.D.|authorlink=Appropriate Technology and Its Role|editor=Ghosh, P. K.|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of technology under the appropriate technology umbrella include:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Capital-saving technology
* Labor-intensive technology
* Alternate technology
* Self-help technology
* Village-level technology
* Community technology
* Progressive technology
* Indigenous technology
* People's technology
* Light-engineering technology
* Adaptive technology
* Light-capital technology
* Soft technology
{{div col end}}

A variety of competing definitions exist in academic literature and organization and government policy papers for each of these terms.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology in Third World Development|year=1984|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=London|isbn=0-313-24150-3|author=Jackson, S.|authorlink=Economically Appropriate Technologies|editor=Ghosh, P.K.|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general consensus is appropriate technology encompasses the ideas represented by the above list. Furthermore, the use of one term over another in referring to an appropriate technology can indicate ideological bias or emphasis on particular economic or social variables. Some terms inherently emphasize the importance of increased employment and labor utilization (such as labor-intensive or capital-saving technology), while others may emphasize the importance of human development (such as self-help and people's technology).&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

It is also possible to distinguish between ''hard'' and ''soft'' technologies. According to Dr. [[Maurice Albertson]] and Audrey Faulkner, appropriate ''hard'' technology is "engineering techniques, physical structures, and machinery that meet a need defined by a community, and utilize the material at hand or readily available. It can be built, operated and maintained by the local people with very limited outside assistance (e.g., technical, material, or financial). it is usually related to an economic goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2007 | title = Teaching Physics Using Appropriate Technology Projects | url = http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHTEAH000045000003000164000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes| journal = The Physics Teacher | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 164–167 | doi=10.1119/1.2709675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albertson and Faulkner consider appropriate ''soft'' technology as technology that deals with "the social structures, human interactive processes, and motivation techniques. It is the structure and process for social participation and action by individuals and groups in analyzing situations, making choices and engaging in choice-implementing behaviors that bring about change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkner | first1 = A.

===Practitioners===
Some of the well known practitioners of the appropriate technology-sector include:
[[B.V. Doshi]],&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/node/5799 and http://www.auroville.org/thecity/architecture/two_at_once.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212193854/http://www.auroville.org/thecity/architecture/two_at_once.htm |date=2008-12-12 }} BV Doshi as AT founder&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[William Moyer]] (1933–2002), [[Amory Lovins]], [[Sanoussi Diakité]], [[Albert Bates]], [[Victor Papanek]], [[Giorgio Ceragioli]] (1930–2008), [[Frithjof Bergmann]], [[Arne Næss]], (1912–2009), and [[Mansur Hoda]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; [[Laurie Baker]].

===Development===
Schumacher's initial concept of intermediate technology was created as a critique of the currently prevailing development strategies which focused on maximizing aggregate economic growth through increases to overall measurements of a country's economy, such as [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref name=jackson /&gt; Developed countries became aware of the situation of developing countries during and in the years following [[World War II]]. Based on the continuing rise in income levels in Western countries since the Industrial Revolution, developed countries embarked on a campaign of massive transfers of capital and technology to developing countries in order to force a rapid industrialization intended to result in an economic "take-off" in the developing countries.&lt;ref name=jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=baron&gt;{{cite book|last=Baron|first=C.|title=Appropriate technology in Third World Development|year=1984|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-24150-3|page=117|editor=Ghosh, P.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the late 1960s it was becoming clear this development method had not worked as expected and a growing number of development experts and national policy makers were recognizing it as a potential cause of increasing poverty and income inequality in developing countries.&lt;ref name=jequier&gt;{{cite book|last=Jequier|first=Nicolas|title=Appropriate Technology: Problems and Promises|year=1976|publisher=[[OECD]] |location=Paris|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, this influx of technology had increased the overall economic capacity of the country. However, it had created a dual or two-tiered economy with pronounced division between the classes. The foreign technology imports were only benefiting a small minority of urban elites. This was also increasing urbanization with the rural poor moving to urban cities in hope of more financial opportunities. The increased strain on urban infrastructures and public services led to "increasing squalor, severe impacts on public health and distortions in the social structure."&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;

Appropriate technology was meant to address four problems: extreme poverty, starvation, unemployment and urban migration. Schumacher saw the main purpose for economic development programs was the eradication of extreme poverty and he saw a clear connection between mass unemployment and extreme poverty. Schumacher sought to shift development efforts from a bias towards urban areas and on increasing the output per laborer to focusing on rural areas (where a majority of the population still lived) and on increasing employment.&lt;ref name=willoughby&gt;{{cite book|last=Willoughby|first=K.W.|title=Technology Choice: A Critique of the Appropriate Technology Movement|year=1990|publisher=Intermediate Technology Publications|location=London|isbn=0-8133-7806-0|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In developed countries===
The term ''appropriate technology'' is also used in developed nations to describe the use of technology and engineering that result in less negative impacts on the environment and society, i.e., technology should be both environmentally sustainable and socially appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 13, "The Design of Environmentally Sustainable and Appropriate Technologies", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes08&gt;Schneider, Keith. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/businessspecial2/26degree.html?scp=2&amp;sq=%22appropriate+technology%22&amp;st=nyt "Majoring in Renewable Energy."] 26 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. F. Schumacher]] asserts that such technology, described in the book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[E. F. Schumacher|Schumacher, E. F.]]; ''Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered: 25 Years Later...With Commentaries''. [[Hartley &amp; Marks Publishers]] {{ISBN|0-88179-169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; tends to promote values such as [[health]], [[beauty]] and permanence, in that order.

Often the type of appropriate technology that is used in developed countries is "appropriate and sustainable technology" (AST),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mcedc.colorado.edu/research |title=Research &amp;#124; Mortenson Center &amp;#124; University of Colorado Boulder |work=mcedc.colorado.edu |year=2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; appropriate technology that, besides being functional and relatively cheap (though often more expensive than true AT), is durable and employs [[renewable resource]]s. AT does not include this (see [[Sustainable design]]).

==Applications==

===Building and construction===
In order to increase the efficiency of a great number of city services (efficient water provisioning, efficient electricity provisioning, easy traffic flow, water drainage, decreased spread of disease with [[epidemic]]s, ...), the city itself must first be built correctly. In the developing world, many cities are expanding rapidly and new ones are being built. Looking into the [[urban planning|cities design]] in advance is a must for every developing nation.

{{Further|Earth structure|Autonomous building|Earthship}}
* [[Adobe]] (including the variation called [[Super Adobe]]),
* [[Rammed earth]],
* [[Compressed earth block]],
* [[Animal]] products,
* [[Cob (building)|Cob]]
* and/or other [[Green building#Green building materials|green building materials]] could be considered appropriate earth building technology for much of the developing world, as they make use of materials which are widely available locally and are thus relatively inexpensive.

The local context must be considered as, for example, [[mudbrick]] may not be durable in a high rainfall area (although a large roof overhang and [[cement]] stabilisation can be used to correct for this), and, if the materials are not readily available, the method may be inappropriate. Other forms of [[natural building]] may be considered appropriate technology, though in many cases the emphasis is on [[Sustainable architecture|sustainability]] and self-sufficiency rather than affordability or suitability. As such, many buildings are also built to function as [[autonomous building]]s (e.g. [[earthship]]s, ...). One example of an organisation that applies appropriate earthbuilding techniques would be [[Builders Without Borders]].

The building structure must also be considered. Cost-effectiveness is an important issue in projects based around appropriate technology, and one of the most efficient designs herein is the [[public housing]] approach. This approach lets everyone have their own [[Condominium|sleeping/recreation space]], yet incorporate communal spaces e.g. [[mess hall]]s, [[latrine]]s, public showers, ...

In addition, to decrease costs of operation (heating, cooling, ...) techniques as [[Earth sheltering]], [[Trombe wall]]s, ... are often incorporated.

Organizations as [[Architecture for Humanity]] also follows principles consistent with appropriate technology, aiming to serve the needs of poor and disaster-affected people.

[[Image:Chunche.jpg|thumb|''[[Chunche]]'', naturally ventilated sheds for drying [[raisin]]s in [[Xinjiang]]]]
* [[Natural ventilation]] can be created by providing vents in the upper level of a building to allow warm air to rise by [[convection]] and escape to the outside, while cooler air is drawn in through vents at the lower level.
* Electrical powered fans (e.g. [[ceiling fan]]s) allow efficient cooling, at a far lower electricity consumption as airconditioning systems.
* A [[solar chimney]] often referred to as ''thermal chimney'' improves this natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] by using [[convection]] of [[air]] heated by [[passive solar building design|passive solar energy]]. To further maximize the cooling effect, the incoming air may be led through [[Earth cooling tubes|underground ducts]] before it is allowed to enter the building.
* A [[windcatcher]] (''Badgir''; بادگیر) is a traditional [[Iran|Persian]] [[Persian architecture|architectural device]] used for many centuries to create natural ventilation in buildings. It is not known who first invented the windcatcher, but it still can be seen in many countries today. Windcatchers come in various designs, such as the uni-directional, bi-directional, and multi-directional.
* A [[Solar chimney#Passive down-draft cooltower|passive down-draft cooltower]] may be used in a hot, arid climate to provide a sustainable way to provide [[air conditioning]]. Water is allowed to evaporate at the top of a tower, either by using evaporative cooling pads or by spraying water. [[Evaporation]] cools the incoming air, causing a [[downdraft]] of cool air that will bring down the temperature inside the building.

===Agriculture===
Appropriate technology has been applied extensively to improve agricultural production in developing countries. In the United States, the [[National Center for Appropriate Technology]] operates ATTRA (attra.ncat.org), a national [[sustainable agriculture]] assistance program.

[[Image:Pump-tah.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hand-operated, reciprocating, positive displacement, water pump in [[Košice]]-[[Tahanovce]], [[Slovakia]] (walking beam pump).]]

As of 2006, waterborne diseases are estimated to cause 1.8 million deaths each year while about 1.1 billion people lack proper drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/safewater/publications_pages/fact_sheets/WW4.pdf "Safe Water System,"] US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] Fact Sheet, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water generally needs treatment before use, depending on the source and the intended use (with high standards required for drinking water). The quality of water from household connections and community water points in low-income countries is not reliably safe for direct human consumption. Water extracted directly from surface waters and open hand-dug shallow wells nearly always requires treatment.

Appropriate technology options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale point-of-use (POU) designs.

The most reliable way to kill microbial pathogenic agents is to heat water to a rolling boil.&lt;ref&gt;WHO's Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality&lt;/ref&gt; Other techniques, such as varying forms of filtration, chemical disinfection, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation (including solar UV) have been demonstrated in an array of randomized control trials to significantly reduce levels of waterborne disease among users in low-income countries.

Over the past decade, an increasing number of field-based studies have been undertaken to determine the success of POU measures in reducing waterborne disease. The ability of POU options to reduce disease is a function of both their ability to remove microbial pathogens if properly applied and such social factors as ease of use and cultural appropriateness. Technologies may generate more (or less) health benefit than their lab-based microbial removal performance would suggest.

The current priority of the proponents of POU treatment is to reach large numbers of low-income households on a sustainable basis. Few POU measures have reached significant scale thus far, but efforts to promote and commercially distribute these products to the world's poor have only been under way for a few years.

On the other hand, small-scale water treatment is reaching increasing fractions of the population in low-income countries, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, in the form of water treatment kiosks (also known as water refill stations or packaged water producers). While quality control and quality assurance in such locations may be variable, sophisticated technology (such as multi-stage particle filtration, UV irradiation, ozonation, and membrane filtration) is applied with increasing frequency. Such microenterprises are able to vend water at extremely low prices, with increasing government regulation. Initial assessments of vended water quality are encouraging.

Whether applied at the household or community level, some examples of specific treatment processes include:
* [[Ceramic water filter|Porous ceramic filtration]], using either clay or [[diatomaceous earth]], and oriented as either cylinder, pot, or disk, with gravity-fed or siphon-driven delivery systems. Silver is frequently added to provide antimicrobial enhancement
* Intermittently operated [[Slow sand filter|slow-sand filtration]], also known as biosand filtration
* [[Water chlorination|Chlorine disinfection]], employing calcium hypochlorite powder, sodium hypochlorite solution, or sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets
* [[Flocculation|Chemical flocculation]], using either commercially produced iron or aluminum salts or the crushed seeds of certain plants, such as [[Moringa oleifera]]. Recent work has shown even table salt (NaCl) is effective at removing high-activity clays for solar water disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;B. Dawney and J.M. Pearce "Optimizing Solar Water Disinfection (SODIS) Method by Decreasing Turbidity with NaCl", ''The Journal of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for Development'' 2(2) pp. 87-94 (2012). [https://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1590504/Optimizing_the_solar_water_disinfection_SODIS_method_by_decreasing_turbidity_with_NaCl open access]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Solar water disinfection|Irradiation with ultraviolet light]], whether using electric-powered lamps or direct solar exposure such as with the [[SODIS]] method
* Mixed flocculation/disinfection using commercially produced powdered mixtures
* membrane filtration, employing [[ultrafiltration]] or [[reverse osmosis]] filter elements preceded by pretreatment

Some appropriate technology water supply measures include:
* [[Water well|Deep wells with submersible pumps]] in areas where the groundwater (aquifers) are located at depths &gt;10 m.
* [[Shallow wells]] with lined walls and covers.
* [[Rainwater harvesting]] systems with an appropriate method of storage, especially in areas with significant dry seasons.
* [[Fog collection]], which is suitable for areas which experience fog even when there is little rain.
* [[Air well (condenser)|Air wells]], a structure or device designed to promote the condensation of atmospheric moisture. 
* Handpumps and treadle pumps are generally only an option in areas is located at a relatively shallow depth (e.g. 10 m). The [http://www.flexipump.net/ Flexi-Pipe Pump] is a notable exception to this (up to 25 meters). For deeper aquifers (&lt;10 m), The [[Rope pump]] and [[Water well|submersible pumps placed inside a well]] can be used. Treadle pumps for household irrigation are now being distributed on a widespread basis in developing countries. The principle of [[VLOM (pumps)|Village Level Operation and Maintenance]] is important with handpumps, but may be difficult in application.
* Condensation bags and condensation pits can be an appropriate technology to get water, yet yields are low and are (for the amount of water obtained), labour-intensive. Still, it may be a good (very cheap) solution for certain desperate communities.
* The [[hippo water roller]] and Q-drum allow more water to be carried, with less effort and could thus be a good alternative for ethnic communities who do not wish to give up water gathering from remote locations, assuming low topographic relief.
* The [[roundabout playpump]], developed and used in southern [[Africa]], harnesses the energy of children at play to pump water.

====Sanitation====
{{Main|Sanitation}}

Poor sanitation is a major issue for a large proportion of the human population, with about 2.5 billion people lacking even the most basic forms of sanitation and more than a billion people worldwide practising [[open defecation]] in 2015 according to the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access to sanitation|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/sanitation.shtml|website=UN - Water for life decade|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO and UNICEF [https://web.archive.org/web/20120328173008/http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-report-2012-en.pdf ''Progress on Drinking-water and Sanitation: 2012 Update''], WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of appropriate technology influenced the provision of sanitation systems for many years. However, since about the early 2000s there has been a departure from a focus on simplistic 'one-size-fits-all' sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="MurphyMcBean2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Heather M.|last2=McBean|first2=Edward A.|last3=Farahbakhsh|first3=Khosrow|title=Appropriate technology – A comprehensive approach for water and sanitation in the developing world|journal=Technology in Society|volume=31|issue=2|year=2009|pages=158–167|issn=0160-791X|doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2009.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;SuSanA (2008). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/267 Towards more sustainable sanitation solutions - SuSanA Vision Document]. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)&lt;/ref&gt; As conditions vary, sanitation systems also need to vary to meet the needs of the users and other [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Technologies for sanitation provision, such as [[toilet]]s, are important but only one piece of the puzzle. Sanitation needs to be regarded as a system that includes technical and non-technical aspects, such as [[behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] and management as well as political aspects – the enabling environment.&lt;ref name="Sandec"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies - (2nd Revised Edition) |author= Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=Lüthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbrügg, C. |publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall aim should be to achieve a [[sustainable sanitation]] system. One option of achieving that aim can be the [[ecological sanitation]] approach which focuses on safe [[reuse of excreta]].

It is impossible to name all possible sanitation technologies that may fall under the category of "appropriate technologies" but some common systems which might be considered to be "appropriate" include:
* [[Dry toilet]]s as they save on flushing water and may allow the nutrients of the excreta to be reused in agriculture (e.g. for fertilising crops). Two examples of dry toilets are [[composting toilet]]s and [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s.
* [[Constructed wetlands]] which can treat [[wastewater]] and [[greywater]] and require only little electrical power.
* The SanPlat is a simple plate that can be used to cover the hole in the ground of [[pit latrines]] making them potentially more easy to clean and maintain.&lt;ref name="sanplat"&gt;{{cite web|last=The SanPlat System|title=The SanPlat System|url=http://www.sanplat.se/index.php|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usaid-hip"&gt;{{cite web|last=USAID-HIP|title=Success Story: Expanding SanPlat Coverage|url=http://www.hip.watsan.net/redir/content/download/4700/27123/file/SanPlat%20Success%20Story%20HIP%202010.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Arborloo]] which is a very simple low-cost type of composting toilet suitable for rural areas.

===Energy generation and uses===
{{Further|Microgeneration|Remote-area power supply}}

The term [[soft energy technology]] was coined by [[Amory Lovins]] to describe "appropriate" renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;Soft energy paths: toward a durable peace. San Francisco: Friends of the Earth International; Cambridge, Mass: Ballinger Pub. Co., 1977&lt;/ref&gt;
"Appropriate" energy technologies are especially suitable for isolated and/or small scale energy needs. Electricity can be provided from:
* [[solar cell|Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels]], and (large) [[Concentrating solar power]] plants. PV solar panels made from [[low-cost photovoltaic cell]]s or PV-cells which have first been concentrated by a [[Luminescent solar concentrator]]-panel are also a good option. Especially companies as [http://www.solfocus.com/en/technology/ Solfocus] make appropriate technology CSP plants which can be made from waste plastics polluting the surroundings (see above).
* [[Solar thermal collector]]
* [[wind power]] (home do-it yourself turbines and larger-scale)
* [[micro hydro]], and [[pico hydro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |title=Micro hydro in the fight against poverty |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730205707/http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1636&amp;lang=English |archivedate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* human-powered handwheel generators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tinytechindia.com/handwheelgenerator.htm |title=Human powered handwheel generators example |publisher=Tinytechindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611144743/http://www.tinytechindia.com/handwheelgenerator.htm |archive-date=2012-06-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* other [[Zero emission|zero emission generation methods]]

Some intermediate technologies include:
* Bioalcohols as bioethanol, biomethanol and [[biobutanol]]. The first two require minor modifications to allow them to be used in conventional gasoline engines. The third requires no modifications at all.
* V[[vegetable oil|egetable oil]]s which can be used only in internal combustion (Diesel) engines. [[Biofuel]]s are locally available in many developing countries and can be cheaper than [[fossil fuel]]s.
* [[Anaerobic digestion]] power plants
* [[Biogas]] is another potential source of energy, particularly where there is an abundant supply of [[waste]] [[organic matter]]. A generator (running on biofuels) can be run more efficiently if combined with batteries and an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]; this adds significantly to [[capital cost]] but reduces running cost, and can potentially make this a much cheaper option than the solar, wind and micro-hydro options.
* [[Dry animal dung fuel]] can also be used. 
* [[Biochar]] is another similar energy source which can be obtained through charring of certain types of organic material (e.g. hazelnut shells, bamboo, chicken manure, ...) in a pyrolysis unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomassauthority.com/a/precer-bioracer-biomass-car/ |title=Biochar burner/stirling engine setup |publisher=Biomassauthority.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar energy source is [[terra preta nova]].

Finally, [[urine]] can also be used as a basis to generate hydrogen (which is an energy carrier). Using urine, [[hydrogen production]] is 332% more energy efficient than using water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news165836803.html |title=Hydrogen from urine |publisher=Physorg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity distribution could be improved so to make use of a more [[grid plan|structured electricity line arrangement]] and universal [[AC power plugs and sockets#Type E and F hybrid|AC power plugs and sockets]] (e.g. the CEE 7/7 plug). In addition, a universal system of electricity provisioning (e.g. universal voltage, frequency, ampère; e.g. 230&amp;nbsp;V with 50&amp;nbsp;Hz), as well as perhaps a better [[Mains power systems|mains power system]] (e.g. through the use of special systems as perfected [[single-wire earth return]]s; e.g. Tunisia's MALT-system, which features low costs and easy placement)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruralpower.org/ |title=SWER-mains electricity system advantages |publisher=Ruralpower.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721203640/http://www.ruralpower.org/ |archive-date=2012-07-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/product_info.php?products_id=293 |title=Description of Tunisia's MALT-system |publisher=Practicalaction.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity storage (which is required for autonomous energy systems) can be provided through appropriate technology solutions as deep-cycle and car-[[battery (electricity)|batteries]] (intermediate technology), long duration flywheels, electrochemical capacitors, compressed air energy storage (CAES), liquid nitrogen and pumped hydro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.etown.edu/m/mcbridet/Research/McBrideIRESNov2007Presentation%20trim.ppt Appropriate energy storage by Troy McBride] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226051936/http://users.etown.edu/m/mcbridet/Research/McBrideIRESNov2007Presentation%20trim.ppt |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many solutions for the developing world are sold as a single package, containing a (micro) electricity generation power plant and energy storage. Such packages are called remote-area power supply

[[Image:Ampoules.jpg|thumb|right|150px|LED Lamp with GU10 twist lock fitting, intended to replace [[Incandescent lamp#Halogen lamps|halogen]] reflector lamps.]]
* White [[LED]]s and a source of [[renewable energy]] (such as [[solar cell]]s) are used by the [[Light Up the World Foundation]] to provide lighting to poor people in remote areas, and provide significant benefits compared to the [[kerosene lamp]]s which they replace. Certain other companies as [[Powerplus]] also have [http://www.powerplus.nl/contents/media/l_solar_light_rond.JPG LED-flashlights with imbedded solar cells].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerplus.nl/ |title=Powerplus Stingray |publisher=Powerplus.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Organic LED]]s made by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090414054835/http://cleantech.com/news/2582/ge-shows-how-to-roll-out-oleds roll-to-roll production] are another source of cheap light that will be commercially available at low cost by 2015.
* [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s (as well as regular [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED lamp|LED-lightbulbs]]) can also be used as appropriate technology. Although they are less environmentally friendly then LED-lights, they are cheaper and still feature relative high efficiency (compared to incandescent lamps).
* The [[Safe bottle lamp]] is a safer [[kerosene lamp]] designed in Sri Lanka. Lamps as these allow relative long, mobile, lighting. The safety comes from a secure screw-on metal lid, and two flat sides which prevent it from rolling if knocked over. An alternative to fuel or oil-based lanterns is the Uday lantern, developed by Philips as part of its [[Lighting Africa]] project (sponsored by the World Bank Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PennWell Corporation |url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/5/7/10 |title=Uday lamp and lighting africa project description |publisher=Ledsmagazine.com |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Faraday flashlight]] is a LED flashlight which operates on a capacitor. Recharging can be done by manual winching or by shaking, hereby avoiding the need of any supplementary electrical system.
* [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID-lamps]] finally can be used for lighting operations where regular LED-lighting or other lamps will not suffice. Examples are car headlights. Due to their high efficiency, they are quite environmental, yet costly, and they still require polluting materials in their production process.

===Transportation===
[[Image:Person mit fahrrad feb07.jpg|thumb|150px|A man uses a bicycle to cargo goods in [[Ouagadougou]], Burkina Faso (2007)]]
[[Human-powered transport|Human powered-vehicles]] include the [[bicycle]] (and the future [[Bamboo Bike Project|bamboo bicycle]]), which provides general-purpose transportation at lower costs compared to motorized vehicles, and many advantages over walking, and the [[whirlwind wheelchair]], which provides mobility for disabled people who cannot afford the expensive wheelchairs used in developed countries. [[Animal-powered transport|Animal powered vehicles/transport]] may also be another appropriate technology.
Certain [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s may be considered appropriate transportation technology, including [[compressed air car]]s, [[liquid nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen-powered]] vehicles. Also, vehicles with internal combustion engines may be converted to hydrogen or oxyhydrogen combustion.

Bicycles can also be applied to commercial transport of goods to and from remote areas. An example of this is Karaba, a free-trade coffee co-op in Rwanda, which uses 400 modified bicycles to carry hundreds of pounds of coffee beans for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://usingbicycles.blogspot.com/2008/07/video-hauling-coffee-in-rwanda.html | title = Coffee Cargo Bikes in Rwanda | work = Using Bicycles | author = Sherwood Stranieri | date = 24 July 2008 | accessdate = 1 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects for developing countries include the redesign of cycle rickshaws to convert them to electric power.&lt;ref name="Wired-solar-rickshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2008/10/solar-powered-r/|title=Solar Rickshaws Hit the Streets of Delhi|last=Demerjian|first=Dave|date=2008-10-21|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solekshwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/press-release08/solekshwa-launched.htm |title="Solekshwa" Eco-Friendly Dual-Powered Rickshaw Launched |date=2008-10-02 |publisher=Ministry of Science and Technology (India) |author=Press Information Bureau |accessdate=29 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418032252/http://dst.gov.in/whats_new/press-release08/solekshwa-launched.htm |archivedate=18 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However recent reports suggest that these rickshaws are not plying on the roads.&lt;ref name="Solar rickshaws finds no takers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/100289/csirs-solar-rickshaw-finds-no.html|title=Solar rickshaws find no takers&amp;#124;Deccan Herald article|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
According to the [[Global Health Council]], rather than the use of professionally schooled doctors, the training of villagers to remedy most maladies in towns in the developing world is most appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/12/community-doctors/rosenberg-text/2 |title=Use of villagers rather than doctors |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trained villagers are able to eliminate 80% of the health problems. Small (low-cost) hospitals&amp;nbsp;– based on the model of the Jamkhed hospital&amp;nbsp;– can remedy another 15%, while only 5% will need to go to a larger (more expensive) hospital.
* Before being able to determine the cause of the disease or malady, accurate diagnosis is required. This may be done manually (through observation, inquiries) and by specialized tools.
* A [[phase-change incubator]], developed in the late 1990s, is a low-cost way for health workers to incubate microbial samples.
* [[Birth control]] is also seen as an appropriate technology, especially now, because of increasing population numbers (overpopulating certain areas), increasing food prices and poverty. It has been proposed to a certain degree by PATH (program for appropriate technology in health).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/367/36/ |title=PATH proposing birth control as appropriate technology |publisher=Physiciansforlife.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409155651/http://www.physiciansforlife.org/content/view/367/36/ |archive-date=2012-04-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewelltimedperiod.blogspot.com/2007/03/barrier-birth-control-methods.html |title=PATH working on devices for birth control |publisher=Thewelltimedperiod.blogspot.com |date=2007-03-04 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jaipur leg]] was developed by Dr. P. K. Sethi and Masterji Ram Chander in 1968 as an inexpensive prosthetic leg for victims of landmine explosions.
* The [[Leveraged Freedom Chair]] is a low-cost wheelchair designed specifically for rough terrain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gogrit.org/lfc/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930004709/http://gogrit.org/lfc/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-30 |title=Leveraged Freedom Chair |publisher=Gogrit.org |date=2012-06-11 |accessdate=2012-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Natural cleaning products can be used for personal hygiene and cleaning of clothing and eating utensils; in order to decrease illnesses/maladies (as they eliminate a great amount of pathogens).

Note that many Appropriate Technologies benefit [[public health]], in particular by providing [[sanitation]] and safe drinking water. Refrigeration may also provide a health benefit. (These are discussed in the following paragraphs.) This was too found at the [[Comprehensive Rural Health Project]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/12/community-doctors/follow-up-text |title=NGM Necessary angels |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Women Health Volunteers projects in countries as Iran, Iraq and Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR19/FMR1921.pdf |title=Women Health Volunteers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food preparation and storage===
{{Further|Grow house}}
Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include [[urban horticulture|urban gardening]] (indoors and outdoors).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Grow house|Indoor cultivation]] may be set up using [[hydroponics]] with [[Grow light]]s, while outdoor cultivation may be done using [[permaculture]], [[forest gardening]], [[no-till farming]], [[Do Nothing Farming]], etc. In order to better control the [[irrigation]] outdoors, special irrigation systems may be created as well (although this increases costs, and may again open the door to cultivating non-indigenous plants; something which is best avoided).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
One such system for the developing world is discussed here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isf-iai.be/index.php?id=17&amp;L=2 |title=ISF&amp;nbsp;— Ingénieurs Sans Frontières au service du développement durable des territoires |publisher=Isf-iai.be |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crop production tools are best kept simple (reduces operating difficulty, cost, replacement difficulties and pollution, when compared to motorized equipment). Tools can include [[scythe]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/Agriculturaltools.php The scythe, an intermediate technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003075303/http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/Agriculturaltools.php |date=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; animal-pulled [[plows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isf-iai.be/index.php?id=17&amp;L=2 |title=plows |publisher=Isf-iai.be |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although no-till farming should be preferred),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/Agriculturaltools.php AT Plows] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803075351/http://www.villageearth.org/pages/Appropriate_Technology/ATSourcebook/Agriculturaltools.php |date=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dibber]]s, wheeled [[auger (drill)|auger]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/sb021277/Pages/Nederlands/Pflanzfuchs/PF.html |title=Pflanzfuchs wheeled auger |publisher=Users.skynet.be |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotomec.com/english/products/mole/mole.html |title=3-point hitch augers for tractors |publisher=Rotomec.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for planting large trees), [[kirpi]]s, [[hoe (tool)|hoes]], ...

[[Greenhouse]]s are also sometimes included (see Earthship Biotincture).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Sometimes they are also fitted with irrigation systems, and/or [[heat sink]]-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouse starts to cool down).

According to proponents, Appropriate Technologies can greatly reduce the labor required to prepare food, compared to traditional methods, while being much simpler and cheaper than the processing used in Western countries. This reflects [[E.F. Schumacher]]'s concept of "intermediate technology," i.e. technology which is significantly more effective and expensive than traditional methods, but still an order of magnitude (10 times) cheaper than developed world technology. Key examples are:
* the [[Malian peanut sheller]]
* the [[fonio husking machine]]
* the [[screenless hammer mill]]
* the [http://www.isf-iai.be/index.php?id=17&amp;L=2 ISF corn mill]
* the [http://www.isf-iai.be/index.php?id=17&amp;L=2 ISF rice huller]
* all other types of electrical or hand-operated [[kitchen]] equipment (grinders, cutters, ...) Special multifunctional kitchen robots that are able to perform several functions (e.g. grinding, cutting, and even vacuum cleaning and polishing) are able to reduce costs even more. Examples of these devices were e.g. the (now discontinued) [[Piccolo]] household appliance from Hammelmann Werke (previously based in Bad Kissingen.) It was equipped with a flexible axis, allowing a variety of aids to be screwed on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqbook.de/boox/domdey/4332.shtml Piccolo Hilft der Hausfrau] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215051537/http://www.antiqbook.de/boox/domdey/4332.shtml |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/2421132 |title=Electro As Piccolo |publisher=Liveauctioneers.com |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2012-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819130832/http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/2421132 |archive-date=2012-08-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Solar-Panel-Cooker-in-front-of-hut.jpg|thumb|right|In Ghana, Zouzugu villagers use solar cookers for preparing their meals]]
* [[Solar cooker]]s are appropriate to some settings, depending on climate and cooking style. They are emission-less and very low-cost. Hybrid variants also exist that incorporate a second heating source such as electrical heating or wood-based.
* [[Hot plate]]s are 100% electrical, fairly low cost (around €20) and are mobile. They do however require an electrical system to be present in the area of operation.
* [[Rocket stove]]s and certain other woodstoves (e.g. Philips Woodstove&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.philips.com/newscenter/archive/2006/060227-woodstove.html |title=Philips woodstove |publisher=Research.philips.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;) improve fuel efficiency, and reduce harmful indoor air pollution. The stoves however still make use of wood. However, [[briquette]] makers can now [[waste-to-energy|turn organic waste into fuel]], saving money and/or collection time, and preserving forests.
* [[Solar refrigerator|Solar]], special [[Einstein refrigerator]]s and thermal mass [[refrigerators]] reduce the amount of electricity required. Also, solar and special Einstein refrigerators do not use haloalkanes (which play a key role in ozone depletion), but use heat pumps or mirrors instead. Solar refrigerators have been built for developing nations by Sopology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin LaMonica |url=http://news.cnet.com/Hawaiian-firm-shrinks-solar-thermal-power/2100-11392_3-6207877.html |title=Solar refrigerators for developing world |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenoptimistic.com/2008/09/21/einstein-fridge/ |title=Optimized Einstein Fridge |publisher=Greenoptimistic.com |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pot-in-pot refrigerator]] is an African invention which keeps things cool without electricity. It provides a way to keep food and produce fresh for much longer than would otherwise be possible. This can be a great benefit to the families who use the device. For example, it is claimed that girls who had to regularly sell fresh produce in the market can now go to school instead, as there is less urgency to sell the produce before it loses freshness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdg.org/html/agro_processing/docs29/FC29_34.pdf "Development of a low-cost cooler to preserve perishable foods in countries with arid climates"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040205014224/http://www.itdg.org/html/agro_processing/docs29/FC29_34.pdf |date=2004-02-05 }}, ITDG Food Chain Journal, 29 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information and communication technologies===
{{See also|Information and communication technologies for development}}
[[Image:ASUS Eee White Alt-small.png|thumb|right|[[Netbook]]s such as the [[Asus Eee PC]] accommodate low-cost information sharing and communication]]
* The [[OLPC XO]], [[Simputer]], [[Asus Eee PC]], and other low-cost computers are computers aimed at developing countries. Besides the low price, other characteristics include resistance to dust, reliability and use of the target language.
* Eldis OnDisc and [[The Appropriate Technology Library]] are projects that use [[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s to give access to development information in areas without reliable and affordable internet access.
* The [[wind-up radio]] and the computer and communication system planned by the [[Jhai Foundation]] are independent from power supply.
* There is also [[GrameenPhone]], which fused mobile telephony with [[Grameen Bank]]'s microfinance program to give Bangladeshi villagers access to communication.
* [[Mobile telephony]] is appropriate technology for many developing countries, as it greatly reduces the [[infrastructure]] required to achieve widespread coverage. However, [[mobile phone]] network may not always be available (it depends on the location) and may not always provide both voice and data services.
* [[Loband]], a website developed by [[Aptivate]], strips all the photographic and other bandwidth-intensive content from webpages and renders them as simple text, while otherwise allowing one to [[web browsing|browse]] them normally. The site greatly increasing the speed of browsing, and is appropriate for use on low bandwidth connections as generally available in much of the developing world.
* An increasing number of activists provide free or very inexpensive [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[e-mail|email]] services using cooperative computer networks that run wireless [[mobile ad hoc network|ad hoc networks]]. Network service is provided by a cooperative of neighbors, each operating a router as a household appliance. These minimize wired infrastructure, and its costs and vulnerabilities. Private [[Internet protocol]] networks set up in this way can operate without the use of a commercial provider.
* Rural electrical grids can be wired with "optical phase cable", in which one or more of the [[steel]] [[wikt:armor|armor]] wires are replaced with steel tubes containing [[fiber optics]].&lt;ref&gt;Northern Economics Inc. and Electric Power Systems Inc. April 2001.

Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development, via dced.state.ak.us. Retrieved on 16 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Satellite Internet access]] can provide high speed connectivity to remote locations, however these are significantly more expensive than wire-based or terrestrial wireless systems. [[Wimax]] and forms of [[packet radio]] can also be used. Depending on the speed and latency of these networks they may be capable of relaying [[VoIP]] traffic, negating the need for separate telephony services. Finally, the [[Internet Radio Linking Project]] provides potential for blending older (cheap) local radio broadcasting with the increased range of the internet.
* [[Satellite phone|satellite]]-based telephone systems can also be used, as either fixed installations or portable handsets and can be integrated into a [[PABX]] or local IP-based network.

===Finance===
Through financial systems envisioned especially for the poor/developed world, many companies have been able to get started with only limited capital. Often banks lend the money to people wishing to start a business (such as with [[microfinance]]). In other systems, people for a [[Rotating Savings and Credit Association]] or ROSCA to purchase costly material together (such as [[Tontine]]s and [[Susu account]]s). Organisations, communities, cities or individuals can provide loans to other communities/cities (such as with the approach followed by [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110601214010/http://microloans.worldvision.org.uk/ World Vision Microloans] [[MicroPlace]] and [[LETS]]). Finally, in certain communities (usually isolated communities such as small islands or oases) everything of value is shared. This is called [[gift economy]].

==Determining a sustainable approach==
Features such as low cost, low usage of [[fossil fuels]] and use of locally available resources can give some advantages in terms of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name=EJSD&gt;

Use of these cities' waste material allows the gathering of a huge amount of building material at a low cost. When obtained, the materials may be recycled over and over in the own city/community, using the [[cradle to cradle design]] method. Locations where waste can be found include [[landfill]]s, [[Wreck yard|junkyards]], on water surfaces and anywhere around towns or near highways. Organic waste that can be reused to fertilise plants can be found in sewages. Also, town districts and other places (e.g. [[Cemetery|cemeteries]]) that are subject of undergoing renovation or removal can be used for gathering materials as stone, concrete, or potassium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8325">The '''Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator''' (also known as the Aurora flash x-ray simulator) is a 14 TW flash gamma-ray simulator that was designed to simulate the effects of a nuclear weapon’s [[bremsstrahlung]], or [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], pulses on military electronic systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weidenheimer|first=D.M.|last2=Pereira|first2=N.R.|last3=Judy|first3=D.C.|date=June 1991|title=Aurora Synchronization Improvement|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA639246|journal=Berkeley Research Associates|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerris|first=Klaus|date=March 1976|title=The AURORA Dosimetry System|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA025136|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1971 by the U.S. Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), which eventually became the [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitze|first=Karen|date=2013|title=Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619090333/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/md/md1400/md1450/data/md1450data.pdf|journal=Historic American Engineering Record|volume=|pages=|via=Internet Archive WayBack Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 161 feet long and weighing at 1,450 tons, the Aurora Simulator was the first gamma radiation simulator of its size in the world at the time. It was also one of only four large machines in the United States that were built specifically to test complete nuclear weapons packages, with the other three being the Hermes I to III simulators at [[Sandia Base]], New Mexico. Situated at the [[Harry Diamond Laboratories]] (which later became a part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]]) in Adelphi, Maryland, it was used to test complete weapons electronics packages from the warheads of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]] to satellites. After more than 20 years of use during the Cold War, the Aurora Simulator was officially decommissioned and disassembled in 1996.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1986, the Aurora facility set the world record for the largest amount of high-power microwave power generated from a virtual cathode oscillator. As a result, HDL was recognized by the [[American Defense Preparedness Association|American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA)]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=history+of+army+research+lab+aurora&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimr4371OfbAhWRtlkKHSmZA8AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
Following the use of the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]] in World War II, studies on flash radiography found that field emission flash x-rays, which were previously used to analyze explosions, could simulate radiation from a nuclear bomb. Given this realization, the U.S. military began to prioritize the development of flash x-ray machines to test parts of missile packages during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

After the Soviet Union demonstrated the use of the world’s first [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic missiles (ABM)]] in 1964, DASA launched a series of projects in response that aimed to hasten the advancement of nuclear effects laboratories in the United States. The U.S. military was concerned that the introduction and subsequent nuclear explosion of Soviet AMBs into the airspace would increase the likelihood of the resulting radiation interfering with the electronics systems of inbound U.S. ICBMs. In order to [[Radiation hardening|thoroughly harden]] U.S. missiles, DASA initiated the construction of the Aurora Simulator as well as a full-threat level facility that engaged in gamma radiation testing and missile refinement in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When selecting the site for the Aurora facility, DASA wanted the gamma radiation simulator to be situated at an existing military laboratory. After much deliberation between the [[Air Force Weapons Laboratory|Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL)]] in New Mexico and the Army and Navy laboratories in the Washington, D.C. area, DASA chose the latter and granted the Harry Diamond Laboratory (HDL) the responsibility of operating the facility. In order to house the Aurora Simulator, HDL moved from its downtown Washington, D.C. site to an area of land in White Oak, Maryland, which would eventually become the now-present Adelphi.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The cooperation between DASA and HDL on the Aurora project led to many HDL researchers becoming involved in the simulator’s development, including assistant to DASA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Peter Haas and former participant in the Manhattan Project Paul Caldwell, who later was placed in charge of the Aurora Simulator. In turn, Caldwell hired physicist Alexander Stewart from Ion Physics (IP) and HDL’s Robert Lamb and Dennis Whittaker, the four of whom (including Caldwell) made up the bulk of the research and development team for the Aurora project. The construction of the Aurora Simulator was completed on January 1971, costing about $16 million, and the first test was conducted on the Spartan ABM flight control set in April 1972. Throughout its entire run at HDL, which ended in 1995, the Aurora Simulator conducted 287 numbered tests, resulting in more than 9,100 test shots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Operation ==
The Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator consisted of four 14 MV [[Marx generator|Marx generators]], each of which contained four parallel 1.25 MJ units connected together to drive four parallel oil-dielectric [[Blumlein generator|Blumlein pulse-forming lines (PFLs)]]. Each PFL was coupled with an [[Electron-beam processing|E-beam]] diode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Aurora Simulator emitted four short pulses of high energy bremsstrahlung radiation that overlapped to deliver a single 120 ns wide pulse of 20 to 50 krads (Si) into a 1m cube. It could also deliver 25 krads (Si) throughout a 1m diameter and 1m long cylindrical volume or 50 krads (Si) throughout a 25cm sphere. What made the Aurora Simulator unique was its ability to provide an extremely high volumetric dose output. Due to this large irradiation volume, dose measurements ranged up to 200 locations within a single electronics system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in order to obtain the desired radiation levels, all four 8-MeV, 230-kA bremsstrahlung pulses had to overlay within 10 ns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=George|last2=Scharf|first2=William|last3=Spohn|first3=Daniel|date=October 1982|title=Use of the AURORA Flash X-Ray Machine as a Source-Region EMP Simulator and Antenna Coupling Analysis Facility|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA122024|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synchronization was made possible by the symmetrization of the four Blumleins. During active testing, the Aurora Simulator was capable of accommodating as many as 13 test shots in a single day. In comparison, nuclear weapons testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]] was limited to one test shot per three months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There were two main limitations to the operation of the Aurora Simulator. First, the long discharge time of the Blumeins often hindered the extraction of the bremsstrahlung pulses. Second, the high internal impedance of the Blumeins made them rather inefficient for energy transfer to low impedance loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander|last2=Huttlin|first2=George|date=February 1979|title=Design Study for an AURORA Modification Leading to a 100-Terawatt Nuclear Weapon Radiation Simulator|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA071339|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bank code''' is a [[code]] assigned by a [[central bank]], a bank supervisory body or a [[Bankers Association]] in a country to all its licensed member [[bank]]s or [[financial institution]]s. The rules vary to a great extent between the countries. Also the name of bank codes varies. In some countries the bank codes can be viewed over the internet, but mostly in the local language.

The (national) bank codes differ from the international [[ISO 9362|Bank Identifier Code]] (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT code]]). Those countries which use [[International Bank Account Number]]s (IBAN) have mostly integrated the bank code into the prefix of specifying IBAN account numbers. The bank codes also differ from the [[Bank Identification Number|Bank card code]] (CSC).

The term "bank code" is sometimes (inappropriately) used by merchants to refer to the [[Card Security Code]] printed on a credit card.

== Europe ==
* [[Belgium]] has a national system with account numbers of 12 digits. There are no separate bank codes. The first 3 digits of the account number are called the protocol number, and indicate the bank the account belongs to.
* [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] have 4-digit bank codes, used behind account number (domestic account number is XXXXXX-YYYYYYYYYY/CCCC, where CCCC is bank code). A bank branch can be identified from the bank code.
* [[Denmark]] has 4-digit bank code (called ''Registreringsnummer'', or ''Reg. nr.'').
* [[France]] has a 10 digit code, the first 5 digits contain the clearing identifier of the banking company (''Code Banque''), followed by the 5-digit branch code (''Code Guichet''). Both numbers are only used as a combined prefix for the nationwide full account number.
* [[Germany]] has an 8-digit routing code. The first 4 digits identify the banking company and the latter 4 digits are assigned to the branch. In the 4-digit bank identifier:
** the first digit corresponds to one of 8 [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] regions of Germany,
** the first 3 digits (clearing region identifier and the next 2 digits after it) identify a "banking location" (''Bankplatz''),
** the last digit (4th in the whole routing code) denotes a banking company's classification (''Bankengruppe'').
:For bank classification values and identifiers for German clearing regions, see [[:de:Bankleitzahl#Aufbau|''Bankleitzahl'']] (in German).
:For a comprehensive list of Germany's "banking location" identifiers, see [[:de:Bankplätze der Deutschen Bundesbank|''Bankplätze'']] (in German).
* [[Greece]] has a 7-digit Ηellenic Bank Identification Code (HEBIC), where the first 3 digits are the bank code and the last 4 the branch code.
* [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] uses a 6-digit [[sort code]] followed by an 8-digit account number similar to and partially integrated with the UK system.
:The first two digits of the sort code identify the bank (90-xx-xx = [Bank of Ireland], 98-xx-xx = [Ulster Bank], for example) and the last 4 identify the branch.
:There is an exception with 99-xx-xx - these codes are used for international banks Irish Clearing ACs, and some Post Office accounts.
* [[Italy]] has a similar [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] system is used with 5 digits identifying the banking company (''Codice ABI''), followed by a 5-digit ''CAB'' (''Codice di Avviamento Bancario'') identifying the branch, followed by the account number.
* The [[Netherlands]] has a national system with account numbers of 9 or 10 digits. There are no separate bank codes. The first 5 digits of the account number can be used to identify the bank (originally also the branch, but clients can now often keep their account number when they move to another branch).
* [[Spain]] also has a similar format, with the first 4 digits identifying the banking company, the next 4 identifying the branch, the next 2 being the checksum, followed by the 10-digit account number.
* [[Switzerland]]  has a 3 to 5 digit bank code (''Bankenclearing-Nummer''); the first digit indicates the bank's classification group. Following after the bank code, a 4-digit number branch code identifier. For a list of Swiss bank codes, see [[Bank clearing number]].
* [[Sweden]] has 4 digit bank codes (''clearingnummer''), with an extra check digit for [[Swedbank]]. The first one or two digits are the bank group, and the rest the branch. For a list of Swedish bank codes, see [[:sv:Lista över clearingnummer till svenska banker|lista över clearingnummer till svenska banker]] (in Swedish).
* [[Ukraine]] has 6 digit bank codes. Account number does not include bank code. List of bank codes is available at the site of the National Bank of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bank.gov.ua/control/bankdict/banks National Bank of Ukraine (in Ukrainian)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[UK]] has a 6-digit [[sort code]]. For prefixes identifying UK banking companies, see the [[list of sort codes of the United Kingdom]].
As of February 2014 all countries in the [[Single Euro Payments Area]] have switched to an IBAN-based system for clearing (including [[TARGET2]] for cross-border transfers). The national bank codes have been integrated into the IBAN definition, in most cases at the start of the new account number (starting at position 5 after the common prefix of two-letter country identifier and two check digits). This is valid for transfers in the euro currency. Countries which retain their own currency use their own system for transfers in their currency.

== North America ==
* [[United States]] - The [[American Bankers Association]] since 1910 has used a 9-digit [[ABA routing transit number|routing transit number]] to identify American banks, which are used in the automated processing of checks.  The bank company is identified in the 5th to 8th digits (the 4 digits before the last checksum digit). The company number assigned to a bank includes a regional prefix indicating the metropolitan area and/or state.
*[[Canada]] uses codes called [[Routing number (Canada)|routing number]]s.&lt;ref name="fif and routing faq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Institutions File and routing numbers|url=http://www.cdnpay.ca:80/imis15/eng/FAQs/Routing/eng/faq/Routing.aspx|website=FAQs|publisher=Canadian Payments Association|accessdate=January 21, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330072440/http://www.cdnpay.ca/imis15/eng/FAQs/Routing/eng/faq/Routing.aspx|archivedate=2015-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of 5 digits identifying the branch and the 3 digits identifying the financial institution.

== South America ==
* [[Venezuela]] - The [[Central Bank of Venezuela]], since 2001, has used a 20-digit to identify venezuelan banks. The bank company is identified in first four digits followed by four digits for agency, two digits for checksum and last ten digits for bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nota de prensa:cheque único|url=http://bcv.org.ve/c4/notasprensa.asp?Codigo=3972&amp;Operacion=2&amp;Sec=False|website=[[Central Bank of Venezuela]]|accessdate=January 27, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419010601/http://bcv.org.ve/c4/notasprensa.asp?Codigo=3972&amp;Operacion=2&amp;Sec=False|archivedate=April 19, 2005|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asia-Pacific ==
* [[Australia]] has a 6-digit [[Bank State Branch]] (BSB) code which precedes the account number. The first 2 or 3 digits indicate the financial institution and the other 3 or 4 digits are the branch codes assigned by the institution.
* [[New Zealand]] has a [[New Zealand bank account prefix|6-digit prefix]] identical to Australia's BSB code, and although they appear similar (e.g. ANZ bank accounts in both countries start with 01, Westpac with 03), they are not compatible. The first 2 digits indicate the bank and the next 4 digits indicate the branch. All digits, along with the seven-digit account number and two or three digit suffix, are required for all wire transfers regardless of whether the transfer is intra-bank or interbank.
* [[India]] has a 11-digit alpha numeric [[Indian Financial System Code]] (IFSC). The first 4 character indicate the financial institution, fifth digit is 0 and the other 6 digit indicate the branch.  
* [[Iraq]] has a 1 to 3 digit bank code which identifies the bank branch.
* [[Indonesia]] It is used for clearing/kliring transactions such as checks, giros, etc. [[PayPal]] uses this domestic clearing code to transfer money from the PayPal accounts of Indonesian users to their Indonesian bank accounts in [[Rupiah]]. The first three digits of the bank code are also used for inter-bank transfers using an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].
* Since 2010, [[South Korea]] uses a 7-digit code starting with ''0'' or ''2''. The first 3 digits, called the bank code, is required for interbank wire transfers. The last 4 digits are a branch code, which is rarely used.

'''Beam and block''' is a [[construction]] method to support [[flooring]], especially for ground floors as well as multi storey buildings. It is made of cast [[concrete]], one piece of which is a [[prestressed concrete]] Beam which can be inverted T-shape [[beam (structure)|beam]], or lintel, the other piece being a simple rectangular block. The blocks are placed at regular intervals and the beams placed between them to form a connection between each block section. They form a support for the next layer of flooring materials.

Beam and Block is also referred to as Rib and block and lintel and block is some countries. Certain countries incorporate the use of temporary propping for 21 days while other rib and block systems use propless systems. Systems where props are used incorporate lighter [[beams]] while the prop line allows for structural cross support. Propless systems used heavier inverted T beams to compensate for the exclusion of props.

The lintels and blocks are packed above load bearing walls under supervision and design by a structural engineer. This system is extremely versatile in achieving complex designs and using unskilled labour. It is cost efficient as well as easily understood by all contractors.

The use of polystyrene blocks to replace concrete hollow blocks are used for lightweight insulated slabs. This keeps buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer. From a structural viewpoint a lighter slab assists by allowing load bearing walls and foundations taking less strain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6952">'''Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant''' was a munitions plant near [[McGregor, Texas|McGregor]], [[Texas]], which manufactured [[TNT]], bombs,  [[ammonium nitrate]] and similar products for the American troops during [[World War II]]. BlueBonnet Ordnance Plant was one of four ordnance plants in the United States during World War II. 

==Pre World War II==

During the earliest days of McGregor, Texas, the future site of Bluebonnet Ordnance was the crossroads of two railroads in 1879 ([[Santa Fe Railroad]] and the [[Cotton Belt Railroad]]).&lt;ref name="bluord"&gt;{{cite web |title=McGregor: Before SpaceX, facility produced bombs and lots of them |url=http://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Before-SpaceX-McGregor-facility-produced-bombs-and-lots-of-them-430442353.html |website=Kwtx |publisher=Kwtx |accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site that would become the plant had fertile, rich soil which contributed to its usages years later.&lt;ref name="bluord"/&gt; Gradually the McGregor area grew by over 1200 citizens in the 1920s setting the foundation for the founding of the plant a decade later.&lt;ref name="bluord"/&gt;

==World War II==

As the United States engaged in World War II, existing plants and equipment were considered for conversion to directly support the war effort. The [[National Gypsum]] Company of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] successfully lobbied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=War Years |url=http://ngc-heritage.com/ngc-forty.htm |website=National Gypsum |publisher=National Gypsum |accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States War Department]] to purchase their 18,000 acre facility located near McGregor, Texas for the construction and operation of a munitions plant. On March 7, 1942; National Gypsum executives worked with Army engineers in [[Waco, Texas]], to come up with the design and construction of the plant.&lt;ref name="gypp"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soldiers of Production, The World War II Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant |url=https://gypsumfiles.com/2014/02/01/soldiers-of-production-the-world-war-ii-bluebonnet-ordnance-plant/ |website=Gypsum Files |publisher=Gypsum Files |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offices that were set up for this endeveour was located in the Armory and in the Waco library.&lt;ref name="gypp"/&gt;

The plant was operated by the National Gypsum Company but overseen by the military and was one of the four Ordnance plants in the United States during World War II.&lt;ref name="gypp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=National Gypsum |date=May 19, 2014 |title=Soldiers of Production – WWII Blue Bonnet Ordinance Plant |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB9XQLctT0Q |access-date=July 16, 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; The army engineers were in charge of all plant construction while the Gypsum personnel and others worked out other strategies.&lt;ref name="gypp"/&gt; Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant got its name from Major Paul Van Tuyl, who named the plant after the state flower of Texas (Bluebonnet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beginnings |url=http://www.wacohistory.org/items/show/160#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1 |website=Waco History |publisher=Waco History |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At maximum production, the plant employed 5,732 workers. The plant ceased production on August 14, 1945.&lt;ref name="bluord"/&gt;

==Post war==

After the war, the facilities were converted to support the development and manufacture of ammonium nitrate based solid rocket propellants and operated by a number of successive companies: [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] (1952–1958), Astrodyne Incorporated (1958–1959), [[Rocketdyne]] (1959–1978), and [[Hercules Inc.]] (1978–1995). In 1995 Hercules transferred their operations to the [[Allegany Ballistics Laboratory]] in West Virginia, ending the manufacture of energetic materials at the site.&lt;ref name="orl09"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">A '''break junction''' is an electronic device which consists of two metal wires separated by a very thin gap, on the order of the inter-atomic spacing (less than a [[nanometer]]). This can be done by physically pulling the wires apart or through chemical etching or [[electromigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifesciences.ieee.org/areas-of-convergence/feature-articles/48-from-molecular-electronics-to-proteonics-break-junctions-for-biomarker-detection |title=From Molecular Electronics to Proteonics: Break Junctions for Biomarker Detection - IEEE Life Sciences |publisher=Lifesciences.ieee.org |date=2009-04-11 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018040552/http://lifesciences.ieee.org/areas-of-convergence/feature-articles/48-from-molecular-electronics-to-proteonics-break-junctions-for-biomarker-detection |archive-date=2011-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the wire breaks, the separation between the electrodes can be indirectly controlled by monitoring the electrical resistance of the junction.

After the gap is formed, its width can often be controlled by bending the substrate that the metal contacts lie on. The gap can be controlled to a precision of [[picometer]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v99/i2/e026601 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223182950/http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v99/i2/e026601 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 026601 (2007): Tuning the Kondo Effect with a Mechanically Controllable Break Junction |publisher=Prl.aps.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical conductance versus time trace during the breaking process (conductance is simply current divided by applied voltage bias) shows two regimes. First is a regime where the break junction comprises a [[quantum point contact]]. In this regime conductance decreases in steps equal to the [[conductance quantum]] &lt;math&gt;G_Q=2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt; which is expressed through the [[electron charge]] (−''e'') and [[Planck's constant]] &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The conductance quantum has a value of 7.74×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; siemens, corresponding to a resistance increase of roughly 12.9 kΩ. These step decreases are interpreted as the result of a decrease, as the electrodes are pulled apart, in the number of single-atom-wide metal strands bridging between the two electrodes, each strand having a conductance equal to the quantum of conductance. As the wire is pulled, the neck becomes thinner with fewer atomic strands in it. Each time the neck reconfigures, which happens abruptly, a step-like decrease of the conductance can be observed. This picture inferred from the current measurement has been confirmed by "in-situ" TEM imaging of the breaking process combined with current measurement.&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v395/n6704/full/395780a0.html |title=Quantized conductance through individual rows of suspended gold atoms |author=H.

Takayanagi |journal=Nature|volume=395|page=780|year=1998|doi=10.1038/27399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v85/i19/p4124_1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414003147/http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v85/i19/p4124_1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-14|title=Signature of Atomic Structure in the Quantum Conductance of Gold Nanowires|author=V. Rodrigues, T. Fuhrer and D. Ugarte|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|page=4124|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a second regime, when the wire is pulled further apart, the conductance collapses to values less than the quantum of conductance. This is the tunneling regime where electrons tunnel through vacuum between the electrodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5529">'''Brown powder''' or '''prismatic powder''', sometimes referred as "cocoa powder" due to its color, was a propellant used in large artillery and ship's guns from about the 1870s. While similar to [[black powder]], it was chemically formulated and formed hydraulically into a specific grain shape to provide a slower [[burn rate (chemistry)|burn rate]]s with  neutral or progressive burning, as opposed to the faster and regressive burn typical of randomly shaped grains of black powder produced by crushing and screening powder formed into sheets in a press box, as was typical for cannon powder previously.

== Characteristics ==

For pure explosive damage, high burn rates or detonation speeds (and accompanying [[brisance]]) are generally preferable, but in guns and especially [[cannons]], slower-burning powder decreases firing stresses. This allows for lighter, longer (and more accurate) barrels with associated decreases in production and maintenance costs. Further modifications of its burning rate were achieved by shaping the powder grains into prismatic shapes, typically single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.

They became obsolete as a propellant due to the introduction of nitro-explosive propellants such as [[Poudre B]], in France, and later by [[cordite]], in Britain. These new propellants produced less smoke, particularly less black smoke.

== Composition ==
{{refimprovesection|date=June 2018}}
The differences in burning rate were achieved by several means. Changes to formulation were altering ingredients relative percentage by weight and using differently processed charcoals for fuel than those of a standard 75:15:10 (potassium nitrate:charcoal:sulfur) black cannon powder. 

Typically, sulfur was either not used in brown powders, or Sulfur content reduced to around 1% by weight from the usual 10%. The reduction or outright removal of sulfur slowed the burn rate, while replacement of higher molecular weight sulfur dioxide by carbon dioxide or monoxide in the propellant gas mixture gave a higher specific impulse. 

Differently processed charcoals were used. Fully carbonized [[charcoal]] (mostly composed of elemental [[carbon]]) in black powder provides its distinctive black color, while its replacement with an incompletely carbonized, brownish colored charcoal produces a dark brown appearance, hence the names "brown powder" or "cocoa powder".  The less carbonized charcoal was ''more'' reactive than fully carbonized charcoal, somewhat making up for the easy ignition characteristics usually provided by sulfur. The Brown charcoal also helped to produce sturdier grains and replaced sulfur in the role of a binder.

Further modifications of burn rate were achieved by shaping the individual powder grains, often into prismatic shapes such as single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.&lt;ref name="Tenney"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chemistry of Powder and Explosives |last=Davis |first=Tenney L. |year=2012 |origyear=1941–1943 |others=Two volumes |publisher=Wiley |location=Las Vegas |isbn=978-0945001171 |oclc=488351130}}{{Page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Large-grained powder, made in the traditional way as flat sheets but screened to larger sizes, was introduced in the 1850s by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major [[Thomas Rodman]] for his [[Rodman gun|large-calibre cannon]]. In 1875 [[Lammot du Pont]] invented ''Hexagonal'' powder for large [[artillery]], which was pressed using shaped plates with a small center core; about {{convert|1.5|in}} diameter, like a wagon wheel nut, the center hole widened as the grain burned. By 1880 [[Naval artillery|naval guns]] were using Hexagonal grains, {{convert|1|in}} in height.&lt;ref name=Parkinson2008_p135&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Parkinson|title=The Late Victorian Navy: The Pre-Dreadnought Era and the Origins of the First World War |year=2008|publisher=Boydell Press |location=Woodbridge, UK |isbn=978-1-84383-372-7 |oclc=220001679 |page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJB2-QtNbFAC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large grain powders, being subject to defects in manufacturing, did not completely remove the danger of [[overpressure]], as demonstrated in the 1880 accident on the [[Italian ironclad Caio Duilio|Italian ironclad ''Caio Duilio'']], which involved powder made at the chemical works at [[Fossano]].&lt;ref name="Gardiner1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Gardiner |title=Steam, Steel &amp; Shellfire: The Steam Warship, 1815–1905 |year=1992 |publisher=Conway Maritime Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-85177-564-7 |oclc=30778237 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 the German [[Rottweil Company]] developed Prismatic Brown Powder (PBC), which was also adopted by the [[Royal Navy]] in 1884. It retarded burning even further by using only 2 percent [[sulfur]] and using charcoal made from [[rye]] straw that had not been completely charred. It was pressed into prisms with a central hole, similar to the {{convert|1.5|in}} [[DuPont]] Hexagonal.

The [[French Navy]] instead developed the Slow Burning Cocoa (SBC) powder, which had grains of about {{convert|3.1|mm}}; still only 40% of it burned, the rest was ejected as heavy black smoke.

The first smokeless propellant, the [[guncotton]]-based [[Poudre B]] was introduced by the French Navy in 1886,&lt;ref name=Parkinson2008_p135/&gt; triggering rapid development of  smokeless compounds which replaced brown powder.

'''Cheese ripening''', alternatively '''cheese maturation''' or '''affinage''', is a process in [[Cheesemaker|cheesemaking]].  It is responsible for the distinct [[flavour]] of [[cheese]], and through the modification of "''ripening agents''", determines the features that define many different varieties of cheeses, such as taste, texture, and body.&lt;ref name="Guelph"&gt;{{cite web |title = Cheese: Cheese Ripening |work = |publisher = [[University of Guelph]] Department of Dairy Science and Technology |date = |url = https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/ripening-and-packaging |doi = |accessdate = 2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process is "characterized by a series of complex physical, chemical and microbiological changes"&lt;ref name="entre"&gt;{{cite web |title = Monitor biochemical changes during cheese ripening with infrared microspectroscopy. |work = Emerging Food R&amp;D Report  |publisher = [[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur Magazine]] |date = |url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/203561105.html |doi = |accessdate = 2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that incorporates the agents of "[[bacteria]] and enzymes of the [[milk]], lactic culture, [[rennet]], [[lipases]], added [[mould]]s or [[yeast]]s, and environmental contaminants".&lt;ref name="Guelph" /&gt;  The majority of cheese is ripened, save for [[Types of cheese#Fresh, whey, and stretched curd cheeses|fresh cheese]].&lt;ref name="Guelph" /&gt;

==History==
Cheese ripening was not always the highly industrialised process it is today; in the past, cellars and caves were used to ripen cheeses instead of the current highly regulated process involving machinery and biochemistry.  Some cheeses still are made using more historical methods, such as the [[blue cheese]] [[Roquefort]], which is required to be ripened in designated caves in south-eastern [[France]].&lt;ref name="Fox, Patrick p. 350"&gt;Fox, Patrick. Cogan, Timothy. Guinee, Timothy. ''Fundamentals of Cheese Science''. p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the invention of [[refrigeration]] in the 20th century, the process evolved considerably, and is much more efficient at producing a consistent quality of cheese, at a faster pace, and a lower cost (depending on the type of cheese).&lt;ref name="Fox, Patrick p. 350"/&gt;

==Process==
[[File:Beemster detail.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Extra aged [[Beemster cheese]], 26+ months old. Note the tyrosine crystals.]]
After the initial manufacturing process of the cheese is done, the cheese ripening process occurs.  This process is especially important, since it defines the flavour and texture of the cheese, which differentiates the many varieties.  Duration is dependent on the type of cheese and the desired quality, and typically ranges from "three weeks to two or more years".&lt;ref name="Fox, Patrick p. 389"&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripening is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from the [[microflora]] to the curd, and others.  The enzymatic process is the most crucial process for all cheeses, although [[bacteria]] plays a role in many varieties.&lt;ref name="Fox, Patrick p. 389"/&gt;  The most important agents in this process include the following elements: 

* [[Rennet]], or a substitute for rennet
* starter [[bacteria]] and associated enzymes
* milk [[enzymes]]
* second starter bacteria and associated enzymes
* non-starter bacteria

Each of these factors affects the cheese-ripening process differently, and has been the subject of much research.  It is important for manufacturers to understand how each of these elements work, so that they are able to maintain the quality of the cheese while producing the cheese at an acceptable investment of time and cost.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;  These agents contribute to the three primary reactions that define cheese ripening: [[glycolysis]], [[proteolysis]], and [[lipolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

By taking the cheese through a series of maturation stages where temperature and relative humidity are carefully controlled, the cheese maker allows the surface mould to grow and the [[mould]] ripening of the cheese by fungi to occur.  Mould-ripened cheeses ripen faster than hard cheeses, in weeks as opposed to the typical months or even years.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. Cogan, Timothy. Guinee, Timothy. ''Fundamentals of Cheese Science''. p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because the [[fungi]] used are more biochemically active than the starter bacteria.  Where the ripening occurs is largely dependent on the type of cheese: some cheeses are surface-ripened by moulds, such as Camembert and [[Brie]]; and some are ripened internally, such as [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]].  Surface ripening of some cheeses, such as [[Saint-Nectaire]] cheese, may also be influenced by [[yeast]]s which contribute flavour and coat texture.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are allowed by the cheesemaker to develop bacterial surface growths which give characteristic colours and appearances.  The growth of ''Brevibacterium linens'', for example, creates an orange coat to cheeses.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to [[cheddaring]], making cheeses like [[Camembert]] requires a more gentle treatment of the curd.  It is carefully transferred to cheese hoops and the whey is allowed to drain from the curd by gravity, generally overnight.  The cheese curds are then removed from the hoops to be brined by immersion in a saturated salt solution.  This is because the amount of [[salt]] has a large effect on the rate of [[proteolysis]] in the cheese, stopping the bacteria from growing.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. Cogan, Timothy. Guinee, Timothy. ''Fundamentals of Cheese Science''. p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  If white-mould spores have not been added to the cheese milk, the cheese maker applies them to the cheese either by spraying the cheese with a suspension of mould [[spore]]s in water, or by immersing the cheese in a bath containing spores of, e.g., ''Penicillium candida''.

==Effect on features==

===Eyes===
{{main article|Eyes (cheese)}}
[[File:Emmentaler aoc block.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Emmentaler|Emmental]] with eyes.  Emmental tastes sweeter due to proline.]]

The round holes that are a characteristic feature of [[Swiss-type cheese]]&lt;ref name="Metabolism 366"&gt;P.L.H. McSweeney and P.R Fox; ''Metabolism of Residual Lactose and of Lactate and Citrate'', in: Fox, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Emmentaler cheese]]) and some [[Dutch-type cheese]]s are called "eyes".  They are bubbles of [[carbon dioxide]] that is produced by [[bacteria]] in the cheese.

In Swiss-type cheeses, the eyes form as a result of the activity of propionic acid [[bacteria]] (''[[propionibacteria]]''), notably ''[[Propionibacterium freudenreichii]]'' subsp. ''shermanii''.&lt;ref name="Sweeney 349"&gt;P.L.H. McSweeney, ''Biochemistry of Cheese Ripening: Introduction and Overview'', in: Fox, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genoscope"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii ATCC9614: A bacterium used in the production of Emmental|journal=[[Genoscope]]|date=16 January 2008|url=http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/spip/propionibacterium-freudenreichii,467.html|accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dutch-type cheeses, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that forms the eyes results from the metabolisation of [[citrate]] by citrate-positive ("Cit+") strains of [[lactococci]].&lt;ref name="Metabolism 367"&gt;P.L.H. McSweeney and P.R Fox; ''Metabolism of Residual Lactose and of Lactate and Citrate'', in: Fox, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taste===
The process of cheese ripening affects the taste of the final product.  If the product is not ripened, the resulting cheese is tasteless, and so, all cheese is ripened except for fresh cheeses.&lt;ref name="Guelph" /&gt; Different factors define taste in cheese, including [[casein]], [[fat]], [[brine]], and many other elements.  Brine, as an example, mixes with [[saliva]], delivering the flavour of the cheese to the [[taste buds]] and determining the cheese's [[wikt:moist|moistness]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these elements are specific to the type of cheese.  For instance, [[proline]] is more abundant in [[Emmental]] than in any other type of cheese, and gives the cheese its much [[sweet]]er taste.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Patrick. ''Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology''. p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CoCalc''' (formerly called '''SageMathCloud''') is a web-based [[cloud computing]] ([[Software as a service|SaaS]]) and [[Learning management system|course management]] platform for [[computational mathematics]]. Part of the [[SageMath|Sage project]], it supports editing of Sage worksheets, [[LaTeX]] documents and [[Jupyter]] notebooks. CoCalc runs an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux]] environment that can be interacted with through a terminal, additionally giving access to most of the capabilities of Linux.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2014/05/what-can-sagemathcloud-smc-do.html|title=What can SageMathCloud (SMC) do?|date=1 May 2014|website=Sage: Open Source Mathematics Software|publisher=|access-date=|last1=Stein|first1=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CoCalc offers both free and paid accounts. Subscriptions starting at $14/month provide internet access and more storage and computing resources. One subscription can be used to increase quotas for one project used by multiple accounts. There are subscription plans for courses. Over 200 courses have used CoCalc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/wiki/Teaching|title=Teaching - sagemathinc/smc|access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
CoCalc directly supports [[SageMath|Sage]] worksheets, which interactively evaluate Sage code. The worksheets support [[Markdown]] and [[HTML]] for decoration, and [[R (programming language)|R]], [[GNU Octave|Octave]], [[Cython]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] and others for programming in addition to Sage. CoCalc supports [[IPython]] notebooks, which are enhanced with real-time synchronization for collaboration and a history recording function. Additionally, there is also a full [[LaTeX]] editor, with collaboration support, a preview of the resulting document and also support for [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/sagetex.html SageTeX]. With the Linux terminal, CoCalc also indirectly supports editing and running many other languages, including [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and other popular languages that can be run on Linux. Other packages can be installed on request.&lt;ref name="blog" /&gt;

Users can have multiple projects on CoCalc, and each project has separate disk space and may be on an entirely different server. Many users can collaborate on a single project, and documents are synced so multiple users can edit the same file at once, similar to [[Google Docs]]. All the data on projects is automatically backed up about every five minutes with [https://github.com/bup/bup bup], and snapshots of previous versions are accessible. Through the terminal, files can be tracked using revision control systems like [[Git (software)|Git]].

==Development==
CoCalc is open source software hosted by SageMath Inc. The creator and lead developer of CoCalc is [[William A. Stein|William Stein]], a professor of mathematics at the [[University of Washington]] who also created the Sage software system. Initial development was funded by the University of Washington and grants from the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[Google]]. Now CoCalc is mostly funded by paying users. It is intended as a replacement for [http://www.sagenb.org/ sagenb], which also let users edit and share Sage worksheets online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sagemath.org/notebook-vs-cloud.html |title=Sage Notebook vs. Sagemath Cloud |last1=Stein |first1=William |website=Sage |access-date=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CreditPilot PLC''' (or '''Credit Pilot PLC''')&lt;ref name="opencorporates"/&gt; is an international [[FinTech]] company, based in [[Cyprus]] and active in the [[BFSI]] arena. Its main areas of engagement are platforms for [[MNO]]s and [[MVNO]]s, retail fintech platforms, acquiring, [[ESPI]] (enterprise scale payments), and operating financial regulated companies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tmt.knect365.com/mvnos-world-congress/sponsors/creditpilot MVNOs World Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; The group is mainly active in [[Business-to-business|B2B]] and [[Business to many|B2B2C]] sectors, with plans to introduce a B2C product in 2019.

== History ==
CreditPilot was established in 1998 as a FinTech spin-off from [[Megafon]], one of the largest mobile network operators in Russia. Shortly after its establishment, CreditPilot began rendering services not just to its former parent company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://buzz2fone.com/the-future-of-banking-has-two-possibilities-either-fintech-or-techfin/ THE FUTURE OF BANKING HAS TWO POSSIBILITIES: EITHER FINTECH OR TECHFIN]&lt;/ref&gt; but also to numerous other MNOs and service providers in Russia, including banks, utility companies, and retail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techmaish.com/fintech-in-asia-a-necessary-future/ Fintech In Asia – A Necessary Future] {{ref-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial array of services offered by CreditPilot was mainly focused on payment kiosks and acquiring; however, starting from the mid-2000s, CreditPilot began to explore other markets, opportunities and areas of expertise, such as [[SaaS]] services and establishment of regulated companies, banks and remittance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youngherald.com/2018/10/software-as-a-service-a-new-way-to-help-companies-grow/ Software as a Service – a new way to help companies grow]&lt;/ref&gt;

This expansion helped CreditPilot grow, while keeping the company's key focus on providing its business partners with a reliable payments infrastructure. Following a change of ownership in 2010, CreditPilot started a pivot towards processing, FinTech products, and providing ready-to-go platforms to its partners, instead of simply providing services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gearfuse.com/fintech-a-new-source-of-income-for-mobile-operators-worldwide/ FinTech – a New Source of Income for Mobile Operators Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of its client base, CreditPilot began an organic expansion into the European market, becoming a key player in the sector of regulated companies: banks, remittance companies, payment institutions, etc. In 2018, the company began a restructuring process on the basis of CreditPilot PLC, the result of which should be the company’s listing on the Cyprus Stock Exchange by the end of Q4 2018, with the aim to become a solid presence in the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange|Frankfurt]] and the [[London Stock Exchange]]s, too. CreditPilot took part in [[Mobile World Congress]] Shanghai 2018, where it presented its Any2Any platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|XiY_tgSv5eU|Everything about MFS. CreditPilot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|oHiRO96QFZI|CreditPilot booth at MWC2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
CreditPilot's major focus lies in the transactional and processing platforms that act within a financial market infrastructure and require regulated licenses to operate. As such, CreditPilot offers its clients several proprietary solutions:
* Any2Any – a platform that allows [[MNO]]s and [[MVNO]]s to provide financial services to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefintechtimes.com/any2any-platform-a-financial-transaction-possibility-for-the-unbanked/ Any2Any platform – a financial transaction possibility for the unbanked]&lt;/ref&gt; The platform can be rolled out onto any infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://realwealthbusiness.com/cashless-transactions-an-advantage/ Cashless transactions – an advantage]&lt;/ref&gt; The managed services version provides MNOs and MVNOs with products and services that go beyond a barebone transactional platform, and include license arrangements, merchant connections, and the ability for MNOs and MVNOs to have a seamless operation in financial services, thus saving them the time and money that would otherwise be spent on a costly development of internal competencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techbullion.com/small-business-has-a-new-best-friend/ Small Business has a new best friend]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telecoms.com/interview/qa-interview-with-renato-andrade-reis-acqua-telecom/ Q&amp;A Interview with Renato Andrade Reis, Acqua Telecom]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Retail FinTech is an array of products from CreditPilot designed to take care of its end-clients. Solutions include payment kiosks with management and back-end infrastructure, POS-networks, and agents automation networks that allow retail shops to seamlessly and efficiently provide both payment and remittance services. 
* CreditPilot also provides acquiring capabilities for both online and brick &amp; mortar merchants, all through its proprietary payment gateway that allows the following payment methods: [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard|MC]], [[UnionPay]], [[WeChat]], a variety of e-Wallets, and custom [[e-Wallet]]s created specifically for merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jcount.com/fintech-in-africa-mobile-or-more/ FINTECH IN AFRICA – MOBILE, OR MORE?]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of CreditPilot products and platforms are available as a managed service, with a range of VAS telecom companies can offer its end-clients, all while being in range of flexible pricing options for acquiring, core banking on demand, remittance core on demand, local and international peer-to-peer remittance, payment kiosks, settlement and e-Wallets. 
* In addition to the proven B2B/B2C model that has been the core of CreditPilot's business, the company is developing an innovative B2C payment method aggregator and extended distributed payment system that is set for launch in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbw.ge/world/fintech-trends-in-2018/ FINTECH TRENDS IN 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming operative, it would consist of e-Wallet, [[Blockchain]] transport, payment method aggregation, global payment remittance system and [[cryptocurrency]] capabilities.

'''Demolition''' or '''razing''' is the tearing down of [[building]]s and other man-made [[structure]]s. Demolition contrasts with [[deconstruction (building)|deconstruction]], which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes.

For small buildings, such as [[house]]s, that are only two or three stories high, demolition is a rather simple process. The building is pulled down either manually or mechanically using large hydraulic equipment: elevated work platforms, cranes, [[excavator]]s or [[bulldozer]]s. Larger buildings may require the use of a [[wrecking ball]], a heavy weight on a cable that is swung by a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] into the side of the buildings. Wrecking balls are especially effective against masonry, but are less easily controlled and often less efficient than other methods. Newer methods may use rotational hydraulic shears and silenced rock-breakers attached to excavators to cut or break through wood, steel, and concrete. The use of shears is especially common when flame cutting would be dangerous.

The tallest planned demolition of a building was the 47-story [[Singer Building]] in [[New York City]], which was built in 1908 and torn down in 1967–1968 to be replaced by [[One Liberty Plaza]].

Before any demolition activities can take place, there are many steps that must be carried out beforehand, including performing [[asbestos abatement]], removing hazardous or regulated materials, obtaining necessary permits, submitting necessary notifications, disconnecting utilities, rodent baiting and the development of site-specific safety and work plans.

The typical razing of a building is accomplished as follows:

Hydraulic excavators may be used to topple one- or two-story buildings by an undermining process. The strategy is to undermine the building while controlling the manner and direction in which it falls. The demolition project manager/supervisor will determine where undermining is necessary so that a building is pulled in the desired manner and direction. The walls are typically undermined at a building's base, but this is not always the case if the building design dictates otherwise. Safety and cleanup considerations are also taken into account in determining how the building is undermined and ultimately demolished.

In some cases a crane with a [[wrecking ball]] is used to demolish the structure down to a certain manageable height. At that point undermining takes place as described above. However crane mounted demolition balls are rarely used within demolition due to the uncontrollable nature of the swinging ball and the safety implications associated.

High reach demolition excavators are more often used for tall buildings where explosive demolition is not appropriate or possible.  Excavators with shear attachments are typically used to dismantle steel structural elements.  Hydraulic hammers are often used for concrete structures and concrete processing attachments are used to crush concrete to a manageable size, and to remove reinforcing steel.  For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive or high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the "inside-out" method is used, whereby remotely operated mini-excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished.

To control dust, fire hoses are used to maintain a wet demolition. Hoses may be held by workers, secured in fixed location, or attached to lifts to gain elevation.

Loaders or bulldozers may also be used to demolish a building. They are typically equipped with "rakes" (thick pieces of steel that could be an I-beam or tube) that are used to ram building walls. Skid loaders and loaders will also be used to take materials out and sort steel.

The technique of Vérinage is used in France to weaken and buckle the supports of central floors promoting the collapse of the top part of a building onto the bottom resulting in a rapid, symmetrical, collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2td63_hd20h20070822chunk2_news |title=HD_20h_20070822_chunk_2 - Vidéo Dailymotion |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese company [[Kajima Construction]] has developed a new method of demolishing buildings which involves using computer-controlled [[hydraulic jack]]s to support the bottom floor as the supporting columns are removed. The floor is lowered and this process is repeated for each floor. This technique is safer and more environmentally friendly, and is useful in areas of high [[population density]].&lt;ref name=popsci-kajima&gt;{{cite news | title=Kajima Demolition Tech |url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2008/product/kajima-demolition-tech | publisher=Popular Science | date=December 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demolish bridges, [[Hoe ram|hoe rams]] are typically used to remove the concrete road deck and piers, while hydraulic shears are used to remove the bridge's [[structural steel]].

== Building implosion ==
{{main|Building implosion}}
[[File:Blasting of a chimney at the former Henninger Brewery in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.jpg|thumb|Demolition of a chimney at the former brewery "Henninger" in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, on 2 December 2006]]
[[File:Demolition of the New Haven Coliseum.gif|thumb|right|The demolition of the [[New Haven Coliseum]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]]]
Large buildings, tall [[chimney]]s, [[smokestack]]s, bridges, and increasingly some smaller structures may be destroyed by building implosion using [[explosive]]s. Imploding a structure is very fast—the collapse itself only takes seconds—and an expert can ensure that the structure falls into its own footprint, so as not to damage neighboring structures. This is essential for tall structures in dense urban areas.

Any error can be disastrous, however, and some demolitions have failed, severely damaging neighboring structures. One significant danger is from flying debris, which, when improperly prepared for, can kill onlookers.

Another dangerous scenario is the partial failure of an attempted implosion. When a building fails to collapse completely the structure may be unstable, tilting at a dangerous angle, and filled with un-detonated but still primed explosives, making it difficult for workers to approach safely.

A third danger comes from air overpressure that occurs during the implosion. If the sky is clear, the [[shock wave]], a wave of energy and sound, travels upwards and disperses, but if cloud coverage is low, the shock wave can travel outwards, breaking windows or causing other damage to surrounding buildings.&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;{{cite news | title=Blasting a path to world markets |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n1-2_v118/ai_19118720/pg_3 | first=Curtice | last=Cultice | publisher=BNET Business Network | year=1997 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephanie Kegley of CST Environmental described shock waves by saying, "The shock wave is like a water hose. If you put your hand in front of the water as it comes out, it fans to all sides. When cloud coverage is below 1,200 feet, it reacts like the hand in front of the hose. The wave from the shock fans out instead of up toward the sky."&lt;ref name=Kegley&gt;{{cite news | first=Maura | last=Bohart | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | title=Demolition Eliminates Final Remnant of Charlotte Hornets |url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=9327 | date=26 September 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled implosion, being spectacular, is the method that the general public often thinks of when discussing demolition; however, it can be dangerous and is only used as a last resort when other methods are impractical or too costly. The destruction of large buildings has become increasingly common as the massive [[housing project]]s of the 1960s and 1970s are being leveled around the world. At {{convert|439|ft|m}} and {{convert|2200000|sqft|m2}}, the [[J. L. Hudson Department Store and Addition]] is the tallest steel framed building and largest single structure ever [[Building implosion|imploded]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.controlled-demolition.com/default.asp?reqLocId=7&amp;reqItemId=20030225133807 |title=J.L. Hudson Department Store |publisher=Controlled Demolition, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparation ===
It takes several weeks or months to prepare a building for implosion. All items of value, such as copper wiring, are stripped from a building. Some materials must be removed, such as [[glass]] that can form deadly projectiles, and insulation that can scatter over a wide area. Non-load bearing partitions and [[drywall]] are removed.&lt;ref name = "Nova1"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] |title=Interview with Stacey Loizeaux |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/kaboom/loizeaux.html |work=[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |date=December 1996 |accessdate=2009-04-29 |quote=She learned the fine art of demolition from her father, Mark Loizeaux, and her uncle, Doug Loizeaux—president and vice-president of the company. NOVA spoke with Ms. Loizeaux a few days before Christmas, 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected columns on floors where explosives will be set are drilled and [[high explosives]] such as [[nitroglycerin]], [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], [[RDX]], or C4 are placed in the holes. Smaller columns and walls are wrapped in [[detonating cord]]. The goal is to use as little explosive as possible so that the structure will fail in a [[progressive collapse]] therefore only a few floors are rigged with explosives, so that it is safer (fewer explosives) and costs less. The areas with explosives are covered in thick [[geotextile]] fabric and fencing to absorb flying debris.&lt;ref name="Nova1"/&gt; Far more time-consuming than the demolition itself is the clean-up of the site, as the debris is loaded into trucks and hauled away.

== Deconstruction ==
{{main|Deconstruction (building)}}
A new approach to demolition is the deconstruction of a building with the goal of minimizing the amount of materials going to [[landfill]]s. This "green" approach is applied by removing the materials by type material and segregating them for reuse or [[recycling]]. With proper planning this approach has resulted in landfill diversion rates that exceed 90% of an entire building and its contents in some cases. It also vastly reduces the [[carbon dioxide emissions|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions]] of the removing of a building in comparison to demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-01/15/japan-eco-demolition Taisei Corporation's Tecorep reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 85%]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of plant and equipment has allowed for the easier segregation of [[demolition waste]] types on site and the reuse within the construction of the replacement building. On site crushers allow the demolished concrete to be reused as type 1 crushed aggregate either as a piling mat for ground stabilization or as aggregate in the mixing of concrete.

Timber waste can be shredded using specialist timber shredders and composted, or used to form manufactured timber boards, such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]].

Safety is paramount; a site safety officer is usually assigned to each project to enforce all safety rules and regulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7879">A '''dog rope''' is a short length of [[Rawhide (material)|rawhide]] rope that was used by the [[Dog Soldiers]] of the [[Cheyenne]] warrior societies and warriors considered especially brave of other tribes.  Its purpose was to anchor the warrior in place when a last-ditch defence was called for, thus indicating an intention not to retreat even against overwhelming odds.

== Construction ==

The dog rope consisted of eight to twelve feet of rawhide around four inches wide.  One end of the rope was tied to a [[picket pin]] (a pin that could be hammered into the ground, normally used for fixing the [[picket rope]] of a horse) by a string.  The rope was usually carried wound over the right shoulder and under the left arm.  It was looped through a slit cut in the free end to secure it to the wearer.  It could also be hung from the belt by a string.

The leather of the rope was decorated with feathers and porcupine quills dyed bright colours.  The picket pin was made of wood and painted red.  [[Beadwork]], although a common [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] form of decoration, was never used on dog ropes.

== Background ==

The Cheyennes on the [[Great Plains]] of the American [[Old West]] had a number of warrior societies.  Virtually all Cheyenne young men belonged to one or other of these societies.  One society would be appointed by the tribal chiefs to act as camp police.  This society also organised warfare and hunting expeditions as the need arose.

The societies took it in turns to fulfil this role.  The use of the dog rope amongst the Cheyennes was peculiar to the Dog Warrior Society.&lt;ref&gt;Grinnell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dog society eventually took on the nature of a separate band of Cheyennes as opposed to a society within the bands.  This band became known to the whites as the [[Dog Soldiers]].  They were much admired amongst the Cheyenne for their bravery and they played a leading role in the fighting against US forces.

However, the use of dog ropes was not limited to the Cheyenne.  They were also used by many other plains tribes, including the [[Arapaho]]s, [[Mandan]]s, [[Kiowa]]s and [[Apache]]s.  The term ''dog rope'' is thus unlikely to derive from the Dog warrior society.  According to an informant of Marquis&lt;ref name=campdog /&gt; the term ''dog soldier'' is a general term for a camp guard, so called because they complement the barked warnings of the camp dogs.  Thus, the use of a dog rope by a dog soldier is to be compared to the leash of a guard dog.

== Usage ==

Only warriors considered the bravest carried a dog rope.  If a warrior carried a dog rope then he was obliged to use it if needed.  They were typically used as a last resort in defending a camp under attack as a last-ditch stand.  A warrior might also declare in advance, in order to demonstrate his bravery, that in the next battle he would use his dog rope regardless of the necessity.  When required, the dog rope warriors would insert their picket pins into the ground.  Once inserted, the warrior was obliged to restrict his movements to the distance allowed by the length of the dog rope and fight and die on that spot.

The warrior was not permitted to remove the pin himself, but a comrade might do so if he considered it honourable or desirable.  When a dog rope warrior was released in this way, he was ceremoniously driven off the field of battle by the releasing warrior with a [[quirt]].  The symbolism is that the dog rope warrior would not leave the fight of his own will.  The use of a dog rope in battle was considered tantamount to suicide.

== Mythology and customs ==
Dog ropes were brought to the Cheyennes by the mythical and mystical founder of the Dog Soldiers.  When no one showed interest in joining this proposed new society, he caused all the dogs to disappear, then all the buffalo, then himself.  Some warriors reported seeing a vision of Dog Soldiers at the man's camp but they were gone when they returned with their friends.  The man then produced four miniature dog ropes from his throat and instructed some women to make all future dog ropes to this pattern.

Two of the four dog ropes were to be given to unmarried men.  The remaining two he reswallowed saying that anyone who wanted one would have to pay for it.  One of the newly enrolled Dog Soldiers, Crooked Neck, was criticised by his mother, Dying Woman, for being badly painted.  He asked for one of the dog ropes to show his worth, and received it after Dying Woman paid five dogs (including a wolf).  Crooked Neck was then painted properly (red all over) and the buffalo returned to the plains.

This myth was used to explain certain traditions regarding dog ropes.  Amongst the Cheyennes, there were only four dog ropes at any one time.  Two of these, which had longer pins, were a higher grade than the other two.  An owner of a dog rope could pass it on to a younger warrior, chosen by the society chiefs, but payment was expected.  He who wished to receive a dog rope piled up goods until the owner considered the payment to be sufficient.  If the owner was not satisfied with the offer, he could pick up the dog rope and put it down again in another place.  The purchaser and his family then increased the pile of goods.  This could be repeated several times.  Finally, the owner would place the dog rope over the purchaser.  Dancing then commenced to celebrate, starting with the seller leading the purchaser by the dog rope.

== Notable events ==

In 1835 a Kiowa village travelled north intending to trade with the [[Crow Nation|Crows]].  They were attacked by Cheyennes from the Hevhaitanio clan led by [[Yellow Wolf (Cheyenne)|Yellow Wolf]] and a band of [[Suhtai]]s led by Black Shin.  This fight occurred at [[Kiowa Creek (Colorado)|Kiowa Creek]], just east of [[Denver]].  A Kiowa chief carrying a dog rope attempted to single-handedly hold up the Cheyennes while the Kiowas built defences in nearby woodland.  This Kiowa made repeated charges on horseback through the Cheyenne lines.  He was finally brought down by arrow fire.  Although he never dismounted to use his dog rope, he made such an impression on the Cheyennes that they were still telling the story of his bravery at meetings into the 20th century.

[[George Bird Grinnell|Grinnell]] records the use of a dog rope witnessed by [[Tall Bull]], the leader of the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers.  Little Man had been at the front of the charge, but then the Cheyennes started to retreat.  Little Man dismounted and pinned his dog rope.  This stopped the Cheyenne retreat but they began to be pushed back.  Little Man was saved by a [[warbonnet]] Cheyenne who pulled up his pin and drove him back.

At the [[Battle of Summit Springs]] in 1869 the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers led by Tall Bull (who was killed in this engagement) were surprised by an attack from US soldiers.  A number of Cheyennes became trapped in a ravine.  A dog rope warrior, Wolf with Plenty of Hair, pinned his dog rope at the entrance of the ravine to defend them and was killed there.  This was the last recorded use of a dog rope in battle.

== Notes ==
{{reflist|refs=
&lt;ref name=campdog&gt;Marquis's informant was Jules Chaudel, an infantry soldier stationed at [[Fort Keogh]].  This is unusual for Marquis who normally specialised in recording the experiences of Native Americans in the fighting rather than US soldiers.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Durable Medical Equipment (DME)''' is any equipment that provides therapeutic benefits to a patient in need because of certain medical conditions and/or illnesses.
Durable Medical Equipment (DME) consists of items which:
* are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose;
* are not useful to a person in the absence of illness, disability, or injury;
* are ordered or prescribed by a physician;
* are reusable;
* can stand repeated use, and
* are appropriate for use in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is DME?|url=http://dmelibrary.com/what-is-dme/|website=DME Library|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DME includes, but is not limited to, wheelchairs (manual and electric), traction equipment, canes, crutches, walkers, kidney machines, ventilators, oxygen, monitors, pressure mattresses, lifts, nebulizers, bili blankets and bili lights.

Similar criteria are used by Medicare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/durable-medical-equipment-coverage.html|title=Durable medical equipment (DME) coverage - Medicare.gov|website=www.medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextstepincare.org/next_step_in_care_guides/319/Durable_Medical_Equipment|title=Durable Medical Equipment|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nextstepincare.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:(n) The term "durable medical equipment" - DME - includes, but is not limited to, wheelchairs (manual and electric), hospital beds, traction equipment, canes, crutches, walkers, kidney machines, ventilators, oxygen, monitors, pressure mattresses, lifts, nebulizers, bili blankets and bili lights.

Insurance companies will provide coverage for Durable Medical Equipment when it is determined to be medically necessary because the medical criteria and guidelines for its use are met.

'''Durable medical equipment may be covered when All of the following criteria are met:'''
* 1. The equipment provides therapeutic benefit to a patient in need because of certain medical conditions and/or illnesses; And
* 2. The DME is prescribed by a licensed provider; And
* 3. The DME does not serve primarily as a comfort or convenience item; And
* 4. The equipment does not have significant non-medical uses (e.g., environmental control equipment, air conditioners, air filters, and humidifiers).
* 
'''Durable Medical Equipment and Services are not covered when..'''
*  The DME add-ons or upgrades are intended primarily for convenience or upgrades beyond what is necessary to meet the member’s legitimate medical needs. Examples include: decorative items, unique materials (e.g. magnesium wheelchairs wheels, lights, extra batteries, etc.)*; or
*  When it does not provide a therapeutic benefit to a patient in need because of certain medical conditions or illnesses; or
*  When the DME has not been prescribed by a licensed provider; or
*  When the DME serves primarily as a comfort or convenience item. Trays, back packs, wheelchair racing equipment are examples of non-covered or convenience items*; or
*  When the equipment is used in a facility that is expected to provide such items to the patient; or
*  When the devices and equipment are used to enhance the environmental setting (for example; air conditioners, humidifiers, air filters, portable Jacuzzi pumps, or chair lifts used to go up and down the stairs). These are not primarily medical in nature and will not be eligible for coverage*; or
*  For equipment delivery services and set-up, education and training for patient and family, and nursing visits, are not eligible for separate reimbursement regardless of agreement to rent or purchase.
*  For DME add-ons or upgrades that are intended primarily for member/caregiver convenience, or that do not significantly enhance DME functionality.*

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6857">An '''endless tape cartridge''' is a [[tape cartridge]] or cassette that contains magnetic [[audio tape]] that can be played in an [[Loop recording|endless loop]], without the need to rewind to repeat.

==Description==
The endless tape cartridge has a [[tape transport]] that allows forward movement only. The magnetic tape can have start and end markers, like a magnetic beacon, an electric conductive splice, a hole that can be optically scanned, or a transparent splice tape. The cartridge was invented by sound engineer [[Bernard Cousino|Bernard A. Cousino]] and it dominated the North American market for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1= Nielsen Business Media Inc|Periodical=Billboard|Title=Cousino Cartridge Leads Tape Race|Publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;24|Date=1956-02-25|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=pR4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|AccessDate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first products that used the endless tape technology was the Audio Vendor from 1952, an invention of Cousino's.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=David Morton|Title=Sound recording. The life story of a technology|Publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|PublicationPlace=Baltimore, Md|At=p.&amp;nbsp;157|ISBN=0-8018-8398-9|Date=2006|language=German|URL=[https://books.google.de/books?id=0ZmjkJwxyWcC&amp;pg=PA157 books.google.de]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered as patent US2804401A. The tape is passed through an inner ring of loose tape [[reel]], where the recording is stored, and looped back through the outer ring of the reel. Initially, this mechanism was to be implemented in a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel audio tape recorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Magnetic sound tape|Date=1955-04-11|language=German|URL=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2804401A/en|AccessDate=2018-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Audio|Publisher=Radio Magazine, Incorporated|At=p.&amp;nbsp;83|Date=1963|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=josqAQAAMAAJ&amp;PA83|AccessDate=2018-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, Cousino developed a plastic case that could be hung up on some existing tape recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=High Fidelity|Publisher=Audiocom|At=p.&amp;nbsp;357|Date=1973|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=3WRLAAAAYAAJ&amp;PA357|AccessDate=2018-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cartridge was marketed by [[John Herbert Orr]] as Orrtronic Tapette.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|Publisher=Audio Engineering Society.|Date=1967|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=JixWAAAAMAAJ&amp;PA6|AccessDate=2018-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this generation, the magnetic coating of the tape was wound on the inside of the reel. Later cartridge types had the magnetic layer aligned to the outside of the cartridge, which required a specially designed recorder to play it. One traction of the tape by [[Tape transport|capstan]] was added, which allowed users the convenience of just pushing the cartridge into the recorder without having to thread the tape.{{clarify |date=November 2018 |reason=should this be once tape traction was added, users could ... |text=one traction of the tape by capstan}} These cassettes needed no internal space for the [[tape head]] slider because they accessed the tape from outside the cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Tape cartridge|Date=1957-01-22|language=German|URL=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2922642A/en|AccessDate=2018-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on these new cassettes, [[George Eash]] developed the [[Fidelipac]] cartridge in 1954.&lt;ref name="Kernfeld"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Barry Kernfeld|Title=Pop song piracy. Disobedient music distribution since 1929|Publisher=University of Chicago Press|PublicationPlace=Chicago / London|At=p.&amp;nbsp;151|ISBN=978-0-226-43184-0|Date=2011|language=German|URL=[https://books.google.de/books?id=9AK28kNS4O0C&amp;pg=PA151 books.google.de]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PlayTape]] and the [[8-track tape]] and endless [[Compact Cassette|compact cassette]]s for the announcement text of [[answering machine]]s were made with this technique. The take-up roll got a table and the [[perforation]] for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] was removed.{{clarify |date=November 2018}} There was no rear winding roll inside such a cassette so rewinding was impossible. Previously, a similar technique was used to store [[Tefifon]]'s vinyl sonic tape in the Tefi cartridge.

Another invention patented by Cousino was the [[Graphite|graphite coating]] applied to the bottom side of the tape in endless cartridges.&lt;ref name="Kernfeld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Billboard|Title=.|Volume=83|Publisher=Billboard Publications|At=p.&amp;nbsp;134|Date=January 1971|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=UfMiAQAAMAAJ&amp;PA=134|AccessDate=2018-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Title=Magnetic sound recording tapes|Date=1963-04-02|language=German|URL=https://patents.google.com/patent/CA660361A/en|AccessDate=2018-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coating allowed endless tape to be pulled out without crinkling it. 8-track cassettes also used the coating which caused the bottom side of the tape to be grey in colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1= Nielsen Business Media Inc|Periodical=Billboard|Title=Frictionless Tape Ready|Issue=28|Publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;50|Date=1963-04-20|language=German|URL=https://books.google.de/books?id=YQsEAAAAMBAJ|AccessDate=2018-05-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technological predecessor of the endless cartridge ==
* Magnetic [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|audio tape]] (1933)
* [[Tefifon]] (1936) – the vinyl sonic tape was similarly stored in the Tefi cartridge, but without any reel
* Audio Vendor – an assembly to install on a reel-to-reel [[Tape recorder|tape recorder device]] by Bernard Cousino
* Stereo tape (1953) – first stereo audio storage for end users

== List of endless tape cartridges ==

The '''Gansu Wind Farm Project''' or '''Jiuquan Wind Power Base''' is a group of large [[wind farm]]s under construction in western [[Gansu province]] in [[China]].  The Gansu Wind Farm Project is located in desert areas near the city of [[Jiuquan]] in two localities of [[Guazhou County]] and also near [[Yumen City]], in the northwest province of [[Gansu]], which has an abundance of wind resources.&lt;ref name="CD-2010.11.04" /&gt;
The complex has a planned capacity of 8 GW.

== Overview ==
The project is one of six national [[wind power]] megaprojects approved by the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]].&lt;ref name="CD-2010.11.04" /&gt; It is expected to grow to 20,000 [[megawatts]] by 2020, at an estimated cost of 120 billion Chinese yuan ($17.5 billion). The project is being built by more than 20 developers in two localities in [[Guazhou County]] and also near [[Yumen City]].&lt;ref name=reu&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5771IP20090808 China Starts Building First 10-GW Mega Wind Farm], ''[[Reuters]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windpowermonthly.com/news/1016805/Chinas-Jiuquan-wind-farm-speeds-construction/|title=China's Jiuquan wind farm speeds up construction|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction phases ==
[[File:Wind Farm In Gansu PRC.JPG|thumb|A wind turbine in the wind farm]]
[[File:Guazhou.champs éoliennes.2.jpg|thumb|Gansu Wind Farm]]
The project is divided into multiple phases. The first 3,800 MW phase consisted of eighteen 200 MW wind farms and two 100 MW wind farms. The second 8,000 MW phase consists of forty 200 MW wind farms. The planned capacity is 5,160 MW by 2010, 12,710 MW by 2015 and 20,000 MW in 2020.&lt;ref name=reu /&gt; 

In 2008, construction began on a 750 kV AC power line to carry electricity from the wind farm,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fairley. [http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/23460/page2/ China's Potent Wind Potential] ''[[Technology Review]]'', September 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and construction of the wind farms themselves started in August 2009.&lt;ref name=reu /&gt; Power in 2012 was being purchased for 0.54 yuan per kWh, compared with electricity from coal fired powerplants at 0.3 yuan per kWh.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2012.03.19"&gt;Watts, Jonathan &amp; Huang, Cecily. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/19/china-windfarms-renewable-energy Winds Of Change Blow Through China As Spending On Renewable Energy Soars], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 19, 2012, revised on March 20, 2012. Retrieved January 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since operations began, some 6.26 billion kWh has been generated as of October 31, 2011 with 5.96 billion kWh of that produced in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2011/11/02/5902457.htm|title=Wind power generation from Jiuquan base hits 6.26 bln kwh by end-Oct.|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 officials announced the completion of the project's first phase, involving the installation of over 3,500 wind turbines with an installed capacity of approximately 5,160 MW according to Wang Jianxin, director of the Jiuquan Development and Reform Commission.&lt;ref name="CD-2010.11.04"&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2010-11/04/content_11502951.htm Xinhua: Jiuquan Wind Power Base Completes First Stage], ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', November 4, 2010. Retrieved from ChinaDaily.com.cn website January 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Total installed capacity rose to approximately 6,000 MW in March 2012—roughly equivalent to the United Kingdom's entire wind power capacity at that time—with new wind turbines being erected at the rate of 36 per day.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

==Coordinated control centre==
On March 1, 2012, a "wind power coordinated control system" was implemented to adjust the output of the 18 wind farms of the Gansu Wind Farm Project, which total 10&amp;nbsp;GW, to meet the needs of the transmission grid, which is limited to 1.5&amp;nbsp;GW. This permitted the production of 1&amp;nbsp;GWh more per day than previously, and greatly improves the system's stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/asia/china-gansu-wind-farm.html|title=It Can Power a Small Nation. But This Wind Farm in China Is Mostly Idle.|last=Hernández|first=Javier C.|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeccomposites.com/news/composites-news/china-northwest-grid-wind-electricity-coordinated-control-system|title=China northwest grid wind electricity coordinated control system|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtailment of wind turbine operations is a first order method for dealing with the intermittency of wind, but normally loses available output when the power grid's transmission capacity has been reached. Other methods involve either added local industrial usage or added local storage capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47187.pdf The Role Of Energy Storage With Renewable Electricity Generation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/users/papers/engr/ernesto/farrew2/Project/research/1D543506d01.pdf Management of variable electricity loads in wind e Hydrogen systems: The case of a Spanish wind farm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand and utilization==
With local-government favoritism toward coal and inadequate long-distance transmission capacity, Gansu "now has some of the highest rates of underutilization in the wind sector in China". [[National_Development_and_Reform_Commission#National_Energy_Administration|National Energy Administration]] statistics showed 39 percent of wind capacity in 2015 in Jiuquan was wasted.&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;Hernández, Javier C., [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/asia/china-gansu-wind-farm.html "It Can Power a Small Nation. But This Wind Farm in China Is Mostly Idle."], ''New York Times]]'', January 15, 2017. Retrieved 2017-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Gansu is far from full capacity and the wind farm is producing less than half of its full potential. The two main reasons why this is happening is that Gansu is located far from the major Chinese cities and that there is a lack of demand for wind energy in China.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/15/world/asia/china-gansu-wind-farm.html|title=It Can Power a Small Nation. But This Wind Farm in China Is Mostly Idle.|last=Hernández|first=Javier C.|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gansu wind farm sits along the [[Gobi desert]] where there are extremely high winds. However, this location is about a thousand miles from China’s high density port cities that would serve as the biggest consumer of this energy.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
There is a lack of enough infrastructure and transmission lines that would allow the energy to flow into the cities.
There is still also little demand for wind power in China compared to coal. Although China’s central government is actively trying to reduce its emissions and build its clean energy sector, the local governments still push coal on their local industries because it creates more economic output and because the coal is mined locally, which helps local coal companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43564">[[File:The development and the ways to rejuvenate cells - en.svg|thumbnail|Diagram of the ways to reprogram cells along with the development of humans.]]'''Human cloning''' is the creation of a genetically identical copy (or [[Cloning|clone]]) of a [[human]]. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human [[Cell (biology)|cells]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]]. The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[laws]] regarding human cloning and its legality.

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are: ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{As of|2017|04|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.

==History==
Although the possibility of [[cloning]] humans had been the subject of speculation for much of the 20th century, scientists and policy makers began to take the prospect seriously in the mid-1960s.

Nobel Prize-winning geneticist [[Joshua Lederberg]] advocated cloning and [[genetic engineering]] in an article in [[The American Naturalist]] in 1966 and again, the following year, in [[The Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lederberg Joshua | year = 1966 | title = Experimental Genetics and Human Evolution | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 100 | issue = 915| pages = 519–531 | doi=10.1086/282446}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sparked a debate with conservative bioethicist [[Leon Kass]], who wrote at the time that "the programmed reproduction of man will, in fact, dehumanize him." Another [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Laureate]], [[James D. Watson]], publicized the potential and the perils of cloning in his [[Atlantic Monthly]] essay, "Moving Toward the Clonal Man", in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, James. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/moving-toward-the-clonal-man/305435/ "Moving Toward a Clonal Man: Is This What We Want?"] The Atlantic Monthly (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cloning of a sheep known as [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] in 1996 by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT), the idea of human cloning became a hot debate topic.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news|title=Researchers Clone Cells From Two Adult Men|first= Alice |last= Park| date= April 17, 2014|work=Time|url=http://time.com/65610/cloning-cells-from-two-adult-men/|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations outlawed it, while a few scientists promised to make a clone within the next few years. The first [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] human clone was created in November 1998, by [[Advanced Cell Technology]]. It was created using SCNT - a nucleus was taken from a man's leg cell and inserted into a cow's egg from which the nucleus had been removed, and the hybrid cell was cultured, and developed into an [[embryo]]. The embryo was destroyed after 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/371378.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Details of hybrid clone revealed | date=June 18, 1999 | accessdate= April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 and 2005, [[Hwang Woo-suk]], a professor at [[Seoul National University]], published two separate articles in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] claiming to have successfully harvested pluripotent, [[embryonic stem cells]] from a cloned human blastocyst using somatic-cell nuclear transfer techniques. Hwang claimed to have created eleven different patent-specific stem cell lines. This would have been the first major breakthrough in human cloning.&lt;ref&gt;Fischbak, Ruth L., John D. Loike, Janet Mindes, and Columbia Center for New Media Teaching &amp; Learning. [http://stemcellbioethics.wikischolars.columbia.edu/The+Cloning+Scandal+of+Hwang+Woo-Suk The Cloning Scandal of Hwang Woo-Suk], part of the online course, [http://stemcellbioethics.wikischolars.columbia.edu/ Stem Cells: Biology, Ethics, and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006 ''Science'' retracted both of his articles on clear evidence that much of his data from the experiments was fabricated.&lt;ref name="pmid17138870"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kennedy D | title = Responding to fraud | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5804 | pages = 1353 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17138870 | doi = 10.1126/science.1137840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Dr. Andrew French and [[Samuel H. Wood|Samuel Wood]] of the biotechnology company [[Stemagen]] announced that they successfully created the first five mature human embryos using SCNT. In this case, each embryo was created by taking a nucleus from a skin cell (donated by Wood and a colleague) and inserting it into a human egg from which the nucleus had been removed. The embryos were developed only to the [[blastocyst]] stage, at which point they were studied in processes that destroyed them.  Members of the lab said that their next set of experiments would aim to generate embryonic stem cell lines; these are the "holy grail" that would be useful for therapeutic or reproductive cloning.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Weiss for the Washington Post January 18, 2008 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/17/AR2008011700324.html?hpid=topnews Mature Human Embryos Created From Adult Skin Cells]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18202077"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French AJ, Adams CA, Anderson LS, Kitchen JR, Hughes MR, Wood SH | title = Development of human cloned blastocysts following somatic cell nuclear transfer with adult fibroblasts | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 485–93 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18202077 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.2007-0252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, scientists at the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] announced that they had succeeded in generating embryonic stem cell lines, but their process involved leaving the [[oocyte]]'s nucleus in place, resulting in [[triploid]] cells, which would not be useful for cloning.&lt;ref name=TrounsonComment/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21979046"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noggle S, Fung HL, Gore A, Martinez H, Satriani KC, Prosser R, Oum K, Paull D, Druckenmiller S, Freeby M, Greenberg E, Zhang K, Goland R, Sauer MV, Leibel RL, Egli D | title = Human oocytes reprogram somatic cells to a pluripotent state | journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7367 | pages = 70–5 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21979046 | doi = 10.1038/nature10397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21979039"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daley GQ, Solbakk JH | title = Stem cells: Triple genomes go far | journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7367 | pages = 40–1 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21979039 | doi = 10.1038/478040a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a group of scientists led by [[Shoukhrat Mitalipov]] published the first report of embryonic stem cells created using SCNT. In this experiment, the researchers developed a protocol for using SCNT in human cells, which differs slightly from the one used in other organisms.  Four embryonic stem cell lines from human fetal somatic cells were derived from those blastocysts. All four lines were derived using oocytes from the same donor, ensuring that all [[mitochondrial DNA]] inherited was identical.&lt;ref name=TrounsonComment&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trounson A, DeWitt ND | title = Pluripotent stem cells from cloned human embryos: success at long last | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 636–8 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23746970 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2013.05.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, a team led by [[Robert Lanza]] at Advanced Cell Technology reported that they had replicated Mitalipov's results and further demonstrated the effectiveness by cloning adult cells using SCNT.&lt;ref name=TIME /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24746675"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chung YG, Eum JH, Lee JE, Shim SH, Sepilian V, Hong SW, Lee Y, Treff NR, Choi YH, Kimbrel EA, Dittman RE, Lanza R, Lee DR | title = Human somatic cell nuclear transfer using adult cells | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 777–80 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24746675 | doi = 10.1016/j.stem.2014.03.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)===
{{Main|Somatic cell nuclear transfer}}
[[File:Cloning diagram english.svg|thumb|Diagram of SCNT Process]]

In somatic cell nuclear transfer ("SCNT"), the nucleus of a [[somatic cell]] is taken from a donor and transplanted into a host [[oocyte|egg cell]], which had its own genetic material removed previously, making it an enucleated egg. After the donor somatic cell genetic material is transferred into the host oocyte with a micropipette, the somatic cell genetic material is fused with the egg using an electric current. Once the two cells have fused, the new cell can be permitted to grow in a [[in vivo|surrogate]] or [[in vitro|artificially]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= Scott F. |date=2013-06-30 |title= Developmental Biology| edition= 10th |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. |pages=32–33 |isbn=9780878939787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process that was used to successfully clone Dolly the sheep (see section on '''History''' in this article).&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;

===Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)===
[[File:Overview of iPS cells.png|thumb|left|Overview of iPS cells]]
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Creating induced [[Pluripotency|pluripotent]] [[stem cell]]s ("iPSCs") is a long and inefficient process. [[cell potency|Pluripotency]] refers to a stem cell that has the potential to [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into any of the three [[germ layers]]: [[endoderm]] (interior stomach lining, gastrointestinal tract, the lungs), [[mesoderm]] (muscle, bone, blood, urogenital), or [[ectoderm]] (epidermal tissues and nervous tissue).&lt;ref name=Binder&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1= Binder| editor-first1= Marc D.|title=Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|year=2009|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540237358|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|editor-last2=Hirokawa| editor-first2= Nobutaka| editor-first3= Uwe |editor-last3= Windhorst}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specific set of genes, often called "reprogramming factors", are introduced into a specific adult cell type. These factors send [[cell signalling|signals]] in the mature cell that cause the cell to become a pluripotent stem cell. This process is highly studied and new techniques are being discovered frequently on how to better this induction process.

Depending on the method used, reprogramming of adult cells into iPSCs for [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] could have severe limitations in humans. If a [[virus]] is used as a reprogramming factor for the cell, cancer-causing genes called [[oncogenes]] may be [[regulation of gene expression|activated]]. These cells would appear as rapidly dividing cancer cells that do not respond to the body's natural cell signaling process. However, in 2008 scientists discovered a technique that could remove the presence of these oncogenes after pluripotency induction, thereby increasing the potential use of iPSC in humans.&lt;ref name="Cancer threat removed"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-stemcell6-2009mar06,0,63456.story |title= Cancer threat removed from stem cells, scientists say |newspaper= Los Angeles Times | first= Karen | last= Kaplan | date= March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparing SCNT to reprogramming===
Both the processes of SCNT and iPSCs have benefits and deficiencies. Historically, reprogramming methods were better studied than SCNT derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs).&lt;ref name=TrounsonComment/&gt; However, more recent studies have put more emphasis on developing new procedures for SCNT-ESCs. The major advantage of SCNT over iPSCs at this time is the speed with which cells can be produced. iPSCs derivation takes several months while SCNT would take a much shorter time, which could be important for medical applications. New studies are working to improve the process of iPSC in terms of both speed and efficiency with the discovery of new reprogramming factors in oocytes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Another advantage SCNT could have over iPSCs is its potential to treat [[mitochondrial disease]], as it utilizes a donor oocyte.&lt;ref name=TrounsonComment/&gt; No other advantages are known at this time in using stem cells derived from one method over stem cells derived from the other.&lt;ref name="pmid24180743"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Langerova A, Fulka H, Fulka J | title = Somatic cell nuclear transfer-derived embryonic stem cell lines in humans: pros and cons | journal = Cell Reprogram | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 481–3 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24180743 | doi = 10.1089/cell.2013.0054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses, actual and potential==
[[File:Stem cell treatments.png|thumb|Stem cell treatments]]

Work on cloning techniques has advanced our basic understanding of [[developmental biology]] in humans. Observing human pluripotent stem cells grown in culture provides great insight into [[Human embryogenesis|human embryo development]], which otherwise cannot be seen. Scientists are now able to better define steps of early human development. Studying [[signal transduction]] along with genetic manipulation within the early human embryo has the potential to provide answers to many developmental diseases and defects. Many human-specific signaling pathways have been discovered by studying human embryonic stem cells. Studying developmental pathways in humans has given developmental biologists more evidence toward the hypothesis that developmental pathways are conserved throughout species.&lt;ref name="pmid23362344"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhu Z, Huangfu D | title = Human pluripotent stem cells: an emerging model in developmental biology | journal = Development | volume = 140 | issue = 4 | pages = 705–17 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23362344 | pmc = 3557771 | doi = 10.1242/dev.086165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical implications==
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

[[File:Cloning -Twins 1990.jpg|250px|thumb|rigth| Human cloning]]
In [[bioethics]], the ethics of cloning refers to a variety of [[ethical]] positions regarding the practice and possibilities of [[cloning]], especially human cloning. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well. Human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kfoury C | title = Therapeutic cloning: Promises and issues | journal = [[McGill Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 112–20 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18523539 | pmc = 2323472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to stave off the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;{{cite book |last=de Grey |first=Aubrey |last2=Rae |first2=Michael |year=2007 |title=Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime |location=New York, NY |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-36706-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates for reproductive cloning believe that parents who cannot otherwise procreate should have access to the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author= Staff |work= [[Times Higher Education]]| date= August 10, 2001| url= http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/164313.article| title= In the news: Antinori and Zavos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to therapeutic cloning mainly centers around the status of [[embryonic stem cells]], which has connections with the [[abortion debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kfoury C | year = 2007 | title = Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | journal = Mcgill J Med. | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 112–20 | pmid = 18523539 | pmc=2323472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of reproductive cloning have concerns that technology is not yet developed enough to be safe - for example, the position of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] {{As of|2014|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aaas.org/page/american-association-advancement-science-statement-human-cloning| title = AAAS Statement on Human Cloning}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others emphasize that reproductive cloning could be prone to abuse (leading to the generation of humans whose organs and tissues would be harvested),&lt;ref name="McGee"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee |first=G. |title=Primer on Ethics and Human Cloning |date=October 2011 |publisher=American Institute of Biological Sciences |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotech/mcgee.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223142719/http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotech/mcgee.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=UNESCO |date=1997-11-11 |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13177&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have concerns about how cloned individuals could integrate with families and with society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Glenn |year=2000 |title=The Perfect Baby: Parenthood in the New World of Cloning and Genetics |location=Lanham |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8476-9758-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Cloning Ethics"&gt;{{cite web| last= Havstad| first= Joyce| title= Human Reproductive Cloning: A Conflict of Liberties|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious groups are divided, with some{{which|date=May 2014}} opposing the technology as usurping god's (in monotheistic traditions) place and, to the extent embryos are used, destroying a human life; others support therapeutic cloning's potential life-saving benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Bob| last= Sullivan| publisher= MSNBC| date= November 26, 2003 |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3076930/ |title= Religions reveal little consensus on cloning | access-date= September 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=William |last=Sims Bainbridge |url=http://jetpress.org/volume13/bainbridge.htm |title=Religious Opposition to Cloning |work=Journal of Evolution and Technology |volume=13 |date=October 2003 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Canadian law prohibits the following: cloning humans, cloning stem cells, growing human embryos for research purposes, and buying or selling of embryos, sperm, eggs or other human reproductive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Canada Closes Door on Cloning | work=Wired | last=Philipkoski | first=Kristen | url=http://archive.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2004/03/62695 | date=17 March 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also bans making changes to human DNA that would pass from one generation to the next, including use of animal DNA in humans. Surrogate mothers are legally allowed, as is donation of sperm or eggs for reproductive purposes. Human embryos and stem cells are also permitted to be donated for research.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

There have been consistent calls in Canada to ban human reproductive cloning since the 1993 Report of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies. Polls have indicated that an overwhelming majority of Canadians oppose human reproductive cloning, though the regulation of human cloning continues to be a significant national and international policy issue.  The notion of "human dignity" is commonly used to justify cloning laws. The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Overview of World Human Cloning Policies| work= Connexions |access-date= September 15, 2016| url= http://cnx.org/content/m14834/latest/ | first= Kristin| last= Matthews| date= | publisher= [[Rice University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Canada Bans Human Cloning| publisher= republished at Questia.com| work= The [[Hastings Center]] Report| access-date= 7 December 2011| first= Francoise| last= Baylis | url= https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5006805131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Kristen |last= Philipkoski | date= March 17, 2004| title= Canada Closes Door on Cloning |website= Wired.com | access-date= September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Regulating and treating conception problems| website= CBC.ca |date= December 21, 2010 |access-date= 7 December 2011| url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2009/02/05/f-reprotech.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on November 15, 2001, a [[Pro-life movement|pro-life]] group won a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] legal challenge, which struck down the regulation and effectively left all forms of cloning unregulated in the UK. Their hope was that Parliament would fill this gap by passing prohibitive legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Medical Law and Ethics |author=SD Pattinson |year=2006 |publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell |isbn=978-0-421-88950-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1657707.stm |title=Campaigners win cloning challenge |publisher=BBC News |date=15 November 2001 |accessdate=2008-09-06 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament was quick to pass the [[Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001]] which explicitly prohibited reproductive cloning. The remaining gap with regard to therapeutic cloning was closed when the appeals courts reversed the previous decision of the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2846265.stm|title=Lords uphold cloning law|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 March 2003 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first license was granted on August 11, 2004 to researchers at the [[Newcastle University|University of Newcastle]] to allow them to investigate treatments for [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/1048.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009024233/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/en/1048.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 October 2007 |publisher=[[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority|HFEA]] |title=HFEA grants the first therapeutic cloning licence for research |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=2008-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008]], a major review of fertility legislation, repealed the 2001 Cloning Act by making amendments of similar effect to the 1990 Act. The 2008 Act also allows experiments on hybrid human-animal embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7682722.stm|title=MPs support embryology proposals|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
On December 13, 2001, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] began elaborating an international convention against the reproductive cloning of humans. A broad coalition of States, including [[Spain]], [[Italy]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United States]], [[Costa Rica]] and the [[Holy See]] sought to extend the debate to ban all forms of human cloning, noting that, in their view, therapeutic human cloning violates human dignity. Costa Rica proposed the adoption of an international convention to ban all forms of human cloning. Unable to reach a consensus on a binding convention, in March 2005 a non-binding United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning, calling for the ban of all forms of human cloning contrary to human dignity, was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioeticaweb.com/content/view/1267/765/lang,es/ "United Nations Declaration on Human Cloning"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215040939/http://www.bioeticaweb.com/content/view/1267/765/lang,es/ |date=2013-12-15 }}. Bio Etica Web. March 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/law/cloning/ |title=Ad Hoc Committee on an International Convention against the Reproductive Cloning of Human Beings |accessdate=2007-01-28|date=18 May 2005|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The Patients First Act of 2017 (HR 2918, 115th Congress) aims to promote stem cell research, using cells that are “ethically obtained”, that could contribute to a better understanding of diseases and therapies, and promote the “derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines without the creation of human embryos…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Patients First Act of 2017 (HR 2918, 115th Congress)
| date = Oct 19, 2017 | url=http://scipol.duke.edu/content/patients-first-act-2017-hr-2918-115th-congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009, the US Congress voted whether to ban all human cloning, both reproductive and therapeutic (see [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]]). Each time, divisions in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], or an eventual veto from the sitting President (President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2007), over therapeutic cloning prevented either competing proposal (a ban on both forms or on reproductive cloning only) from being passed into law. On March 10, 2010 a bill (HR 4808) was introduced with a section banning federal funding for human cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.4808 - Stem Cell Research Advancement Act of 2009|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4808|website=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a law, if passed, would not have prevented research from occurring in private institutions (such as universities) that have both private and federal funding. However, the 2010 law was not passed.

There are currently no federal laws in the United States which ban cloning completely. Fifteen American states ([[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Indiana]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[North Dakota]], [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Virginia]]) ban reproductive cloning and three states ([[Arizona]], [[Maryland]], and [[Missouri]]) prohibit use of public funds for such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Embryonic and fetal research laws | publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures | date= Jan 1, 2016 | url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/embryonic-and-fetal-research-laws.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Further|Cloning#In popular culture|:Category:Cloning in fiction}}

Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically human cloning, due to the fact that it brings up controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|publisher=The Hastings Center|volume=28|pages=6–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |first=Yvonne A. |last= De La Cruz |title= Science Fiction Storytelling and Identity: Seeing the Human Through Android Eyes| website=CSUStan.edu |publisher= California State University, Stanislaus|format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humorous fiction, such as ''[[Multiplicity (film)|Multiplicity]]'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Roger| last= Ebert| url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/multiplicity-1996| website= RogerEbert.com| title= Multiplicity| access-date= September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maxwell Smart]] feature ''[[The Nude Bomb]]'' (1980), have featured human cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Nude Bomb | website= DVDTalk.com| url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33911/nude-bomb-the/ | first= Todd Jr.| last= Douglass | date= July 12, 2008| access-date= September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplants|transplantation]]. Robin Cook's 1997 novel ''[[Chromosome 6 (novel)|Chromosome 6]]''  and Michael Bay's ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' are examples of this; ''Chromosome 6'' also features [[genetic manipulation]] and [[xenotransplantation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Chromosome-6-Robin-Cook-review-qpuotlmpt| title= A Chiller Thriller |author= tech-writer| date= September 30, 2005| access-date= September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a series named [[Orphan Black]] which follows human clones' stories and experiences as they deal with issues and react to being the property of a chain of scientific institutions.

'''ikeGPS Limited''' is a technology company that designs and manufactures measurement solutions - smart laser-based field tools, mobile software apps and industry specific cloud software solutions for measuring, modeling and managing assets. 

==History==
ikeGPS was founded in the mid-2000s by a group of engineers seeking to design and commercialize a solution to enable the capture of verifiable geodata of offset assets and targets for use in [[Geographical Information Systems]].  ikeGPS is headquartered in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], with offices in [[Broomfield, Colorado]] and [[Seattle, Washington]].

==Products==
IkeGPS allows a user to quickly record the geodata of multiple targets together with their photographs.  ikeGPS lets the user do this from a distance, which is helpful if the user is dealing with any hard to reach or dangerous target.  In 2009, GPS World reviewed ikeGPS as the best GPS device in the world for its purpose because of its unique capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/defense/gps-insights-early-september-2008-8454 |title=I like Ike|work=gpsworld.com |accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spike product uses a phone camera, a laser-based system and mobile app software to capture height, width, and distance of any object with advertised 3% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.ikegps.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2341824-tips-for-troubleshooting-measurement-accuracy-issues&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in a measurement of 100 feet, the error will be approximately 3 feet - substantially greater than using steel tape, but acceptable for rough measurements where time and accessibility are more important than accuracy. 

==Applications==
ikeGPS is used around the world by utilities for pole audits and asset management, by intelligence and defense groups and by other organisations for [[emergency management]] and [[enterprise asset management]].  A major user of the ikeGPS is the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] who have deployed the ikeGPS across a range of applications, for example after the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]] – so that engineers could send back information about the scale of problems to be dealt with at different sites, and in Afghanistan and Iraq – for rapid mapping of infrastructure.  Organisations are also using ikeGPS for humanitarian [[demining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/survey/news/surveylab039s-ikegps-detecting-mines-azerbaijan-7154 |title=Surveylab's ikeGPS Detecting Mines in Azerbaijan|work=gpsworld.com |accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveylab's partners include [[Science Applications International Corporation]]. 

ESRI recently announced the use of the Spike device with ESRI's Collector for ArcGIS to improve annual signage inventory and mapping in Carbon County, Utah, USA, reducing inventory costs to one-tenth their original cost, and resulting in a 568% return on investment. &lt;ref&gt;ESRI News for State and Local Government, Fall 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Interleaving (disambiguation){{!}}Interleaving}}

In [[computing]], '''interleaving''' of data refers to the interspersing of [[Fields (computing)|fields]] or channels of different meaning sequentially in [[Memory (computing)|memory]], in [[processor registers]], or in [[file format]]s. For example, for [[coordinate]] data, &lt;code&gt;x0 y0 z0 w0 x1 y1 z1 w1 x2 y2 z2 w2&lt;/code&gt; is interleaved whilst &lt;code&gt;x0 x1 x2 x3 y0 y1 y2 y3 z0 z1 z2 z3 w0 w1 w2 w3&lt;/code&gt; is not.

A processor may support [[permute instruction]]s, or strided [[load and store instructions]], for moving between interleaved and non-interleaved representations.

Interleaving has performance implications for [[cache coherency]], ease of leveraging [[SIMD]] hardware, and leveraging a computer's [[addressing mode]]s. (e.g. - interleaved data may require one address to be calculated, from which individual fields may then be accessed via [[immediate offset (addressing mode)|immediate offset]]s; conversely if only one field is required by index, de-interleaved data may leverage [[scaled index addressing]]).

'''Jaime Teevan''' is an American [[computer scientist]] known for her research in [[human-computer interaction]] and [[information retrieval]]. She is particularly known for the work she has done on [[personalized search]]. According to the [[Technology Review]], Teevan "is a leader in using data about people's knowledge, preferences, and habits to help them manage information.&lt;ref name="tr35"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kleiner|first=Kurt|title=TR35: Jaime Teevan, 32|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/Profile.aspx?Cand=T&amp;TRID=778|accessdate=10 March 2011|newspaper=Technology Review|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Biography==
Teevan received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Computer Science]] from [[Yale University]] and a Ph.D. and S.M. from [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csail.mit.edu/~teevan/work/publications/theses/phd/thesis.pdf] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.csail.mit.edu/~teevan/work/publications/theses/masters/thesis.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907105844/http://www.csail.mit.edu/~teevan/work/publications/theses/masters/thesis.pdf# |archive-date=2008-09-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently a researcher at [[Microsoft Research]] and an affiliate associate professor at the [[University of Washington]]. There she co-authored the first book on [[collaborative information seeking]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Meredith Ringel and Teevan, Jaime|title=Collaborative Search: Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How|year=2010|publisher=Morgan and Claypool Publishers|isbn=1-60845-121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also edited a book on [[Personal Information Management]] (PIM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jones, William |editor2=Teevan, Jaime|title=Personal Information Management|year=2007|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=0-295-98737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
edited a special issue of Communications of the ACM on the topic, and organized workshops on [[PIM (software)|PIM]] and query log analysis. She has published numerous technical papers, including several best papers, and was chair of the Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM) 2012 conference.

'''JasperReports''' is an [[open-source software|open source]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[report]]ing tool that can write to a variety of targets, such as: screen, a printer, into [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[OpenDocument|ODT]], [[Comma-separated values]] or [[XML]] files.

It can be used in Java-enabled applications, including [[Java EE]] or [[web application]]s, to generate dynamic content. It reads its instructions from an XML or .jasper file.

''JasperReports'' is part of the [[Lisog]] open source stack initiative.

==Features==
JasperReports is an open source reporting library that can be embedded into any Java application. Features include:
 
* Scriptlets may accompany the report definition,&lt;ref name="jw-09-2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2002/jw-0920-opensourceprofile.html|title=Reports made easy with JasperReports|work=JavaWorld.com|author=Erik Swenson|date= 2002-09-20|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the report definition can invoke at any point to perform additional processing.  The scriptlet is built using Java, and has many hooks that can be invoked before or after stages of the report generation, such as Report, Page, Column or Group.
* Sub-reports&lt;ref name="jspk200701"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.oio.de/public/opensource/JS_01_07_Reporting.pdf | title = Freie Reporting-Tools im Vergleich |author1=Christian Brell |author2=Tobias Kieninger | work = [[Orientations in Objects]]; [[JavaSpektrum]] | date = January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-07-14 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For users with more sophisticated report management requirements, reports designed for JasperReports can be easily imported into the ''JasperServer'' - the interactive report server.

Teodor Danciu began work on JasperReports in June 2001, the [[sf.net]] project was registered in September 2001&lt;ref name="rp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=8332|title=An Interview with Teodor Danciu of JasperReports|work=RootPrompt|date=February 16, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and JasperReports 0.1.5 was released on November 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freshmeat.net/projects/jasperreports/#comment-12052 freshmeat.net: Project details for JasperReports:Comment]&lt;/ref&gt;

JasperReports Version 1.0 was released on July 21, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35381|title=JasperReports 1.0 released|work=theserverside|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code was originally licensed under a copyleft ''JasperReports License''&lt;ref name="rp"/&gt; and later moved to [[LGPL]].

Jaspersoft was originally called Panscopic, and was founded by Al Campa, CEO, and Raj Bhargava, VP of Products in 2001.  Panscopic raised $23M from Doll Capital, Discovery Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Partech. In 2004 Panscopic teamed up with Teodor Danciu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/can-an-open-source-project-get-acquired-one-just-did/|title=Can an open source project get acquired? One just did.|work=zdnet blogs|date= April 25, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired the intellectual property of JasperReports, and changed the name of the company to Jaspersoft.  Brian Gentile became CEO in 2007.

Jaspersoft provides commercial software around the JasperReports product, and negotiate contracts with software developers that wish to embed the JasperReports engine into a closed source product.

Jaspersoft's main related product is JasperReports Server, a Java EE [[web application]] that provides advanced report server capabilities such as report scheduling and permissions. It is available under an open source license for use in conjunction with open source infrastructure such as [[MySQL]] and [[JBoss]], or a commercial license for enterprise deployments involving commercial databases and application servers.

Jaspersoft is a gold partner with MySQL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solutions.mysql.com/solutions/partner.php?partner=1102 |title=MySQL AB :: Jaspersoft |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2007-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101043646/http://solutions.mysql.com/solutions/partner.php?partner=1102 |archivedate=2007-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and JasperReports was included in the [[PostgreSQL]] distribution ''Bizgres'' version 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizgres.org/articles.php?id=9 |title=Bizgres 0.7 Released |date=August 3, 2005 |work=bizgres.org |accessdate=2007-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217065559/http://www.bizgres.org/articles.php?id=9 |archivedate=December 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2005/08/03/postgre_bi/|title=Bizgres gets down to business with open source BI stack|author=Gavin Clarke|work=RegDeveloper|date= 3 August 2005|accessdate=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osdbmigration.org/misc/case_datawarehouse.pdf |author=Jutta Horstmann |title=Migrating to Open Source Databases: The Data Warehouse Case Study |date=November 10, 2005 |accessdate=2007-01-11 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929043853/http://www.osdbmigration.org/misc/case_datawarehouse.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2014, [[TIBCO]] announced it had acquired Jaspersoft for  approximately $185 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2014/press1341.jsp TIBCO Software Acquires Jaspersoft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501140250/http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2014/press1341.jsp |date=2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==JRXML==
JasperReports reports are defined in an XML file format, called JRXML, which can be hand-coded, generated, or designed using a tool. The file format is defined by a [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) or [[XML schema]] for newer versions, providing limited interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ensode.net/jasperreports_intro.html|title=JasperReports Tutorial/Getting Started Guide|author=David R. Heffelfinger|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; JRXML files have the filename extension ''.jrxml''.

A ''.jasper'' file is a compiled version of a ''.jrxml'' file. iReport does the compilation on the fly, but the compilation can also get achieved at runtime using the JasperCompileManager class.

== IDE integration ==
Several Java [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]s, such as [[NetBeans]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and  [[IBM Websphere Studio Application Developer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0411_olivieri/0411_olivieri.html|title=Generating online reports using JasperReports and WebSphere Studio|author=Ricardo Olivieri|work=[[IBM developerWorks]]|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide instructions for users wishing to integrate JasperReports into a project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasperforge.org/jaspersoft/opensource/business_intelligence/ireport/ JasperReports Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James M. Williams''' (April 14, 1948 – June 12, 2011) was an [[analog circuit]] designer and technical author who worked for the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1968&amp;ndash;1979), [[George A. Philbrick|Philbrick]], [[National Semiconductor]] (1979&amp;ndash;1982) and [[Linear Technology]] Corporation (LTC) (1982&amp;ndash;2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor-last=Williams |editor-first=Jim |title=Analog Circuit Design: Art, Science, and Personalities |year=1991 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/54152596/Analog-Circuit-Design |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote over 350 publications&lt;ref name=BIB&gt;{{Citation |last=Lundberg |first=Kent |title=A Bibliography of Jim Williams |date=July 31, 2011 |publisher=MIT |url= http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/jw/jwbib.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; relating to analog circuit design, including 5 books, 21 application notes for [[National Semiconductor]], 62 application notes for [[Linear Technology]], and over 125 articles for [[EDN (magazine)|EDN Magazine]].

== Biography ==
Jyoti Prakash Tamang was born on 16 November 1961 in the mountain district of [[Darjeeling]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]  from [[Nepali Indian|Nepali parents]].&lt;ref name="NABS fellow"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nabsindia.org/profiles/jyotiprakashtamang.html |title=NABS fellow |date=2017-12-12 |website=National Academy of Biological Sciences |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his schooling at Turnbull High School, Darjeeling in 1977 and his pre-university course at the [[St Joseph's College, Darjeeling]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="NAAS Fellows"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://naasindia.org/detail.php?id=556 |title=NAAS Fellows |date=2017-12-06 |website=National Academy of Agricultural Sciences |access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His undergraduate education was at the [[Darjeeling Government College]] of [[North Bengal University]] from where he passed BSc honors in 1982 and continued at the institution to earn an MSc in microbiology in 1984, passing the examination winning a gold medal for academic excellence.&lt;ref name="Faculty profile"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cus.ac.in/index.php/en/schools/life-sciences/108-home/schools/life-sciences/department-of-microbiology/478-updated-prof-jyoti-prakash-tamang |title=Faculty profile |date=2017-12-12 |website=Sikkim University |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career in 1986 as an associate professor at the department of botany of [[Sikkim Government College, Tadong]] where he worked until 2011. Simultaneously, he enrolled at North Bengal University for his doctoral studies and after securing a PhD in microbiology in 1992, he did his post-doctoral work at two institutions abroad during 1994–95; first at the National Food Research Institute, [[Tsukuba]] with a fellowship from the [[United Nations University]]-[[Kirin Brewery Company]] and, later, at the Institute of Hygiene and Toxicology, [[Karlsruhe]], on a fellowship received from [[Volkswagen Foundation]]. In 2011, he joined [[Sikkim University|Central Sikkim University]] (CUS) as a member of faculty and has been serving the institution since then. He has held various positions at the university which included those of an academic coordinator, the dean of the School of Life Sciences, the registrar (the first registrar of the university) and a professor (presently the senior-most professor at CUS). He also serves as the officiating vice chancellor of the university.&lt;ref name="Jyoti Prakash Tamang on Sikkim University"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cus.ac.in/index.php/en/department-of-microbiology/prof-jyoti-prakash-tamang |title=Jyoti Prakash Tamang on Sikkim University |date=2017-12-12 |website=cus.ac.in |language=en-gb |access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between, he had a short stint at the Research Institute of Humanity and Nature of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, [[Kyoto]] as a visiting professor during 2009–10.&lt;ref name="NABS fellow" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Lurgi–Ruhrgas process was originally invented in the 1940s and further developed in the 1950s for a low-temperature liquefaction of [[lignite]] (brown coal).&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=coal/&gt;  The technology is named after its developers [[Lurgi AG|Lurgi Gesellschaft für Wärmetechnik G.m.b.H.]] and [[E.ON|Ruhrgas AG]]. Over a time, the process was used for coal processing in Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Argentina, and former Yugoslavia.  The plant in Japan processed also [[Petroleum cracking|cracking petroleum oils]] to [[Alkene|olefins]].&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

In 1947–1949, the Lurgi–Ruhrgas process was used in Germany for [[shale oil]] production. In [[Lukavac]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], two retorts for liquefaction of lignite were in operation from 1963 to 1968. The capacity of the plant was 850&amp;nbsp;tons of lignite per day.  The plant in [[Lincolnshire]], the United Kingdom, operated in 1978–1979 with capacity of 900&amp;nbsp;tons of coal per day. In late 1960s and early 1970s [[oil shale]]s from different European countries and from the [[Green River Formation]] of [[Colorado]], the  United States, were tested at the Lurgi's pilot plant in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=assessment&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the technology was promoted in cooperation with [[Dravo Corporation]]. In the 1970s, the technology was licensed to the Rio Blanco Shale Oil Project for construction of a modular retort in combination with the modified ''in situ'' process.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  However, this plan was terminated.

In 1980, the Natural Resources Authority of Jordan commissioned from the [[Klöckner]]-[[Lurgi AG|Lurgi]] consortium a pre-feasibility study of construction of an oil shale retorting complex in [[Jordan]] using the Lurgi–Ruhrgas process. However, although the study found the technology feasible, it was never implemented.&lt;ref name=jordan2&gt;

==Technology==
The Lurgi–Ruhrgas process is a hot recycled solids technology, which processes fine particles of coal or oil shale sized {{convert|0.25|to|0.5|in|mm|1}}. As a heat carrier, it uses spent [[char]] or [[spent oil shale]] (oil shale ash), mixed with sand or other more durable materials.&lt;ref name=coal&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat is transferred from the heated char or spent oil shale to the coal or raw oil shale causing pyrolysis. As a result, oil shale decomposes to shale oil vapors, [[oil shale gas]] and spent oil shale.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  The oil vapor and product gases pass through a hot cyclone for cleaning before sending to a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. In the condenser, shale oil is separated from product gases.&lt;ref name=coal/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon ([[char]]), is burnt at a lift pipe [[combustor]] to heat the process.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;  If necessary, additional fuel oil is used for combustion.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;  During the combustion process, heated solid particles in the pipe are moved to the surge bin by pre-heated air that is introduced from the bottom of the pipe. At the surge bin, solids and gases are separated, and solid particles are transferred to the mixer unit to conduct the pyrolysis of the raw oil shale.&lt;ref name=assembly&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages of this technology is the fact that produced shale oil vapors are mixed with shale ash causing impurities in shale oil. Ensuring the quality of produced shale oil is complicated as compared with other mineral dusts the shale ash is more difficult to collect.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

The '''Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Building''' ({{Lang-da|Klima-, Energi og Bygningsministeriet}}) is a governmental agency in [[Denmark]]. It is responsible for national climate policy and international cooperation on climate change, as well as energy issues, meteorology and national geological surveys in Denmark and Greenland.

==History==
The predecessor of the Ministry of Climate and Energy, the Ministry of Energy ({{Lang-da|Energiministeriet}}), was created in 1979, from the energy department of the [[Ministry of Trade of Denmark|Ministry of Trade]]. In 1994, it was merged with [[Danish Ministry of the Environment|Ministry of the Environment]] and in 2005 it was detached from that ministry, to be merged with [[Ministry of Transport and Energy of Denmark|Ministry of Transport and Energy]].

On 23 November 2007, the energy issues were de-merged from the Ministry of Transport and climate issues were de-merged from the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Climate and Energy was created.

==Minister==
The minister of climate and energy was [[Connie Hedegaard]] until November 2009 when she was replaced with [[Lykke Friis]]. [[Martin Lidegaard]] followed on 3 October 2011 who was replaced by [[Rasmus Helveg Petersen]] on 3 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.onlineenergievergelijker.nl/faq/| title=energy faq }} Wednesday, 18 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agencies==
{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}
The [[Danish Energy Agency]] belongs under this ministry.

The Danish Electricity Saving Trust ([[Elsparefonden]]) is an independent trust under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Climate and Energy. The Trust works to promote energy savings and a more efficient use of electricity.

[[File:Pupitre bois.jpg|thumb|200px|A heavy wooden music stand. This stand is designed for use in a private home or teaching studio. Its weight and fine finish make it unsuitable for daily transportation to rehearsals and gigs.]]
A '''music stand''' is a pedestal or elevated rack designed to hold a paper score or [[sheet music|sheets of music]] in position for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music stand|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/music-stand|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/music%20stand &lt;/ref&gt; Most music stands for [[orchestra]]l, [[chamber music]] or solo orchestra-family instruments (violin, oboe, trumpet, etc.) can be raised or lowered to accommodate seated or standing performers, or performers of different heights. Many types of keyboard instruments have a built-in or removable music rack or stand where sheet music can be placed. Music stands enable musicians to read sheet music or scores while playing an instrument or conducting, as the stand leaves the hands free. Music stands are sometimes used by singers, however for [[choir]]s, singers typically hold their sheet music in a folder, and singers performing solo recitals or [[opera]] performances typically memorize the lyrics and melodies. Some singers use stands, such as lounge singers and wedding vocalists who have a repertoire of hundreds of songs, which makes remembering all of the verses difficult.

==Types==
[[File:Abant Cuartet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A vocal group using music stands.]]
There are various types of music stands for different purposes and intended users. Folding stands collapse, which makes them convenient to take to rehearsals and performances out of the home. Folding stands are typically used by amateur musicians at rehearsals and performances. Professional musicians are more likely to limit their use of folding stands to rehearsals held outside of normal performance venues (e.g., a [[chamber music]] rehearsal at a private home) or small gigs. Non-folding stands tend to be used by professional orchestras and [[big band]]s for rehearsals and concerts.
===Folding===
====Lightweight====
[[File:Music stand metal folded.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A folding music stand in its collapsed position, ready for transportation.]]
Folding stands range from inexpensive, lightweight models made of metal, which are designed to hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal folding stands often have solid wire extensions or metal "arms" which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in [[youth orchestra]]s. Lightweight folding stands are designed to collapsible; if folding stands did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for [[rehearsal]]s, [[audition]]s and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring folding stands to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non-folding stands.

Lightweight stands are not designed to support heavy books of music such as full-size [[fake book]]s; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. Folding stands consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for supporting the rack, with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).

The portability of lightweight music stands can lead to some problems. Heavy fake books or full scores may overload the stand, leading to it falling over when a performer turns a page. As well, when a lightweight stand is used with its column fully extended, as by a standing orchestral timpanist or double bass player, a heavy part may be "tippy" on the over-extended column. Oversized parts, which are used in some [[contemporary classical music]], may be too wide to be supported by the stand; a solution that some musicians use is to use multiple stands for oversize parts. As well, during outdoor performances, such as playing at a wedding, picnic or a [[bandstand]], lightweight stands may be blown over by wind, which can interrupt a performance or even, if the stand strikes an instrument, damage the finish of an instrument.

====Heavy duty====
Heavy duty folding models typically use a hollow cylindrical column as the main support and three cylindrical columns arrayed in a tripod to ensure the stand stays upright. Heavy duty stands can reliably support a thick, several hundred page [[fake book]], [[song book]] or a binder full of songs. The height of the column can be raised or lowered to permit the stand to be used for a seated performer (common for most orchestral instruments, except for percussion and sometimes double bass) or a standing performer.

===Non-folding===
[[File:2012-05-20 Musicians leaving a wedding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Musicians leaving a wedding performance carry non-folding music stands.]]
Professional [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s and [[big band]]s typically use non-portable, non-folding heavy-duty stands. The stands are typically coloured or painted black so that the stands blend in with the black clothing of the musicians and are not distracting. The music holding portion of the stand may be plastic or metal, and in both cases, the music holding portion is supported by a metal column. The part supporting the music often has a shelf below it for pencils, [[rosin]] (for string players), and other rehearsal accessories. The metal column can be raised or lowered to put the stand at the desired height. Professional stands can be lowered to be used for a seated performer or raised for standing performers. Some non-folding stands have perforations in the music rack to reduce the weight of the stand, an especially important consideration when a large number of stands are being moved.

These stands do not fold or collapse (apart from the ability to lower the height of the stand) and are thus rarely used by musicians travelling alone or one-by-one to rehearsals or gigs. The stands can be moved, but for a full orchestra to move its 50-100 stands, which are often loaded onto a heavy rack, a moving truck and movers need to be hired to relocate the stands. Professional stands either have some type of tripod-style or quadruped-style base, or they have a heavy, metal base, often circular.
[[File:2016 Stojak na nuty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An expensive antique music stand.]]
Some musicians use non-folding, professional stands for all of their rehearsals and gigs, even though this may require them to take more trips to load their gear into the hall. The reason some musicians choose to use non-folding stands is because they are more stable, even with heavy parts or scores, they are more resistant to falling over during outdoor shows, and they look more professional. As well, some performers like to have access to a shelf underneath their stand, to obtain music accessories that are needed throughout a rehearsal or show (e.g., pencils, rosin for string players, picks for guitar players, reeds for reed players, valve oil for brass players, a tuning key for percussionists, etc.)

Musicians may also have expensive non-folding stands in their homes or music studios made of wood or metal. These stands are not designs that are meant to be relocated. Due to their weight and/or their delicate finishes, they are intended to be used in a single location, such as a private home. Some heavy stands are made of carved wood and feature [[bas relief]] carvings and inlay work. Other heavy stands are made of brass, and feature musical motifs such as [[treble clef]]s. Some of these heavy stands are objects of art in their own right.

===Digital===
[[Digital data|Digital]] music stands that use a computer screen to display the music began being used in the 1990s and 2000s. The digital "pages" can be turned by pressing an electronic footpedal, thus enabling performers to play [[chamber music]] or solo pieces with difficult page turns without hiring or finding a volunteer to act as a page turner. The music notation is typically displayed on a [[flatscreen display]] or a [[tablet computer]] screen.
===Marching band===
[[File:Trumpet's lectern.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A marching band "clip" for a [[trumpet]] player.]]
[[Marching band]] or some [[brass band]] members use a small sheet holder called a '''lyre''' or a '''clip''' which, can be attached to an instrument. The clip holds a smaller-sized part for the performer, so she/he can read the music while marching.

===Conducting===
[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|right|A large, heavy conductor's stand.]]
Large, heavy duty music stands are available for [[Conducting|conductors]] of [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s, [[choir]]s and [[big band]]s to hold their heavy, over-size scores of music. These stands are typically not designed to be easily transportable, and they are usually intended for installation in a rehearsal hall or concert hall. Conductor's stands have to be able to be angled much flatter than an instrumentalist's stand, because the conductor reads from a large [[full score|full-score]], which contains the parts for all of the instruments. For some [[symphony|symphonies]], the score can be both thick and heavy; to ensure that the stand is stable, a conducting stand needs to have a heavy, wide base and a sturdy platform for the score. As with professional instrumentalist stands, some conducting stands have a narrow shelf where a conductor can store her [[baton (music)|batons]], [[handkerchief]]s, [[reading glasses]], and, for rehearsals, a small [[metronome]].

===Keyboard instruments===
[[Upright piano]]s, [[grand piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[harpsichord]]s, [[pipe organ]]s, [[Hammond organ]]s and many post-1980s [[electronic keyboard]]s have some type of rack or stand to hold sheet music and/or scores. On some grand pianos, the music stand can be removed, for example, if the performer is playing a piano solo work or a [[piano concerto]] from memory. On some electronic or electric keyboards, the stand can be removed, to facilitate transportation of the instrument to rehearsals and gigs. If the music stands on electronic and electric keyboards were permanently affixed, they would make the instrument harder to load into a van or car, and the stand would be vulnerable to damage. 
[[File:KORG LP350 with music scores on music stand (photozou 43110250) by Ludwig D. Omen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Korg LP350 electronic keyboard with a music stand on the top of the instrument.]]
On some [[digital piano]]s designed for use in a private home or studio, the music rack is permanently installed, but most users of digital pianos do not transport them to rehearsals and gigs, because these instruments often have a number of design features that are not conducive to regular transport (e.g., fixed keyboard legs and a [[modesty panel]] and fixed pedals for sustain and sostenuto). Most keyboardists who are regularly transporting electronic keyboards to rehearsals and gigs use [[stage piano]]s or [[MIDI controller]] keyboards along with a [[sound module]]; on these instruments, all of the accessories (music rack, keyboard stand, sustain pedal) can be disconnected. By enabling the keyboard to be broken down into separate components, it makes the instrument more transportable in a regular car, even including small vehicles. In contrast, a high-end digital piano with a fixed music rack, stand and pedals would need a van and several helpers to transport it.

===Tabletop===
[[File:Music stand table.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A table top stand.]]
While the vast majority of music stands are designed to provide their own support for raising the music rack to the desired height, there are some music racks which are designed for placing on a table or counter. Since a table or counter must be used, this makes these racks unsuitable for instruments such as timpani.

==Challenges==
With outdoor performances, users of music stands can face challenges due to wind blowing the pages of sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal clips or clothes pins on the sides of the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight folding stand may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base.

In opera, ballet and musical theatre, the orchestra (or band in the case of musicals) often plays in an [[orchestra pit]] in front of and at a lower level than the main performance stage. For dramatic reasons, the stage may be darkened at times during the performance, and the [[house lights]] turned off. This darkness could pose challenges for the musicians who are reading parts or chord charts in the pit. To resolve this challenge, small stand lights are clipped onto the tops of stands. To avoid having the stand lights distract audience members, some venues have cloth "hoods" over the lights. Originally, stand lights were incandescent, requiring extension cords running throughout the pit and regular bulb changes. In the 2000s, as [[LED]] lights became more affordable, battery powered LED lights have become widely used. LED lights do not need extension cords and the bulbs almost never need replacement. Stand lights do not clip as securely to thin folding stands. Stand lights clip more securely onto the solid rack of a professional, non-folding stand. A Canadian viola player invented a stand with a built-in LED light, for dark performing settings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottawalife.com/article/visionary-music-stand-puts-ottawa-at-the-forefront-of-innovation &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with music desk==
The term ''stand'', as it is used to describe furniture such as a plant stand or music stand, generally implies a relatively small surface area supported at the required height, most usually by a turned leg or support known as a ''standard''. Any inclined surface that can be used for supporting music may be thought of a music stand, although generally this function is divided between two types of furniture: a music stand proper and a music desk. The music stand, as the name suggests, consists of a support for the music raised upon a freestanding column or tripod, which, in addition to being movable may also be adjustable with regard to its height and the angle at which it may be tilted. A music [[desk]] generally implies a similar, tiltable support for the music, but rather than being raised on a stand, instead forms part of a table. In as much as the term "desk" originally implied a sloping-topped table for reading or writing, the slight adjustment necessary to turn a desk into a music desk was a relatively simple matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12572">The '''Network Computer''' (or '''NC''') was a [[diskless node|diskless]] [[desktop computer]] device made by [[Oracle Corporation]] from about 1996 to 2000. The devices were designed and manufactured by an alliance, which included [[Sun Microsystems]], [[IBM]], and others. The devices were designed with minimum specifications, based on the [[Network Computer Reference Profile]]. The brand was also employed as a [[marketing]] term to try to popularize this design of computer within enterprise and among consumers.

The NC brand was mainly intended to inspire a range of desktop computers from various suppliers that, by virtue of their diskless design and use of inexpensive components and software, were cheaper and easier to manage than standard [[fat client]] [[Personal computer|desktops]]. However, due to the [[commoditization]] of standard desktop components, and due to the increasing availability and popularity of various software options for using full desktops as [[diskless node]]s, [[thin client]]s, and [[hybrid client]]s, the Network Computer brand never achieved the popularity hoped for by Oracle and was eventually [[:wikt:mothball#Verb|mothballed]].

The term "network computer" is now used for any [[diskless node|diskless]] [[desktop computer]] or a [[thin client]].

==History ==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2011}}
The failure of the NC to impact on the scale predicted by [[Larry Ellison]] may have been caused by a number of factors. Firstly, prices of PCs quickly fell below $1000, making the competition very hard. Secondly, the software available for NCs was neither mature nor open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Walters, E. Garrison | authorlink= | title=The essential guide to computing | year=2001 | publisher=Prentice Hall PTR | location=Upper Saddle River, NJ  | isbn=0-13-019469-7 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwrQsOW5SsQC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;dq=information+network+desktop+computer+IT+appliance+date:1970-2005#PPA398,M1  | accessdate=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2008}}

Thirdly, the idea could simply have been ahead of its time, as at the NC's launch in 1996, the typical home [[Internet]] connection was only a 28.8 kbit/s modem [[dialup]]. This was simply insufficient for the delivery of [[executable]] content. The [[world wide web]] itself was not considered mainstream until its breakout year, 1998. Prior to this, very few [[Internet service provider]]s advertised in mainstream press (at least outside of the USA), and knowledge of the Internet was limited. This could have held back uptake of what would be seen as a very niche device with no (then) obvious appeal.

NCs ended up being used as the very 'dumb terminals' they were intended{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to replace, as the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] backend infrastructure is not readily available.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}} 1990s era NCs are often network-booted into a minimal Unix with X, to serve as X terminal. While NC purists may consider this to be a suboptimal use of NC hardware, the NCs work well as terminals, and are considerably cheaper than purpose-built terminal hardware.

==NC standards and drafts==

===Reference Profile===
The initial Network Computing standard, the [[Network Computer Reference Profile]] (NCRef), required that all 'NC' appliances supported [[HTML]], [[Java virtual machine|Java]], [[HTTP]], [[JPEG]], and other key standards.

{{details|Network Computer Reference Profile}}

===Other standards===

Because many NCs did not use [[Intel]] [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Computer software|software]], Microsoft and Intel developed a competing standard called [[NetPC]].&lt;ref name="bytecoverstory"&gt;[http://www.byte.com/art/9704/sec6/art1.htm Cheaper Computing, Part I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404210105/http://www.byte.com/art/9704/sec6/art1.htm |date=2007-04-04 }}, ''Byte'' magazine, April 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternatives to the NCRef were [[WeBRef]] ([[Motorola]] and [[HDS (company)|HDS]] Network Systems) and [[Odin (software)|Odin]] ([[National Semiconductor]]).&lt;ref&gt;

===Macintosh NC===
In 1997 Apple announced the [[Mac NC]], its attempt to develop the [[Apple Pippin|Pippin]] into a network computer platform. By the end of 1997, Steve Jobs discontinued all [[Macintosh clone]] efforts, effectively killing the Pippin, although key components of the Mac NC technology were inherited by the original [[iMac]].

===NetProducts NetStation===
The first generation [[NetStation]] design and the NetStation [[trademark]] was licensed to [[NChannel]], which provided the consumer equipment and Internet service (with associated infrastructure) for the [[United Kingdom|UK]] market. After a few months, NChannel split into two entities: [[NetChannel]] (which provided the Internet service) and [[NetProducts]] which provided the consumer hardware.

NetProducts started working with Acorn to develop a next-generation product, NetStation II and started developing an [[email]]-only set-top-box (the TVemail). NetProducts went into voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1998 before either project was completed.

===Sun Microsystems JavaStation===
[[Sun Microsystems]] developed the [[JavaStation]], a [[JavaOS]]-based NC based on [[SPARC]] hardware, initially similar to Sun's range of Unix [[workstation]]s.

===IBM Network Station===
[[IBM]] launched its [[Network Station]] in September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As with the later reference design, the Network Station used a NetBSD-based NCOS booted over a LAN from an [[AS/400]] or [[IBM PC]] server. The Network Station supported local execution of basic applications, such as a [[web browser]] and [[Virtual console|console]]. In addition, [[X Window System|X]] capability was also implemented to allow both locally and remotely run applications to be used on the same machine. In practice, the lack of real applications meant that this was little more than a hardware [[X terminal]].

The IBM Network Station was originally based on the [[PowerPC]] architecture, but the final few models used [[Intel]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors.

==Contemporary analogy==
Some see the idea behind the NC as existing in contemporary times in the system of [[cloud computing]] and in particular [[Google Chrome OS]]. In [[Wired magazine]], Daniel Roth claims that the failure of the network computer eventually led to the development of cloud computing. A large contribution to this transition was attributed to [[Eric Schmidt]], once the [[chief technical officer|CTO]] of [[Sun Microsystems]], a proponent of the network computer, who eventually became the CEO of [[Google]]. Google is a large purveyor of cloud technology, "most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets."&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Daniel.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Such notices (NANUs) provide updates on the general health of individual satellites in the GPS [[satellite constellation|constellation]].  NANUs are typically issued approximately three days prior to a change in the operation of a GPS satellite, such as a change in orbit or scheduled on-board equipment maintenance.

==NANU types==

Forecast Outages

* FCSTDV, or Forecast Delta-V, gives scheduled outage times for Delta-V maneuvers. The satellite is moved during this maintenance and the user may be required to download a new almanac.
* FCSTMX, or Forecast Maintenance, gives scheduled outage times for Ion Pump Operations or software tests.
* FCSTEXTD, or Forecast Extension, extends the scheduled outage time "Until Further Notice"; references the original NANU.
* FCSTSUMM, or Forecast Summary, gives the exact outage times for the scheduled outage, including the FCSTEXTD; sent after the maintenance is complete and the satellite is set healthy to users; references the original NANU.
* FCSTCANC, or Forecast Cancellation, cancels a scheduled outage; new maintenance time not yet determined; references the original NANU.
* FCSTRESCD, or Forecast Rescheduled, reschedules a scheduled outage; references the original NANU.
* FCSTUUFN, or Forecast Unusable Until Further Notice, scheduled outage of indefinite duration not necessarily related to Delta-V or maintenance activities.

Unscheduled Outages

* UNUSABLE, or UNUSABLE with a reference NANU, closes out an UNUSUFN NANU and gives the exact outage times for the outage; references the UNUSUFN NANU.
* UNUSUFN, or Unusable Until Further Notice, notifies users that a satellite will be Unusable to all users until further notice.
* UNUNOREF, or UNUSABLE with no reference NANU, gives times for outages that were resolved before a UNUSUFN NANU could be sent.

Other

* LEAPSEC, or Leap Second, is used to notify users of an impending Leap Second and all data after the subject line is free flowing text.
* LAUNCH, is used to notify users of a recent GPS launch.
* DECOM, is used to notify users that an SV has been removed from the current constellation identified within the broadcast almanac, but does not necessarily signify permanent disposal.
* USABINIT, or Initially Usable, notifies users that a satellite is set healthy for the first time.
* GENERAL, informs the user of general GPS information and is written using free flowing text.

'''Ogle Winston Link'''&lt;ref&gt;Link was named after two of his maternal ancestors: the twentieth [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[John Winston Jones]] and [[Pennsylvania]]n Representative [[Alexander Ogle]]. ''Last Steam Railroad'' p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; (December 16, 1914 – January 30, 2001), known commonly as '''O. Winston Link''', was an American photographer. He is best known for his black-and-white photography and sound recordings of the last days of [[steam locomotive]] railroading on the [[Norfolk Southern|Norfolk &amp; Western]] in the United States in the late 1950s. A commercial photographer, Link helped establish [[rail photography]] as a hobby. He also pioneered [[night photography]], producing several well known examples including ''Hotshot Eastbound'', a photograph of a steam train passing a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theater]],&lt;ref name="Simpsons"&gt;This was duplicated in "[[Dumbbell Indemnity]]", an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ([http://www.atomicdeathray.com/?p=442 Visual comparison between "Hotshot Eastbound" and ''The Simpsons'' scene] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630154633/http://www.atomicdeathray.com/?p=442 |date=June 30, 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hawksbill Creek Swimming Hole'' showing a train crossing a bridge above children bathing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkmuseum.org/linkbio.html O.

==Early life==
Link and his siblings, Eleanor and Albert Jr., spent their childhood in the borough of [[Brooklyn]], New York City, where they lived with their parents, Albert Link, Sr. and Anne Winston Jones Link. Link's given names honor ancestors [[Alexander Ogle]] and [[John Winston Jones]], who had served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Link taught [[woodworking]] in the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City Public School system]], and encouraged his children's interest in arts and crafts and first introduced Winston to photography.{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}}

Link's early photography was created with a borrowed [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] [[Autographic]] Kodak camera. By the time he was in high school he had built his own photographic [[enlarger]].&lt;ref&gt;''Last Steam Railroad'' pp. 132&amp;ndash;3; ''Museum'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing high school, Link attended the [[Polytechnic University of New York|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]], receiving a degree in [[civil engineering]]. Before his graduation in 1937, he spoke at a banquet for the institute's newspaper, where he served as photo editor. An executive from [[Carl Byoir]]'s public relations firm was present and was impressed by Link's speaking ability. He offered Link a job as a photographer.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Steam Railroad'' p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Link worked for Carl Byoir and Associates for five years, learning his trade on the job. He adapted to the technique of making posed photographs looking candid, as well as creatively emphasizing a point. On his first major assignment, to photograph part of the state of Louisiana in the summer of 1937, he found himself in New Iberia, the location where Cecil B. DeMille's 1938 movie "The Buccaneer", about Jean LaFitte was being filmed. Here he met his future first wife, a former Miss Ark-La-Tex, now actress/model/body double, Vanda Marteal Oglesby, who stood-in for lead actress [[Franciska Gaal]]. They 'took a shine' to one another and later that year she posed for some of his photographs in the French Quarter of New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;O Winston Link biography at louisianalink.net&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually married in 1942, but later divorced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121412645&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Link's photographs from this time included an image of a man aiming a gun at a pig wearing a [[bulletproof vest]], and one eventually known as "What Is This Girl Selling?" or "Girl on Ice," which was widely published in the United States and later featured in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' as a "classic publicity picture." According to Thomas Garver, a later assistant to Link, during his employment at Byoir's firm, Link "clearly defined a point of view and developed working methods that were to shape his entire career."&lt;ref&gt;''Last Steam Railroad'' pp. 136-9; ''Museum'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[World War II]] reached the United States, Link found himself unable to join the military as a result of [[mumps]]-induced hearing loss.  He left Byoir's employ in 1942 to work for the Airborne Instruments Laboratory, part of [[Columbia University]]. Drawing on both his university degree and professional photographic experience, Link worked at the laboratory as both project engineer and photographer. The laboratory was then researching a device to enable low-flying airplanes to detect submarines underwater. Link's main responsibility was photographing the project for the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;''Museum'' p. 5; ''Last Steam Railroad'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, with the end of the war, Link's employment at the Airborne Instruments Laboratory also ended. Byoir invited Link back, but Link instead opened his own studio in New York City in 1946; his clients included [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]], [[Alcoa]], [[Texaco]], and [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethyl]].&lt;ref&gt;''Last Steam Railroad'' p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rail photography: Norfolk and Western project==
While in [[Staunton, Virginia]], for an industrial photography job in 1955, Link's longstanding love of railroads became focused on the nearby [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] line. N&amp;W was the last major ([[Class I railroad|Class I]]) railroad to make the transition from [[Steam locomotive|steam]] to [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] motive power and had refined its use of steam locomotives, earning a reputation for "precision transportation." Link took his first night photograph of the road on January 21, 1955, in [[Waynesboro, Virginia]]. On May 29, 1955 the N&amp;W announced its first conversion to [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and Link's work became a documentation of the end of the steam era. He returned to Virginia for about twenty visits to continue photographing the N&amp;W. His last night shot was taken in 1959 and the last of all in 1960, the year the road completed the transition to diesel, by which time he had accumulated 2400 negatives on the project.&lt;ref name=SteamSteelAndStars&gt;{{cite book|author=Link, O. Winston|title=Steam, Steel &amp; Stars|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=1987|isbn=0-8109-1645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was entirely self-financed, Link's work was encouraged and facilitated by N&amp;W officials, from President [[Robert Hall Smith]] downwards. Besides the locomotives, he captured the people of the N&amp;W performing their jobs on the railroad and in the trackside communities.  Some of his images were of the massive [[Roanoke Shops]], where the company had long built and maintained its own locomotives.&lt;ref name=SteamSteelAndStars/&gt;

Link's images were always meticulously set up and posed, and he chose to take most of his railroad photographs at night. He said "I can't move the sun &amp;mdash; and it's always in the wrong place &amp;mdash; and I can't even move the tracks, so I had to create my own environment through lighting."&lt;ref&gt;''Last Steam Railroad'' p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Although others, including Philip Hastings and Jim Shaughnessy, had photographed locomotives at night before, Link's vision required him to develop new techniques for [[Flash (photography)|flash photography]] of such large subjects. For instance, the movie theater image ''Hotshot Eastbound ([[Iaeger, West Virginia]])'', photographed on August 2, 1956 [negative NW1103], used 42 #2 flashbulbs and one #0 fired simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;''Ghost Trains''. It was taken at 1/200 sec. at f11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Link, with an assistant such as George Thom, had to lug all his equipment into position and wire it up: this was done in series so any failure would prevent a picture being taken at all; and in taking night shots of moving trains the right position for the subject could only be guessed at. Link used a 4 x 5 Graphic View [[view camera]] with [[Black-and-white|black and white]] [[Photographic film|film]], from which he produced silver gelatin [[Photo|prints]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}}

''Hawksbill Creek Swimming Hole ([[Luray, Virginia]])'' was photographed on August 9, 1956 [NW1126]. Other widely known images include ''Swimming Pool ([[Welch, West Virginia]])'' (1958 [NW1963]), ''Ghost Town (Stanley, Virginia)'' [NW1345], ''Main Line on Main Street ([[Northfork, West Virginia]])'' (1958 [NW1966]) and ''Mr and Mrs Ben Pope watch the last steam powered passenger train ([[Max Meadows, Virginia]])'' (1957 [NW1648]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkmuseum.org/1955-5.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Ghost Trains''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his black and white night shots, Link also recorded the single daytime train on the Norfolk &amp; Western's hilly Abingdon branch, serving the rural communities from [[Abingdon, Virginia]], 55 miles (88&amp;nbsp;km) south to [[West Jefferson, North Carolina]]. It was also on this line that most of his railroad [[color photography]] was done; a selection is included in ''The Last Steam Railroad in America''. His familiar 1956 view of a horse and steam locomotive ''Maud bows to the Virginia Creeper (Green Cove, Virginia)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkmuseum.org/1955-7.html]&lt;/ref&gt; exists in black and white and color versions.

As well as photographing them, Link was also making [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recordings]] of the trains, which he issued on a set of six [[gramophone record]]s between 1957 and 1977 under the overall title ''Sounds of Steam Railroading''. In the [[railfan]] world he was probably best known by these, and by photographs published in ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine and elsewhere in the 1950s, which inspired others to follow his example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brouws, Jeff and Delvers, Ed. (ed.)|title=Starlight on the Rails|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2000|isbn=0-8109-8230-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traveling exhibition in 1983 brought his work to a wider public&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as did [[Paul Yule]]'s award-winning documentary "Trains That Passed In The Night" (1990), in which Link re-visited the scenes of his classic photographs of the Norfolk and Western.

==Later life==
From 1960 until he retired in 1983 Link devoted himself to advertising. Among notable pictures taken during this period are those recording construction of the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] and other views of [[New York Harbor]] including the great [[ocean liner]]s. In retirement, Link moved to [[Lewisboro, New York|South Salem]], [[Westchester County, New York]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}}

In 1996, Link's second wife, Conchita, was arrested for (and later convicted of) stealing a collection of Link's photographs and attempting to sell them, claiming that Link had [[Alzheimer's disease]] and that she had power of attorney.  She served six years in prison.  After being released, she again attempted to sell some of Link's works that she had stolen, this time using the Internet auction site [[eBay]].  She received a three-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2004/05/06/NEWSconchitassentence2.html "Ex-Wife's 2nd Trial"]. May 6, 2004. ''[[The Hook weekly|The Hook]]''. Accessed June 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Conchita was also accused of imprisoning her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2004/01/08/coverSidebarHellmatesSadTa.html "Hell mates: Sad tale of Winston and Conchita"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this allegation is disputed by some, and it never led to any criminal charges against Conchita.{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}} The story of Winston and Conchita became the subject of the documentary "The Photographer, His Wife, Her Lover" (2005) made by [[Paul Yule]].

Link made a [[cameo appearance]] as a steam locomotive engineer in the 1999 film ''[[October Sky]]''. He was actively involved with the planning of a museum of his work when he suffered a heart attack near his home in South Salem, was transported to Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, Westchester County, NY where he died on January 30, 2001. Mr. Link was interred adjacent to his parents in Elmwood Cemetery, Shepherdstown, Jefferson County, West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, The Journal News, February 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}}

==Museum==
The rail photography of Winston Link is featured at the [[O. Winston Link Museum]] in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], which opened in January 2004. The museum is housed in the former passenger station of the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]]. Link's N&amp;W [[caboose]] forms part of the display.{{Citation needed|date = January 2014}}

A '''phase shift module''' is a [[Microwave transmission|microwave network]] module which provides a controllable phase shift of the [[RF signal]].&lt;ref&gt;Microwave Solid State Circuit Design, 2nd Ed., by Inder Bahl and Prakash Bhartia, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003 (Chapter 12)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RF MEMS Theory, Design and Technology by Gabriel Rebeiz, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003 (Chapter 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antenna Engineering Handbook, 4th Ed., by John Volakis, McGraw-Hill, 2007 (Chapter 21)&lt;/ref&gt; Phase shifters are used in [[phased array]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phased Array Antennas, 2nd Ed., by R. C. Hansen, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phased Array Antenna Handbook, 2nd Ed., by Robert Mailloux, Artech House, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phased Array Antennas by Arun K. Bhattacharyya, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

* '''Active versus passive''': Active phase shifters provide gain, while passive phase shifters are lossy.
** Active:
*** Applications: [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA), [[passive electronically scanned array]] (PESA)
*** Gain: The phase shifter amplifies while phase shifting
*** [[Noise figure]] (NF)
*** Reciprocity: not reciprocal
** Passive:
*** Applications: [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA), [[passive electronically scanned array]] (PESA)
*** Loss: the phase shifter attenuates while phase shifting
*** NF: NF = loss
*** [[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|Reciprocity]]: reciprocal
* '''Analog versus digital''':
** Analog phase shifters provide a continuously variable phase shift or time delay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=app_notes&amp;notes=iqv_phaseshift Microwave Phase Shifter] information from [[Herley Industries|Herley General Microwave]]&lt;/ref&gt;
** Digital phase shifters provide a discrete set of phase shifts or time delays. Discretization leads to quantization errors. Digital phase shifters require parallel bus control.
* '''Differential, single-ended or waveguide''':
** [[Differential signaling|Differential]] [[transmission line]]: A differential transmission line is a balanced two-conductor transmission line in which the phase difference between currents is 180 degrees. The differential mode is less susceptible to common mode noise and cross talk.
*** [[antenna (radio)|Antenna]] selection: [[dipole]], tapered slot antenna (TSA)
*** Examples: coplanar strip, slotline
** Single-ended transmission line: A single-ended transmission line is a two-conductor transmission line in which one conductor is referenced to a common ground, the second conductor. The single-ended mode is more susceptible to common-mode noise and cross talk.
*** Antenna selection: double folded slot (DFS), microstrip, [[Monopole antenna|monopole]]
*** Examples: CPW, microstrip, stripline
** [[Waveguide]]
*** Antenna selection: waveguide, [[horn antenna|horn]]
* '''Frequency band'''
* '''One-conductor or dielectric transmission line versus two-conductor transmission line'''
** One-conductor or dielectric transmission line ([[optical fibre]], [[finline]], waveguide):
*** [[Transverse mode|Modal]]
*** No TEM or [[quasi-TEM mode]], not TTD or quasi-TTD
*** Higher-order TE, TM, HE or HM modes are [[Distortion|distorted]]
** Two-conductor transmission line ([[coplanar waveguide|CPW]], [[microstrip]], [[slotline]], [[stripline]]):
*** Differential or single-ended
*** TEM or quasi-TEM mode is TTD or quasi-TTD
* '''Phase shifters versus TTD phase shifter'''
** A phase shifter provides an invariable phase shift with frequency, and is used for fixed-beam frequency-invariant pattern synthesis.
** A TTD phase shifter provides an invariable time delay with frequency, and is used for [[Squint (antenna)|squint]]-free and [[ultra wideband]] (UWB) beam steering.
* '''Reciprocal versus non-reciprocal'''
** Reciprocal: T/R
** Non-reciprocal: T or R
* '''Technology'''
** Non semi-conducting (ferrite, ferro-electric, [[RF MEMS]], liquid crystal):
*** Passive
** Semi-conducting (RF CMOS, [[Gallium(III) arsenide|GaAs]]. [[SiGe]], InP, [[GaN]] or Sb):
*** Active: [[BJT]] or [[Field effect transistor|FET]] transistor based [[MMIC]]s, RFICs or optical ICs
*** Passive: [[PIN diode]] based hybrids
* '''Design'''
** Loaded-line:
*** Distortion:
**** Distorted if lumped
**** Undistorted and TTD if distributed
** Reflect-type:
*** Applications: reflect arrays (S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; phase shifters)
*** Distortion:
**** Distorted if S&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; phase shifter, because of 3&amp;nbsp;dB coupler
**** Undistorted and TTD if S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; phase shifter
** Switched-network
*** Network:
**** High-pass or low-pass
**** &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; or T
*** Distortion:
**** Undistorted if the [[metamaterial|left-handed]] high-pass sections cancel out the distortion of the right-handed low-pass sections
** Switched-line
*** Applications: UWB beam steering
*** Distortion: undistorted and TTD
** Vector summing

== Company history ==
The company founders are [[BCIT School of Business]] alumni who graduated together in Operations Management in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Owner Invests With BCIT Alumni|url=http://commons.bcit.ca/update/2013/08/nba-owner-invests-with-bcit-alumni/|publisher=BCIT|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Got Mark Cuban To Invest In Our Company|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-money/business-funding/how-we-got-mark-cuban-to-invest-in-our-company/article13524012//|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for Procurify came from a BCIT class project where the founders Aman Mann - CEO, Eugene Dong - CTO, and Kenneth Loi - COO were randomly placed together to consult a Vancouver-based business on their internal processes.

In November 2012, they joined the Growlab Accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Announces Its Five Winter 2012 Cohort Companies|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/growlab-announces-its-five-winter-2012-cohort-companies-2012-11-20|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=714 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2013, Procurify graduated from Vancouver-based incubator program GrowLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Companies on GlobalBC and ShawTV!|url=http://growlab.ca/growlab-companies-on-globalbc-and-shawt|publisher=GrowLab|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2014, Procurify raised a total of 1.2 Million seed round from venture capitalists Nexus Ventures, BDC and Mark Cuban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Knowlton|title=Vancouver's Procurify Raises $1.2 Million Seed Round from BDC, Mark Cuban|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/procurify-seed-round-mark-cuban-2014-04-16|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=BDC Venture Capital Invests in All Four GrowLab Graduates|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/bdc-invests-in-growlab-graduates-2013-03-01|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koetsier|first=John|title=Procurify is securing a $400K Mark Cuban investment even before graduating from GrowLab|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/20/procurify-is-securing-a-mark-cuban-investment-even-before-graduating-from-growlab/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2015, Procurify raised another seed round totaling $4 Million from Point Nine Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC).

== History ==
The company was founded in 1996 at premises of a former "Proton" plant affiliated with the [[Ministry of Electronic Industry of the USSR]]. The purchased facilities and equipment were intended for [[Cleanroom|clean technologies]] enabling to launch production of power semiconductors, however almost all assembly lines and manufacturing processes, as well as manufacturing processes and routes had to be researched and launched all over again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Леонид Чанов |editor=  |format= |url= http://www.proton-electrotex.com/files/project_52/Surma_EK.pdf |title= "Протон-Электротекс"  — уверенность в завтрашнем дне |type= журнал |origyear= | agency =  |edition= Электронные компоненты  |location=  |date= |year= 2011 |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue=  |number= 4|pages =  |page=  |series=  |isbn =  |issn =  |doi =  |bibcode =  |arxiv =  |pmid =  |ref=  |archiveurl =  |archivedate =  |language=  |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs and technologies were developed jointly with specialists of the [[:ru:Всероссийский электротехнический институт|Russian Electrical Engineering Institute]] in Moscow.

On January 11, 2011 the company founded a Research and Development Center involved in R&amp;D, designing automatization systems and measurement equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proton-electrotex.com/ru/news/131|title=НТЦ Протон-Электротекс 6 лет!|publisher=www.proton-electrotex.com|language=ru|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the company launched serial production of [[IGBT|IGBT modules]], 95% of which had been previously imported to Russia from abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asi.ru/projects/13406/|title=Организация серийного сборочного производства линейки IGBT модулей на широкий диапазон мощностей|publisher=asi.ru|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Later in 2018 they were extended by a family of low-inductance MIDA-type modules, [[Silicon_carbide#Power_electronic_devices|Full-SiC]] MCDA-type IGBT and pressure contact PIMA-type IGBT.

In 2018 quality management system and ecology management systems of the company were certified according to [[ISO_9000#Contents_of_ISO_9001:2015|ISO 9001:2015]] and [[ISO_14000#ISO_14001_and_EMAS|ISO 14001:2015]] standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2191">A '''Rate integrating gyroscope''' is a [[rate gyro]] with a built in [[integrator]]. It is usually a component of an [[Inertial Measurement Unit]] or a stabilization system.

==Principle of operation==
In a rate indicating &lt;!-- see discussion page --&gt; gyroscope, the [[gyroscope]] is turned at a steady rate about its input axis and a torque is applied to the spin axis. This causes the gyroscope to [[precess]] about the output axis.
The rate indicating gyroscope consists of a [[damping]] fluid between the float assembly can and the outer casing. This [[viscous]] fluid resists the motion of the [[gimbal]] precession. This causes the gimbal to accelerate initially in the fluid, until the damping effect is equal to the precessing force.
The rate of precession, will hence be directly proportional to the rate of turn of the gyroscope about its input axis and the total angle of movement about the output axis will be proportional to the speed and length of time the input axis is turning.

In a typical application (e.g. an aircraft), the output axis could have revolved 180 degrees clockwise in 20 seconds, then 80° anti-clockwise (say if the aircraft was changing direction again).
This output would then be fed to a [[computer]] to calculate the total distance traveled ([[Inertial guidance system|Inertial Navigation Platform]]).

* [http://usdynamicscorp.com/literature/general/AN-006_USD_RIG_Gyroscope_Brief.pdf US Dynamics Rate Integrating Gyroscope Technical Brief]

===Key===
* '''Spin Axis''': Spin Axis is the axis of rotation of the rotor (rotating mass).
* '''Input Axis''': Input Axis is the Axis about which the force is applied.
* '''Output Axis''': Output axis is the Axis perpendicular to the input axis and the spin axis.

==Gimbal gain==

Gimbal gain is the amount of precession that can be varied by varying the viscosity of the damping fluid. For (for example) increased sensitivity of a gyroscopic instrument.

[[File:Car rapide.jpg|thumb|A ''car rapide'' share taxi in Senegal]]
A '''share taxi''' (also called '''shared taxi''') is a [[mode of transport]] which falls between a [[taxicab]] and a [[bus]]. These [[vehicles for hire]] are typically smaller than buses and usually take [[passengers]] on a fixed or semi-fixed route without timetables, but instead departing when all seats are filled. They may stop anywhere to pick up or drop off their passengers. Often found in [[developing countries]],&lt;ref name="urbtran254"/&gt; the vehicles used as share taxis range from four-seat cars to minibuses.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cervero, [http://www.reason.org/ps146.html Fostering Commercial Transit: Alternatives in Greater Los Angeles], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason Magazine]], September 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often owner-operated.

The [[UITP]] term "informal transport" includes share taxis.

==Operation==

===Terminus===
A given share taxi route may start and finish in fixed central locations, and landmarks may serve as route names or route termini. In some African cities routes are run between formal termini,&lt;ref name="synd"/&gt; where the majority&lt;ref&gt;http://themediaonline.co.za/2013/10/ooh-mass-urbanisation-and-the-south-african-taxi-commuter/&lt;/ref&gt; of passengers board.&lt;ref name="synd"/&gt; In these places the share taxis wait for a full load of passengers prior to departing, and off-peak wait times may be in excess of an hour.&lt;ref name="synd"/&gt;

In other places there may be no formal termini, with taxis simply congregating at a central location,&lt;ref name="nypubcarpr"/&gt; instead.

Even more-formal terminals may be little more than parking lots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p.  24.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, its also referred to as a rank, which denotes an area specifically built, by a municipality or city, for taxi operators, where commuters may start and end their journey.&lt;ref&gt;http://joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Along the route===
Where they exist, share taxis provide service on set routes within and sometimes between towns.

After a share taxi has picked up passengers at its terminus, it proceeds along a semi-fixed route where the driver may determine the actual route within an area according to traffic condition. Drivers will stop anywhere to allow riders to disembark, and may sometimes do the same when prospective passengers want to ride.

===Operational distinctions===
While all share taxis share certain characteristics—and many regional versions exhibit peculiarities—some basic operational distinctions can be delineated.

====Vehicle ownership====
Most share taxis are operated under one of two regimes. Some share taxis are operated by a company. For example, in [[Dakar]] there are company-owned fleets of hundred of ''car rapides''.&lt;ref name="Cameroon"/&gt; In the [[Soviet Union]], share taxis, known as ''[[marshrutka]]'', were operated by state-owned taxi parks.&lt;ref&gt;''RAF-977DM marshrutnoye taksi'', "Avtomobil Na Sluzhbie'', No.28, DeAgostini, 2012, {{ISSN|2223-0440}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual operators in many countries. In Africa, while there are company share taxis, individual owners are more common. Rarely owning more than two vehicles at a time, they will rent out a minibus to operators, who pay fuel and other running costs, and keep revenue.&lt;ref name="Cameroon"/&gt;

====Syndicates====
In some places, like some African cities and also Hong Kong, share taxi minibuses are overseen by syndicates, unions, or route associations.&lt;ref name="synd2"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. 9.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups often function in the absence of a [[regulation|regulatory]] environment&lt;ref name="synd"/&gt; and may collect dues or fees from drivers&lt;ref name="pg10"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. 10.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as per-use terminal payments,&lt;ref name="pg11"/&gt; sometimes illegally), set routes,&lt;ref name="pg11"/&gt; manage terminals, and fix fares.&lt;ref name="synd"/&gt; Terminal management may include ensuring each vehicle leaves with a full load of passengers.&lt;ref name="synd"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. xiv.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pg11"/&gt;

Because the syndicates represent owners, their regulatory efforts tend to favor operators rather than passengers,&lt;ref name="pg11"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. 11.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the very termini syndicates upkeep can cost delays and money for passengers as well as forcing them to disembark at inconvenient locations, in a phenomenon called "terminal constraint".&lt;ref name="termc"/&gt;

===Regulation===
In Africa, [[regulation]] is mainly something that pertains to the vehicle itself&lt;ref name="xv"/&gt; not its operator&lt;ref name="xv"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. xv.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or its mode of operation.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In [[Kenya]], regulation does extend to operators&lt;ref name="hid2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="port"/&gt; and mode of operation (such as routes used){{citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as the vehicle&lt;ref name="lpkenya"/&gt;

As of 2008, African minibuses are difficult to [[tax]],&lt;ref name="pg10"/&gt; and may operate in a "regulatory vacuum" perhaps because their existence is not part of a government scheme, but is simply a market response to a growing demand for such services.&lt;ref name="Cameroon"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Stuck in Traffic; Urban Transport in Africa (p. 8).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }} Ajay Kumar &amp; Fanny Barrett. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic in cooperation with the World Bank, January 2008. Draft Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt; Route syndicates&lt;ref name="overarchcityregs"/&gt; and operator's associations&lt;ref name="termc"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. 17.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; often exercise unrestricted control, and existing rules may see little enforcement.&lt;ref name="overarchcityregs"/&gt;

==Types of vehicle==
Share taxi is a unique [[mode of transport]] independent of [[vehicle]] type. [[Minibus]]es,&lt;ref name="pg10"/&gt; [[midibus]]es, covered [[pickup truck]]s, [[station wagon]]s, and [[truck|lorries]] see use as share taxis.

Certain vehicle types may be better-suited to current condition than others. In many traffic-choked, sprawling, and low-density African cities minibuses profit.&lt;ref name="pg10"/&gt;

In Israel they were mostly the largest model of Mercedes, owned generally by Arabs, and very efficient, having space for 7-8 people, and having loosely fixed routes, dropping a passenger either at a specific terminus or going a little out of way to facilitate the passenger.

==By country==
While carrying different names and distinguished by regional peculiarities, the share taxi is an everyday feature of life in many places throughout the world.

====Taxis collectifs====

=====Algeria=====


In [[Algeria]], ''taxis collectifs'' ply fixed routes with their destination displayed.&lt;ref name="lpalgeria"/&gt; Rides are shared with others who are picked up along the way,&lt;ref name="catc"/&gt; and the taxi will leave only when it seats all the passengers it can.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyg7ViBs4JAC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Algeria%20taxi&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Johathan Oakes, ''Bradt Travel Guide: Algeria'' (p. 173).] Bradt Travel Guides, 2008. 352 pp. 184162232X, 9781841622323.&lt;/ref&gt; While stations, set locations to board and disembark,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} exist,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyg7ViBs4JAC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Algeria%20taxi&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Oakes (2008), ''Bradt Travel Guide: Algeria'' (p. 90).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vyg7ViBs4JAC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Algeria%20taxi&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Oakes (2008), ''Bradt Travel Guide: Algeria'' (p. 173).]&lt;/ref&gt; prospective passengers flag down a ''taxis collectifs'' when they want a ride.&lt;ref name="lpalgeria"&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/algeria/algiers/transport/getting-around#269895 Transport in Algiers: Local transport; Taxi] lonelyplanet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with all forms of public transport in Algeria, the [[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] recommend against using these share taxis.&lt;ref name="catc"&gt;[http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport-eng.asp?id=5000#9 TRAVEL REPORT Algeria: 9.

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
Those in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]], (or perhaps just the [[Kongo people]]) may call share taxis ''fula fula'' meaning "quick quick".&lt;ref group=Thompson name="kiakia39"/&gt;

There was no independent transport authority in the city of Kinshasa as of 2008.&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt;

====Côte d'Ivoire====
In [[Côte d'Ivoire]], ''gbaka'' are a name for minibus public transports.&lt;ref name="synd2"/&gt;

The transport [[regulator (economics)|regulator]] in [[Abidjan]], CI, is ''Agence de Gestion des Transports Urbains''&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt; or AGETU.&lt;ref name="overarchcityregs"/&gt;

As of 2008, Abidjan public transport was serviced by large buses as well as minibuses.&lt;ref name="xiii"&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. xiii.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syndicates include UPETCA, SNTMVCI.&lt;ref name="synd2"/&gt;
==== Ethiopia ====
Minibus taxis in [[Ethiopia]] are one of the most important modes of transport in big cities like [[Addis Ababa]]. They are preferred by the majority of the populace over public buses and more-traditional taxicabs because they are generally cheap, operate on diverse routes, and are available in abundance. All minibus taxis in Ethiopia have a standard blue-and-white coloring scheme, much like the yellow color of [[New York taxi]]s except it isn't yellow. Minibus taxis are usually [[Toyota Hiace]]s, frequent the streets. They typically can carry 11 passengers, but will always have room for another until that is no longer the case. The minibus driver has a crew member called a ''[[weyala]]'', and his job is to collect the fare from passengers.

In 2008, publicly operated public transport was available in [[Addis Ababa]] in addition to that provided by the minibuses.&lt;ref name="nobuses"/&gt; A fleet of 350 large buses may operate for this purpose,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} as such a number does exist.&lt;ref name="xiii"/&gt; Also as of 2008, the city lacks an independent transport authority,&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt; but some [[regulation]], such as that controlling market entry, does exist.&lt;ref name="termc"/&gt;

Route syndicates may be a presence but are described as "various".&lt;ref name="synd2"/&gt;
====Tro tro====

In [[Ghana]] and neighboring countries, ''tro tro'' are privately owned&lt;ref name="ghanaweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cblog"/&gt; minibus [[vehicle for hire|vehicles for hire]] that travel fixed routes&lt;ref name="cblog"/&gt; leaving when filled to capacity.&lt;ref name="ghanaweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tg1"/&gt; While there are ''tro tro'' stations,&lt;ref name="cblog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1HapewBo3c0C&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;ots=pGv2432qPk&amp;dq=tro%20tro%20New%20Tema%20Station&amp;pg=PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''West Africa'' (p. 347).] Anthony Ham.

As of 2008, there is no independent transport authority in [[Accra]], Ghana,&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt; and the share taxi industry may be wholly unregulated.

=====Ghana=====

''Tro tro'' are used by 70% of [[Ghanaian]] commuters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/01/000333037_20100801234448/Rendered/PDF/551170ESW0P1131Citizens0Report0Card.pdf City of Accra, Ghana consultative citizens' report card (page 113)] Report No. 55117-GH.

Share taxis do exist in [[Cameroon]], but as of 2008 minibuses cannot be used for this purpose, by law.&lt;ref name="Cameroon"/&gt; That same year, [[Douala]], Cameroon, also was without an independent transport authority.&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt;

====Burkina Faso====
In [[Ouagadougou]], capital of [[Burkina Faso]], the share taxi role is not filled by the traditional African minibus.&lt;ref name="Cameroon"/&gt;

====Mali====

Over 60% of South African commuters use shared minibus taxis (16 seater commuter buses). 

Many of these vehicles are unsafe and not roadworthy, and often dangerously overloaded&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arrivealive.mobi/minibus-taxis-and-road-safety|title=Minibus Taxis and Road Safety|work=Arrive Alive|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Prior to 1987, the taxi industry in South Africa was highly regulated and controlled.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Black taxi operators were declined permits in the [[Apartheid]] era and all minibus taxi operations were, by their very nature, illegal.

Post 1987, the industry was rapidly deregulated, leading to an influx of new minibus taxi operators, keen to make money off the high demand for this service. Taxi operators banded together to form local and national associations. Because the industry was largely unregulated and the official regulating bodies corrupt,{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} these associations soon engaged in anti-competitive [[price fixing]] and exhibited gangster tactics – including the hiring of hit-men and all-out gang warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csvr.org.za/wits/papers/papvtp4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209034354/http://www.csvr.org.za/wits/papers/papvtp4.htm |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the height of the conflict, it was not uncommon for taxi drivers to carry shotguns and AK-47s to simply shoot rival taxi drivers and their passengers on sight.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Currently the South African Government is attempting to formalize and re-regulate the out-of-control minibus taxi industry. Along with new legislation, the government has instituted a 7-year recapitalization scheme to replace the old and unroadworthy vehicles with new 18- and 35-seater minibuses. These new minibus taxis carry the South African flag on the side and are notably more spacious and safe.

[[File:Daladala bus.JPG|thumb|A ''dala dala'' in the city of [[Dar es Salaam]]]]
[[Minivan]]s (minibuses may be a more correct term here) are used as vehicles for hire and referred to as ''dala dala'' in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="blog2"&gt;[http://isteptanzania.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/thoughts-on-dala-dala-buses/ Thoughts On Dala Dala Buses] isteptanzania.wordpress.com, May 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''dala dala'' may run fixed routes picking up passengers at central locations, they will also stop along the route to drop someone off or allow a prospective passenger to board.&lt;ref name="blog2"/&gt; Before minibuses became widely used, the typical ''dala dala'' was a [[pick-up truck]] with benches placed in the [[truck bed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zanzibar.org/ Travel Guide to Zanzibar] zanzibar.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dar es Salaam]], publicly operated minibus service may also exist as of 2008.&lt;ref name="synd2"/&gt;

Usually run by both a driver and a [[Bus conductor|conductor]],&lt;ref name="blog2"/&gt; the latter is called a ''mpigadebe'', literally meaning "a person who hits a debe" (a 4-gallon tin container used for transporting gasoline or water). The name is in reference to the fact that conductors are often hitting the roof and side of the van to attract customers and notify the driver when to leave the station.

These often-crowded&lt;ref name="blog2"/&gt; public transports have their routes allocated by a Tanzania transport [[regulator (economics)|regulator]], Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf Kumar &amp; Barrett, ''Stuck in Traffic'' (2008), p. xii.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917053406/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTAFRSUBSAHTRA/Resources/Stuck-in-Traffic.pdf |date=2012-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but syndicates also exist and include DARCOBOA.&lt;ref name="synd2"/&gt;

=====Ugandan regulations=====

As of 2008, [[Kampala]], Uganda, has no independent transport authority,&lt;ref name="cityregs"/&gt; but transport is authorised by Kampala Capital city Authority (KCCA).[http://www.newvision.co.ug/article/fullstory.aspx?story_id=629055&amp;catid=1&amp;mid=53] In Kampala the informal vehicles are called taxis. [http://www.newvision.co.ug/article/fullstory.aspx?story_id=629055&amp;catid=1&amp;mid=53]

====Micro-bus====
[[Egypt]]ian share cabs are generally known as micro-bus (''{{transl|arz|mekrobass}}'' {{lang|ar|ميكروباص}} or ''{{transl|arz|mašrūʿ}}'' {{lang|ar|مشروع}}, "project"; plural ''{{transl|arz|mekrobassāt}}'' {{lang|ar|ميكروباصات}} or ''{{transl|arz|mašarīʿ}}'' {{lang|ar|مشاريع}}). The second name is used by [[Alexandria]]ns.

Micro-buses are licensed by each [[governorates of Egypt|governorate]] as taxicabs, and are generally operated privately by their drivers. Although each governorate attempts to maintain a consistent paint scheme for them, in practice the color of them varies wildly, as the "consistent" schemes have changed from time to time and many drivers have not bothered to repaint their cars.

Rates vary depending on distance traveled, although these rates are generally well known to those riding the micro-bus. The fares also depend on the city. Riders can typically hail micro-buses from any point along the route, often with well-established hand signals indicating the prospective rider's destination, although certain areas tend to be well-known micro-bus stops.

Like the Eastern European ''marshrutka'', a typical micro-bus is a large [[van]], most often a [[Toyota HiAce]] or its [[Jinbei (car)|Jinbei]] equivalent, the [[Jinbei Haise|Haise]], and the latter is produced by the [[Bavarian Auto Group|Bavarian Auto Manufacturing Group]] in [[6th of October City]] in Egypt. Smaller vans and larger small buses are also used.


====Tunisia====
Share taxis in [[Tunisia]] are called ''louage'' and follow fixed or semi-fixed routes, departing from stations when full.&lt;ref name="tpro"/&gt; Usually minibuses or compact cars,&lt;ref name="tpro"/&gt; although some ''louage'' are station wagons,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/travel/how-green-is-the-desert.html?pagewanted=3 How Green Is the Desert] nytimes.com, November 28, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; passengers may board and disembark at any point during travel.&lt;ref name="tpro"/&gt;

They run between towns and within cities.&lt;ref name="tpro"&gt;[http://www.tunispro.net/tunisia/public-transport-in-tunisia.htm Public Transport in Tunisia] tunispro.net&lt;/ref&gt;


====West Africa - Kia kia====
The term ''kia kia'' may be used in [[Yorùbáland]] to refer to minibus public transports, and means "quick quick".&lt;ref group=Thompson name="kiakia41"/&gt;


===Asia===

====China====
In Mainland China, it is normal in some areas like [[Yingkou]] City to share a regular taxicab with other passengers waiting song the same route. However, the primary passenger has the right to refuse pickup.
====Hong Kong====
[[File:HongKong-Bus&amp;Minibus.png|thumb|A [[public light bus]] (left) and a [[double-decker bus]] (right) in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{main|Public light bus}}
[[Public light buses]] ({{zh|c=公共小型巴士}}), also known as minibus or maxicab ({{zh|c=小巴}}), run the length and breadth of [[Hong Kong]], through areas which the standard bus lines cannot or do not reach as frequently, quickly or directly.

Typically offering a faster and more efficient transportation solution due to their small size, limited carrying capacity, frequency and diverse range of routes, although they are generally slightly more expensive than standard buses, minibuses carry a maximum of 16 seated passengers. [[Standing passenger]]s are not allowed.

There are two types of public light minibus, green and red. Both types have a cream-coloured body, the distinguishing feature being the colour of the external roof, and the type of service that the colour denotes: green is like regular [[transit bus]] with fixed number, route, schedule and fare (but generally not fixed stops); red is a shared taxi, operating on semi-fixed route unregulated, with the driver waiting for enough passengers to justify leaving, as his income depends on the revenue.

====India====
Shared taxis have been operating in [[Mumbai, India]], since the early 1970s. These are point-to-point services that operate during peak hours. During [[off-peak]] hours they ply like regular taxis; they can be hailed anywhere on the roads and passengers are charged by the meter. During peak hours they will take a full cab load of passengers to a more or less common destination. The pick-up points are usually fixed, and sometimes (but not always) marked by a sign saying "shared taxis". Cabs typically line up at this point during peak hours.

They sometimes display their general destination on their windscreens, and passengers get in and wait for the cab to fill up. Once full the cab moves off. Fares are fixed and much lower than the metered fare to the same destination, but higher than a bus or train fare.

Such informal arrangements also exist in other Indian cities. Share jeeps are a common form of transportation in the Himalayas, the North Eastern States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fk8FQa2ZSFQC&amp;pg=PA521 Sarina Singh, ''India'', Lonely Planet, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indonesia====

[[File:Daihatsu Midget "Bemo" in Jakarta.jpg|thumb|left|A three-wheeler ''Bemo'' in Jakarta. It also serves as a share taxi like Angkots]]
'''''Angkutan Kota''''' abbreviated '''''Angkot''''' or '''''Mikrolet''''' are share taxis in [[Indonesia]] widely operating throughout the country usually with Mini vans. In some places there are also three-wheelers which are called ''Bemo'' (such as [[autorickshaw]]s based on the [[Daihatsu Midget]]). The older version of Angkot is called ''Oplet''. The name of this transportation differs from each different province or area in the country. In [[Jakarta]], it is called ''Angkot'', in other parts such as in [[Sulawesi]], the term ''Mikrolet'' shortened ''Mikro'' is more widely used especially in [[Manado]]. In [[Makassar]] it is called ''"Pete-Pete"'', in [[Malang]] it is called ''"Angkota"'', in [[Medan]] it is called ''"Sudako"''.

It runs accordingly with its exact routes and passengers can stop the van anywhere according to its destination, and is not required to stop at a bus stop or station.
====Iran====
[[Image:Tehran-Sharetaxi.jpg|thumb|right|Sharing ajans in [[Tehran]]]]
In Iran a share taxi is usually called "taxi", while a non-share is called "ajans"/اژانس, pronounced [aʒans]. Four passengers share a taxi and sometimes there is no terminus and they wait in the street side and blare their destination to all taxies until one of them stops. These are regular taxies but if somebody wants to get a non-share taxi he can call for an ajans (taxi service) for himself or wait in the street side and say 'DARBAST' (which means non-share). It means he is not interested in sharing the taxi and is consequently willing to pay more for the privilege.

Minibuses, in the past years, with a capacity of 18 passengers, and nowadays van taxies, with a capacity of 10 passengers are other kinds of share transport in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mideastyouth.com/2007/08/05/on-taxis mideastyouth]&lt;/ref&gt;

The change (and the receipt, when requested) are returned to the person who paid by the same means.

They have not changed much since their post-war creation, even in the face of an increased access to pre-made vehicles, such as minibuses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Jeepneys have the entrance on the back, and there is space for two people beside the driver (or more if they are small). The back of the Jeepney is equipped with two long bench seats along the sides and the people seated closest to the driver are responsible for passing the fare of new passengers forward to the driver and the change back to the passenger. The start and end point of the Jeepney route is often a Jeepney terminal, where there is a queue system so only one Jeepney plying a particular route is filled at a time, and where a person helps the driver to collect fares and fill the vehicles with people, usually to more than comfortable capacity.

Shared buses or vans are available in many more developed countries connecting frequent destinations, charging a fixed fee per passenger. The most common case is a connection between an airport and central city locations. These services are often known as shuttles. Such services usually use smaller vehicles than normal buses, and often operate on demand. An air traveller can contact the shuttle company by telephone or [[Internet]], not necessarily in advance; the company will ensure that a shuttle is provided without unreasonable delay. The shuttle will typically connect one airport with several large hotels, or addresses in a specified area of the city. The shuttle offers much of the convenience of a taxi, although taking longer, at a price which is significantly lower for one or two passengers. Scheduled services between an airport and a hotel, usually operated by the hotel, are also called shuttles.

In many cases the shuttle operator takes the risk of there not being enough passengers to make the trip profitable; in others there is a minimum charge when there are not enough passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenstown.net.nz/index.php?title=Airport_Transfers Airport Transfers]. Queenstown.net.nz (2008-10-28). Retrieved on 2013-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually there are regulations covering vehicles and drivers; for example in New Zealand under NZTA regulations, shuttles are only allowed to have up to eleven passenger seats, and the driver must have a passenger endorsement (P) on their drivers' licence.

====Cyprus - Service taxi====
In [[Cyprus]], there are privately owned share taxis that travel to set destinations and board additional passengers en route called service taxis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BKlnz-TResC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=cyprus%20lonely%20planet&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cyprus] Vesna Maric.

====Cyprus - Turkey====
[[File:Dolmuş.JPG|thumb|left|Karsan-built Peugeot J9 Premier ''dolmuş'' in [[Bodrum]], Turkey]]
In Turkey and Turkish controlled Northern [[Cyprus]] ''dolmuş'' (pronounced "dolmush") are share taxis that run on set routes within and between cities.&lt;ref name="tplan"&gt;[http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/trans/LocalTransport/Dolmush.html Turkish Dolmus Taxi or Minibus] turkeytravelplanner.com&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these cars or minibuses displays their particular route on signboards behind the [[windscreen]].&lt;ref name="tplan"/&gt;

Some cities may only allow ''dolmuş'' to pick up and disembark passengers at designated stops, and terminals also exist.&lt;ref name="tplan"/&gt; The word derives from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "full" or "stuffed", as these share taxis depart from the terminal only when a sufficient number of passengers have boarded.&lt;ref name="Cypriot"&gt;[http://essentialcyprus.com/bus-services-in-north-cyprus/ Bus Services in North Cyprus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823133025/http://essentialcyprus.com/bus-services-in-north-cyprus/ |date=2010-08-23 }} essentialcyprus.com, January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors to Turkey have been surprised by the speed of ''dolmuş'' travel.&lt;ref name="turk"&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=dolmus-story-2010-01-19 Dolmuş story] hurriyetdailynews.com, Tuesday, January 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

These share taxis are also found in Turkish-controlled, Northern [[Cyprus]] under the same name.&lt;ref name="Cypriot"/&gt; Traveling intra and inter-city, the privately owned minibuses or aging Mercedes [[stretch limo]]s are overseen by a governance institution; routes are leased and vehicles licensed.&lt;ref name="Cypriot"/&gt; Passengers board anywhere along the route (you may have to get the driver to stop if he doesn't honk at you) as well as at termini and official stations.&lt;ref name="Cypriot"/&gt; ''Dolmuş'' in Turkish-controlled, Northern Cyprus display their routes but don't follow timetables. Instead, they simply appear frequently.&lt;ref name="Cypriot"/&gt;

====Estonia====
Share taxis in Estonia are mostly found in [[Tallinn]], the capital.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Called ''liinitakso'', ''marsruuttakso'', ''taksobuss'' or ''mikroautobuss'' depending on the language spoken, these minibuses run fixed routes and allow passengers to disembark at any time.&lt;ref name="lpestonia"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Yg-9Np1abwC&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;ots=Vh7LssCjxB&amp;dq=Liinitakso&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania] Carolyn Bain.

====Lithuania====
In [[Lithuania]], share taxis are called ''maršrutinis taksi''.

====Netherlands====

Besides the conventional ''deeltaxi'', there are ''treintaxis'' in some [[Netherlands|Dutch]] towns. Operated on behalf of the [[Netherlands Railways]],{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} they run to and from railway stations and the ride is shared with additional passengers picked up along the way.&lt;ref name="lpnetherlands"/&gt; Tickets can be purchased at railway ticket offices or from the cabdriver,&lt;ref name="lpnetherlands"/&gt; but ''treintaxis'' must be ordered by phone unless boarding at a railway station.&lt;ref name="lpnetherlands"&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/transport/getting-around#215338 Transport in The Netherlands: Train; Treintaxi] lonelyplanet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Northern Ireland=====
In some towns in [[Northern Ireland]], notably certain districts in [[Ballymena]], [[Belfast]], [[Derry]] and [[Newry]], share taxi services operate using [[Hackney carriage]]s and are called black taxis. These services developed during [[The Troubles]] as public bus services were often interrupted due to street [[rioting]]. Taxi collectives are closely linked with political groups – those operating in Catholic areas with [[Sinn Féin]], those in Protestant areas with [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[paramilitaries]] and their political wings.

Typically, fares approximate to those of [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] operated bus services on the same route.  Service frequencies are typically higher than on bus services, especially at peak times, although limited capacities mean that passengers living close to the termini may find it difficult to find a black taxi with seats available in the [[rush hour]].

===North America===
====Caribbean====
''Carros Públicos'' (literally "Public Cars") are share taxis in the [[Dominican Republic]]&lt;ref name="carpublic"/&gt; and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="prico"/&gt;

=====Dominican Republic=====

In the [[Dominican Republic]], these privately owned vehicles&lt;ref name="statedr"/&gt; run fixed routes&lt;ref name="carpublic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="statedr"/&gt; with no designated stops, and the ride is shared with other passengers.&lt;ref name="carpublic"&gt;[http://dr1.com/articles/transportation_1.shtml Dominican Republic Transportation: Carro Publicos] dr1.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] advises against traveling in Dominican Republic ''carros públicos'' because doing so makes passengers targets for robbery, and because the taxis are known to, "disregard traffic laws, often resulting in serious accidents involving injuries and sometimes death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport-eng.asp?id=77000#9 TRAVEL REPORT: Dominican Republic; 9.

====United States====
{{Main|Dollar van}}
''Jitney'' is an American English term that originally referred to a [[vehicle for hire]] intermediate between a taxi and a bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Page, Walter Hines |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 1915 |author2= Page, Arthur Wilson  |title=The March Of Events: The Jitney |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XXIX |issue= |page=618 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l_2rn8M7DSsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA618 |accessdate=2009-08-04 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally small-capacity vehicles that follow a rough service route, but can go slightly out of their way to pick up and drop off passengers. In many US cities (e.g. [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Detroit]]), the term ''jitney'' refers to an unlicensed taxi cab.

The name comes from an archaic, colloquial term for a five-cent piece in the US (the [[nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]). The common fare for the service when it first came into use was five cents, so the "five-cent cab" or "jitney cab" came to be known for the price charged.

In Rhode Island a jitney license plate is used for all public passenger buses, even for larger ones.

[[File:Atlantic City Jitney Association Champion 29.jpg|thumb|left|Jitney in [[Atlantic City]], United States in 2008]]
While jitneys became fairly common in many other countries, such as the Philippines, they first appeared in the US and Canada. The first US jitneys ran in 1914 in [[Los Angeles, California]]. By 1915, there were 62,000 nationwide. Local regulations, demanded by streetcar companies, killed the jitney in most places. By the end of 1916, only 6,000 jitneys remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Ross D. | last2 = Hilton | first2 = George W. | title = The Jitneys | journal = Journal of Law and Economics | publisher = The University of Chicago | volume = 15 | pages = 293–325 | issue = 2 | date = March 1972 | page = | location = Chicago | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

BC Electric Railway Company Limited, Vancouver, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; Operators were referred to as "jitney men." They were so successful that the city government banned them at the request of the streetcar operators.

Since the [[1973 oil crisis]] (as well as the mid-20th-century decline in transit service), jitneys have reappeared in some areas of the US, particularly in [[inner city]] areas once served by streetcars and private buses. An increase in bus fares usually leads to a significant rise in jitney usage. Liberalization of jitneys is often encouraged by [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] urban economists, such as [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]], [[Rutgers]]' [[James Dunn (economist)|James Dunn]], and [[University of Southern California|USC]]'s [[Peter Gordon (economist)|Peter Gordon]], as a more "market-friendly" alternative to public transportation. Concerns over fares, insurance liabilities, and passenger safety have kept legislative support for jitneys decidedly tepid. Nevertheless, in New York City and [[Gateway Region|northern New Jersey]], jitneys (known as "[[dollar van]]s" because of their original price) are regulated.

[[Miami]] has the country's most comprehensive jitney network, due to Caribbean influence. In [[Atlanta]] jitneys run along [[Buford Highway]].

In [[Atlantic City]] the [[Atlantic City Jitney Association|ACJA]] operates a jitney service that travels the main strip of casinos. One of the routes also services the new cluster of casinos west of Atlantic City proper.

In 2009, the Houston Waves, Houston's first jitney service in 17 years, started running. It has expanded into a network of buses operating within Loop 610 and to all special event venues in Houston.

===South America===
====Argentina====
{{main|Colectivo}}
''Colectivos'' operated as share taxis from the late 1920s until the 1950s in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] when they were integrated into the public transportation system. Vehicles still known as ''colectivos'' operate throughout the country, but have long been indistinguishable from buses.&lt;ref name="busarg"&gt;[http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm The design evolution of the colectivo.

[[File:Colectivos18.jpg|thumb|upright|Taxis ''Colectivos'' of different lines in [[Talca]], Chile]]

Often share taxi routes in [[Mexico]] are ''[[ad hoc]]'' arrangements to fill in gaps in regular public transportation, and many operate inter-city as well as local routes. In many rural areas, they are the only public transportation.

In some cases truck/taxi combination vehicles have evolved to transport light goods as well as passengers. Heavily used share taxi routes often evolve into regulated microbus public transit routes, as has occurred in [[Mexico City]] and in [[Lima]].

''Taxis colectivos'' are also found in [[Perú]], [[Chile]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Argentina]], where they are most commonly referred to simply as ''colectivos'', although in some places they have become essentially standard buses.&lt;ref name="busarg"/&gt;

In Guatemala, ''ruleteros'', minibus share taxis, pick up and discharge passengers along major streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_gt.htm Guatemala: Local Transportation] ediplomat.com, 6/8/2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prensalibre.com.gt/noticias/Ruleteros-regresan-falta-buses-barrios_0_481751857.html "Ruleteros regresan por falta de buses en barrios", Prensa Libre.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern technology-based services==

===Paratransit===
Modern [[Paratransit]] services, also known as [[demand responsive transport]] systems in the UK, can provide shared transport services in situations where scheduled services are not viable. Traditionally these services had to be booked a day in advance, but are becoming increasingly responsive using modern communications systems with a central booking system accessed by phone or internet and instant communications with GPS tracked vehicles. Unlike scheduled services the vehicles need not operate on fixed routes of timetables, although they do often have constrained routes.

===Commercial shared taxis booking services===
Some newer taxi share systems now use internet and mobile phone communications for booking and scheduling purposes, with the actual service provided by normal [[hackney carriage]] or Private Hire vehicles. Prospective passengers make bookings and supply destination details using SMS to a central server which aggregates these travel requests and creates packages of trips which are then communicated to drivers.

===Commercially operated airport shuttle buses===
There are many operators of airport shuttle services between Airports and Hotels around the world that operate on flexible routing and timing to offer a service that is both cheaper than a sole-occupancy taxi and also often more convenient that other forms of public transport. The requirement to carry luggage offers an added incentive to use such services over scheduled transport which will normally require a walk from the drop-off location to the final destination. Services from these operators are starting to spread from airports to railway stations and to other locations.

===Demand responsive transport===
{{main|Demand responsive transport}}
Some operators and/or governments around the world are now offering demand-based shared transport to residents in community with low ridership numbers, which could help maintain the existence of public transport. Operations are predefined according to bookings.

[[File:Software dev2.svg|thumb|Software release life cycle map]]

A '''software release life cycle''' is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer [[software]]: ranging from its initial development to its eventual release, and including updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix [[software bug]]s still present in the software.

== History ==
Usage of the "alpha/beta" test terminology originated at [[IBM]]. Similar terminologies for IBM's software development were used by people involved with IBM from at least the 1950s (and probably earlier). "A" test was the verification of a new product before the public announcement. "B" test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured. "C" test was the final test before the general availability of the product. As software became a significant part of IBM's offerings, the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre-announcement test and the beta test was used to show product readiness for general availability. Martin Belsky, a manager on some of IBM's earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology. IBM dropped the alpha/beta terminology during the 1960s, but by then it had received fairly wide notice. The usage of "beta test" to refer to testing done by customers was not done in IBM. Rather, IBM used the term "field test".

== Stages of development ==
=== Pre-alpha ===
Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include [[requirements analysis]], [[software design]], [[software development]], and [[unit testing]]. In typical [[Open-source software|open source]] development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. ''Milestone'' versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete.

=== {{anchor|Alpha}}Alpha ===
The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin [[software testing]] (alpha is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using [[white-box testing|white-box techniques]]. Additional validation is then performed using [[black-box testing|black-box]] or [[Grey box testing#Grey box testing|gray-box]] techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as ''alpha release''.&lt;ref name=alphadef&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=alpha+version&amp;i=37675,00.asp |title=Encyclopedia definition of alpha version |work=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427065905/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3Dalpha%20version%26i%3D37675%2C00.asp |archivedate=2011-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=29|quote=Alpha software generally barely runs and is missing major features like gameplay and complete levels.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon in [[proprietary software]], while [[FOSS|open source software]] often has publicly available alpha versions. The alpha phase usually ends with a [[Freeze (software engineering)|feature freeze]], indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be [[feature complete]].

=== {{Anchor|BETA}}Beta ===
{{Redirect|Beta test|the film|Beta Test (film)}}

Beta, named after [[Beta|the second letter of the Greek alphabet]], is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as ''betaware''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/betaware
 | title = Definition of betaware in the Free Online Encyclopedia
 | accessdate = 2015-04-06
 | website = thefreedictionary.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating [[usability testing]]. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called ''beta release'' and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a ''preview'', ''preview release'', ''prototype'', ''technical preview'' / ''technology preview'' (''TP''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview
 | title = Technology Preview Features Support Scope
 | accessdate = 2015-03-18
 | publisher = [[Red Hat]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''early access''. Some software is kept in [[perpetual beta]], where new features and functionality are continually added to the software without establishing a final "stable" release.

''Beta testers'' are people who actively report issues of beta software. They are usually customers or representatives of prospective customers of the organization that develops the software. Beta testers tend to volunteer their services free of charge but often receive versions of the product they test, discounts on the release version, or other incentives.

As the [[Internet]] has facilitated rapid and inexpensive distribution of software, companies have begun to take a looser approach to use of the word "beta".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-328.html |title=Waiting with Beta'd Breath ''TidBITS'' #328 (May 13, 1996) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515093203/http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-328.html |archivedate = 2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, [[ZDNet]] published an article about the recent phenomenon of a beta version often staying for years and being used as if it were in production level, disparagingly called "perpetual beta". It noted that [[Gmail]] and [[Google News]], for example, had been in beta for a long time although widely used; Google News did leave beta in January 2006, followed by [[G Suite|Google Apps]], including Gmail, in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html |title=Google Apps is out of beta (yes, really) |publisher=[[Google]] |work=Google Blog |date=7 July 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121002635/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html |archivedate=21 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique may allow a developer to delay offering full support and responsibility for remaining issues. In the context of [[Web 2.0]], people even talk of perpetual betas to signify that some software is meant to stay in beta state. Also, "beta" is sometimes used to indicate something more like a [[#Release candidate|release candidate]], or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 The inconvenient truths behind betas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430173029/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 |date=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of [[Windows 8]], [[Microsoft]] has called pre-release software as a "preview", rather than beta. All pre-release builds released through the [[Windows Insider Program]] launched in 2014 are termed "Insider Preview builds".

==== Open and closed beta ====
&lt;!-- Closed beta test redirects here --&gt;
Developers may release either a ''closed beta'' also called ''private beta'', or an ''open beta'' also called ''public beta''; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. Private beta could be suitable for the software that is capable to deliver value, but is not ready to be used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version. Examples of a major public beta test include the following:
* Early customers purchased a "pioneer edition" of the WordVision word processor for the [[IBM PC]] for $49.95. In 1984, [[Stephen Manes]] wrote that "in a brilliant marketing coup, Bruce and James Program Publishers managed to get people to ''pay'' for the privilege of testing the product."&lt;ref name="manes19840403"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Taking A Gamble With Word Vision |work=PC |date=1984-04-03 |accessdate=15 February 2015 |author=Manes, Stephen |pages=211 |authorlink=Stephen Manes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317045015/https://books.google.com/books?id=e-gI2W-3JwkC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;pg=PA211 |archivedate=17 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2000 a ''boxed version'' of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X Public Beta]] operating system was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Apple Releases Mac OS X Public Beta |publisher=Apple Inc. |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/sep/13macosx.html |accessdate=2011-02-22 |date=13 September 2000 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501091431/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/sep/13macosx.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Microsoft's release of ''community technology preview''s (''CTP''s) for [[Windows Vista]], between September 2005 and May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/WinVistaCTPFS.mspx |title=Microsoft Windows Vista October Community Technology Preview Fact Sheet |date=October 2005 |accessdate=2011-02-22 |publisher=Microsoft |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430145018/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/winxp/WinVistaCTPFS.mspx |archivedate=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2009 to 2011 [[Minecraft]] was in public beta.
* From December 29, 2014, all owners of ''[[Halo: The Master Chief Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox One]] were able to download and play the Beta of ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'' free of charge until January 18, 2015. Users of the Beta were reminded via an in-game popup that the release was a Beta and could contain some glitches, and were encouraged to communicate them through the [[Halo series|''Halo'' series]] online community.

Open betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers, and testing among an extremely wide user base likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.

=== Release candidate ===
A ''release candidate'' (''RC''), also known as "going silver", is a beta version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant [[computer bug|bugs]] emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called ''code complete'' when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral code for test cases or utilities. Beta testers, if privately selected, will often be credited for using the release candidate as though it were a finished product. Beta testing is conducted in a client's or customer's location and to test the software from a user's perspective.

== {{Anchor|STABLE-RELEASE}}Release ==
Once released, the software is generally known as a "stable release". The formal term often depends on the method of release: physical media, online release or a web application.

=== {{Anchor|RTM|Release to manufacturing|Release to marketing|RTM or RTW}}Release to manufacturing (RTM) ===
The term "release to manufacturing", also known as "going gold", is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be [[Code signing|digitally signed]], allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software purchase. A copy of the RTM build known as the "gold master" or GM is sent for mass duplication if applicable. RTM precedes general availability (GA) when the product is released to the public.

It is typically used in certain retail mass-production software contexts—as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution—where the software is sold as part of a bundle in a related computer hardware sale and typically where the software and related hardware is ultimately to be available and sold on mass/public basis at retail stores to indicate that the software has met a defined quality level and is ready for mass retail distribution. RTM could also mean in other contexts that the software has been delivered or released to a client or customer for installation or distribution to the related hardware end user computers or machines. The term does ''not'' define the delivery mechanism or volume; it only states that the quality is sufficient for mass distribution. The deliverable from the engineering organization is frequently in the form of a golden master media used for duplication or to produce the image for the web.

=== {{Anchor|GA|General availability}}General availability (GA) ===
[[File:ProductEndOfLifeCycle.png|thumb|Milestones in a product life cycle: general availability (GA), [[end of life announcement]] (EOLA), [[last order date]] (LOD), and [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] (EOL)]]
''General availability'' (''GA'') is the marketing stage at which all necessary [[commercialization]] activities have been completed and a software product is available for purchase, depending, however, on language, region, electronic vs. media availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|first=Yvan Philippe |last=Luxembourg |title=Top 200 SAM Terms – A Glossary Of Software Asset Management Terms |url=http://omtco.eu/references/sam/top-200-sam-terms-a-glossary-of-software-asset-management-terms/ |publisher=OMTCO |date=20 May 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810111112/http://omtco.eu/references/sam/top-200-sam-terms-a-glossary-of-software-asset-management-terms/ |archivedate=10 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercialization activities could include security and compliance tests, as well as localization and worldwide availability. The time between RTM and GA can be from a week to months in some cases before a generally available release can be declared because of the time needed to complete all commercialization activities required by GA. At this stage, the software has "gone live".

=== {{Anchor|Web release}}Release to web (RTW) ===
''Release to the web (RTW)'' or ''web release'' is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution. No physical media are produced in this type of release mechanism by the manufacturer. Web releases are becoming more common as Internet usage grows.

== Support ==
During its supported lifetime, software is sometimes subjected to service releases, [[patch (computing)|patches]] or [[service pack]]s, sometimes also called "interim releases". For example, Microsoft released three major service packs for the [[32-bit Windows|32-bit]] editions of [[Windows XP]] and two service packs for the [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] editions. Such service releases contain a collection of updates, fixes, and enhancements, delivered in the form of a single installable package. They may also implement new features. Some software is released with the expectation of regular support. Classes of software that generally involve protracted support as the norm include [[Antivirus software|anti-virus suites]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s. A good example of a game that utilizes this process is [[Minecraft]], an [[indie game]] developed by [[Mojang]], which features regular "updates" featuring new content and bug fixes.

=== End-of-life {{Anchor|EOL|End of life}} ===
{{See also|End-of-life (product)|abandonware}}

When software is no longer sold or supported, the product is said to have reached end-of-life, to be discontinued, retired, deprecated, abandoned, or obsolete, but user loyalty may continue its existence for some time, even long after its platform is obsolete—e.g., the [[Atari ST]] and Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum]].

After the end-of-life date, the developer will usually not implement any new features, fix existing defects, bugs or vulnerabilities (known before that date or not) or provide any support for the product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="892">In [[electronics]] ([[radio]] in particular), a '''spurious tone''' (also known as an '''interfering tone''', a '''continuous tone''' or a '''spur''') denotes a tone in an [[electronic circuit]] which interferes with a signal and is often masked underneath that signal.

'''''The Clean Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity''''' is a 2007 book by [[Ron Pernick]] and [[Clint Wilder]], who say that commercializing [[clean technology|clean technologies]] is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into [[mainstream]] business. As the world economy faces challenges from energy price spikes, [[Peak oil|resource shortages]], [[global warming|global environmental problems]], and [[Brittle Power|security threats]], clean technologies are seen to be the next engine of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology sectors: [[solar power]], [[wind power]], [[biofuels]], [[green building]]s, [[Sustainable transport|personal transportation]], the [[smart grid]], mobile applications, and [[water filtration]].&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;Anderson, Leonard (August 5, 2007). [http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/08/05/for_investors_a_heads_up_on_clean_tech/ For investors, a heads-up on clean tech]  ''The Boston Globe''. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Six major forces, which they call the six C’s, are pushing clean technology into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate.&lt;ref name=sixcs/&gt; Very large corporations such as [[GE]], [[Toyota]] and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and investment firms such as [[Goldman Sachs]] are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt;

The book has been reviewed in ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', ''Energy Priorities'', ''Sustainability Investment News'' and several other magazines, and has been translated into seven languages.&lt;ref name=huffing&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/clint-wilder Clint Wilder] ''Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Clean Tech Nation]]'' is the sequel to ''The Clean Tech Revolution''.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/09/21/clean-tech-nation-book-review/ |title=Clean Tech Nation (Book Review) |author=Adam Johnston |date=September 21, 2012 |work=Clean Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Pernick and Wilder explain that, in the 1970s, clean technology was considered “alternative,” the province of back-to-the-land lifestyle advocates, altruistic environmentalists, and lab scientists on research grants.  Such technology was in an early stage of development, was too expensive, it did not have widespread political support, and very few large, established companies were embracing the sector. Even at the start of the 21st century, the term ''clean tech'' was not yet in the financial or business community’s vocabulary. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is "the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernick and Wilder define "clean tech" as "any product, service, or process that delivers value using limited or zero non-renewable resources and/or creates significantly less waste than conventional offerings."&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt;&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt; They highlight eight major clean technology sectors: [[solar power]], [[wind power]], [[biofuels]], [[green building]]s, [[Sustainable transport|personal transportation]], the [[smart grid]], mobile applications (such as portable [[fuel cells]]), and [[water filtration]].&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt; The authors explain how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas.  Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies, companies, and regions that are leading the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007|loc=Introduction pp.1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors present a list of drivers for clean tech: "high energy prices, depleted natural resources, volatile sources of foreign oil, record deficits, and unprecedented environmental and security challenges".&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt; The central message, which is repeated in almost every chapter, is that a clean tech revolution with benefit humanity worldwide, and will require significant collaboration between the public and private sectors.&lt;ref name=erbinst&gt;{{cite web |url=http://erbsustainability.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/book-review-23/ |title=Book Review: The Clean Tech Revolution |author=Gruber, Paul |date=November 2008 |work=Perspective |publisher=[[Erb Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernick and Wilder present examples which show that the "clean tech revolution" is already under way. Very large corporations such as [[GE]], [[Toyota]] and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and investment firms such as [[Goldman Sachs]] are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.&lt;ref name="inside" /&gt; Emerging clean tech cities are seen to include [[Copenhagen]], where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmark's electricity, and Chicago, a leader in "green" buildings saving energy, heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt; Statistics from the U.S. and from abroad, especially from China, India, Brazil, and Europe are presented.&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt;

The authors' claim that [[nuclear power]] and [[clean coal]] are not clean technologies.  Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, "multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also believe that ''clean coal'' is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pernick and Wilder do not recommend specific stocks or securities. They prefer to lay out a blueprint of opportunities, technologies, companies, and trends that may build successful businesses and strengthen economies.&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt;

==Six C's==
[[File:Wind power plants in Xinjiang, China.jpg|thumb|[[Wind farm]] in [[Xinjiang]], China]]

Pernick and Wilder identify six major forces, which they call the six C’s, that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate.&lt;ref name=sixcs&gt;{{harvnb|Pernick|Wilder|2007|pp=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt;

*'''Costs.''' "Perhaps the most powerful force driving today’s clean-tech growth is simple economics. As a general trend, clean-energy costs are falling as the costs of [[fossil fuel]] energy are going up. The future of clean tech is going to be, in many ways, about scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs."
*'''Capital.''' "An unprecedented influx of capital is changing the clean tech landscape, with billions of dollars, euros, yen, and yuan pouring in from a myriad of public and private sector sources."
*'''Competition.''' "Governments are competing aggressively in the highstakes race to dominate in the clean-tech sector and build the jobs of the future."
*'''China.''' "Clean tech is being driven by the inexorable demands being placed on the earth not only by mature economies but also by the explosive demand for resources in [[Energy policy of China|China]], [[Solar power in India|India]], and other developing nations. Their expanding energy needs are driving major growth in clean-energy, transportation, building, and water-delivery technologies." 
*'''Consumers.''' "Savvy consumers are demanding cleaner products and services that use resources efficiently, reduce costs, and embrace quality over quantity."
*'''Climate.''' "The debate around [[climate change]] has gone from question mark to peer-reviewed certainty, and smart businesses are taking heed."&lt;ref name=sixcs/&gt;

The six C’s are a simple list of factors, not necessarily a useful framework for understanding, or profiting from, the clean technology industry.&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt;

==Release and reception==
''The Clean Tech Revolution'' was published by [[HarperCollins|Collins]] as a 320-page hardcover book on June 12, 2007. An [[e-book]] version was published by [[HarperCollins]] on June 7, 2007. In 2008, a revised paperback edition was published, with a new sub-title: ''Discover the Top Trends, Technologies and Companies to Watch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pernick|first=Ron|title=The Clean Tech Revolution: Discover the Top Trends, Technologies and Companies to Watch|year=2008|publisher=Collins Business|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-089624-9|author2=Wilder, Clint  |oclc=191930205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been translated into seven languages.&lt;ref name=huffing/&gt;

Paul Gruber from the [[Erb Institute]] states that ''The Clean Tech Revolution'' is logically organized and is "an excellent resource for those who would like a solid understanding of clean tech and the potential of each sector". He also says that it is very useful for those seeking out the names of companies, NGOs, agencies, and people working on each technology.&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt; Gruber identifies one omission: the concern that major investments in clean technology parallel those made during the Internet boom, with the attendant fear that there "may be a bubble burst with clean tech".&lt;ref name=erbinst/&gt;

The physicist and environmentalist, [[Joseph Romm]], has recommended ''The Clean Tech Revolution'' to people who are looking for one book to help them understand what is happening in clean technology. He says ''The Clean Tech Revolution''  is the only book that covers the whole gamut of the latest in clean energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romm|first=Joseph|title=If you only read one book, pick this one|url=http://grist.org/article/the-best-clean-tech-book/|newspaper=Grist|date=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russ Juskalian from ''[[USA Today]]'' says ''The Clean Tech Revolution'' shows the green movement not in "heartstring terms" but as economically profitable. The real power players are the mainstream consumers, investors, entrepreneurs, governments and multinational corporations whose "eyes are trained on that most crucial of economic fundamentals: the bottom line".&lt;ref&gt;Juskalian, Russ (September 4, 2007). [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/environment/2007-09-03-clean-tech_N.htm Review: 'Clean tech' eyes green (as in cash)] ''USA Today''. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Reena Jana from ''[[Business Week]]'', ''The Clean Tech Revolution'' is a "readable, straightforward guide to earth-friendly business strategies". The authors explain how businesses can follow the lead of companies such as Toyota by designing, selling, or funding inventive [[Sustainable products|eco-friendly products]] and services. Jana says that the [[Toyota Prius]] is just one well-known example of successful clean technology in action.&lt;ref&gt;Jana, Reena (June 22, 2007). [http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2007/id20070622_491833.htm The Business Benefits of Going Green] ''Business Week''. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Denis Du Bois, editor of ''Energy Priorities'' magazine, commented on the realistic and  comprehensive coverage of the book. However, he suggests that ''The Clean Tech Revolution'' is not an explanation of the technologies and how they work, nor is it an analysis of energy or [[environmental policy]]. Policy is complicated and the authors avoid discussing it in detail.&lt;ref name="ep"&gt;Du Bois, Denis (June 11, 2007). [http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/the_clean_tech_revolution.php Book Review: "The Clean Tech Revolution"] ''Energy Priorities''. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Little discussion ties the various clean technologies together and a "single-minded American focus" dominates. There is very little on the influence of mass transit and urban planning in Europe and other progressive regions. The chapter on water focuses on filtration, which is already an area of considerable opportunity, affecting even "green" industries, such as [[photovoltaics]] manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ep" /&gt;

Francesca Rheannon in ''Sustainability Investment News'' says that the book does not ask the most challenging question of all: is "clean growth" an oxymoron? She says that at a time when some experts say [[carbon emission]]s will need to be cut by 80 to 90% by 2050, the world may have to accept steady or even decreasing energy production, no matter how clean it is.&lt;ref name=socialf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/2411.html |title=Book Review: The Clean Tech Revolution |author= Rheannon, Francesca |date=November 5, 2007  |work=Sustainability Investment News  |publisher=Social Funds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheannon also states that there is little coverage of social issues. For example, nowhere is there mention of how water supply privatization and delivery by multinational corporations could affect the poor people of the world.&lt;ref name=socialf/&gt;

The ''Clean Tech Revolution'' was followed by the 2012 book ''[[Clean Tech Nation]]: How the U.S. Can Lead in the New Global Economy''.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2012/09/08/clean-tech-nation-the-scramble-for-clean-tech-supremacy/ |title=Clean Tech Nation: The Scramble for Clean Tech Supremacy |author=Pentland, William |date=September 8, 2012  |work=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Triumph of Technique: The Industrialization of Agriculture and the Destruction of Rural America''''' is a 2004 book by [[Robert Wolf (writer)|Robert Wolf]].

''The Triumph of Technique'' examines contemporary [[agriculture]] and its impact on rural [[economics|economies]]. This book has been hailed by leaders of the [[sustainable agriculture]] movement as a significant contribution to understanding the depth of the current crisis in agriculture and its implications.

The “technique” of the title refers not only to technologies but to any methods developed for the purpose of achieving predetermined ends. Wolf argues that technique, as he defines it, has taken the art out of farming by transforming it into [[agribusiness]], on a much larger scale.  He claims that this transformation has led to the decline of rural communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2107">The '''Uranium Information Centre''' (UIC) was an Australian organisation primarily concerned with increasing the public understanding of [[uranium mining]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear]] [[electricity generation]]. 

Founded in 1978, the Centre worked for many years to provide information about the development of the Australian uranium industry, the contribution it can make to world energy supplies and the benefits it can bring Australia. It was a broker of [[information]] on all aspects of the [[mining]] and processing of [[uranium]], the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and the role of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in helping to meet world electricity demand.

The Centre was funded by companies involved in uranium exploration, mining and export in Australia.

In 1995 [[Ian Hore-Lacy]] assumed the role of General Manager of the UIC, a position he held until 2001. The UIC's website was established in the year of his appointment. After leaving the UIC, Ian Hore-Lacy went on to work for the [[World Nuclear Association]] (WNA) as Director of Public Information for 12 years and as of 2015 he continues to work there as a Senior Research Analyst. In the late 2000s, the UIC's main information-providing function was assumed by the WNA and World Nuclear News (WNN), based in London, UK.

In 2008 the UIC's purely domestic function was taken over by the [[Australian Uranium Association]], and was subsequently absorbed by the [[Minerals Council of Australia]]'s uranium portfolio in 2013.

==Implications==  
I believe the implications should be covered but I can find no professional or reliable published opinions on the company's implications.

==Technology==
Vaxess's business plan is based around a technology developed by Tufts University Professors Fiorenzo Omenetto and David Kaplan.  The technology uses a silk-derived protein called fibroin to stabilize vaccines so that they can be shipped and stored without refrigeration, eliminating the need for the [[cold chain]].&lt;ref name="Harvard Innovation Lab - Vaxess"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaxess Technologies|url=http://i-lab.harvard.edu/presidents-challenge/finalists/vaxess-technologies|publisher=[[Harvard Innovation Lab]]|accessdate=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="America24 - The Italian startup that won Harvard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marinelli|first=Andrea|title=Vaxess, la startup italiana che ha conquistato Harvard|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Famerica24.com%2Fnews%2Fvaxess-la-startup-italiana-che-ha-conquistato-harvard|accessdate=14 June 2012|newspaper=America24|date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Globe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Winning the competition for ideas|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-05-20/business/31779616_1_vaccines-social-impact-bonds-refrigeration|accessdate=21 May 2012|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaxess is working with vaccine manufacturers to develop heat-stable vaccines and targeting a product launch by 2019.&lt;ref name="Forbes - Vaxess Goes To Harvard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohan|first=Peter|title=Vaxess Goes To Harvard|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/08/13/vaxess-goes-to-harvard/|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wahl Clipper Corporation''', based in [[Sterling, Illinois]], manufactures grooming products for people and animals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WAHL+IN+THE+FAMILY.-a055022112&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded on the strength of [[Leo J. Wahl]]'s [[patent]] for an electromagnetic [[hair clipper]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wahl.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Wahl introduced the first vacuum clipper, which allowed a person's hair to be cut without use of a cape.

==Operations==
In 1967 Wahl produced the first cordless hair clipper using its own rechargeable battery technology. Four years later it started an electronics division with the world's first cordless and rechargeable [[solder]]ing iron. In 1975 the company released a line of back and foot massagers utilizing the vibrating motor technology used in their hair trimmers.  In 1984 Wahl invented the first cordless consumer beard and mustache trimmer.  

In 2001 it patented the first vacuuming consumer beard trimmer, the Trim N Vac.  Wahl manufactures its clippers and trimmers in its own factories in Sterling, Illinois; [[Germany]], [[England]], [[China]], and [[Hungary]].  

==Products==
Wahl is also a brand of men's trimmers including trimmers for beards, mustaches, goatees, body, and ear / nose &amp; brow.  

Products are sold in over 150 countries worldwide under the brands Wahl, Moser, Lister and more recently Groom Ease.  In 2006 Wahl licensed the ''[[For Dummies]]'' brand from [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] publishing company and launched the Home Haircutting for Dummies product line.

The Wahl 'Super Taper' is one the most popular electric razors used by barbers across the world today. Its adjustable blade length makes it very useful in the world of modern barbering with popularity of "Skin-fades" and other "faded" haircuts.
