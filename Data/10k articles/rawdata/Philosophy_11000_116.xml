The '''world soul''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ψυχὴ κόσμου ''psuchè kósmou'', [[Latin]]: ''anima mundi'') is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living things on the planet, which relates to our world in much the same way as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the human body.   [[Plato]] adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most [[Neoplatonic]] systems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', 30b–c, 33b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of [[eastern philosophy]] in the [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Buddha-Nature]] in [[Mahayana Buddhism]],{{fact|date=May 2016}} and in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|School of Yin-Yang]], [[Hundred Schools of Thought#Taoism|Taoism]], and [[Neo-Confucianism#World view|Neo-Confucianism]] as ''[[qi]]''.

Other resemblances can be found in the thoughts of [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] philosophers like [[Paracelsus]], and by [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Friedrich Schelling]] and in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"/"Mind"). [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] published "The Over-Soul" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a ''universal soul''. There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by [[Gaia Theory|Gaia theorists]] such as [[James Lovelock]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of "[[Chokhmah]] Ila'ah," the all-encompassing "Supernal Wisdom" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps "channeled") by a perfect [[tzaddik]] (holy man).&lt;ref&gt;Likutey Moharan I, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tzaddik attains "[[cosmic consciousness]]" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.

As a [[political movement]] in [[France]], '''antinaturalism''' is closely linked to the [[animal welfare]] movement; some antinaturalists posit that any reference to [[Natural law]], such as the reintroduction of [[wolf]] predators into a forest to curb [[deer]] [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]], is a form of [[speciesism]], and encourage [[veganism]] in human beings as well as in [[predator]] animals, as a way of showing equal respect to the lives of [[prey]] as to the lives of predators.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  

==Philosophy==
Some French antinaturalists defend the inherent and absolute moral permissibility of [[abortion]], [[body modification]], [[divorce]], [[contraception]], [[sex reassignment surgery]], and other means by which they believe human beings can assume control of their own bodies and their own environments (see also [[transhumanism]]).  Antinaturalism stands in contrast to some [[radical environmentalist]] movements, which state that [[Nature]] itself is sacred, and should be preserved for its own sake; antinaturalism posits that all human acts are natural, and that ecological preservation is important inasmuch as it is necessary for the well-being of [[sentient]] life, not because of some inherently sacred attribute of Nature as a whole.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The  '''''Aparokshanubhuti''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अपरोक्षानुभूतिः) is a famous work attributed to [[Adi Shankara]]. It is a popular introductory work that expounds [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy. It describes a method that seekers can follow to directly experience the essential truth of one's one nature. Thus, the work is literally titled ''Aparokshanubhuti'', or ''Direct Experience''. Swami Vimuktananda titles his translation ''Self-Realization''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vimuktananda|first=Swami |title=Self-Realization|publisher=[[Advaita Ashrama]]|year=1993|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
The oldest extant commentary on this work is a Sanskrit commentary (Dipika or 'Elucidation') by Sri [[Vidyaranya]]. This work has been repeatedly translated and commented upon in other languages.

Taylor &amp; Francis; 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-415-18571-4}}. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shia Islam|Shia Islamic scholar]], [[philosopher]], [[architect]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and poet who lived in the late 16th and early 17th centuries in [[Safavid Iran]].{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}} He was born in [[Baalbek]], [[Ottoman Syria]] (present-day [[Lebanon]]) but immigrated in his childhood to Safavid Iran with the rest of his family.{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}}  He was one of the earliest astronomers in the Islamic world to suggest the possibility of the Earth's movement prior to the spread of the [[Copernican theory]].{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}} He is considered one of the main co-founders of [[Isfahan School]] of [[Islamic Philosophy]]. In later years he became one of the teachers of [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]. ''[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/molla-sadra-sirazi MOLLĀ ṢADRĀ ŠIRĀZI]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote over 100 treatises and books in different topics,{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}} in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. A number of architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}} These may have included the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and [[Charbagh Avenue]] in [[Isfahan]],&lt;ref&gt;Kheirabadi Masoud (2000). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HEumaflGM_cC Iranian Cities: Formation and Development]''. Syracuse University Press. pp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;. He is buried in [[Imam Reza]]'s shrine in [[Mashad]] in Iran.

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}
Shaykh Baha' al-Din (also spelled Baha'uddin) Muhammad ibn Husayn al-'Amili was born near [[Baalbek]], in [[Ottoman Syria]] (present-day Lebanon) in 1547.{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}} After the execution of al-Shahid al-Tani in 1558, his father's mentor, he and his family moved to the neighboring [[Safavid Empire]]; first to [[Isfahan]], and from there to [[Qazvin]], the then Iranian royal capital.{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}} At the time, the Safavid realm was ruled by king [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524-1576).{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}}  Tahmasp I appointed Shaykh Bahāʾī's father to serve as ''[[Shaykh al-Islām]]'' in several important Safavid cities in order to propagate [[Twelver Shiism|Twelver Shi'ism]] amongst the population.{{sfn|Kohlberg|1988|pages=429-430}}

Shaykh Bahāʾī completed his studies in [[Isfahan]]. Having intended to travel to [[Mecca]] in 1570, he visited many Islamic countries including [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] and after spending four years there, he returned to Iran.

Shaykh Baha' al-Din died in 1621 in Isfahan. His body was buried in [[Mashhad]] according to his will.

===Exact dates of birth and death===
The exact dates of his birth and death are different on his grave stone and on the ceramic of the walls of the room where he is buried in. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''Date of birth''':
*''On the ceramics of the wall'': 27 February 1547
*''On the grave stone'': March 1546

'''Date of death''':
*''On the ceramics of the wall'': 30 August 1621
*''On the grave stone'': August 1622

The dates on the wall contain day, month and year, while the dates on the grave stone only contain month and year. The ceramics of the wall are made in 1945. It seems that at that time a research is performed about the exact dates, and, therefore, the information about the day is added to the dates.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Pen name===
According to [[Bahá'í]] scholar [[‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávari]], Shaykh Baha' al-Din adopted the pen name (''[[Pen name#Persian and Urdu poetry|takhallus]]'') 'Baha' after being inspired by words of [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Shi'a Imam]] [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] (the fifth Imam) and Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the [[Names of God in the Qur'an#100th name|Greatest Name of God]] was included in either [[Du'ay-i-Sahar]] or [[Du'ay-i-Umm-i-Davud]]. In the first verse of the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a dawn prayer for the [[Ramadan]], the name "Bahá" appears four times: "Allahumma inni as 'aluka min Bahá' ika bi Abháh va kulla Bahá' ika Bahí".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Bahá'u'lláh and His Most Holy Shrine | first = Dhikru'llah | last = Khadem | authorlink = Dhikru'llah Khadem |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1976 | issue = 540 |pages=4–5 | url = http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His descendants now live in all over Iran with a major concentration on Isfahan city. The family name of his new generation is "Jabalameli" or "Jabal Ameli" which attributes them to their origin land, which was Jabal Amel.

His interest in the sciences is also apparent by some of his works and treaties, although many of his astronomical treatises are yet to be studied.{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}} He probably have written 17 tracts and books on astronomy and related subjects. The following are some his works in astronomy:

* ''Risālah dar ḥall‐i ishkāl‐i ʿuṭārid wa qamar'' (''Treatise on the problems of the Moon and Mercury''), on attempting to solve inconsistencies of the [[Ptolemaic system]] within the context of [[Islamic astronomy]].
* ''Tashrīḥ al‐aflāk'' (''Anatomy of the celestial spheres''), a summary of theoretical astronomy where he affirms the view that supports the positional rotation of the Earth. He was one of Islamic astronomers to advocate the feasibility of the Earth's rotation in the 16th century, independent of Western influences. {{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}}
* ''Kholasat al-Hesab'' (''The summa of [[arithmetic]]'') was translated into German by [[G. H. F. Nesselmann]] and was published as early as 1843.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

== Architecture ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

Shaykh Baha' al-Din's fame was due to his excellent command of mathematics, architecture and geometry. A number or architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}}

Shaykh Baha' al-Din is also attributed with architectural planning of the city of Isfahan during the Safavid era. He was the architect of Isfahan's [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square|Imam Square]], [[Shah Mosque|Imam Mosque]] and [[Hessar Najaf]]. He also made a sun clock to the west of the Imam Mosque. There is also no doubt about his mastery of topography. The best instance of this is the directing of the water of the [[Zayandeh River]] to different areas of Isfahan. He designed a canal called [[Zarrin Kamar]] in Isfahan which is one of Iran's greatest canals. He also determined the direction of [[Qiblah]] (prayer direction) from the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square.

He also designed and constructed a furnace for a public bathroom, which still exists in Isfahan, known as ''Sheikh Bahaei's bathroom''. It is said that the furnace was warmed by a single candle, which was placed in an enclosure; and that the candle burned for a long time, warming the bath's water. It is also said that according to his own instructions, the candle's fire would be put out if the enclosure was ever opened. It is believed that this happened during the restoration and repair of the building and it was not possible to make the system work again. In fact, Sheikh Bahaei used the flammable gases that were naturally produced in a nearby cesspool for heating the bath's water. Recently in 1969-70 the bathroom heating system was excavated and some series of underground pipe lines made of sun dried clay were discovered. Even though there are many theories about the working of this heating system, it was concluded recently that he knew about biogas and the network was to guide toilet wells which were common to Iranian's houses and mosques.

It is said that he also designed the [[Manar Jonban]] (shaking minaret), which still exists in Isfahan; but this edifice was built in the fourteenth century during the Il-khanid period on the tomb of Amu Abdollah, a pious sheikh who died in that century.

The [[High Council of Cultural Revolution]] in Iran designated April 23 as the [[National Architect Day]], marking the birth anniversary of Sheikh Bahaei.

==Imami Jurisprudence==
In the [[Twelver]] tradition, Shaykh Bahai is regarded as a leading scholar of his age and a [[mujaddid]] of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Iranica]], ''[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-al-din-ameli-shaikh-mohammad-b BAHĀʾ-AL-DĪN ʿĀMELĪ, SHAIKH MOḤAMMAD B. ḤOSAYN BAHĀʾĪ]'' by E. Kohlberg.&lt;/ref&gt; His erudition won him the admiration of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], and he was appointed the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] of Isfahan after the death of the previous [[incumbent]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; He composed works on [[tafsir]], [[hadith]], [[grammar]] and [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence).&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

==Mysticism==
Shaykh Baha' al-Din was also an adept of [[mysticism]]. He had a distinct [[Sufi]] leaning for which he was criticized by Mohammad Baqer Majlesi.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; During his travels he dressed like a [[Dervish]]&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; and frequented Sufi circles.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; He also appears in the chain of both the Nurbakhshi and [[Ni'matullāhī]] Sufi orders.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; In the work called "Resāla fi’l-waḥda al-wojūdīya" (Exposition of the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud (Unity of Existences), he states that the Sufis are the true believers,&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; calls for an unbiased assessment of their utterances,&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; and refers to his own mystical experiences.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; His Persian poetry is also replete with mystical allusions and symbols.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; At the same time, Shaykh Baha' al-Din calls for strict adherence to the [[Sharia]] as a prerequisite for embarking on the [[Tariqah]]&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; and did not hold a high view of [[antinomian]] mysticism.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Manuscript by Shaykh Bahai.gif|thumb|A manuscript by Shaykh Bahai]]
Shaykh Baha' al-Din contributed numerous works in philosophy, logic, astronomy and mathematics. His works include over 100 articles, epistles and books. Shaykh Baha' al-Din also composed poems in [[Persian language|Persian]]. His outstanding works in the Persian language are ''Jāmi’-i Abbāsī'' and two [[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavis]] (rhymed couplets) by the names of ''Shīr u Shakar'' ("Milk and Sugar") and ''Nān u Halwā'' ("Bread and Halva").{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

His other important work is the ''Kashkūl'', which includes stories, news, scientific topics, [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[proverb]]s.

His also wrote ''Khulāṣat al‐ḥisāb'' ({{lang-ar|خلاصة الحساب}}, lit. "Essentials of arithmetic"), an Arabic textbook that became popular throughout the Islamic world from Egypt to India until the 19th century. It was translated into German in Berlin by [[G. H. F. Nesselmann]] and published in 1843. A French translation appeared later 1854.{{sfn|Hashemipour|2007}}

'''Bhakti yoga''', also called '''Bhakti marga''' (literally the path of ''[[Bhakti]]''), is a spiritual path or [[spiritual practice]] within [[Hinduism]] focused on loving devotion towards a [[God in Hinduism|personal god]].&lt;ref name=karen19&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 19-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cutler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Norman|title=Songs of Experience|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1987|pages=1–2|isbn=978-0-253-35334-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=veSItWingx8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the paths in the spiritual practices of Hindus, others being [[Jnana yoga]] and [[Karma yoga]]. The tradition has ancient roots. Bhakti is mentioned in the ''[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]]'' where it simply means participation, devotion and love for any endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 326&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/266/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 267&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhakti yoga'' as one of three spiritual paths for salvation is discussed in depth by the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Lochtefeld (2014), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, {{ISBN|978-0823922871}}, pages 98-100, also see articles on bhaktimārga and jnanamārga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klostermaier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus|authorlink=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A survey of Hinduism|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1989|pages=210–212|isbn=978-0-88706-807-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechelis (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, pages 14-15, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bhakti marga'' involving these deities grew with the ''[[Bhakti Movement]]'', starting about the mid-1st millennium CE, from [[Tamil Nadu]] in South India. The movement was led by the Saiva [[Nayanars]]&lt;ref name="Embree"&gt;{{cite book|last=Embree|first=Ainslie Thomas | authorlink=Ainslie Embree|author2=Stephen N.

[[File:(A) Hindu in midst of puja in Himachal Pradesh India.jpg|thumb|left|Bhakti yoga by a Hindu in [[Himachal Pradesh]].]]
The Sanskrit word ''bhakti'' is derived from the root ''bhaj'', which means "divide, share, partake, participate, to belong to".&lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prentiss"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pechilis Prentiss|first=Karen|title=The Embodiment of Bhakti|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=US|year=1999|page=24|isbn=978-0-19-512813-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vu95WgeUBfEC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=Karel|title=Love Divine: studies in bhakti and devotional mysticism|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|pages=168|isbn=978-0-7007-0235-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYahlaJCLnYC&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word also means "attachment, devotion to, fondness for, homage, faith or love, worship, piety to something as a spiritual, religious principle or means of salvation".&lt;ref name=monier&gt;See [[Monier-Williams]], ''Sanskrit Dictionary'', 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''yoga'' literally means "union, yoke", and in this context connotes a path or practice for "salvation, liberation".&lt;ref name="Brannigan2010p18"/&gt; The ''yoga'' referred to here is the "joining together, union" of one's ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (true self) with the concept of ''[[Brahman]]'' (true Reality).&lt;ref name="Brannigan2010p18"/&gt;

According to Samrat Kumar, bhakti yoga is an Indian tradition of "divine love mysticism", a spiritual path "synonymous for an intimate understanding of oneness and harmony of the eternal individual with the Divine (the universal Being) and all creatures, a constant delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samrat S Kumar|title=Bhakti - The Yoga of Love: Trans-Rational Approaches to Peace Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzA3oAAHAQIC|year=2010|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-50130-1|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
{{main|Bhagavad Gita}}

Bhakti yoga is one of three ''yoga'' taught in ''Bhagavad Gita''.&lt;ref name="Brannigan2010p18"/&gt; ''Bhakti yoga'' is, according to Peter Bishop, a devotee's loving devotion to a personal god as the path for spirituality.&lt;ref name=bishop47/&gt; The other two paths are ''jnana yoga'', the path of wisdom where the Hindu pursues knowledge and introspective self-understanding as spiritual practice, while ''karma yoga'' is path of virtuous action (karma) neither expecting a reward nor consequences for doing the right thing, or ''nishkama karma''.&lt;ref name="Brannigan2010p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael C.

===Bhagavata Purana===
{{main|Bhagavata Purana}}

The ''Bhagavata Purana'' is a popular and influential text in the Vaishnavism traditions, and it discusses [[Ishvara]] pranidhana (devotion to a personal god).&lt;ref name="Bryant2017"/&gt; The Sanskrit text presents various modes of bhakti specifically to incarnations of [[Vishnu]], particularly in terms of "Narayana, Krishna".

== Traditions ==
{{main|Bhakti movement}}
Hinduism, in its scriptures such as chapter 7 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', recognizes four kinds of devotees who practice Bhakti yoga.&lt;ref name=grimes84/&gt;&lt;ref name="Malpan1992p147"&gt;{{cite book|author=Varghese Malpan|title=A Comparative Study of the Bhagavad-gītā and the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola on the Process of Spiritual Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSy_BSaO2BwC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1992|publisher=GBP|isbn=978-88-7652-648-0|pages=147–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hawley2011p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Hawley|title=The Bhagavad Gita: A Walkthrough for Westerners |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nfe_tgzvbg0C&amp;pg=PA71 |year=2011|publisher=New World Library|isbn=978-1-60868-057-3|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practice it because they are hard pressed or stressed by anxiety or their life's circumstances and see Bhakti yoga as a form of relief. The second type practice Bhakti yoga to learn about god out of curiosity and intellectual intrigue. The third type seek rewards in this or in afterlife through their Bhakti yoga. The fourth are those who love god driven by pure love, knowing and seeking nothing beyond that experience of love union.&lt;ref name=grimes84&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

Major traditions include the Shaiva who focus on [[Shiva]] theology; the Vaishnava who worship [[Vishnu]] or his [[avatar]]s such as [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]; and the Shakta who focus on goddess, also called ''[[Devi]]'' such as [[Durga]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Parvati]].

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images ([[murti]]) are icons of ''saguna'' [[Brahman]], a means to thinking about the abstract Ultimate Reality called ''nirguna'' Brahman. The five or six icons are seen by [[Smartas]] as multiple representations of the one [[Saguna Brahman]] (i.e., a personal God with form), rather than as distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as "That art Thou".&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;[https://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects The Four Denominations of Hinduism], Basics of Hinduism, Kauai Hindu Monastery&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saiva Siddhanta===
The [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Śaivasiddhānta]] tradition favors Bhakti yoga, emphasizing loving devotion to Shiva.{{Sfn|Mariasusai Dhavamony|1971|pp=14-22, 257-258}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

The tradition teaches ethical living, service to the community and through one's work, loving worship, yoga practice and discipline, continuous learning and self-knowledge as means for liberating the individual soul from bondage.&lt;ref name=britshaivasiddhanta&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shaiva-siddhanta Shaiva Siddhanta], Encyclopedia Britannica (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S Parmeshwaranand|title=Encyclopaedia of the Śaivism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQvbJDacNDMC&amp;pg=PA210|year=2004|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-427-4|pages=210–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakti Bhakti===
[[File:Meerabai (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Meera]]bai is considered as one of the most significant sants in the [[Vaishnava]] bhakti tradition.&lt;ref name=smpandey&gt;SM Pandey (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1061803 Mīrābāī and Her Contributions to the Bhakti Movement], History of Religions, Vol. 5, No. 1, pages 54-73&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The specific Bhakti yoga practices amongst Shakta are similar to those in other traditions of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Mackenzie Brown|title=The Devi Gita: The Song of the Goddess: A Translation, Annotation, and Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZVhvra-n9wC |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-9773-9|pages=208–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDaniel2004p11"&gt;{{cite book|author=June McDaniel|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=11–13, 209–221, 265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shakta devotion is common in eastern states of India, particularly [[West Bengal]]. The personal god here varies, and includes [[Durga]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara Ma]] (Buddhist influence), [[Kali]] and to a lesser extent [[Saraswati]], [[Lakshmi]], Bharat Mata (land goddess), according to June McDaniel.&lt;ref name="McDaniel2004p11"/&gt;

===Vaishnava Bhakti===
The Bhakti yoga tradition has been historically most associated with Vaishnavism. The personal god here is Vishnu or one of his [[avatar]]s. In many regions, the loving devotion is either to Vishnu-Lakshmi (god-goddess) together, or through Lakshmi who is considered as the [[shakti]] of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabapathy Kulandran|title=Grace in Christianity and Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pujRGufjKBAC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2004|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-227-17236-0|pages=174–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

==== Chaitanya Mahaprabhu ====

In the Krishna-oriented traditions of Vaishnavism, the ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' by [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]] interprets the section 7.5.23-24 of ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' to teach nine types of ''bhakti'' sadhana, in the words of [[Prahlada]]. David Haberman translates them as follows:&lt;ref name="Halberman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haberman|first=David L.|title=Acting as a Way of Salvation|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=2001|pages=133–134|isbn=978-81-208-1794-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ua-E20uyH9IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) ''śravaṇa'' ("listening" to the scriptural stories of Krishna and his companions), (2) ''kīrtana'' ("praising"; usually refers to ecstatic group singing), (3) ''smaraṇa'' ("remembering" or fixing the mind on Vishnu), (4) ''pāda-sevana'' (rendering service), (5) ''arcana'' (worshiping an image), (6) ''vandana'' (paying homage), (7) ''dāsya'' (servitude), (8) ''sākhya'' (friendship), and (9) ''ātma-nivedana'' (complete surrender of the self).''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These nine principles of devotional service were incorporated by [[Rupa Goswami]] linked to [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] as integral to spiritual practice focussed on Krishna.&lt;ref name="Halberman"/&gt;

[[File:Aarti plate for a Sikh ceremony.jpg|thumb|A Sikh performing Bhakti]]

===Meher baba===
A movement led by [[Meher Baba]] states that "out of a number of practices which lead to the ultimate goal of humanity – God-Realisation – ''Bhakti Yoga'' is one of the most important. Almost the whole of humanity is concerned with ''Bhakti Yoga'', which, in simple words, means the art of worship. But it must be understood in all its true aspects, and not merely in a narrow and shallow sense, in which the term is commonly used and interpreted. The profound worship based on the high ideals of philosophy and spirituality, prompted by divine love, doubtless constitutes true ''Bhakti Yoga''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]]: ''The Path of Love'', Sheriar Press, 2000, pp. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Figdor received a bachelor's degree in political science from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Figdor|first=Carrie|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://myweb.uiowa.edu/cfigdor/cvweb.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to receive a master's degree and doctorate in philosophy from the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]] in 1997 and 2005, respectively.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Before beginning her career in philosophy, Figdor served as a local correspondent in [[Caracas]] for the [[Wall Street Journal]] between 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She also began to work for the [[Associated Press]] in 1986, where she served as a reporter and editor in various locations until 1997.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; While at the AP, she primarily reported on issues related to government, international relations, and society.&lt;ref name=lna&gt;{{cite web|title=Grouping of Carrie Figdor's work by category|publisher=LexisNexis Academic &amp; Library Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving her master's degree in philosophy, she accepted a position as an adjunct professor at the [[College of Staten Island]], and later a position as adjunct professor at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; After finishing her doctorate, she served as a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at [[Claremont McKenna College]] for two years, before accepting a permanent position as assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy and the Interdisciplinary Program in Cognitive Neuroscience at the [[University of Iowa]] in 2007, where she received tenure in 2013.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tns&gt;{{cite news|title=Promotion and Tenure 2013-14|newspaper=Targeted News Service|date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (She also served as a visiting assistant professor at [[Duke University]] for a term.)&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Outside of her university and journalistic work, Figdor is also a co-host of the [[New Books in Philosophy]] podcast,&lt;ref&gt;http://newbooksinphilosophy.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a member of the [[American Philosophical Association]], the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] (where she has served on the executive committee and co-chaired the Diversity Committee), the [[Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology]], and the [[Philosophy of Science Association]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas==
Figdor's research revolves around issues involving the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[philosophy of cognitive science]], and [[neuroethics]], with a secondary focus in [[media ethics]] and other issues related to journalism.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=obio/&gt;  Her current research focuses on mechanistic explanations for mind and metaphysics, as well as the practical implications of recent scientific findings for social relations.&lt;ref name=obio/&gt; Figdor has suggested that the existence of objective news is theoretically possible, but that contemporary journalistic practices prevent it from being realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehouse|first=G.|title=Book Review: Christopher Meyers (ed.)

Apart from her primary interests, Figdor has taken a quantitative approach to examining the gender gap in philosophy as a field, finding that the stage of education where the gap grew the most was between those taking introductory philosophy courses and those pursuing undergraduate degrees in philosophy, finding further that the size of this gap was reduced in schools with a high proportion of women philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name=hyp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paxton|first=Molly|author2=Figdor, Carrie |author3=Tiberius, Valerie |title=Quantifying the Gender Gap: An Empirical Study of the Underrepresentation of Women in Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1 November 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=949–957|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2012.01306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figdor's research has been recognized and disseminated through a series of invited talks at universities across the country. She, for instance, delivered a keynote speech at the 30th Boulder Conference on the History and Philosophy of Science in October 2014, a conference that addressed the historical and philosophical questions raised by cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;The Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Colorado Boulder; "30th Boulder Conference on the History and Philosophy of Science."http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/chps/conference.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Figdor also delivered a talk at Rice University in March 2014 on gender diversity in philosophy,.&lt;ref&gt;Figdor, Carrie; "Gender Diversity in Philosophy: Data, Initiatives, and Common Concerns." Delivered at the Rice Workshop on Diversity in Philosophy. March 21, 2014. https://sites.google.com/site/diversityinphilosophy/workshop-program&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these invited talks, Figdor also participated in a yearlong residency as a Scholar at the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh from fall 2013 until summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Philosophy of Science, University of Pittsburgh: "Visiting Fellows." http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/People/visiting_fellows/vf_2013-14/figdor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy''' was formulated by more than 200 [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] leaders at a conference convened by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reformation.net/articles-by-dr-j-grimstead/how-the-international-council-on-biblical-inerrancy-began&lt;/ref&gt; and held in [[Chicago]] in October 1978. The statement was designed to defend the position of [[biblical inerrancy]] against a perceived trend toward [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] conceptions of [[Bible|Scripture]].

The subsequent November 1982 '''Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics''' recognised the need to add a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] framework to the Statement.

Finally the December 1986 conference adopted the '''Chicago Statement on Biblical Application'''.

==Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy==
The Inerrancy Statement elaborates on various details in articles formed as couplets of "We affirm..." and "We deny...".  Under the statement, inerrancy applies only to the ''original manuscripts'' (which no longer exist, but which can be inferred on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or translations themselves. In the Statement, inerrancy does ''not'' refer to a blind [[Biblical literalism|literal]] interpretation, and that "history must be treated as history, poetry as poetry, hyperbole and metaphor as hyperbole and metaphor, generalization and approximation as what they are, and so forth." It also makes it clear that the signers deny "that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood."

Signatories to the statement came from a variety of evangelical [[Christian denomination]]s, and included [[Robert Preus]], [[James Montgomery Boice]], [[Kenneth Kantzer]], [[J. I. Packer]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[R. C. Sproul]] and [[John F. MacArthur]].

==Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics==
The Hermeneutics Statement recognised that "the values of a commitment [to inerrancy] are only as real as one's understanding of the meaning of Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alliancenet.org/the-chicago-statement-on-biblical-hermeneutics | title=The Chicago Statement On Biblical Hermeneutics | last=Packer | first=J.I. | authorlink=J.I. Packer | publisher=Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals | accessdate=31 Oct 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It particularly aimed to address "the meaning of the 'grammatico-historical exegesis' mentioned in Article XIII".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://defendinginerrancy.com/chicago-statements/ | title=The Chicago Statements | publisher=Defending Inerrancy | accessdate=31 Oct 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chicago Statement on Biblical Application==
The foci of the summit on Biblical Application were "the Trinitarian foundations that must give shape to all the church's life and witness, and then on a number of community concerns that come under the heading of Christian social ethics. These themes were chosen partly for their intrinsic importance and partly because there is need to dispel doubts as to whether Bible believers can ever agree on how to respond to them. ... [It] offers a high degree of consensus as to how a trusted Bible directs prayer, planning and  action  in  today's drifting society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sbcreformed.org/hp_wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Chicago-Statement-Inerrancy-Hermeneutics-Application.pdf | title=International Council on Biblical Inerrancy | publisher=South Baptist Church, New Hampshire | accessdate=3 Nov 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Leading inerrantists regard the Chicago Statement as a very thorough statement of what they mean by "inerrancy".{{cn |date=October 2018}}

The Statement has been compared to the [[Second Vatican Council]] Decree ''[[Dei verbum]]'' in addressing issues of the [[Historical criticism|historical critical method]] and affirming inerrancy.{{bywhom|date=October 2018}}

===Criticism within evanglicalism===
Old Testament theologian [[Peter Enns]], himself an evangelical scholar, highlights a significant weakness underlying the framing of the Statements: "Much of what burdens CSBI can be summed up as failing to reflect adequately on the nature of inspiration.  The irony is clear.   In their efforts  to protect biblical authority, the framers define inspiration in  a way that does not account well for how the Bible actually behaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/files/2014/08/Science-Faith-and-the-Chicago-Statement-on-Biblical-Inerrancy-Enns-Edited-no-watermark.pdf | title=Science, Faith and the Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy | last=Enns | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Enns | publisher=[[BioLogos]] | year=2014 | accessdate=3 Nov 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologian [[Roger Olson]] recognised the political elements of the statements: "In all such efforts, projects, there is a perceived 'enemy' to be excluded."&lt;ref name=olson&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2016/02/is-real-communication-as-perfect-meeting-of-minds-possible-some-radical-thoughts-about-words-like-inerrancy/ | title=Is Real Communication as Perfect "Meeting of Minds" Possible? Some Radical Thoughts about Words like "Inerrancy" | last=Olson | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Olson | date=17 Feb 2016 | accessdate=4 Nov 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adds: "When I look at the Chicago Statement on inerrancy and its signatories I believe it is more a political (in the broad sense) statement than a clear, precise, statement of perfect agreement among the signatories.  In other words, what was really going on there... was driven by a shared concern to establish and patrol 'evangelical boundaries'."&lt;ref name=woods&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.christiantoday.com/article/what-is-the-chicago-statement-on-biblical-inerrancy-and-should-evangelicals-believe-it/126747.htm | title=What is the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, and should evangelicals believe it? | last=Woods | first=Mark | date=2 March 2018 | publisher=[[Christianity Today]] | accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

===Sceptism of science===
The Hermeneutics statement was received negatively by scientists of Christian persuasion; it specifically came out against what it called "evolutionism":
* Article 19: "WE DENY that Scripture should be required to fit alien preunderstandings, inconsistent with itself, such as naturalism, evolutionism, scientism, secular humanism, and relativism."
* Article 22: "WE DENY that the teachings of Genesis 1-11 are mythical and that scientific hypotheses about earth history or the origin of humanity may be invoked to overthrow what Scripture teaches about creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/icbi.htm | title=Biblical Inerrancy and Science — Principles from The International Council on Biblical Inerrancy in The Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics | publisher=American Scientific Affiliation | accessdate=31 Oct 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biblical Application statement was also forthright in its denial of evolutionary thought: "Mainstream Protestantism ... provides a cautionary tale in this regard, for it has erred in a radical way by acquiring the habit of regularly relativizing biblical teaching to current secular fashion, whether rationalist, historicist, evolutionist, existentialist, Marxist, or whatever. But this is to forget how sin darkens and misdirects the human intellect..." and "for our secular society insists on judging itself, not by the revelation of the Creator that the Bible sets forth, but by evolutionary, permissive, materialistic, hedonistic, and this-worldly
yardsticks...".

The Statements' rejection of the scientific consensus about evolution has been strongly criticised by thinkers within the evangelical community itself, such as by [[John Oakes (apologist) | John Oakes]]: "the important Chicago Inerrancy statements simply miss the target when addressing the relationship between science and the bible.  ... [D]iscussions on science and the bible touch upon very important and profound theological issues, which require some amount of expounding, but none was given.  The statements supply a surprisingly large number of articles and other declarations that insist that all the bible is literal, historical truth, including Genesis.  Those articles, combined with [[Norman Geisler|Geisler]]'s commentary to those articles, reveal contradictions, inconsistencies, and a healthy dose of lazy theology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evidenceforchristianity.org/a-case-to-rewrite-the-chicago-statement-on-inerrancy/ | title=A Case to Rewrite the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy | author=John Oakes | authorlink=John Oakes (apologist) | date=12 September 2015 | publisher=Evidence for Christianity | accessdate=31 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Divya-drishti ''' ([[Hindi]]: दिव्य दृष्टि) or the divine eye-sight, also known as ''Yoga-drishti'', refers to 'divine perception' which is intuitive perception or cognition that carries with it an intrinsic certainty and conviction. It is a spiritual attainment which according to [[Patanjali]] enables the '' [[yogi]] '' to communicate with heavenly bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Textbook of Scientific Hindu Astrology|author=P.

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]:-

: न तु मां शक्यसे द्रष्टुमनेनैव स्वचक्षुषा |
: दिव्यं ददामि ते चक्षुः पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् || 

: " But surely you cannot see Me with these human eyes of yours; therefore; I vouchsafe to you the divine eye. With this you behold My divine power of Yoga. "  - ([[Bhagavad Gita]] XI.8)

Krishna invited Arjuna to observe the Cosmic Body or [[Viraj]]) and behold as concentrated within that body (in the person of Krishna) the entire creation and all that is desired to be seen. When Arjuna failed to see that divine form, Krishna bestowed the gift of divine vision – दिव्यं चक्षुः. Thus endowed, Arjuna saw an undisguised reality he could otherwise not see, what he then saw was अद्भुतदर्शनम् (many a wonderful sight) divine in essence, transcendent and all-effulgent, the sight which has never been seen before. Arjuna saw the power of creating diversity in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Devotion|author=GK Marballi|publisher=Lulu|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_LwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=divya-drishti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6rztVOf4AoHjuQTv9oHgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=divya-drishti&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar gift had been bestowed on [[Sanjaya]] by Sage [[Vyasa]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|pages=488-490|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Srimadbhagavadgita.html?id=NFWHMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Vedic|Vedic seers]] have spoken about the wondrous eyes of Lord [[Vishnu]], the ever-open watchful divine eyes whose power of sight is not restricted by space and time. Rishi Medhātithih Kānvah states that:-

: तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः |
: दिवीव चक्षुराततम् || - ([[Rig Veda]] I.xxii.20)

: " the learned practitioners of Dharma do, in the brightness of the (all-revealing) sun, (clearly) see the wide spread eyes of the Lord, the mighty all-surveying Sole Witness, and in the process with the aid of knowledge also see Him at all times ensconced as the atman. " &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda with commentary of Dayananda Saraswati|publisher=Arya Samaj, Jamnagar|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda/rugveda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, Bondy was active in a surrealistic group. From 1957 to 1961, he studied philosophy and psychology at [[Charles University]] in Prague.
From the 1960s he was one of the main figures of the Prague underground, writing texts for [[The Plastic People of the Universe]]. His non-conformism brought him into conflict with the totalitarian [[communist]] regime in [[Czechoslovakia]]. His works were circulated only as [[samizdat]].

Bondy was always interested in the study of [[Karl Marx]] and in the criticism of both contemporary [[capitalism]] and totalitarian [[socialism]]. His philosophical work concerns [[Ontology|ontological]] and related [[ethic]]al problems. He attempts to show the relevance of ontology without any substance or grounding.

Bondy's work is very distinctive. He was a close friend of [[Bohumil Hrabal]], another Prague writer, and is one of the most influential Czech intellectuals of the 20th century.

In the 1990s Bondy moved from [[Prague]] to [[Bratislava]], Slovakia.

The scope of his works is exceptionally broad: he published about thirty books of poetry, ranging from epic poems in early 1950s to meditative philosophical works in the 1980s. He also published about twenty novels, most of them dealing with the topic of a society or an individual in crisis, or a crisis in the relationship between an individual and his or her community. Despite the deep, existential background of his work, the texts are fresh and entertaining. He himself most valued his philosophical works. He published a history of philosophy. However, this work is criticized by authorities within the field for its subjective deformation of the topic [lacks citation].

Bondy is a name drawn from the great Czech writer [[Karel Čapek]] in his ''[[War with the Newts]]''. (However, it has nothing to do with Egon Bondy for Zbyněk Fišer started to use this Jewish pseudonym in 1949 when he prepared a surrealistic anthology. The authors of the texts in the anthology chose a Jewish pseudonym each.)

'''Endophora''' refers to the phenomenon of expressions that derive their reference from something within the surrounding text (endophors).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Grammatical Structure and its Interpretation: An Introduction to natural Language Semantics|last = Gillon|first = Brendan|publisher = MIT Press|year = in prep.|isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 4|url = http://webpages.mcgill.ca/staff/group3/bgillo/web/semantics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the sentences "I saw Sally yesterday. She was lying on the beach", "she" is an ''endophoric'' expression because it refers to something mentioned elsewhere in the text, i.e. "Sally".

By contrast, "She was lying on the beach," if it appeared by itself, contains an [[Exophora|''exophoric'']] expression; "she" refers to something that is not present in the surrounding text, so there is not enough information given within the text to independently determine to whom "she" refers. It can refer to someone the speaker assumes his audience has prior knowledge of, or it can refer to a person he is showing to his listeners. Without further information, in other words, there is no way of knowing the exact meaning of an exophoric term.

Endophora can be broken into three subcategories: [[cataphora]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] and [[self-reference]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2425">An '''ethical calculus''' is the application of [[mathematics]] to [[calculate]] issues in [[ethics]]. 

==Scope==
Generally, ethical calculus refers to any method of determining a course of action in a circumstance that is not explicitly evaluated in one's [[ethical code]].

A formal philosophy of ethical calculus is a development in the study of [[ethics]], combining elements of [[natural selection]], [[self-organizing systems]], [[emergence]], and [[algorithm]] theory. According to ethical calculus, the most ethical course of action in a situation is an absolute, but rather than being based on a static ethical code, the ethical code itself is a function of circumstances. The optimal ethic is the best possible course of action taken by an individual with the given limitations. 

While ethical calculus is, in some ways, similar to [[moral relativism]], the former finds its grounds in the circumstance while the latter depends on social and cultural context for moral judgment. Ethical calculus would most accurately be regarded as a form of dynamic [[moral absolutism]].

==Examples==
Francis Hutcheson devoted a section of his 1725 work ''Inquiry into the Original of our ideas and Beauty and Virtue'' to "an attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation in subjects of Morality". Formulas included:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YRurAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA173 Page 173] in: {{cite book|chapter=The Invention of the Ethical Calculus|title=Seventeenth Century Studies in the History of English Thought and Literature from Bacon to Pope|year=1951|author=R. F. Jones|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* M = B * A
where,
*M is the moral importance of any agent
*B is the [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] of the agent
*A is the ability of the agent

Another example is the [[felicific calculus]] formulated by [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] for calculating the degree or amount of [[pleasure]] that a specific action is likely to cause.  Bentham, an [[ethics|ethical]] [[hedonist]], believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced.  The felicific calculus could, in principle at least, determine the moral status of any considered act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">'''Ferdinando Cazzamalli''' (August 4, 1887 in [[Crema, Italy]] – 1958) was an Italian psychiatrist from [[Crema, Lombardy]] who was interested in [[paranormal]] phenomena.

==Biography==

Cazzamalli was the director of a psychiatric hospital in [[Como]], but later became a lecturer in psychiatry at the university of [[Modena]], which employed Cazzamalli for 20 years together with electrical engineer [[Eugenio Gnesutta]] to work with psychologically disturbed patients, where they also investigating physical accounts of [[telepathy]].

They created equipment to measure ultra-high-frequency waves to explain the phenomena of [[telepathy]] as [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] effects on the brain. Cazzamalli conducted experiments with a radio receiver enclosed in a [[Faraday cage]], and came to the conclusion that there were paranormal phenomena.

In 1937 Cazzamalli founded, together with [[Giovanni Schepis]], [[Emilio Servadio]], and [[Luigi Sanguineti]], the [[Italian Society of Metaphysics]] (SIM), the first group in Italy to study paranormal activity full-time. The Italian [[fascist]] state recognized this group in 1941. The group was later renamed in 1955 to the [[Italian Society of Parapsychology]]. In 1946 the society released its first magazine, called "Metaphysics". Due to political and methodological differences, Cazzamalli left the society in order to create his own group, the [[Italian Associated Scientists of Metaphysics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4583">'''E. Gabriele Taylor''' (born 11 October 1927) is a British philosopher and university teacher. She was fellow and tutor in philosophy at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] until her retirement in 1996. She notably taught the philosophers [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Constantine Sandis]], and the politicians [[Edwina Currie]] and [[Danny Alexander]]. Since then she has continued work as a senior research fellow of the college, pursuing her own particular interests in [[ethics]].

== Early life and education ==
Taylor was born in 1927 and grew up in Berlin. Her early education was disturbed by the war and at the conclusion of hostilities she and her family found themselves in the British sector of the occupied city. She worked for a while with the [[Red Cross]] but ultimately was able to travel to England in 1947 to join a relative already in the country. She then worked part-time whilst also studying and then was successful in gaining a place at St Anne’s in 1952 to read [[philosophy, politics and economics]] (PPE). She went on to study for the BPhil in philosophy, which she completed in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/profile?tx_oxford_pi1%5Bstaff%5D=302&amp;cHash=0b157028d1dd499a05dfcf5c2c231843&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==

On completing her BPhil, Taylor started her teaching career as a lecturer in philosophy at St Anne’s, working alongside [[Iris Murdoch]], who had been a fellow of the college since 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/supernumerary-emeritus-honorary-and-senior-research-fellows.html |accessdate=August 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710101401/http://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/about/people/supernumerary-emeritus-honorary-and-senior-research-fellows.html |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a spell in Australia teaching at [[Canberra University College]], on her return to England she rejoined the college as a lecturer in 1962 and became a fellow of the college in 1964. During her career as fellow and tutor she taught undergraduates reading most of the Honour Schools involving philosophy as well as supervising graduate students. In the [[Faculty of Philosophy, University of Oxford]], Taylor also examined and lectured  on moral philosophy, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[British Empiricists]] and gave revision classes on the history of philosophy.

== Academic interests ==
In her role as tutor for the PPE school, Taylor taught the general and moral philosophy courses and special papers for PPE final examinations, and also taught elementary [[formal logic]] to first year undergraduates. 

Her own research has focused on [[moral psychology]], with a particular interest in the ‘ordinary’ vices traditionally seen as death to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/s/Gabriele%20Taylor |title=Works by Gabriele Taylor |publisher=PhilPapers |date= |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her best-known works are probably ''Pride, Shame and Guilt'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198246206.do?keyword=gabriele+taylor&amp;sortby=bestMatches |title=Pride, Shame, and Guilt: Gabriele Taylor - Oxford University Press |publisher=Ukcatalogue.oup.com |date=1985-10-24 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deadly Vices'' ([[Clarendon Press]] 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198235804.do?keyword=deadly+vices&amp;sortby=bestMatches |title=Deadly Vices: Hardback: Gabriele Taylor - Oxford University Press |publisher=Ukcatalogue.oup.com |date=2006-06-08 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examine the beliefs involved in the experience of these emotions. [[Tom Hurka]] described ''Deadly Vices'' as 'deeply illuminating ... she takes the neo-Aristotelian view of virtue further than any other writer I know'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25260/?id=9226 |title=Deadly Vices // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The '''Geometry of Interaction''' (GoI) was introduced by [[Jean-Yves Girard]] shortly after his work on [[linear logic]]. In linear logic, proofs can be seen as various kinds of networks as opposed to the flat tree structures of [[sequent calculus]]. To distinguish the real [[proof net]]s from all the possible networks, Girard devised a criterium involving trips in the network. Trips can in fact be seen as some kind of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} acting on the proof. Drawing from this observation, Girard described directly this operator from the proof and has given a formula, the so-called ''execution formula'', encoding the process of [[cut elimination]] at the level of operators.

One of the first significant applications of GoI was a better analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Gonthier | first1 = G. | last2 = Abadi | first2 = M. N. | last3 = Lévy | first3 = J.

[[File:Charles_Vance_Millar.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Vance Millar]], whose will sparked the Great Stork Derby]]
The '''Great Stork Derby''' was a contest held from 1926 to 1936, in which women residing in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, competed to produce the most babies in order to qualify for an unusual bequest in a will.&lt;ref name=fte2015121&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldenberg|first1=David|title=How A Dead Millionaire Convinced Dozens of Women To Have As Many Babies As Possible|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-a-dead-millionaire-convinced-dozens-of-women-to-have-as-many-babies-as-possible/|publisher=FiveThirtyEight Science|accessdate=January 12, 2016|date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of many unusual bequests listed in the will, along with giving a vacation home in Jamaica to a group of three men who detested each other under the condition that [[Concurrent estate#Joint tenancy|they live in the estate together indefinitely]], brewery stocks to a group of prominent [[Teetotalism|teetotal]] Protestant ministers if they participated in its operations and collected its dividends, and jockey club stocks to a group of anti-horse-racing advocates.

The race was the product of a scheme by [[Charles Vance Millar]] (1853–1926), a Toronto lawyer, financier, and practical joker, who bequeathed the residue of his significant estate to the woman in Toronto who could produce the most children in the decade following his death.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;Orkin, Mark M.

The Canadian 2002 TV movie ''The Stork Derby'', depicted the stories of Lillian Kenny, Pauline Mae Clarke and Grace Bagnato and starred [[Megan Follows]]. The film was based upon [[Elizabeth Wilton]]'s book ''Bearing The Burden: The Great Toronto Stork Derby 1926–1938''.

In 2016, Toronto's Muddy York Brewing Company produced a ''Stork Derby [[Stout]]'' as a nod to the unusual event.

[[Prayer]] has been an essential part of [[Christianity]] since [[Early Christianity|its earliest days]]. As the [[Middle Ages]] began, the monastic traditions of both [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] moved beyond vocal prayer to [[Christian meditation]]. These progressions resulted in two distinct and different meditative practices: [[Lectio Divina]] in the West and [[hesychasm]] in the East. Hesychasm involves the repetition of the [[Jesus Prayer]], but Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reading with God: Lectio Divina'' by David Foster 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-6084-4}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by [[Guigo II]], a [[Carthusian]] monk who died late in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Egan38 &gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3660-5}} pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Guigo II's book ''The Ladder of Monks'' is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} pages 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Eastern Christianity]], the monastic traditions of "constant prayer" that traced back to the Desert Fathers and [[Evagrius Pontikos]] established the practice of [[hesychasm]] and influenced [[John Climacus]]' book [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]] by the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Orthodox Church: Its Past and Its Role in the World Today'' by John Meyendorff 1981 {{ISBN|0-913836-81-8}} page &lt;/ref&gt; These meditative prayers were promoted and supported by Saint [[Gregory Palamas]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238" /&gt;

From the 18th century some components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=ReadLive &gt;''Reading to live: the evolving practice of Lectio divina'' by Raymond Studzinski 2010 {{ISBN|0-87907-231-8}} pages 188-195&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival and books and articles on approaches such as [[Lectio divina]] aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.&lt;ref name=ReadLive /&gt; In 1965 one of the principal documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the dogmatic constitution ''[[Dei verbum]]'' (Latin for ''Word of God'') emphasized the use of [[Lectio divina]] and on the 40th anniversary of ''Dei verbum'' in 2005 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] reaffirmed its importance.&lt;ref name=spring &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050916_40-dei-verbum_en.html Vatican website ''Address at the 40th anniversary of DEI VERBUM, Friday, 16 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Christianity==
The history and origins of Christian meditation have been intertwined with that of [[monastic life]], both in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]] and the [[Western Christianity|West]]. By the 4th century, groups of Christians, who came to be called the [[Desert Fathers]], had sought God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt, and began to become an early model of monastic Christian life.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=global31 &gt;''Globalization of Hesychasm and the Jesus Prayer: Contesting Contemplation'' by Christopher D. L. Johnson 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4411-2547-7}} pages 31-38&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of a Christian life of "constant prayer" in a monastic setting began in this period.&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt; I

In the 5th century, [[John Cassian]] described their life as prayerful and shaped by contemplation of God and [[Evagrius Ponticus]] wrote extensively on pure prayer and the [[Sayings of the Desert Fathers]] appeared thereafter.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt; The "prayer of fire" that emerged in this period, was said to have been driven by the love for God, which was to shape a life of meditation and contemplation in the East. However, these "desert meditations" are not equivalent to the modern methods of reflection and meditation. The desert monks gathered to hear scripture recited in public, and would then recite those words privately in their cells. For them meditation was a memorization and recitation of scripture, primarily as a verbal exercise.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 &gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3660-5}} page 88-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;

==Early Middle Ages==
By the end of the 4th century, [[Martin of Tours]] had introduced monasticism to the West and the western monastic traditions began to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Civilization: Beyond Boundaries'' by Thomas Noble 2008 {{ISBN|0-618-83423-0}} page 193&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century, the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] included three elements: public prayer, manual labor and lectio divina.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McGinn415 &gt;''Christian Spirituality: Origins to the twelfth century, Vol 1'' by Bernard McGinn 1986 {{ISBN|0-7102-0927-4}} pages 415-424&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the  Christian monastic tradition included the development of an austere and secluded lifestyle and practices that were intended to help meditation by freeing the mind from worldly matters, e.g. in his Rule for [[monastic life]], [[Gregory the Great]] developed 12 steps towards [[asceticism]] based on [[abstinence]] and [[mortification of the flesh]] and search for [[humility]].&lt;ref name=Clowney12 &gt;''Christian Meditation'' by Edmund P. Clowney, 1979 {{ISBN|1-57383-227-8}} pages 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid worldly contamination by seculars (i.e. not monks or clergy) the Rule of [[Saint Benedict]] forbade a monk from eating with them unless the monk was so far away that he could not return to the monastery that day.&lt;ref&gt;''Benedict's Rule: a translation and commentary'' by Terrence Kardong, Saint Benedict 1996 page 414&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Lectio_Divina.svg|thumb|180px|left|The four movements of [[Lectio divina]]: ''read'', ''meditate'', ''pray'', ''contemplate''.]]
The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] (chapter #48) stipulated specific times and manners for ''[[Lectio Divina]]'' - a meditative reading of Scripture.&lt;ref name=Egan38 &gt;''Christian spirituality: themes from the tradition'' by Lawrence S. Cunningham, Keith J. Egan 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-3660-5}} pages 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its specific blending of spirituality with moderation and balance, the Benedictine Rule became widely used by the 10th century, and  became the de facto standard for Western monastic life in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;''The world of the early Christians'' by Joseph Francis Kelly 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-8146-5313-5}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 10th century, during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the traditions of the Desert Fathers led to a style of life and prayer in the [[Eastern Church]] called [[hesychasm]], developed particularly on [[Mount Athos]] in Greece. St. [[Gregory of Sinai]] is generally considered by most to be the founder of the hesychastic approach to prayer in early 14th century.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt; Although controversies appeared thereafter between [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlam]] and St. [[Gregory Palamas]], hesychasm was eventually well established within Eastern Christianity, but never made significant inroads in the West.&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Byzantine Empire' page 238"&gt;''The Byzantine Empire'' by Robert Browning 1992 {{ISBN|0-8132-0754-1}} page 238&lt;/ref&gt; While hesychasm involves the repetition of the [[Jesus Prayer]], Lectio Divina uses different Scripture passages at different times and although a passage may be repeated a few times, Lectio Divina is not repetitive in nature.&lt;ref name=global31 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reading with God: Lectio Divina'' by David Foster 2006 {{ISBN|0-8264-6084-4}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of prayer had undergone very little change in the West from its origins until the 11th century, at which point a major change took place via the introduction of methods of meditation. Monasticism played a key role in bringing about this change, first to establish basic concepts about the forms of prayer, then introduce meditation and finally to emphasize that monastic prayer is inseparable from a specific "way of life".&lt;ref name=McGinn415 /&gt; 

From the end of the 11th century two specific genres of literature for prayer appeared. The first was extensions of Augustinan forms of addressing God or oneself (e.g. [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|his confessions]] or [[Soliloquies of Augustine|the Soliloquies]]). The "Meditations of St. Augustine" became a popular reading item. Saint Anselm composed "Meditations and Prayers" along similar lines, but it included no methodical elements and was simply a collection of material for [[Lectio Divina]] and the duration of the exercise was not specified.&lt;ref name=McGinn415 /&gt; The second genre an example of which was [[Hugh of Saint Victor]], tried to put more structure into meditation that was then available within the monastic tradition.&lt;ref name=McGinn415 /&gt; Hugh wrote that there are three visions of the soul: "thinking, meditation and contemplation". Hugh aimed his meditations as a way towards contemplation of God."&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt; The approach was further developed by [[Guigo II]] whose "Ladder of Monks" is considered a key text in the field. This second genre lead to methodical prayer, and approaches in which the imagination holds a strong place.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McGinn415 /&gt; 

Guigi II (the 9th [[Carthusian]] prior) went beyond the meditations of [[Guigo I]] (the 5th prior).&lt;ref&gt;''The Meditations of Guigo I, Prior of the Charterhouse'' (Cistercian Studies Series ; No. 155) 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-87907-655-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Guigo II, reading scripture is an "encounter with the word of God", meditation is "seeking the hidden meaning of this word", prayer is "turning one's heart to God" and contemplation is when "the mind is lifted up to God and held above itself".&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;  Guigo II's Ladder of the Monks may well be the first description of the "methodical prayer" in the mystical traditions of the west.&lt;ref name=Egan207 &gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan 1991 {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}} page 207&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 11th century Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]] was producing meditative prayers, which however, still focused towards the monsatic traditions of [[Lectio Divina]].&lt;ref name=Battle67 &gt;''Blessed are the peacemakers: a Christian spirituality of nonviolence'' by Michael Battle 2004 {{ISBN|0-86554-871-4}} pages 67-71&lt;/ref&gt; Anselm began his [[Proslogion]] by calling it a "short work on an example meditation on the meaning of faith", and the meditations in the Proslogion are intended to lead the reader to a contemplation of God.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt; Anselm's teachings, which greatly influenced the monastic meditation traditions of the Middle Ages were that meditation can lead to "seeing the face of God in contemplation".&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;

==Latter part of Middle Ages==
[[File:JohnCross.jpg|thumb|180px|St. [[John of the Cross]] taught the 4 stages of [[Lectio Divina]] as: "Seek in ''reading'' and you will find in ''meditation''; knock in ''prayer'' and it will be opened to you in ''contemplation''".&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;]]
Late in the 14th century [[Gerard of Zutphen]] had built on "Guigo's Ladder" to write his major work ''On Spiritual Ascents''.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 &gt;''Christian spirituality: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-631-21281-2}} pages 84-87&lt;/ref&gt; Zutphen warned against considered meditation without reading of scripture, and taught that the reading prepares the mind, so meditation will fall into error. Similarly, he taught that meditation prepares the mind for contemplation.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt; Zutphen's definition of meditation is generally considered the synthesis of medieval consensus on the topic of meditation:
:Meditation is the process in which you deligently turn over in your heart whatever you have read or heard, earnestly reflecting upon it to enkindle your affection or enlighten your understanding.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt;

By the 14th century, the practice of meditation in the West had become more systematic as the arrival of ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' in Germany and the Netherlands introduced more structure into it through the writings of [[Geert Groote]], [[Gerard of Zutphen]] and [[Jan Mombaer]]. By this time, the tradition of "methodical prayer" which arranged exercises day by day and week by week found significant following within the Catholic Church, as well as later Reformed communities.&lt;ref name=Battle67 /&gt; In the 15th century, Ignatius of Loyola developed the technique in which the meditator enters the Biblical scene, e.g. begins a conversation with Jesus on the Cross in Calvary.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt; A similar idea had been developed by [[Ludolph of Saxony]] in his ''Vita Christi'' in 1374 in which the reader would make themselves present in the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt; 

During the 15th century, reforms of the clergy and monastic settings were undertaken by the two Venetians, [[Lorenzo Giustiniani]] and [[Louis Barbo]]. Both men considered methodical prayer and meditation as essential tools for the reforms they were undertaking.&lt;ref name=Hay76 &gt;''The church in Italy in the fifteenth century'' by Denys Hay 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-52191-2}} page 76&lt;/ref&gt; Barbo, who died in 1443, wrote a treatise on prayer titled ''Forma orationis et meditionis'' otherwise known as ''Modus meditandi''. He described three types of prayer; vocal prayer, best suited for beginners; meditation, oriented towards those who are more advanced; and contemplation as the highest form of prayer, only obtainable after the meditation stage. Based on the request of Pope [[Eugene IV]], Barbo introduced these methods to [[Valladolid]], Spain and by the end of the 15th century they were being used at the [[abbey of Montserrat]]. These methods then influenced [[Garcias de Cisneros]], who in turn influenced [[Ignatius of Loyola]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christian spirituality in the Catholic tradition'' by Jordan Aumann 1985 Ignatius Press {{ISBN|0-89870-068-X}} page 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14224b.htm Catholic encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods of "methodical prayer" as taught by the ''devotio moderna'' groups had entered Spain and were known in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name=Elena28 &gt;''Teresa of Avila's autobiography'' by Elena Carrera 2004 {{ISBN|1-900755-96-3}} page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was known in Spain as ''Contemptus mundi'' became known in Spain, and while Teresa probably did not initially know of Guigo II's methods she was likely influenced by its teachings via the works of [[Francisco de Osuna]] which she studied.&lt;ref name=Elena28 /&gt; Teresa's contemporary and collaborator, [[John of the Cross]] continued the tradition of Guigo II and taught the 4 stages of Lectio Divina.&lt;ref name=Cunningham88 /&gt;

==18th–20th centuries==
{{Christian Mysticism}}
From the 18th to the end of the 19th century the non-discursive components of meditation began to be de-emphasized in some branches of Western Christianity. By the middle of 19th century, the [[Historical criticism|historical critical]] approach to biblical analysis which had started over a century earlier, and focused on determining the historicity of gospel episodes, had taken away some of the emphasis on biblical meditation outside monastic communities.&lt;ref name=ReadLive &gt;''Reading to live: the evolving practice of Lectio divina'' by Raymond Studzinski 2010 {{ISBN|0-87907-231-8}} pages 188-195&lt;/ref&gt; However, in parallel, by the 19th century the importance of Biblical meditation had been firmly established in the [[Protestant]] spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name=McGrath84 /&gt;

The non-discursive components or stages of meditative practice, which are often called "contemplation" in Western traditions, were beneficiaries of "a positive attitude toward contemplation [that] characterized the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era."&lt;ref name=keatinghistory97&gt;"The History of Contemplative Prayer in the Christian Tradition" chapter 3 (pp. 19-31) in {{cite book

 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}} But "a negative attitude has prevailed from the sixteenth century onward,"&lt;ref name=keatinghistory97/&gt;{{rp|19}} according to [[Thomas Keating]], a [[Trappist]] monk and a primary modern expositor of the Christian meditative method of [[Centering Prayer]].
Keating attributes the emergence of a negative attitude towards contemplation to several factors, including  the 17th century controversy over [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]&lt;ref name=keatinghistory97/&gt;{{rp|23}} and an increasing tendency to distinguish between "discursive meditation if thoughts predominated; affective prayer if the emphasis was on acts of the will; and contemplation if graces infused by God were predominant.... This division of the development of prayer into compartmentalized units entirely separate from one another helped to further the... notion that contemplation was an extraordinary grace reserved to the few."&lt;ref name=keatinghistory97/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Keating states that the ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola]]'' are "extremely important in order to understand the present state of spirituality in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]," but that there has been a "tendency to reduce the ''Spiritual Exercises'' to a method of discursive meditation."&lt;ref name=keatinghistory97/&gt; 
 
The early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival in the practice, and books and articles on approaches such as [[Lectio divina]] aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.&lt;ref name=ReadLive /&gt; In 1965 one of the principal documents of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the dogmatic constitution ''[[Dei verbum]]'' (Latin for ''Word of God'') emphasized the use of Lectio divina. On the 40th anniversary of ''Dei verbum'' in 2005 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] reaffirmed its importance and stated:&lt;ref name=spring &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050916_40-dei-verbum_en.html Vatican website ''Address at the 40th anniversary of DEI VERBUM, Friday, 16 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century has also witnessed a new focus on Biblical meditation. These may be defined as: "the devotional practice of pondering the words of a verse or verses of Scripture with a receptive heart."&lt;ref name=McAlpine &gt;''Explaining Biblical Meditation'' by Campbell McAlpine, Joyce Huggett 2004 {{ISBN|1-85240-385-3}} pages 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Biblical meditations may be designed to relate and connect the Biblical message to the modern world.&lt;ref name=BLent /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gariepy &gt;''Daily Meditations on Golden Texts of the Bible'' by Henry Gariepy 2004 {{ISBN|0-8028-2755-1}} pages xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Such Biblical meditations may correspond to specific seasons such as [[Lent]] with the meditation topic selected to interact with  two or three readings of the Bible during weekdays or Sundays of Lent.&lt;ref name=BLent &gt;''Biblical meditations for Lent'' by Carroll Stuhlmueller 1977 {{ISBN|0-8091-2089-5}} pages ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; The meditation sequence may begin by a summary of the Bible reading, then suggest specific ideas for meditation, then conclude with an appropriate prayer.&lt;ref name=BLent /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gariepy /&gt; Such meditations may also be designed not just for "strong seasons" such as Lent or Easter, but also for [[Ordinary Time]].&lt;ref&gt;''Biblical Meditations for Ordinary Time, weeks 23-34'' by Carroll Stuhlmueller 1984 {{ISBN|978-0-8091-2648-4}} pages 1-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century methods of Christian meditations have been taught using relatively new devotions such as the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion.&lt;ref&gt;''Scriptural Meditations: For the Divine Mercy Chaplet, Franciscan Crown'' by Lucas J. Amato 2009 {{ISBN|0-87946-388-0}} pages 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrid growth disorders may be referred to as a '''growth dysplasia''', especially when resulting in overgrowth, although this terminology may be confusing since the term [[dysplasia]] is commonly used to imply an impending cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706780870|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary.|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|others=Dorland, W. A. Newman (William Alexander Newman), 1864-1956.|isbn=9781416062578|edition=32nd|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=706780870}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a hybrid growth disorder is not caused by cancer.

Hybrid growth disorders are exhibited among a variety organisms, including [[liger]]s, [[tigon]]s, hybrid mice, and hybrid [[dwarf hamster]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/532895|title=Mammalian hybrids: a check-list with bibliography,|last=P.|first=Gray, Annie|date=1972|publisher=Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux|isbn=0851981704|edition=2d [rev.]|location=Slough,|oclc=532895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul B. Vrana|display-authors=etal|year=2000|title=Genetic and epigenetic incompatibilities underlie hybrid dysgenesis in Peromyscus|journal=Nature Genetics|volume=25|issue=1|pages=120–124|doi=10.1038/75518|pmid=10802670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on hybrid mice which investigated the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders reveals [[Imprinting (genetics)|genomic imprinting]] to have a major effect.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Paternal imprinting may increase growth to maximize maternal resources allocated to his progeny, while maternal imprinting may suppress growth in favor of ensuring her own survival and equal allocation of resources between offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/imprinting/|title=Genomic Imprinting|website=learn.genetics.utah.edu|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the extent of a disorder depends on the combination of parental species and their respective sexes, as demonstrated by the Vrana study.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The study concludes that hybrid growth disorders most commonly affect the [[Heterozygote|heterozygous]] sex, as expected by [[Haldane's rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haldane|first1=J.B.S.|title=Sex ratio and unisexual sterility in hybrid animals|journal=Journal of Genetics|date=October 1922|volume=12|issue=2|pages=101–109|doi=10.1007/BF02983075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delph|first1=Lynda F.|last2=Demuth|first2=Jeffery P.|title=Haldane's Rule: Genetic Bases and Their Empirical Support|journal=Journal of Heredity|date=September 2016|volume=107|issue=5|pages=383–391|doi=10.1093/jhered/esw026}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also explain why hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other.

Similarly, a study of hybrids between dwarf hamster species [[Campbell's dwarf hamster|''Phodopus campbelli'']] and [[Djungarian hamster|''Phodopus sungorus'']] suggests that gene imprinting causes abnormal interactions between growth-promoting and growth-repressing genes which regulate placental and embryonic growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12575">This '''Index of ethics articles''' puts articles relevant to well-known ethical (right and wrong, good and bad) debates and decisions in one place - including practical problems long known in [[philosophy]], and the more abstract subjects in [[law]], [[politics]], and some [[profession]]s and [[science]]s. It lists also those core concepts essential to understanding ethics as applied in various [[religion]]s, some movements derived from religions, and religions discussed as if they were a theory of ethics making no special claim to [[divinity|divine]] status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">'''Orlov, Ivan Efimovich''' (October 1 (old style) 1886 Galich, Kostroma district [[Russia]] – 1936) was a [[philosopher]], a forerunner of [[relevant logic|relevant]] and other [[substructural logic]]s, and an industrial chemist. The date of his death is unknown but is believed to have occurred no earlier than 1936.

==Education and Scientific Career==
Orlov studied at the Natural Sciences Faculty of [[Moscow University]]. His academic career began in 1916, when he published several papers related to the method of [[inductive reasoning]] and the notion of [[inductive proof]]. For 7 years beginning 1916, he published no scientific work, presumably because of the political turmoil of the era. In the 1920s, he taught in the newly established [[Communist Academy]], and was an officer at the Chemical Institute.

In 1923 Orlov resumed his academic activity, becoming very productive. Most of his papers were published in leading Soviet ideological journals, where he waxed polemical in the manner typical of that place and time. Orlov's work bore on the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[logic]], specifically on the so-called [[dialectical logic]], [[Marxist]] in nature. He wrote on the [[theory of probability]], [[psychology]], [[theory of music]], and on [[chemical engineering]].

==Logic==
Analyzing the development of the natural sciences, he sought to uncover their specific "logic." According to Orlov, the laws of thought should be treated as formal rules, bounded by the laws of [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] and [[contradiction]]. (When Orlov wrote this, the invention of [[natural deduction]], the [[sequent calculus]], and the [[semantic tableau]]x all lay in the future.) We must seek the [[semantic]] relation between [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[consequent]]. The main "contradiction of logic" manifests itself in the linkage of premise and corollary, and requires a logic different from the traditional one. If we insist that a corollary be a necessary condition of the premises then, according to Orlov, we necessarily arrive at a [[non-Aristotelian logic]], [[dialectical]] in nature.

===The Logic of Compatibility Propositions===
Orlov proposed a logic of just this type in his work "The Logic of Compatibility of Propositions" published in 1928 in a Soviet mathematical journal. This paper analysed the problem of compatibility (noncompatibility) of propositions through the interpretative prism of an [[logical consequence|implication]] procedure. He also foresaw the translation of systems with intuitionistic [[intuitionistic logic|negation]] into [[S4 (modal logic)|S4]] [[modal logic]] with classical [[negation]].

Orlov's work was very little known for a long time, because his publications, all in Russian, were almost totally unknown outside of the [[Soviet Union]]. It is only with the post-World War II rise of what have come to be known as [[substructural logic]]s (Restall 2000) that Orlov's pioneering role has gradually emerged. [[Substructural logic]]s, a category including [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]], relevant, [[linear logic]]s, etc., can be obtained by restricting the [[natural deduction]] ("structural") rules for [[classical logic]]. For example, [[relevant logic]] does not employ the structural rule of weakening (also called the rule of [[monotonicity]]), and this rule is unlike the other structural rules (Dosen).

Orlov believed in a mechanistic reduction of the laws of nature. He castigated the [[set theory]] of [[Georg Cantor]], the [[theory of relativity]] (he believed in the existence of [[luminiferous aether|aether]]), and the [[heliobiology]] of A. Chizhevsky.

==Industrial Chemistry==
Around 1928, Orlov ceased publishing logical and philosophical work, turning to industrial [[chemistry]], specifically the production of [[bromine]] and [[iodine]], and in translating German works on chemistry into Russian.

==Education==
Lackey graduated from [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College]] in 1994 with a B.A. in philosophy and from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1995 with an M.A. in philosophy. In 2000, she graduated from [[Brown University]] with a Ph.D. in philosophy under the supervision of [[Ernest Sosa]].

==Research areas==
Lackey’s primary research interests lie in [[social epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=epistemology-social |title=Social Epistemology |author= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known for arguing against the traditional view of testimony, according to which testimony is a merely transmissive, rather than a generative, epistemic source. On this view, hearers can acquire [[knowledge]] on the basis of testimony only if the speakers themselves possess the knowledge in question and thus testimony transmits knowledge from one person to another without being able to generate knowledge in its own right. In ''Learning from Words: Testimony as a Source of Knowledge'', Lackey uses her widely discussed [[Creationism|creationist]] teacher case &lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/rec/CAROTA-5 J. Adam Carter &amp; Philip J. Nickel, On Testimony and Transmission - PhilPapers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~peterg/Peter%20Graham%20Can%20Testimony%20Generate%20Knowledge.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that the standard view is false and that testimony can in fact be generative. In this case, a creationist teacher rejects all of the [[empirical evidence|evidence]] supporting [[evolutionary theory]] and thus fails to either believe or know that modern day [[Homo sapiens]] evolved from [[Homo erectus]], but nevertheless reliably conveys this fact about Homo sapiens to her students. This shows that the teacher imparts knowledge to her students that she fails to possess herself. Lackey then advances a theory of the epistemology of testimony that focuses on the linguistic or communicative items in testimonial exchanges, such as statements and other acts of communication, rather than the internal states of speakers, such as states of knowing and believing.

In other work, Lackey argues that [[reason]]ableness, rather than knowledge, is the norm of assertion,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cVM1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=john+turri+you+gotta+believe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y04D79Zr-A&amp;sig=jNaTktV9OgMTiC9nWo9XzI_UAiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ru1PU7nrJ8K0yAGR4YHYDQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20turri%20you%20gotta%20believe&amp;f=false Epistemic Norms: New Essays on Action, Belief, and Assertion - Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; that memory is a generative epistemic source,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2007.00009.x/full Preserving Preservationism: A Reply to Lackey - SENOR - 2007 - Philosophy and Phenomenological Research - Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PhilPapers|rec|NAYJAF|Andrew Naylor, Justification and Forgetting - PhilPapers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that lying requires deception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3819041/Lies_and_Deception_A_Failed_Reconciliation Lies and Deception: A Failed Reconciliation | Fernando Broncano-Berrocal - Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lackey is also known for arguing against the claim central to virtue epistemology that knowledge should be understood in terms of the knower’s deserving credit for the truth of her belief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-008-9342-6#page-1 Two problems of easy credit - Springer]&lt;/ref&gt; Lackey argues that the virtue epistemologist faces a dilemma: either the standards for deserving credit for a true belief are relatively high, or they are relatively low. If they are relatively high, then the virtue epistemologist cannot account for instances of knowledge from testimony, where the credit for the hearer’s true belief goes to the speaker. On the other hand, if the standards are relatively low, then the virtue epistemologist cannot distinguish between cases of genuine knowledge and [[Gettier problem|Gettier cases]] where a person has a [[justified true belief]] by accident.

==Awards and fellowships==
Lackey has received a number of awards, including a Charles A. Ryskamp Research Fellowship from the [[American Council of Learned Societies]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acls.org/research/fellow.aspx?cid=9eae748d-b016-dc11-9d54-000c2903e717 Jennifer Lackey F'07]&lt;/ref&gt; the Young Epistemologist Prize,&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/for-faculty/237-program-2005 Program 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and an Alice Kaplan Institute for the Humanities Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.northwestern.edu/people/fellows.html Fellows - People - Kaplan Institute for the Humanities | Northwestern University]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann J Engel.jpg|thumb|right|Johann Jakob Engel, portrait by Chodowiecki]]
'''Johann Jakob Engel''' (11 September 1741 – 28 June 1802) was a German author.

== Life ==

Engel was born and died in [[Parchim]], in the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. He studied theology at [[university of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[Bützow]],&lt;ref&gt;See entries of [http://matrikel.uni-rostock.de/gnd/11868468X Johann Jakob Engel] in [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy at [[university of Leipzig|Leipzig]], where he took his doctors' degree. In 1776 he was appointed professor of [[moral philosophy]] and belles-lettres in the Joachimstal gymnasium at [[Berlin]], and a few years later he became tutor to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards [[Frederick William III|Frederick William&amp;nbsp;III]].&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Engel, Johann Jakob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lessons which he gave his royal pupil in ethics and politics were published in 1798 under the title ''Fürstenspiegel'' ("Mirror for Princes"), and are a favourable specimen of his powers as a popular philosophical writer. In 1787 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in the same year he became director of the royal theatre, an office he resigned in 1794.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

== Works ==
[[File:Houghton Typ 720.85.363 - fig 19.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''Ideen zu einer Mimik'', 1785]]
Besides numerous dramas, some of which had a considerable success, Engel wrote several valuable books on aesthetic subjects. His ''Anfangsgründe einer Theorie der Dichtungsarten'' ("Initial foundations for a theory of poetry types," 1783) showed fine taste and acute critical faculty if it lacked imagination and poetic insight. The same excellences and the same defects were apparent in his ''Ideen zu einer Mimik'' (1785), written in the form of letters.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;
It demonstrated a knowledge of human nature, and may be regarded as a kind of manual for actors.&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Engel, Johann Jakob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most popular work was ''Der Philosoph für die Welt'' (1775), which consists chiefly of dialogues on men and morals, written from the [[utilitarian]] standpoint of the philosophy of the day. His last work, a romance entitled ''Herr Lorenz Stark'' (1795), achieved a great success, by virtue of the marked individuality of its characters and its appeal to middle-class sentiment.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

He wanted to make the German theatre the mirror of the national life, and he wrote several plays, but they were of little merit — ''Der dankbare Sohn'' and ''Edelknaben'' are examples.&lt;ref name=ea/&gt;

Engel's ''Sämtliche Schriften'' (''complete writings'') were published in twelve volumes at Berlin in 1801–1806; a new edition appeared at Frankfort in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;K Schröder, ''Johann Jakob Engel'' (speech, 1897)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Katsu''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: [[wiktionary:喝|喝]]; [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]: ''{{Audio|Hot3.ogg|hot3}}'', [[Pinyin]]: ''hè'', [[Wade-Giles]]: ''ho'') is a shout that is described in [[Chán]] and [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] encounter-stories, to expose the [[Bodhi|enlightened state]] (Japanese: ''[[satori]]'') of the Zen-master, and/or to induce [[Kensho|initial enlightenment experience]] in a student.{{sfn|Lievens|1981}}{{sfn|Schloegel|1979}} The shout is also sometimes used in the [[Martial arts#Martial arts in Asia|East Asian martial arts]] for a variety of purposes; in this context, ''katsu'' is very similar to the shout ''[[kiai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Clubs/Karate/generalterminology.php#K Dublin University Shotokan Karate Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] means literally "to yell"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; or "to shout".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgibin.erols.com/mandarintools/cgi-bin/charlook.pl?searchmode=standard&amp;printtype=utf8&amp;chartype=trad&amp;ordering=frequency&amp;display=char&amp;display=radstroke&amp;display=strokes&amp;display=pinyin&amp;display=english&amp;display=cantonese&amp;display=variants&amp;display=unicode&amp;display=gb&amp;display=big5&amp;enctype=big5&amp;whatchar=%B3%DCBD&amp;searchchar=Search+by+Character&amp;lowerb=&amp;upperb= Character Search Results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In Japanese it has also developed the meaning of "[[wiktionary:browbeat|to browbeat]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saiga-jp.com/cgi-bin/dic.cgi?m=search&amp;sc=0&amp;f=0&amp;j=%E5%96%9D&amp;g=&amp;e=&amp;s=&amp;rt=0&amp;start=1&amp;sid=1161114881_32668 Japanese Kanji Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "to scold", and "hoarse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.j-talk.com/nihongo/search/kanjisearch.php?skanji=%E5%96%9D Kanji Search - Search %E5%96%9D results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the context of Chan and Zen practice, the word is not generally used in its literal meaning(s), but rather—much as with the martial arts shout of ''kiai''—as fundamentally a means of focusing [[Qi|energy]]. When the Chan and Zen practice of the ''katsu'' first emerged in [[Jiangxi]] province in the south of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang dynasty China]] in the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]], the word was pronounced roughly as /xat/,&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wbaxter/pdf/d041-060.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a pronunciation that is largely preserved&lt;ref&gt;Watson xiv&lt;/ref&gt; in the Japanese ''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'' ("[[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]]") reading of the character as {{IPA-ja|katsɯ|}}, as well as in Cantonese and [[Southern Min]] Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{holodict|8200|e=喝}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The ''katsu'' shout, insofar as it represents a kind of verbal harshness and even violence, can be considered a part of the [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhist]] doctrine of "[[Upaya|skill-in-means]]" ({{lang-sa|upāya-kauśalya}}), which essentially teaches that even an action or practice which seems to violate Buddhist moral guidelines—in this case, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]'s injunction against "abusive speech"&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro 96&lt;/ref&gt;—is permissible, and even desirable, so long as it is done with the aim of ultimately putting an end to [[Dukkha|suffering]] and introducing others to the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dharma]], or teachings of Buddhism.

The most celebrated and frequent practitioner of the ''katsu'' was the Chinese [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|master]] [[Línjì Yìxuán]] (?–866), and many examples of his use of the shout can be found in the ''Línjì-lù'' (臨済錄; Japanese: ''Rinzai-roku''), or ''Record of Linji'', the collection of Linji's actions and lectures:
{{quote|A [[Buddhist monasticism|monk]] asked, "What is the basic meaning of Buddhism?" The Master gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;Here, the phrase translated as "gave a shout" is a reference to Linji's shouting the ''katsu''.&lt;/ref&gt; The monk bowed low. The Master said, "This fine monk is the kind who's worth talking to!"&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of the ''katsu'' stands in a tradition of [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] methods, such as striking disciples with a stick or a [[Buddhist symbolism#The eight auspicious symbols of Tibetan &amp; Nepali Buddhism|fly whisk]],&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' 15&lt;/ref&gt; which developed  within the [[Mazu Daoyi|Mǎzǔ Dàoyī]] (709–788) lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin 2005, 180&lt;/ref&gt; Linji greatly developed and used the ''katsu'' technique. In one of his lectures, often termed as "Linji's Four Shouts"&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 99&lt;/ref&gt; he distinguished four different categories of ''katsu'':
{{quote|The Master said to a monk, "At times my shout is like the precious sword of the [[Manjusri|Diamond King]]. At times my shout is like a golden-haired lion crouching on the ground. At times my shout is like the search pole and the shadow grass. At times my shout doesn't work like a shout at all. Do you understand?" The monk started to answer, whereupon the Master gave a shout.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Death poems==
The Rinzai school continued the practice of the ''katsu'', as can be seen through the examples of the [[death poem]]s of certain Rinzai priests:

{{quote|''Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;On the death bed—''Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;Let he who has eyes see!&lt;br&gt;''Katsu! Katsu! Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;And once again, ''Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;''Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;
-–Yōsō Sōi (養叟宗頤, 1379–1458)&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 128&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|For over sixty years&lt;br&gt;I often cried ''Katsu!'' to no avail.&lt;br&gt;And now, while dying,&lt;br&gt;Once more to cry ''Katsu!''&lt;br&gt;Won't change a thing.&lt;br&gt;
—Kokei Sōchin (古溪宗陳, 1515–1597)&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Conservatism'' (2011), O'Hara developed the philosophy of 'small-c conservatism' that he originally outlined in ''After Blair'' (2005/7). He argued that conservatism must be a philosophy concerned with [[social change]], and must be defensible using [[public reason]]. To that end, he defined conservatism as the knowledge principle plus the change principle. The knowledge principle, influenced by [[scepticism]], states that:
“because society and its mediating institutions are highly complex and dynamic with natures that are constantly evolving as they are co-constituted with the individuals who are their members, both data and theories about society are highly uncertain”.&lt;ref&gt;Kieron O’Hara, Conservatism, pp.49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change principle adds:
“because the current state of society is typically undervalued, and because the effects of social innovations cannot be known fully in advance, then social change (a) must always risk destroying beneficial institutions and norms and (b) cannot be guaranteed to achieve the aims for which it was implemented. It therefore follows that societies should be risk-averse with respect to social change, and the burden of proof placed on the innovator, not his or her opponents. It also follows that change, when it does come, should ideally be (a) incremental, (b) reversible where possible and (c) rigorously evaluated before the next incremental step”.&lt;ref&gt;Conservatism, p.88.&lt;/ref&gt;
Influenced by [[Edmund Burke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Michael Oakeshott]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], O'Hara distanced conservative philosophy from free-market liberalism and [[neo-conservatism]]. He also developed ideas about risk and uncertainty about the environment to sketch a type of [[green conservatism]].

Other projects have included co-authoring the script of ''[[Tomb Raider 4]]'' and an article in the ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]]'' on the film ''[[Carry On Cabby]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/4146/ |title=Carry On Cabby, Gender and the Local Industrial Power Nexus – ePrints Soton |publisher=University of Southampton |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Karatani was educated at [[University of Tokyo]], where he received a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] in [[economics]] and an [[Master's degree|MA]] in [[English literature]]. The Gunzō Literary Prize, which he received at the age of 27 for an essay on [[Natsume Sōseki]], was his first critical acclaim as a literary critic. While teaching at [[Hosei University]], Tokyo, he wrote extensively about modernity and postmodernity with a particular focus on language, number, and money, concepts that form the subtitle of one of his central books: ''Architecture as Metaphor''.

In 1975, he was invited to [[Yale University]] to teach [[Japanese literature]] as a [[Visiting Professor|visiting professor]], where he met [[Paul de Man]] and [[Fredric Jameson]] and began to work on [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]]. Starting from a study of Natsume Sōseki, the variety of the subjects examined by Karatani became so wide that he earned the nickname ''The Thinking Machine''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Karatani collaborated with novelist [[Kenji Nakagami]], to whom he introduced the works of [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. With Nakagami, he published  ''Kobayashi Hideo o koete'' (''Overcoming Kobayashi Hideo''). The title is an ironic reference to “Kindai no chokoku” (''Overcoming Modernity''), a symposium held in the summer of 1942 at Kyoto Imperial University (now [[Kyoto University]]) at which [[Hideo Kobayashi]] (whom Karatani and Nakagami did not hold in great esteem) was a participant.

He was also a regular member of [[ANY (conference)|ANY]], the international architects' conference that was held annually for the last decade of the 20th century and that also published an architectural/philosophical series with Rizzoli under the general heading of ''Anyone''.

Since 1990, Karatani has been regularly teaching at [[Columbia University]] as a visiting professor.

Karatani founded the [[New Associationist Movement]] (NAM) in Japan in the summer of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Harootunian, Harry. "Out of Japan: The New Associationist Movement". ''[[Radical Philosophy]]''. Issue 108 (July/August 2001). Retrieved 21 Mar. 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2187&amp;editorial_id=9899 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416092300/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2187&amp;editorial_id=9899 |archivedate=2007-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NAM was conceived as a counter–capitalist/nation-state association, inspired by the experiment of LETS ([[Local Exchange Trading Systems]], based on non-marketed currency). He was also the co-editor, with [[Akira Asada]], of the Japanese quarterly journal, ''Hihyōkūkan'' (''Critical Space''), until it ended in 2002.

In 2006, Karatani retired from the chair of the International Center for Human Sciences at [[Kinki University]], [[Osaka]], where he had been teaching.

== Philosophy ==
Karatani has produced philosophical concepts, such as "the will to [[architecture]]", but the best-known of them is probably that of "Transcritique", which he proposed in his book ''Transcritique'', where he reads [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] through [[Marx]] and vice versa. Writing about ''Transcritique'' in the ''New Left Review'' of January–February 2004, [[Slavoj Žižek]] brought Karatani's work to greater critical attention. Žižek borrowed the concept of "parallax view" (which is also the title of his review) for the title of his own book.

Karatani has interrogated the possibility of a ([[Paul de Man|de Manian]]) deconstruction and engaged in a dialogue with [[Jacques Derrida]] at the Second International Conference on Humanistic Discourse, organized by the [[Université de Montréal]]. Derrida commented on Karatani's paper "Nationalism and Ecriture" with an emphasis on the interpretation of his own concept of [[écriture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pum.umontreal.ca/revues/surfaces/vol5/derrida.html Jacques Derrida, Introduction to Kōjin Karatani's "Nationalism and Ecriture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurent Gervereau''' (born 1956, in [[Paris]]) is a [[France|French]] artist, novelist, [[philosophy|philosopher]] and filmmaker.  The founder of the discipline of [[Visual History]] (or ''Histiconologia''),&lt;ref&gt;Gervereau, Laurent.  ''Images, une histoire mondiale''.  Paris: Nouveau monde, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; he has devoted his professional life to the world of images, as well as to the direction of cultural and international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroparistech.fr/+Musee-du-Vivant-all-around-the+.html]. Accessed 10 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

Gervereau has been actively engaged in the art world since the 1970s, having participated in exhibitions with several notable [[Surrealism (art)|surrealists]] ([[Philippe Soupault]], [[Belgium|Belgian]] or [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] surrealists, Mirabelle Dors, Alfred Courmes, Maurice Rapin, [[Clovis Trouille]], etc.). His artistic and cultural interests include the [[Dada]] movement, [[Proudhon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Guy Debord]] and [[situationism|the situationist movement]]. He is a member of the [[Collège de 'Pataphysique]].

In 1977, he founded the [[pataphysics|pataphysico]]-situationnist review ''Aux poubelles de la Gloire'' with Guy Bodson.&lt;ref&gt;Bibl. : [ISSN 0399-9440&lt;/ref&gt; There were 13 issues and it finished in 1979. This was the beginning of his philosophy of relativity (''Pour une philosophie de la relativité'', 2010) against relativism. He then built his theories about cultural ecology, evolutionism, necessity of diversity and movement (''plurofuturo''), of choice between past and future (''retrofuturo'') and his struggle against those who have only one way to look at the world, inheritated from the past, and want to uniformise the entire planet (''monoretros'').

He began then his long novel called ''L'homme planétaire'' (end of the 1970s). The middle part of this triptych was published by Sens &amp; Tonka in 2001 with the title ''Ce livre n'est pas à lire'' (''This Book is Not to be Read''). It was chosen by the ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' magazine and the radio channel [[France Culture]] as one of the seven best novels of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Les Inrockuptibles n°301, 21 août 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This book is an experiment in mixed media and local-global description in literature: the "crossmedialism". He will make the adaptation for manga of the third part of the tryptique with a Chinese artist Xin Ye ("Mixplanet", 2011).

In 1989, he built with Louis Rollinde a new artistic group with a new review in English and French: Painters of History (''Les Peintres d'histoire''). Exhibitions were held in Naples, Paris and Hanover. To struggle against the new maelstrom of images, he defended rarity in art and the difficulty to see with hidden images (''La Disparition des images'', 2003). So, he combines art actions or art productions and the creation of unique pieces ("Unik" movement which defends rarity and magic).

After he began to make short movies during the 1970s, he released eight movies. They are experimental documentaries belonging to the "cinema espresso" and were shown from 2009 to 2012 (and after). Official projections were made in January 2011 in the Reflet Médicis in Paris.

He agreed to become president of the See-socioecolo Network, founded in 2010 in Brazil and Canada ([http://see-socioecolo.com/ official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]). In the end of  2012 he published ''LE LOCAL-GLOBAL. Changer soi pour changer la planète'' (''The Local-Global. Change yourself to change the Planet'') and was nicknamed for years "Mister Local-Global". Last but not least, in 2012, he made an artistic action in Hong Kong with the words: "economy is a belief". In France, he chose: "nostalgia = cancer".&lt;ref&gt;Interview in English on Radio Hong Kong 3, World Vibes 2012/11/10 (podcast http://programme.rthk.hk/channel/radio)&lt;/ref&gt; Other members act in Brazil and Canada, and in some other countries &lt;ref&gt;look at [http://see-socioecolo.com/official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the World Campaign "Knowledge is beautiful".

He creates the local-global annual meeting in Argentat sur Dordogne (France): Les Rencontres-Promenades "Histoires de Passages...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoiresdepassages.com/official website of the Rencontres-Promenades]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabu gave the drawing for the 1st edition (July 2015), which is his last poster, in December 2014.

==The scientific and professional aspects==

He first worked in bookshops and in a bank (Crédit Agricole) to get money to live. He made the choice on October 1, 1978, to work in a museum. It had two consequences: first, to act for the transformation of the patrimonial institutions all over the world (look at the networks part in networks section); second, made the choice to base his researches on all kind of images because he discovered that 98% of the pieces in the collections interested nobody. Then, became the specialist of the World History of Images or ''Histiconologia'' ([http://decryptimages.net.com/general website for cultural education]).

He became the curator of the Museum of Contemporary History (''Musée d'Histoire contemporaine de la Bibliothèque de documentation internationale contemporaine'') in 1991 where he did a lot of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdic.fr&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he founded the International Association of Museums of History ([http://iamh-aimh.org/official website of the International Association of Museums of History]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and was the president for 14 years. In 1992, he founded the ''Group L'Image'' with [[Fabrice d'Almeida]], Antoine de Baecque, Philippe Buton, Christian Delporte, Laurence Bertrand Dorléac, and David El Kenz.  The review is distributed by [[Gallimard]] in France and [[Harvard University]] in the United States. There are many contributions such as his interview of [[Ernst Gombrich]] in London or [[Arturo Schwarz]] in Milan about [[Marcel Duchamp]]. International colloquiums were held ("Où va l'histoire de l'art contemporain?" / "Where does the History of Contemporary Art go?", "Peut-on apprendre à voir?" / "How to learn to see?", "Quelle est la place des images en histoire?" / "What is the Place of Images in History?" ) and websites were invented with the help of the French government or the European Commission (imagesmag.net, imageduc.net, primages.net) as CD-roms (collection [décrypter les images] |deciphere the images]). Now all these activities belong to the Institute of Images and [http://decryptimages.net/general website of cultural education]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In the Museum of Contemporary History, he works with a lot of different researchers and artists. He built comparative exhibitions (Germany and France during the 1920s, Great Britain and France during the 1960s), exhibitions about foreign countries as Yugoslav space or Russia and USSR and also exhibitions about difficult subjects concerning French history: propaganda under the Vichy Government (1991), War in Algeria (1992), history of immigration, Dreyfus Affair, Deportation, Images and colonies etc. In 2001, he became director of the Museum of Cinema-Henri Langlois in the [[Cinémathèque française]] in Paris.

Every two years, he organized world congresses with different subjects ("How to organize a Multipolar World?", April 2004 in Brazil). He led the EUROCLIO Network about history of Europe and heritage, helped by the [[European Commission]] from 1999 to 2003 with numerous institutions from all countries of the European Union and more. He built the Museums of Europe Network, founding the review of comparatist history "Comparare" with [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlo Ginzburg]], Rudolf von Thadden, [[Bronislaw Geremek]]. He wrote the book ''Vous avez dit musées? Tout savoir sur la crise culturelle'' / ''You said museums? To know everything about the cultural crisis'' ([[CNRS Editions]]).

Concerning the question of images, he published a lot of books during 30 years. The general bibliography (except articles and conferences) is on: [http://gervereau.com/ official website of Laurent Gervereau], look at "traces". Here are some main examples: about the method to analyse images, ''Voir, comprendre, analyser les images'' ([[La Découverte]]); with Cabu, educative comics for children, "Le monde des images. Comprendre les images pour ne pas se faire manipuler" ([[Robert Laffont]]); le ''Dictionnaire mondial des images''/ ''World Dictionary of Images'' (Nouveau monde); the general history of images, ''Images, une histoire mondiale'' (Nouveau monde/CNDP); ''Un siècle de manipulations par l'image'' (Somogy Editions d'art), ''Inventer l'actualité'' (La Découverte), ''La Guerre mondiale médiatique'' (Nouveau monde), the exhibition and the book ''Les images mentent? Manipuler les images ou manipuler le public'': [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. Some translations are done (in Portuguese and in Arabic), but there is still a lack for some important languages as English, Spanish or Chinese.

Gervereau is now the president of the Institut des Images and director of: [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. In July 2013, he created on this website a monthly cultural video magazine: [decryptcult].

In 2004, he became also the director of the International Museum of Ecology: ''Musée du Vivant'' ([http://agroparistech.fr/Musée du Vivant]). He created a world network in UNESCO during the Congress of December 2005 in Te Papa Museum (New Zealand): Ecology and Sustainable Development Network. He wrote in 2011 "Une histoire générale de l'écologie en images" ("A General History of Ecology in Images", about the relations between humanity and environment from prehistory). In 2012, he organized with Christian Delporte the international colloquium "Patrimoine de l'écologie et écologie du patrimoine" / "Heritage of Ecology, Ecology of Heritage".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histecologia.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105154645/http://histecologia.net/ |date=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jacques Le Goff]], who directed Annales review [[Annales School]], wrote in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' (December 15, 2006) about the ''World Dictionary of Images'': "President of the Institute of Images, Laurent Gervereau published a book that will be essential. He built a team to work on the question of all types of images, a team of exceptional specialists, artists or celebrated intellectuals or brilliant young researchers. We know that, after the last years of the 20th century, humanity has entered into the time of images. The sum realised by Gervereau is in the continuity of his book of method ''See, Understand, Analyse Images'' (La Découverte, first edition in 1994) and of the reflections about the new and fundamental object of the human contemporary reality, the visual, visual that he has studied through his book ''History of the Visual in the XXth Century'' (« Points histoire », Le Seuil, 2000). (...) Today, we entered with the Internet into the "Time of accumulation" and this book seems to be the first attempt to decode this new world of mass images in a global World."

=== Movies ===
Eight movies have been directed by Laurent Gervereau (1h45). They are distributed by [http://adav-assoc.com/distribution in France and abroad for Gervereau's movies]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:
* ''A travers les utopies'', road movie between France and Switzerland to see old places of utopias and to think how to change everyday life today
* ''La fabrique des images hybrides'', how all images were censored about the atomic effects in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and how United States and Europe inspired after that the Japonese culture to make through movies, manga, video games a visual mainstream culture
* ''L'info est-elle comestible?'', how we can understand the great crisis of medias through newspapers, TVs, websites, magazines, radios... Many interviews in France, Germany and Switzerland
* ''La pauvreté, c'est quoi?'' Only people from Mali speak about their everyday life, celebrated or not. So, it is a way to ask the questions of what poverty is, of what is the best way to live when we see that money makes moral disasters in United States or Europe. This film is a great lesson of relativity in order to respect every way to look at the world and to behave.
* ''Où sont les déchets?'' An experimental movie (almost nobody speaks) as a dream or a nightmare through India. A reflection about pollution, people rejected from the society (as Adivasis, Aborigens, considered as non human) and destruction, death, rebirth
* ''En attendant l'hiver... Climat et vie quotidienne chez les Inuit'' This film was done with the Inuit (extreme North of [[Nunavik]]). It shows the changes of life, the question of climate and its consequences, but also as Inuit do with collective property (of their houses or the supermarket), how they continue to hunt in this society where money was a complete nonsense, how they negotiate with the new mines and the big companies
* ''Politically InKorect! Noël Arnaud et Dada, Jarry, Picasso, Jorn, Duchamp, Debord, Vian, l'Oulipo...'' Interview, rare documents of this incredible author (Noël Arnaud) who was Dadaist in the 1930s (against Surrealism), was the leader of the Surrealist Group clandestine during the Second World War, promoted the "surréalisme révolutionnaire" before COBRA after the War, pronounced a conference in 1957 with Guy Debord and the situationists, was close to Fluxus or Boris Vian and the Pataphysicians... Debord speaks in the film as Constant (with a special interview). (2013)
* ''Spectateur'' − An experimental film: three days long looking at TV. A reflection about this dying media. The cemetery for a dead Infante. Goyesque movie. (2013)

'''Lifespring''', founded in 1974, was a [[private company|private]], [[for-profit]], [[New Age]]-[[human potential movement|human potential]] cult. Lifespring said that more than 400,000 people participated in its trainings.&lt;ref name="McAndrews"&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/group/1026-lifespring/12659-i-lost-my-husband-to-a-cult-.html McAndrews, Anne (May 1994). "I Lost My Husband to a Cult,"] ''Redbook Magazine''. Retrieved 2013-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult, which promoted itself through books and [[word-of-mouth]] advertising, was the subject of [[investigative journalism|investigative reports]] by the media, and was criticized by a few former staff members and participants.&lt;ref name="blumenfeld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skeptics"&gt;[http://www.ntskeptics.org/1989/1989mayjune/mayjune1989.htm ''The Newsletter of The North Texas Skeptics''], ''March program looks at Lifespring'', Volume 3 Number 3, May/June 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  At least 30 lawsuits sought to hold Lifespring responsible for participants' deaths or their mental damages. The cult paid to settle some of the suits before trial and in other cases lost jury decisions.&lt;ref name="McAndrews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/lifespring/lifespring8.html Brown, Larry (June 21, 1980).

Lifespring concentrated on how people experience each other, whereas est dealt with changing the way people experience themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q7.com/~terri/Papers/transformative.htm A Critical Analysis of The Transformative Model of Mediation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134336/http://www.q7.com/~terri/Papers/transformative.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}, Terri L. Kelly, Department of Conflict Resolution, [[Portland State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were many similarities between the two.

The former Director for Corporate Affairs of Lifespring, Charles "Raz" Ingrasci,&lt;ref name="KARE"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060314022848/http://www.news-council.org/Outcomes/outcomes_det-83.html "In the Matter of the Complaint of Lifespring, Inc. against KARE-TV, Channel 11,"] Minnesota News Council, Determination 83&lt;/ref&gt; also worked with Erhard, promoting an est mission to the USSR and the [[Hunger Project]]. Ingrasci is now President of the Hoffman Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hoffmaninstitute.org/about/directors-advisors/directors.html Hoffman Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208153055/http://www.hoffmaninstitute.org/about/directors-advisors/directors.html |date=2007-02-08 }}, Board of Directors, Charles "Raz" Ingrasci, President &amp; CEO&lt;/ref&gt; which offers programs such as the Hoffman Quadrinity Process which some regard as similar to Lifespring.&lt;ref name="vahle"&gt;{{cite book| last = Vahle| first = Neal|author2=Connie Fillmore Bazzy| title = The Unity Movement: Its Evolution and Spiritual Teachings
  | publisher = Templeton Foundation Press| year = 2002| pages = 399, 402, 403, 480| isbn =  1-890151-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hanley denied that Lifespring was a duplicate of est, in their 1992 book ''Perspectives on the New Age'' James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] describe the similarities as "striking." They note that both Lifespring and est used "authoritarian trainers who enforce numerous rules", require applause after participants "share" in front of the group, and deemphasize [[reason]] in favor of "feeling and action". The authors also said that graduates of both Lifespring and est were "fiercely loyal", and recruited heavily for their respective groups, reducing marketing expenses to virtually zero.&lt;ref name="meltonnewage" /&gt;

==Course overview==
The Lifespring training generally involved a three-level program starting with a "basic" training, an "advanced" breakthrough course, and a three-month "leadership program" which taught the students how to implement what they learned from the training into their lives. "There is no hope" is a fundamental theory in the course.

Studies commissioned by Lifespring in the 1980s by researchers at Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF, including [[Lee Ross]], Morton Lieberman, and [[Irvin D. Yalom]], found that an overwhelming majority of participants in this training called it either "extremely valuable" or "valuable" (around 90 percent). Many described the training as among the most profound experiences of their lives and said they were able to produce substantial results in their lives as a result of their participation.
&lt;ref name="Sfires"&gt;[http://www.lifespring-scientific-research.com/pages/lifespring-ScientInq3.htm Lifespring Scientific Research], Scientific Inquiry: A Report on Independent Studies of the Lifespring Trainings, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than two percent found them to be "of no value".&lt;ref name="Sfires"/&gt;  Graduates were often eager to share their own experiences in the training with family, friends, and co-workers, although they were precluded from sharing fellow trainees' experiences. There was never any compensation for assisting in enrolling others into the workshops.&lt;ref name="Sfires"/&gt; However, another, independent study found that, "The merging, grandiosity, and identity confusion that has been encouraged and then exploited in the training in order to control participants is now used to tie them to Vitality (Lifespring) in the future by enrolling them in new trainings and enlisting them as recruiters".&lt;ref name="Perso"&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/eldon.braun/awareness/v-intro.htm The Politics of Transformation: Recruitment — Indoctrination Processes In a Mass Marathon Psychology Organization], Philip Cushman, fair use excerpt, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The basic training was composed of successive sessions on Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday day and night, Sunday day and night, a Tuesday night post-training session ten days after graduation, and a post-training interview. Evening sessions began at 6:30 pm and lasted until 11:30 or 12 or later. Saturday sessions started at 10 am and lasted until approximately midnight. Sunday sessions started at 9 am and lasted until approximately 6 pm. The trainings were usually held in the convention facilities of large, easily accessible, moderate priced hotels (i.e., mid-town New York). A basic training was usually composed of 150–200 participants, while an advanced training was composed of 75-100 participants. Approximately 50 percent of advanced training graduates participated in the leadership program. Training also included alumni volunteers who served as small group leaders, several official staff, an assistant trainer, and a head trainer.&lt;ref name="Perso"/&gt;

The training consisted of a series of lectures and experiential processes designed to show the participants a new manner of contending with life situations and concerns and how other possible explanations and interpretations may lead to different results. Some individuals complained that they felt harangued, embarrassed, or humiliated by the trainer during the training. A few individuals choose not to complete the training. Additionally, the trainer used many English words in a manner different from their usual meaning. "Commitment", for instance, was defined as "the willingness to do whatever it takes". "Conclusion" was defined as a belief. Also, words such as "responsibility", "space", "surrender", "experience", "trust", "consideration", "unreasonable", "righteous", "totally participate", "from your head", "openness", "letting go" were redefined or used so as to assign them a more specific meaning.&lt;ref name="Perso"/&gt;

The book ''[[Evaluating a Large Group Awareness Training]]'' made comparisons between Lifespring and est.&lt;ref name="evaluating" /&gt;

Lifespring has been characterized as a form of "[[Large Group Awareness Training]]" in several sources.&lt;ref name="dumerton"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = DuMerton| first = C.| title = Tragic Optimism and Choices|publisher = [[Trinity Western University]]  |date=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zeig"&gt;{{cite book| last = Zeig  | first = Jeffrey K.| title = The Evolution of Psychotherapy: The Third Conference | publisher = Psychology Press  | year = 1997  |  pages = 352, 357|isbn =  0-87630-813-2}}&lt;br&gt;"Training or T-groups, sensitivity training, and encounter groups spread and were followed by commercially sold large group awareness training programs, such as est, Lifespring and other programs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book

==Lawsuits==
Lawsuits were filed against Lifespring for charges ranging from [[involuntary servitude]] to wrongful death. The suits often said that the trainings placed participants under extreme [[stress (medicine)|psychological stress]] in order to elicit change. Lifespring was ordered to pay money to participants who required psychiatric hospitalization and to relatives of members who committed suicide, or otherwise died.&lt;ref name="McAndrews"/&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' published an article about the company in 1987.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; In it Hanley is quoted as saying, "If a thousand people get benefit from the training, and one person is harmed, I'd can it. I have an absolute commitment for having this training work for every person who takes it."

According to the ''Post,'' however, by 1987 Hanley and other Lifespring executives had known for more than a decade that some people sustained serious injuries from its training. As evidence, the ''Post'' cited:

* A deposition in which a former Lifespring vice president said that in 1977 there was a discussion among company executives about participants who suffered ill effects and that such people were referred to as "casualties," "wackos" and "basket cases"
* Talk among top company officials about how to make the trainings less harsh while maintaining their effectiveness
* Dozens of incident reports submitted to Hanley in the late-1970s and early-1980s by Lifespring staff about participants who variously became panicky, incapable of making decisions, or incoherent and nervous. Others landed in psychiatric wards, had visions, regressed to the womb, or became deeply depressed
* Six participants who died.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The ''Post'' also reported in the same article that Hanley had been convicted of six counts of [[felony]] [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]] in 1969, and was given a five-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

Soon after the conviction, Hanley joined [[Holiday Magic]]. The Wisconsin Justice Department sued him and others over a [[pyramid scheme]] involving the company. Hanley paid the state $1,750 to settle the case, but told the ''Post'' that he did so only to avoid the costs of hiring a lawyer, not because he had done anything wrong.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

In 1980, a federal judge rejected Hanley's request to have the felony conviction removed from his record. His request for a presidential pardon was also denied.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

In 1990 [[KARE-TV]] (Channel 11, Minneapolis-St. Paul) ran a segment called "Mind Games?" that Lifespring said was deceptive and sensationalized.&lt;ref name="KARE"/&gt;

''The Skeptic'', a newsletter of The North Texas Skeptics, reported in 1989 on criticism from a participant and former staff volunteer who said the trainings were too stressful and disruptive, and that the program was "an urban cult".&lt;ref name="skeptics" /&gt;

One prominent critic of Lifespring is [[Virginia Thomas]], wife of [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Clarence Thomas]]. Mrs. Thomas said in an interview with the ''Post'' that she chose to seek counseling after her decision to stop participating in Lifespring. In order to avoid phone calls from fellow Lifespring members, urging her to remain in the course, she chose to hide in another part of the United States.  One explanation for the criticisms and actions taken by roughly eight percent of all Lifespring graduates comes from clinical psychologist and Lifespring graduate Bronson Levin.  Levin said, "people who are not prepared for the intense emotional experience of Lifespring or who have hidden traumas tend to become overwhelmed as childhood memories come thundering back to them during training."  Virginia Thomas went on to speak on panels and organized [[Anti-Cult Movement|anti-cult workshops]] for congressional staffers in 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="blumenfeld"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/lifespring/main.htm "The Nominee's Soul Mate,"] [[The Washington Post]], Laura Blumenfeld, September 10, 1991; Page F01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoffs==
While Lifespring no longer delivers training, 75 independent companies offer replicas or training employing many of the company's methods, in the United States and in nine other countries, according to Hanley.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.lifespringnow.com/pages/ctrs.htm Lifespring Now], retrieved 7/4/14.&lt;/ref&gt; These include "Discovery" in Texas and in Southern California, and "WorldWorks", also in Southern California.

"Mastery In Transformational Training", in [[Marina del Rey]], is one out of five of the 75 independent companies that have established a formal relationship with John Hanley, Sr. by purchasing an official license.

"Leaders in Transformation", also known as LIT, bases its methods on the Lifespring model.

"Choice Center" in Las Vegas, Nevada, bases its methods on the Lifespring model.

"Gratitude Trainings in Charlotte, NC and Florida" bases its methods on the Lifespring model.

“Next Level Trainings” in Columbus, OH and also in Philadelphia, PA, bases its methods on the Lifespring model and has mentioned its influence in the trainings.

[[Peter Pomerantsev]] examines a Russian version of the training program, ''Roza Mira'' ({{lang-ru|Роза Мира}}; "The Rose of the World"), in his 2014 book ''Nothing is True and Everything is Possible''. However, ''Roza Mira'' is largely based on the 1958 book of the same name by [[Daniil Andreyev]], based on "mystic visions" he experienced while imprisoned for anti-Soviet propaganda. Another opinion is that "Roza Mira" training program/destructive sect is not based on Daniil Andreyev's book at all, there is nothing written in the book ''Nothing is True and Everything is Possible'' that implies any relation besides the organisers of "Rosa Mira" sect/program saying so, you can find it comparing information about the "Rosa Mira" sect/program in ''Nothing is True and Everything is Possible'' and Andreyev's book that critises sects and personality cults among other things.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Lung''' ({{bo|t=རླུང}} ''rlung'') means wind or breath. It is a key concept in the [[Vajrayana]] traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and has a variety of meanings. ''Lung'' is a concept that Is particularly important to understandings of the [[subtle body]] and the [[Three Vajras]] (body, speech and mind). [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]] practitioner Dr Tamdin Sither Bradley provides a summary:
{{quote|The general description of rLung is that it is a subtle flow of energy and out of the five elements (air, fire, water, earth and space) it is most closely connected with air. However it is not simply the air which we breathe or the wind in our stomachs, it goes much deeper than that. rLung is like a horse and the mind is the rider, if there is something wrong with the horse the rider will not be able to ride properly. Its description is that it is rough, light, cool, thin, hard, movable. The general function of rLung is to help growth, movement of the body, exhalation and inhalation and to aid the function of mind, speech and body. rLung helps to separate in our stomachs what we eat into nutrients and waste products. However its most important function is to carry the movements of mind, speech and body. The nature of rLung is both hot and cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetanmedicine-edu.org/images/stories/pdf/tibetan_yoga.pdf Arya, Pasang Yonten (2009). ''Tibetan Tantric Yoga''] (accessed: January 8, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Usages==
Some of the different usages of the term ''lung'' include:
* the psychic winds ([[sanskrit]]: ''prana'') that travel in the internal channels, or ''nadi'' (Sanskrit) of the [[subtle body]] and are manipulated in certain [[Vajrayana]] [[yoga]] practices.
* specifically the five psychic winds that are a manifestation of the [[mahābhūta]]. These five are the [[Energy (esotericism)|lifeforce]] that animate the [[bodymind]] (Sanskrit: ''[[namarupa]]'') of all [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] and are key to certain tantric [[Vajrayana|Buddhist]] and [[Bon]] [[sādhanā]]s and traditional Tibetan medicine.
* to the [[vayu]] and [[prana]] of [[ayurveda]].
* as a component of the term for a type of [[prayer flag]], named after the allegorical [[Wind Horse]] (Tibet: ''lung ta'').
* a type of tantric buddhist [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] that involves the transference of spiritual power from master to augment or refine that of the disciple through the recitation of scripture or song. This oracular transmission received aurally defines Vajrayana and [[Ngagpa]] traditions and provides them with their [[nomenclature]].
* the "reading transmission" of [[sutrayana]] texts, in which the entirety of the text is read aloud from teacher to student.

==Traditional Tibetan medicine==
{{main|Traditional Tibetan medicine}}
[[Image:Chenrezig empowerment seattle sakya.jpg|thumb|right|The text being read during an empowerment ceremony - the 'lung']]

Traditional Tibetan medicine, a discipline practiced throughout the [[Himalayas]], identifies a system of 'The Five Lung' which help to regulate the human body:
*'Life-grasping lung' (''srog 'dzin rlung'') is located in the [[brain]]. This lung regulates swallowing, inhalation, spitting, eructation, sneezing, and generally clearing the senses and steadying of the mind and concentration.
*'Upward moving lung' (''gyen-rgyu rlung'') is located in the [[thorax]]. This lung regulates speech, energy to work, body weight, memory, the increase of bodily vigour and health, complexion and the skin lustre, mental endeavour and diligence.
*'All pervading lung' (''khyab-byed rlung'') is located is in the [[heart]]. This lung regulates lifting, walking, stretching and the contraction of muscles: opening and closing of the mouth, eyelids, anus etc.
*'Fire accompanying lung' (''me-mnyam rlung'') is located is in the [[stomach]] and [[abdomen]] area. This lung regulates [[digestion]] and the [[metabolism]]. This lung also ripens the Seven Bodily Sustainers (Tibetan: ''lus-zung dhun'').
*'Downward cleansing lung' (''thur-sel rlung'') is located in the [[rectum]], [[gastrointestinal tract]] and [[perineum|perineal]] region and its function is to expel feces, urine, semen, menstruation, uterine contractions and the [[fetus]]. This is also considered as "enjoyment lung" by most of the sublime practices of Vajrayana. (direct transmission is to be required by a qualified teacher)

==Subtle Body==
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] views the human body as consisting of a coarse body made of six constituent elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space and consciousness and also of a [[subtle body]], or 'Vajra body', of winds, channels and drops.There are many types of wind or 'subtle breath' that move along the invisible channels of the [[subtle body]]. The 'vital breath' (Tibetan:''sog lung'' ) is considered the most important. It is "the essence of life itself that animates and sustains all living beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmer-Brown|first=Judith|title=Dakini's Warm Breath:The Feminine Principle in Tibetan Buddhism|publisher=Shambhala Publications Inc.|location=Boston and London|year=2002|pages=169|isbn=1-57062-920-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] practices from the [[Mahamudra]] meditation system, such as [[Guhyasamāja Tantra|Guhyasamāja]], [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra|Cakrasaṃvara]] and [[Hevajra]] tantras, provide various methods to penetrate the vital points of the Subtle Body. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] summarises the practice: "To penetrate these points means to gather there the energy-winds and the subtle minds that ride on them, basically by means of different types of absorbed concentration focused on these spots.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Tenzin |author2=Alexander Berzin |title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=New York|year=1997|pages=219|isbn=1-55939-072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices that work with the subtle energy winds includes [[tummo]] or 'Inner Fire', one of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]]. In this practice, the [[yogin]] or [[yogini]] uses breathing and meditation techniques to draw the lung or subtle winds into the central channel and hold them there, traversing the body vertically.

==Tsa Lung==
[[Image:Chakras and energy channels 2 (3749594497).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras.]]
'''Tsalung''' (Skt: ''[[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]-[[vayu]]''; Tib. ''rtsa rlung''; where "rtsa" denotes an energetic channel) are special yogic exercises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|Wangyal, Tenzin]] (2002) p.89 ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''.  Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercises are used in the Bon tradition and the four main schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. [[Trul khor]] employs the ''tsa lung'' and they constitute the internal [[yantra]] or [[sacred architecture]] of this yoga's Sanskrit name, ''yantra yoga''. ''Tsa lung'' are also employed in [[generation stage]] practices.

The exercises are used:
* to open major [[chakra]]s and
* to bring the ''lung'' from the [[side channels]] into the [[central channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|Wangyal, Tenzin]] (2002) p.82 ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''.  Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That coincides with mind releasing [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] misperceptions and abiding in non-dual awareness of [[rigpa]] (Tib. ''rig pa''). Detailed instructions on the exercises describe 3 levels of ''rtsa rlung'': external, internal and secret.

Each level contains 5 exercises corresponding to [[Tattva|five elements]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|Wangyal, Tenzin]] (2002) p.76-110 ''Healing with Form, Energy, and Light''.  Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|1-55939-176-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsa===
Dr Arya (2006) defines "Tsa" in relation to [[śūnyatā]], zero, [[bodymind]] and [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]:
{{quote|''Tsa'', 'channel' means hollow tube where blood, wind and consciousness can pass freely, for example body cavities such as blood vessels, the mouth and hollow organs. Tsa is a symbol of space, and it gives space to the consciousness and other components of body/mind to manifest themselves under transcendental and dualistic forms and colors. It is like a house for the consciousness. The space is limitless and boundless therefore its symbolic sign is the zero. Everything manifests from this zero or space and also dissolves into it. For example, in mathematics, the zero keeps the first space for no. 1, which goes until 9 and returns back to the zero. It shows that all phenomena existence have the same space origin and ends at the same place. In fact, there is nothing which comes or goes to that state. Therefore Buddhism, as a symbolic language, calls ''Shunyata'' (voidness) what draws round zero. The space is a ''Thikle'' (round) in Tibetan, and ''Bindu'' in [S]anskrit. It is the cause of the particle as well as the unlimited space nature. It is the base for everything and the innate nature of emptiness. This is called space particles as well as symbol of the body channels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetanmedicine-edu.org/pdf/yogaD1.pdf Arya, Pasang Yonten (2006). ''Tibetan Tantric Yoga''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229110048/http://www.tibetanmedicine-edu.org/pdf/yogaD1.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }} (accessed: December 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophy==
Drury's book, "The Danger of Words" has been described by [[Ray Monk]] as 'the most truly Wittgensteinian book published by any of Wittgenstein's students'.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Monk, The Duty of Genius (1990), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Drury brought Wittgenstein's "critique of language" to bear on the practice of medicine, and particularly psychology that promised the same control over the mind that physics achieved with matter. This promise, pointed out Drury, was one where the delivery date was always being pushed into the future.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Irish Philosophers, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Monad to Man: the concept of progress in evolutionary biology''''' is a 1996 book about the longstanding idea that [[evolution]] is [[orthogenesis|progressive]] by the [[philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]]. It analyses the connection between ideas of [[Evolutionary progress|progress]] in culture generally and its application in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Summary==

In this "really big book"&lt;ref name=ix&gt;Ruse, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; (539 pages, plus notes), [[Michael Ruse]] surveys the attitude to progress throughout the history of [[biology]], exploring the connections between the idea of progress and the belief that evolution is progressive ([[orthogenesis]]). He argues that from early nineteenth century speculation, [[Charles Darwin]] came to suggest that [[natural selection]] drove [[species]] to "a higher stage of perfection",&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, p. 151, quoting a letter from Darwin to Hooker.&lt;/ref&gt; jumping from relative to absolute progress. In this, Ruse argues, he was followed by many later biologists. Ruse interviews well-known [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] such as [[Ernst Mayr]], [[John Maynard Smith]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[E. O. Wilson]], and both reports their views and gives his own opinion of how progressionist they were.

==Illustrations==

The book is illustrated with photographs of the major figures, such as [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] and [[Sewall Wright]], and a few drawings such as of the [[titanothere]], an animal used by Osborn to illustrate "orthogenetic evolution beyond the adaptive optimum"&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few diagrams such as [[William Bateson]]'s schematic "phylogeny", a proposed tree of life for some [[invertebrate]] animals.

==Publication history==

''Monad to Man'' was first published by [[Harvard University Press]] with cloth covers in 1996. They produced the first paperback edition in 2009.

Makarand Paranjape, in an "introductory essay" for The International Society for Science and Religion, notes that Ruse was a "key witness" in the 1982 court case which decided that the attempt by Arkansas to ban the teaching of evolution in schools was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Paranjape&gt;{{cite web| last1=Paranjape|first1=Makarand|title=Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology {{!}}  by Michael Ruse {{!}}  Introductory Essay|url=http://www.issrlibrary.org/introductory-essays/essay/?title=Monad%20to%20Man:%20The%20Concept%20of%20Progress%20in%20Evolutionary%20Biology&amp;ref=essays |publisher=The International Society for Science and Religion |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranjape writes that Ruse argues that evolutionary biology has been an immature science "for much of its 150 year history", because it has been tied to [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]]'s idea of progress. He suggests that Ruse is "unapologetically, even unreflexively Euro-centric", leaving out non-Western thinkers like [[Sri Aurobindo]], and notes that Ruse ends by predicting that "P&lt;!--cap. is important here--&gt;rogress will continue to dog evolutionary theory" because as Ruse explains, the belief of evolutionists in scientific Progress [with a capital P] is so readily transferred into "a belief in organic progress".&lt;ref name=Paranjape/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science Ron Amundson, reviewing the book for ''The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', notes that Ruse thanks [[E. O. Wilson]] for urging him "to write a really big book", and quotes [[Peter J. Bowler]] as calling it "an important book on the status of evolutionism that will almost certainly become embroiled in controversy".&lt;ref name=Amundson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amundson |first1=Ron |title=Reviewed Work: Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology by Michael Ruse |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|date=September 1998 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=515–521 |jstor=688089 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundson observes that Ruse claims that evolutionary biology has nearly always been seen as only doubtfully a professional scientific discipline, and that Ruse's thesis is that this is because it has always been tied to "culturally biased concepts of progress".&lt;ref name=Amundson/&gt; Whether this is actually "bad" is, suggests Amundson, almost irrelevant as long as biologists have thought it so, but since normative (value) judgements such as of progress cannot be derived from observation they are from a methodological point of view not part of science. All the same, he argues, Ruse is an analytic and empiricist philosopher, not at all social-constructivist. Amundson finds Ruse's handling of the morphological traditions "less satisfactory" than of the [[adaptation]]ist, Darwinian traditions, and doubts whether [[Richard Owen]] was a social progressionist just because he was influenced by ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.&lt;ref name=Amundson/&gt; He compares Ruse unfavourably with Betty Smokovitis's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03343-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obsessive concern with historiography", and calls Ruse's writing style "bluff, unselfconscious, and opinionated" and finds Ruse sarcastic, "scarcely a neutral observer". On the other hand, he notes, Ruse is completely open about when he is "sensing" (guessing) something. Amundson concludes that Ruse has certainly shown that evolution and progress "have been closely linked", and his narrative of the people and ideas "rich and compelling", but finds Ruse's claim that biology has been shaped by biologists's embarrassment at this connection debatable.&lt;ref name=Amundson/&gt;

The biologist and philosopher [[Michael Ghiselin]] notes that biologists agree that there is progress in biology and in technology, and that anatomists "do not seem too unhappy with the idea" of something much like that sort of progress in evolution, but that biologists have had trouble finding a theory of progress that did not lead into problems with ideology and "bad metaphysics". He criticises Ruse for "politically correct" "academic bigotry", disagrees with Ruse's narrative about phylogenetics, and accuses him of "completely ignor[ing] recent work such as by [[Carl Woese]], "neglect[ing] data" that contradict his thesis. Ironically, in Ghiselin's view, Ruse's own epistemological ideal for science relies on the idea of Progress.&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |title=Monad to Man: The Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology.Michael Ruse |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=72 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=452–452 |doi=10.1086/419959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1969">'''Norman J. Kretzmann''' (4 November 1928 – 1 August 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]] - Number: 201-16-9077; Issue State: Pennsylvania; Issue Date: Before 1951&lt;/ref&gt; was a Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Cornell University]] who specialised in the history of [[medieval philosophy]] and the [[philosophy of religion]].

Kretzmann joined Cornell's Department of Philosophy in 1966. His work as a teacher and scholar was recognized in 1970, when he was appointed Chairman of the Department of Philosophy, and in 1977 when he was elected a Susan Linn Sage Professor of Philosophy by the University Board of Trustees. In 1992, he received a Graduate Teaching Award from the [[Northeastern Association of Graduate Deans]] for his excellence and creativity in the teaching of graduate students. He became a Susan Linn Sage [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1995. He published numerous books, articles, essays, and editions of medieval texts. He served as the principal editor of ''The Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy'' (1982), and as an editor of the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University [http://hdl.handle.net/1813/18235 Memorial statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kretzmann was brought up a [[Lutheran]] and descended from a long line of Lutheran [[pastor]]s, but he lost his Lutheran faith while at college. He was for many years an active member of the Society of Christian Philosophers.  In his early sixties, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and given less than two years to live; in the event, he lived seven more years and completed two volumes of his projected three-volume work on Aquinas's Summa contra Gentiles.

'''Oresas''' was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], according to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], (1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofgree03smituoft|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|author=Sir Smith William|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smith'' (1870) noted (p. 40):
:ORESAS, a Pythagorean. A fragment of his writings is preserved in [[Stobaeus]], Eclog. p. 105. ( Fabric. Bibl. Graec. vol. i. p. 860.) [C. P. M.]

However, it has been pointed out that ''Stobaeus'' occasionally mixed up [[Platonism]] with [[Pythagoreanism]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Stobaeus, Joannes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the '''philosophy of color''', there is a dispute between '''color realism''', the view that colors are [[physical properties]] that objects possess, and '''color fictionalism''', a species of [[error theory]] viewing colors according to which there are no such physical properties that objects possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/colour/concrete_dirigible/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gatzia-Colour-Fictionalism-2010.pdf|title=Colour Fictionalism – SFU|author=|date=|website=sfu.ca|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of color==
One of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color. The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind of properties colors are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation of colors, and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/color/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Barry|last=Maund|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=23 March 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the ontology of color, there are various competing types of theories. One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties (properties of a special kind that can't be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such). This divides color primitivism from color reductionism. A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as unreducible properties. A reductionism is the opposite view, that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties. Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object's disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself (this sort of view is often dubbed "relationalism", since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers, but it also often called simply dispositionalism - various forms of course exist). An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen.

Another type of reductionism is color physicalism. Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects. Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces (though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too). Byrne, Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view. They identify colors with reflectance types.

A reflectance type is a set, or type, of reflectances, and a reflectance is a surface's disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum.

Both relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories, since apart from specifying what colors are, they maintain that colored things exist.

Primitivism may be either realist or antirealist, since primitivism simply claims that colors aren't reducible to anything else. Some primitivists further accept that, though colors are primitive properties, no real or nomologically possible objects have them. Insofar as we visually represent things as colored - on this view - we are victims of color illusions. For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory.

==Color discourse==
If color fictionalism is true, and the world has no colors, should one just stop color discourse, and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other? ''Prescriptive color fictionalism'' would say no.  In ''prescriptive color fictionalism'',  while color discourse is, strictly speaking, false, one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist.

Color vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like [[Leo Hurvich]] that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the 1980s. An important work on the subject was C. L. Hardin's 'Color for Philosophers,' which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world, but are instead purely mental features.

David Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision. Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world. Nigel J.T. Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument. The psychologist George Boeree, in the tradition of J. J. Gibson, specifically assigns color to light, and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience, an approach he refers to as "quality realism".

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of University of Texas have also written many essays on color vision. Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto. In The Red and the Real, Cohen argues for the position, with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics. Cohen's work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin.

Michael Tye argues, among other things, that there is only one correct way to see colors. Therefore, the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of "normal" humans. Similarly, creatures with more advanced color vision, although better able to distinguish objects than people, are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans. Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called ''True Blue''.

Paul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism. In the 1980s Paul Churchland's view located colors in the retina. But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream. Paul Churchland's view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert's view, but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks.

Many philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism, the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world. Surprisingly, most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism (a.k.a. irrealism).

Jonathan Cohen of UCSD has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science, ''Color Ontology and Color Science''.

'''R. De Staningtona''' was a friar, likely of the [[Dominican Order]],  who was at [[Oxford University]] in the mid-1250s. He composed a noteworthy summary of ''libri naturales'' (works of natural philosophy) by [[Aristotle]]. His summary was entitled ''Compilacio quedam liborum naturalium''. The manuscript has never been edited although selections from it have appeared in the ''[[Journal of the History of Philosophy]]''. The final work he summarized was ''[[De anima]]''.

R. De Staningtona made use of the explanations of [[Averroes]] in compiling his text. His work was probably employed in the Oxford Dominican convent for the preliminary education of the brothers. Many of these people were not degree candidates. De Staningtona's tract was useful in providing a medium for the influence of [[Richard Fishacre]], especially for those who were unlikely to read Fishacre's commentary on the [[Books of Sentences]] by [[Peter Lombard]].&lt;ref&gt;''R. De Staningtona'', ''The Problem Of The Rational Soul In The Thirteenth Century'', Richard C. Dales, E.J. Brill, 1995, pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

In 1990, in response to [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s ''Is There a Right to Pornography?'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Ronald|title=Is There a Right to Pornography?|jstor=764457|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|year=1981|volume=1|issue=2|pages=177–212|doi=10.1093/ojls/1.2.177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langton published ''Whose right? Ronald Dworkin, Women, and Pornographers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langton|first1=Rae|title=Whose Right? Ronald Dworkin, Women, and Pornographers|journal=Philosophy and Public Affairs|date=1990|volume=19|issue=4|pages=311–359|jstor=2265317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it she argued that the positions Dworkin takes on segregation and affirmative action are not consistent with his position in defence of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langton|first=Rae|title=Whose right? Ronald Dworkin, Women, and Pornographers|journal=Philosophy and Public Affairs|volume=19|issue=4|pages=311–59|year=1990|doi=10.1023/A:1010619209334}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was voted one of the ten best articles in philosophy that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Volumes|url=http://www.philosophersannual.org|publisher=The Philosopher's Annual|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993 she published her paper ''Speech Acts and Unspeakable Acts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langton|first=Rae|title=Speech Acts and Unspeakable Acts|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2265469?uid=3739552&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103755184003|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|year=1993|volume=22|issue=4|pages=293–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mary Kate McGowan]], "Rather than focus on the harms allegedly caused, Langton explores the hypothesis that pornography actually constitutes harm."&lt;ref name=McGowan2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGowan|first=Mary Kate|title=Review: Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24072-sexual-solipsism-philosophical-essays-on-pornography-and-objectification|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book, ''Kantian Humility: Our Ignorance of Things in Themselves'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/177345495|title=Kantian humility our ignorance of things in themselves|last=Rae|first=Langton,|date=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=9780198236535|oclc=177345495}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on her thesis. According to one reviewer, "In this perspective there is no idealism in Kant, rather what Langton calls epistemic humility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esfeld|first=Michael|title=Rae Langton, Kantian Humility. Our Ignorance of Things in Themselves|journal=Erkenntnis|volume=54|issue=3|pages=399–403|year=2001|doi=10.1023/A:101061920933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer described the book as "one of the most original and thought-provoking books on Kant to have appeared for quite some time."&lt;ref name=Walker2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Ralph|title=Review: Kantian Humility: Our Ignorance of Things in Themselves|journal=Mind|year=2002|volume=111|issue=441|pages=136–43|doi=10.1093/mind/111.441.136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the papers she published from 1990-99 were collected in her 2009 book, ''Sexual Solipsism: Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification'', along with her responses to some of her critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/902008049|title=Sexual solipsism philosophical essays on pornography and objectification|last=Rae|first=Langton,|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199247066|oclc=902008049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this book, [[Wellesley College]] philosophy professor [[Mary Kate McGowan]] wrote in  ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'' that "...Langton's crisp, clear, and careful argumentation proves that philosophy has much to offer the socially, politically and even legally charged issues addressed here... This is feminist scholarship at its very best. It's first-rate philosophy."&lt;ref name=McGowan2009/&gt; Langton has written more than fifty articles about subjects ranging from feminist approaches to pornography, to animal ethics, to hate speech.&lt;ref name="cambridge.academia"/&gt;

'''Saviour Bernard''' (1724-1806) was a Maltese medical practitioner, a scientist, and a major philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were mostly philosophical [[psychology]] and [[physiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, no portrait of Bernard has been located as yet.

==Life==

===Beginnings===
Bernard was born at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], on November 29, 1724, from French parents. His family seems to have been well-off, enough, at least, to give Bernard a good initial formation, one which was probably better than that of his peers.

At the young age of nineteen, in 1743, Bernard was sent to the south of [[France]], at [[Aix-en-Provence]], to study medicine and surgery at the [[university|University of Aix-en-Provence]] there. He graduated in June 1749, at the age of twenty-four.

===Professional career===
It was during that same year that Bernard, then already back in [[Malta]], published in [[Sicily]] what turned out to be his life’s major work, entitled ''Trattato Filosofico-Medico dell’Uomo'' (See below: ''Magnum opus'').

In 1752, Bernard was appointed the principal officer of public health by the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]. He was also appointed medical superintendent of two major hospitals of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], Santo Spirito, at [[Rabat, Malta|Rabat]], and [[Lazzaretto of Manoel Island|Lazzaretto]], on [[Manoel Island]].

At the end of the 18th century, Bernard worked hard to cure the diseased stricken by the epidemic influenza. On this occasion he is said to have showed outstanding proficiency and resourcefulness.

===Retirement and death===
During the very last years of the [[Knights Hospitallers]]’ rule, when Bernard was in his late seventies, the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] graciously granted the aged doctor and philosopher a pension equal to his salary, something which was not normal practice in those days. In return, Bernard continued to provide his services whenever asked for as long as his health held out. He finally retired in 1801, at the age of seventy-seven, when by then the [[Knights Hospitallers]] had long been expelled from [[Malta]].

Bernard died at [[Rabat, Malta]] at the age of eighty-two on March 7, 1806.

==Magnum opus==
* '''''Trattato Filosofico-Medico dell’Uomo e Sue Principali Operazioni''''' (A Philosophical-Medical Study on Man and his Principal Operations; 1749)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 235}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Despite having almost certainly been composed in France, the book was written in Italian and published in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]], at the printing press of the senate there, which was run by Mr. Bisagni. It was dedicated to the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]. Essentially, the work is a philosophical study thoroughly based on medical observations of human beings and animals.

The book, which is composed of 111 pages, opens with a dedicatory letter and a table of contents. Then it is divided in eight chapters. In his opening letter, Bernard goes at some length to justify the significance of his work despite his relatively young age (of just twenty-four). The chapters respectively deal with (1) the nature of human beings, (2) their bodily functions, (3) their sensitive faculties, (4) their intellectual faculties, (5) the relation between their sensitive and intellectual faculties, (6) the dependence of bodily movements upon the intellect, (7) the effect of the intellect upon bodily movements, and finally (8) the nature of the ‘internal life’ of the intellect.

===Quotes===
These are a few quotations from Bernard’s ''Trattato'':&lt;ref name="Falzon"&gt;{{harvp|Falzon|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*''“Amongst the many calamities brought upon the human race by the first sin of Adam, Ignorance, to which we are all indifferently subject, is certainly not the least important.”'' – Prologue

:*''“Man emerges into light enriched with the beautiful gift of reason, which arms him, clothes him and strengthens him, in such a way that it makes him Lord and absolute Master of all other creatures, whether their earthly bodies be animate or inanimate.”'' – Chapter 1

:*''“The human body is a machine so artful and complicated in its many parts, so well planned together and meshed from so many sides that all the intellects united together would hardly suffice to understand its construction and symmetry. Therefore, not without reason is it called the small world.”'' – Chapter 2

:*''“This is the principal role of the senses, namely watching over the preservation of one’s own individuality.”'' – Chapter 3

:*''“I hold that since in this there is no contradiction, one can cautiously conjecture that body or matter can think, and that God can, if He wants, grant to it this so noble faculty and establish that its various movements and diverse figures are its various perceptions and diverse thoughts; nor do I find reasons that prohibit me to believe it.”'' – Chapter 4

:*''“If thought and cognition are not properties belonging only to spirits, but can also be compatible with bodies, it can be inferred that animals can know, feel and have many other ideas and perceptions without having a spiritual soul, but by means solely of some movements which their organs perform.”'' – Chapter 4

:*''“It is not necessary for a King to be present in all the cities of his kingdom in order to govern and know that which occurs in its various provinces: it suffices that he be at his seat of command and overall rule. Likewise the soul, which is the Queen of the body, does not need to be present and united to all of its parts. It suffices for the soul to be at its seat of command and rule over all the movements of its body which are subordinated to its jurisdiction. There, finally, all the parts of the body send, so to speak, accounts of all that occurs in them.”'' – Chapter 5

:*''“The body lives independently of the soul, and all the others vital functions are fulfilled in it without its concurrence.”'' – Chapter 5

:*''“The body dies not because the soul separates itself from it. The soul divorces itself from its body because the latter dies and ceases to live.”'' – Chapter 5

:*''“For us good is all that which is apt to bring us happiness and augment it in us, by means of the pleasure, merriment and contentment brought to us by its possession and enjoyment, or else that which can hive away or remove from us some pain, sadness, or other nuisance.”'' – Chapter 6

:*''“Imagining does not differ from sensing, except in terms of greater or lesser vivacity.”'' – Chapter 7

==Other works of philosophical interest==
Both of the following works contain interesting reflections which might interest philosophy. The second one especially. It is written in a curious style, its theme is rather intriguing, and the philosophical arguments brought forth are quite interesting.

* '''''Notamenta''''' (Annotations; 1749)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; – A manuscript in Latin composed by Bernard during the same year that his ''Trattato'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, MS. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The document is made up of 91 back-to-back folios, and contains a whole series of notes organised in alphabetical order. The work deals with a lot of subjects. Most of them are of a historical nature related to [[Malta]]’s history. Others are interesting from a sort of sociological point of view. It is in this sense that these latter ones might be of interest to philosophy.
* '''''De Fluidorum''''' (Concerning the Nature of a Fluid; 1751)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; – The whole title of this work is ''De Fluidorum et Materiæ Electricæ Natura concertatio sive Dissertatio Apologetica'' (Concerning the Nature of a Fluid and the Nature of the Electrical Matter which it contains, or a Defensive Study). The manuscript uses the genre of a report of a (probably imagined) discussion between a Sicilian, Benedict Genuisi, on one side, and John Bruno and Bernard, both Maltese, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Malta, MS. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole document is made of just 35 folios, and is divided in three main parts. The first part is written in Italian supposedly by Genuisi. It deals with two main themes: the nature of a fluid, and whether electrical energy is transmitted through a fluid or, rather, through sulphate acid. Herein, Genuisi answers to four objections which Bruno and Bernard have raised. [[Aristotle]] is quoted various times. The second and third parts, both written in Latin, respectively report the answers of Bruno and Bernard, in which each goes into some detail to explain points already mentioned in the first part of the work. While Bruno produces two experiments to prove his case, Bernard insists that experiments must be proved philosophically. In support of his arguments, Bernard calls forth the authority of [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Descartes]] and [[Robert Boyle]].

==Other manuscripts==
The following three tracts, all unpublished, are not of any philosophical interest. They might, however, be interesting and valuable from a medical point of view.

* ''Tractatus de Morbis'' (A Study of Illnesses) – In Latin.
* ''Sull’Origine della Pazzia'' (On the Origin of Madness) – In Italian.
* ''Delle Epidemie Febbrili Maligne'' (Concerning Malign Feverish Epidemics) – In Italian.

===Political views===
Bernard lived during the turbulent times when the [[Knights Hospitallers]] were ousted from the [[Maltese islands]] by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798. Despite the fact that the French, in turn, were overthrown by the [[Maltese people|Maltese]], and later driven out in 1800 by the British, the [[Knights Hospitallers]] were not reinstated. Bernard lived his last years during the ‘temporary’ rule of the British.

These developments must not have been to Bernard’s liking. He was very proud of his [[Christian faith]] and also very fond of the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. To see them reduced to a nonentity must have been difficult for him to acknowledge.

===Philosophy===
In terms of his philosophical positions, Bernard must be considered to be a modern philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falzon|1998|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in the pre-Kantian period of modern philosophy when two main schools of thought, namely [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], opposed each other despite their common inheritance of the characteristic Cartesian prejudice of the whole of modern philosophy – viz. that what man knows directly and immediately are not things themselves but his own ‘ideas’.

Bernard was not a rationalist in the sense that he adopts the ‘geometrical method’ which characterised the writings of [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Nor is Bernard a rationalist in the sense of excluding supernatural faith. While [[Descartes]] in the ''Discourse on Method'' attempts to construct knowledge entirely on reason and not on dogma or faith, Bernard takes the existence of God for granted and accepts the immortality of the soul on the basis of faith. Bernard can be labelled a rationalist only in a very wide sense; only in so far as he highly values the rational qualities of man (bequeathed upon him by God). His emphasis on man as a rational animal, and his discourse in the preface to his ''Trattato'' concerning the spirit of his attempt to illumine the minds of men, are grounds for considering his work to be part and parcel of the enlightenment culture of the 18th century.

In any stricter (epistemological) sense of the word ‘rationalist’, Bernard should rather be considered as adhering to the opposite camp. He takes sensorial ''experience'' as the point of departure for the acquisition of knowledge. He criticises the theory of innate ideas – characteristic of the rationalist stream of thought in [[modern philosophy]] – and points out that the mind is at birth a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or rather a blank slate awaiting ideas from experience. He thinks that ideas are derived from experience, and this is highly reminiscent of the empiricism of [[John Locke|Locke]]. However, he does seem to have the greatest sympathy for [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] (who belongs, in the epistemological sense of the word, to the rationalist school) out of all philosophers, except on this basic issue of the origin of ‘ideas’.

There is hardly any indication whatsoever of indebtedness to [[Thomistic philosophy]] in Bernard’s work despite his repeated professions of deference to the [[Catholic Church]]. His tacit rejection, rather than explicit opposition, to the central features of the anthropology of [[Aquinas]], notably its anti-dualism, is, however, not surprising and possibly unintended.

===Appreciation===
In academic circles, Bernard is revered more as a philosopher than as a medical doctor. This might be because his major writing, even if written in his youth, is more of a philosophical nature than anything else. It might be also due to the fact that Bernard is generally eclipsed by his more well-known contemporary, [[Joseph Demarco]].

In any case, since 1995, when Bernard’s ''Trattato'' was presented to the public as a work worthy of philosophical consideration,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Stedina ghall-Filosofija Maltija'', PEG, Malta, 1995, pp. 105-106.&lt;/ref&gt; more and more attention was given to the work by philosophers. Unfortunately, Claude Falzon's excellent translation of it, made in 1998, is still to be published. Falzon’s work also includes a philosophical study of Bernard’s book as an introduction. Nevertheless, further investigations would certainly be more than fitting, especially to amplify the biographical data concerning Bernard’s life, times and also his professional and academic activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20836">"'''The Unreality of Time'''" is the best-known philosophical work of the Cambridge idealist [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] (1866–1925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, ''The Nature of Existence''.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. E. McTaggart, "The Unreality of Time", ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' 17: 457–73; reprinted in J. M. E. McTaggart, ''The Nature of Existence'', Vol. 2, 1927, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: Book 5, Chapter 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by [[C. D. Broad]] 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the 1st Volume of ''The Nature of Existence'' ([https://www.academia.edu/343534/McTaggart_and_the_Unreality_of_Time Ingthorsson 1998] &amp; [https://www.amazon.com/McTaggarts-Paradox-Routledge-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/1138677248 2016]).

It is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all.

==The phenomenological analysis: the A- and B-series==
{{main|A-series and B-series}}
To frame his argument, McTaggart initially offers a phenomenological analysis of how time appears to us in experience. Time appears, he says, in the form of events standing in temporal positions, of which there are two kinds. On the one hand events are earlier than and later than each other, and on the other hand they are future, present, and past, and continually changing their position in terms of futurity, presentness, and pastness. The two kinds of temporal positions each represent events in time as standing in a certain order which McTaggart chooses to call the A-series and the B-series. The A-series represents the series of positions determined as future, present, and past, and which continuously pass from the distant future towards the present, and through the present into the remote past. The B-series represents the series of positions determined as earlier than or later than each other. The determinations of the B-series hold between the events in time, and never change. If an event ever is earlier or later than some other event, then their respective position in time never changes. The determinations of the A-series must hold to something outside of time, something that does not itself change its position in time, but in relation to which the events in time pass from being future, present, and past. Surprisingly, McTaggart does not suggest the present, or NOW, as this something whose position in time is fixed and unchanging. He just says that it will be difficult to identify any such entity (seeing as it is outside time). Broad explains that McTaggart believed that the difficulty of identifying this entity was serious enough in its own right to be persuaded that time is unreal, but thinks that the contradiction of the A-series is still more convincing, wherefore he leaves this particular difficulty aside.&lt;ref&gt;Broad 1938: p. 317-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==The atemporality of the B-series==

McTaggart argues that the conception of time as only forming a B-series is inadequate because the B-series does not change, and [[change (philosophy)|change]] is of the essence of time. If any conception of [[reality]] represents it as changeless, then this is a conception of an atemporal reality. The B-series does not change because earlier-later relationships never change (e.g. the year 2010 is always later than 2000). The events that form a B-series must therefore also form an A-series in order to count as being in time, i.e. they must pass from future to present, and from present to past, in order to change.

It should be noted that the A- and B-series are not mutually exclusive. If events form an A-series they automatically also form a B-series (anything in the present is earlier than anything in the future, and later than everything past). The question is not therefore whether time forms an A- or a B-series; the question is whether time forms both an A- and a B-series, or only a B-series.

The proponents of the B-view of time typically respond by arguing that even if events do not change their positions in the B-series, it does not follow that there can be no change in the B-series. This conclusion only follows if it is assumed that [[event (philosophy)|events]] are the only entities that can change. There can be change in the B-series in the form of objects bearing different properties at different times (Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 &amp; 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. as argued by: Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 &amp; 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion that the B-view of time can escape the problem by appealing to particulars that endure through time and have different properties at different times is controversial in its own right, but it is generally assumed that this is a controversy that has nothing to do with McTaggart. Instead it is treated as a separate issue, the question of whether things can endure in B-time. However, as Ingthorsson has argued, McTaggart does discuss variation in the properties of persistent entities in the 1st Volume of The Nature of Existence, and there comes to the conclusion that variation in the properties of things between times is not change but mere variation between the temporal parts of things ([https://www.academia.edu/343537/Temporal_Parity_and_the_Problem_of_Change Ingthorsson 2001]).

==The contradiction of the A-series==
Attacking the A-series, McTaggart argues that any event in the A-series is past, present, ''and'' future, which is contradictory in that each of those properties excludes the other two. McTaggart admits that the contradictory nature of the A-series may not be obvious, because it would appear that events never are simultaneously future, present, and past, but only successively so. However, there is a contradiction, he insists, because any attempt to explain why they are future, present, and past, ''at different times'' is (i) ''circular'' because we would need to describe the successive order of those "different times" again by invoking the determinations of being future, present ''or'' past, and (ii) this in turn will inevitably lead to a ''vicious infinite regress''. The [[vicious infinite regress]] arises, because to explain why the second appeal to future, present, and past, doesn't lead again to the same difficulty all over, we need to explain that they in turn apply successively and thus we must again explain that succession by appeal to future, present, and past, and there is no end to such an explanation. It is the validity of the argument in favour of a vicious infinite regress that has received the most attention in 20th Century [[philosophy of time]].

In the later version of the argument, in ''The Nature of Existence'',&lt;ref&gt;McTaggart 1927: ch. 33&lt;/ref&gt; McTaggart no longer advances the circularity objection. This is, arguably, because by then he has come to treat [[grammatical tense|tense]] as a simple and indefinable notion, and thus cannot argue that the terms need to be explained at all in order to be applied. He now instead argues that even if it is admitted that they are simple and indefinable, and thus can be applied without further analysis, they still lead to contradiction.

Philosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart's argument against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;For instance: Dummett 1960; Mellor 1981  &amp; 1998; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1992&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two of the most commonly invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Gotschalk 1930; Broad 1938: 313; Oakley 1946-7; Prior 1967: 5–6; Christensen 1974; Baldwin 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the [[semantics]] of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like "''M'' is present, has been future, and will be past" can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that ''M'' is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because "has been" and "will be" indicate that we are not talking about how ''M'' currently ''is'', but instead of how ''M'' once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to ''M'' of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987).

Ingthorsson has argued that the reason for this incommensurability between the proponents of the A- and B-views is found in the prevailing view that McTaggart's argument is a stand-alone argument. If it is read in that way, the proponents of each view will understand the argument against the background of their respective views of time, and come to incompatible conclusions (1998 &amp; 2016). Indeed, on closer scrutiny it will be found that McTaggart explicitly claims that in "The Unreality of Time" he is inquiring whether [[reality]] can have the characteristics it appears to have in experience (notably being temporal and material) given his earlier conclusions about what reality must really be like in Absolute Reality{{clarify|reason=define what Absolute Reality means in this context|date=July 2018}}. In the introduction to the 2nd Volume of ''The Nature of Existence'', he says: &lt;blockquote&gt;Starting from our conclusions ''as to the general nature of the existent, as reached in the earlier Books,'' we shall have to ask, firstly which of these characteristics can really be possessed by what is existent, and which of them, in spite of the ''primâ facie'' appearance to the contrary, cannot be possessed by anything existent (1927: sect. 295).&lt;/blockquote&gt;And he continues:&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be possible to show that, ''having regard to the general nature of the existent as previously determined'', certain characteristics, that we consider here for the first time, cannot be true of the existent (1927: sect. 298).&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Ingthorsson notes, the most central result of McTaggart's earlier inquiry into the general nature of the existent in Absolute Reality, an inquiry McTaggart claims is based entirely on a priori arguments (i.e. such as do not rely on any empirical observations), is that [[existence]] and [[reality]] coincide and have no degrees: either something exists and thus is real, or it does not. It immediately follows that for the future and past to be real, they must exist. This is why he interprets the statement "''M'' is present, has been future, and will be past" as a statement about ''M'' existing in the present bearing the property of being present, and existing in the past bearing the property of being future, and existing in the future bearing the property of being past. This interpretation of the expression, if correct, does say that ''M'' is future, present, and past, which is contradictory. However, since it starts from the premise that the future and past can only be real by existing, then it remains to show that this is what the A-view of time assumes.

==The C-series==
Having come to the conclusion that reality can neither form an A- nor a B-series, despite appearances to the contrary, then McTaggart finds it necessary to explain what the world is really like such that it appears to be different from what it appears to be. Here is where the C-series comes into play. McTaggart does not say much about the C-series in the original journal article, but in ''The Nature of Existence'' he devotes six whole chapters to discuss it (1927: Chs. 44–9).

The C-series is rarely given much attention. When it is mentioned, it is described as "an expression synonymous with 'B-series' when the latter is shorn of its temporal connotations" (Shorter 1986: 226). There is a grain of truth in this, but there is more to the C-series than this. Stripping the temporal features from the B-series only gives what the C- and B-series have ''minimally in common'', notably the constituents of the series and the formal characteristics of being linear, asymmetric, and transitive. However, the C-series has features that the B-series does not have. The constituents of the C-series are ''mental'' states (a consequence of McTaggart's argument in Ch. 34 of ''The Nature of Existence'' that reality cannot really be material), which are related to each other on the basis of their conceptual content in terms of being ''included in'' and ''inclusive of'' (1927: sect. 566 &amp; Ch. 60). These atemporal relations are meant to provide what the earlier/later than relation cannot, notably explain why an illusion of change and temporal succession can arise in an atemporal reality.

== Influence of "The Unreality of Time" ==
McTaggart's argument has had an enormous influence on the [[philosophy of time]]. His phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time has been accepted as good and true even by those who firmly deny the end conclusion that time is unreal. For instance, J. S. Findlay (1940) and A. Prior (1967) took McTaggart's phenomenological analysis as their point of departure in the development of modern [[tense logic]].

McTaggart's characterisation of the appearance of time in terms of the A- and B-series served to sharpen the contrast between the two emerging and rival views of time that we now know as the A- and B-views of time. The assumption is that the A-view, in accepting the reality of [[grammatical tense|tense]], represent time as being like an A-series, and that the B-view, in rejecting the reality of [[grammatical tense|tense]], represent time as being like a B-series.

The two objections that McTaggart develops against the conception of time as forming an A- and a B-series are still the two main objections with which the A- and B-views of time struggle. Is the A-view contradictory, and is the B-view able to incorporate an account of [[change (philosophy)|change]].

The controversy about McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time continues unabated (see, for instance, Smith 2011; Cameron 2015; Mozersky 2015; Ingthorsson 2016).

[[Image:Jan_Wildens_Landscape_with_Christ_and_his_Disciples_on_the_Road_to_Emmaus.jpg|thumb|200px|''Christ and his Disciples on the Road to Emmaus'', by Jan Wildens]]
The '''Walk to Emmaus''' or '''Emmaus Walk''' is a [[three day movement]] that came out of the Roman Catholic [[Cursillo]] Movement.  It started in the 1960s and 1970s when [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and [[Lutherans]], and [[Tres Dias]] offered Cursillo. In 1978, [[The Upper Room (United Methodist Church)|The Upper Room]] of the [[General Board of Discipleship]] of the [[United Methodist Church]] trademarked Emmaus and tried to make the Roman Catholic program into a primarily Protestant version.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upperroom.org/emmaus/whatis/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the [[Catholic Church]] Emmaus began for women in 1978, with the approval of the [[Archdiocese of Miami]]. It was developed and conducted by a team of laywomen from St. Louis Church in Kendall (Miami). Father David G. Russell, who was pastor at that time, saw the need for, and envisioned, a parish-based retreat that enabled lay women to minister to lay women. He approached the secretariat of the Cursillo movement and asked if they would allow a parish-based Cursillo to be held at St. Louis. This request was denied. Since there was no other retreat of this type available at that time, Father Russell asked the Directress of Religious Education, Myrna Gallagher, to form a team and develop one. After intense prayer and much thought, it was established that the theme of the retreat would be based on the Scripture passage found in the Gospel of Luke 24:13-35, the Emmaus Reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Myrna|title=History of Women's Emmaus Retreat|url=http://www.catholicemmausradio.org/Retreat_History.htm|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1985 Larry Barfield and Jim Loretta from St. Louis Catholic Church, along with Fr. Jim Fetcher, were discussing what kind of ministry would be good for men within the church. Catholic Cursillo offered a wonderful retreat for Catholics already on a journey, but there was nothing for Catholic men who were struggling with their walk.  The present men's club was not very active whereas the Hard Hat Ministry was very active, but not very spiritual in its goals. The group's consensus was that a ministry that would reach into the heart of the Parish and pull out those men who "came to church" but were "not involved". From this discussion, a team was formed and the first Men's Emmaus was held at the Dominican Retreat House. Eventually, one of the candidates from a previous weekend called to say they would like to have the same retreat at St. Brendan’s Catholic Church. Larry Barfield from St. Louis went to St. Brendan’s and put on the first "not at St. Louis" Men's Emmaus weekend, held at the youth center next to Mercy Hospital in Coconut Grove. Thereafter an event was held at St. John Neumann Catholic Church, and the program expanded thenceforth.  Since that time in 1986, Christian Emmaus retreats have spread throughout the entire United States, every country in Central and South America, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, and even to Shanghai, China.  A retreat was even held underground in Cuba 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barfield|first=Larry|title=History of Men's Emmaus Retreat|url=http://www.catholicemmausradio.org/Retreat_History.htm|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmaus Retreats are different from the Catholic [[Cursillo]]. Cursillo aims to form "Catholic leaders" from those Catholics already on a walk with the Lord. Emmaus reaches out to all Christians who are members of church.  Participants are encouraged to find ways to live out their individual call to discipleship in their home, church, and community.&lt;ref&gt;(cite web|url=http://emmaus.upperroom.org/about)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barfield|first=Larry|title=History of Men's Emmaus Retreat|url=http://www.catholicemmausradio.org/Retreat_History.htm|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today Emmaus retreats are held worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmaus Radio: Retreats|url=http://www.catholicemmausradio.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmaus Calendar|url=http://emmauscalendar.groupsite.com/calendar|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical reference==
The name of the movement comes from the [[Gospel of Luke]] 24:13-53 ([[King James Version]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=24&amp;version=9&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, a follower of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] named [[Cleopas]], also identified as Simon, and another unnamed traveler leave [[Jerusalem]] for the town of [[Emmaus]] on the day of Jesus' [[resurrection]]. On the journey the two travelers encounter an unnamed man who asks about the happenings over the past few days in Jerusalem concerning Jesus of Nazareth. Cleopas and his companion describe the events of that week. They tell about Jesus' trial, [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and burial. They also share that some of the women who followed Jesus discovered the tomb in which Jesus was buried empty. The unnamed man then proceeds to explain the writings of the prophet [[Moses]] concerning God's [[Messiah]] or [[Christ]].

When the three travelers reach Emmaus, they share a meal. During the blessings of the meal, it is revealed to Cleopas and his companion that the unnamed man who accompanied them is none other than Jesus whom God has raised from the dead. In that moment of recognition, Jesus disappears from their presence. Cleopas and his companion immediately return to Jerusalem to tell the other followers of Jesus that he has appeared to Simon in his resurrected, glorified body.

Luke also records that the moment of recognition of the resurrected Jesus was in the blessing and breaking of bread, a reference to the [[Passover seder]] Jesus shared with his disciples commonly known as the [[Last Supper]]. Also, it is a reference to the [[Christian]] [[sacrament]] or [[Ordinance (Christianity)|ordinance]] or act of worship known among different branches of Christianity as [[Eucharist]] or [[Holy Communion]] or [[Lord's Supper]].

{{History of printing}}

'''Woodblock printing''' (or block printing) is a technique for [[printing]] text, [[image]]s or patterns used widely throughout [[East Asia]] and originating in [[China]] in antiquity as a method of [[textile printing|printing on textiles]] and later [[paper]]. As a [[Woodblock printing on textiles|method of printing on cloth]], the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to before 220 AD. Woodblock printing existed in [[Tang China]] during the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term [[woodcut]], except for the [[#15th-century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the 15th century in India.

==Seals and stamps==
Prior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round "[[cylinder seal]]s" for rolling an impress onto [[clay tablet]]s goes back to early [[Mesopotamia]]n civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13&amp;times;13&amp;nbsp;cm) [[impression seal|stamp]]s for marking clay bricks survive from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] from around 2270 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/pre1450.html#21.1 Schoyen collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s of some length that were stamped, and [[amulet MS 5236]] may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an [[amulet]] text in the 6th&amp;nbsp;century BC.  However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of [[scaraboid seal|small stamp]]s for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of [[old master print|prints]] were often printed on [[silk]] until at least the 17th century.

==Technique==
[[File:Woodcut Press Skeen 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut press, from engraving in Early Typography by William Skeen, Colombo, Ceylon, 1872]]The wood block is carefully  prepared as a [[relief print|relief]] pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print "in reverse" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as ''[[xylography]]'', though the term is rarely used in English.

For colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.

There are three methods of printing to consider:
[[Image:Textildruckmodel - Indien um 1900.jpg|upright|thumb|Woodblock for textile printing, India, about 1900, 22&amp;times;17&amp;times;8 cm]]
; Stamping: Used for many fabrics, and most early European woodcuts (1400–40). These  items were printed by putting paper or fabric on a table or a flat surface with the block on top, and pressing, or hammering, the back of the block.
; Rubbing: Apparently the most common for Far Eastern printing. Used for European woodcuts and block-books later in the 15th century, and very widely for cloth. The block is placed face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a "hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton".&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p64-94, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Printing in a press: "Presses" only seem to have been used in Asia in relatively recent times. Simple weighted presses may have been used in Europe, but firm evidence is lacking. Later, printing-presses were used (from about 1480). A deceased Abbess of [[Mechelen]] in [[Flanders]] in 1465 had "unum instrumentum ad imprintendum scripturas et ymagines ... cum 14 aliis lapideis printis" ("an instrument for printing texts and pictures ... with 14 stones for printing") which is probably too early to be a [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]-type printing press in that location.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

In addition, ''jia xie'' is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour woodblock printing===
[[File:Hiroshige A large waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mino province: Yoro-taki'' from the series ''Views of Famous Places in the Sixty-odd Provinces'' by [[Hiroshige]], an [[ukiyo-e]] artist]]

The earliest woodblock printing known is in colour—[[China|Chinese]] [[silk]] from the [[Han dynasty]] printed in three colours.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt;
On paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s.

Colour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in [[China]] the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is ''Chengshi moyuan'' ({{zh|程氏墨苑}}), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s ''Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio'' of 1633,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shi zhu zhai shu hua pu|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-FH-00910-00083-00098/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden|''Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual'']] published in 1679 and 1701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Sickman |first2=A. |last2=Soper |title=The Art and Architecture of China |series=Pelican History of Art |edition=3rd |year=1971 |location= |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-056110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], a multi-colour technique called ''[[nishiki-e]]'' ("brocade pictures") spread more widely, and was used for prints from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting.

In both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica.

==History of woodblock printing==
[[File:Yuan dynasty woodblock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] woodblock edition of a [[China|Chinese]] play]]

===Origins in Asia===
The earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the [[Han dynasty]] (before AD 220).&lt;ref name="cave"/&gt; It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe.  The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper ([[woodcut]]s). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only, came about four hundred years after the development of [[movable type]] by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] of China, .

[[File:WoodcutBuddaChina.jpg|thumb|Coloured woodcut Buddha, 10th century, China]]

In China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of [[reprography]] since the Han Dynasty using carved stone [[stele]]s to reproduce pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berner |first=R. Thomas |title=The Ancient Chinese Process of Reprography |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=424–431 |jstor=3107128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in [[relief carving|relief]]; dye or [[ink]], which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either [[cloth]] or [[paper]], which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on [[papyrus]] seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.

A few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have been excavated from a 10th-century context in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]]. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention, but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Bulliet&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), pp. 427–438.&lt;/ref&gt; In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/6/1272/1274|title=Ashmolean − Eastern Art Online, Yousef Jameel Centre for Islamic and Asian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of printed Indian silk and [[cotton]] were exported to Europe throughout the [[Modern period]].

Because [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] has a [[character set]] running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than [[movable type]] to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |title=Fifty Wonders |publisher=Korean Hero |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904181045/http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]], requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries.&lt;ref name=christensen&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-1-introduction.htm | title=Did East Asian Printing Traditions Influence the European Renaissance? | author=Thomas Christensen | accessdate=2006-10-18 | year= 2007 | publisher = Arts of Asia Magazine (to appear) }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct "editions".

In China, [[Korea]], and [[Japan]], the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western [[printing press]] had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe.

===Early printed books in China and Korea===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, the world's earliest dated printed book, AD 868 ([[British Library]])]]

Woodblock printing in China is strongly associated with [[Buddhism]], which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book "Yuan Xian San Ji" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649).

The oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in [[Xi'an]] (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called [[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt;

Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").

The world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the [[Diamond Sutra]]. It was found in 1907 by the [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]] in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]], and is currently in the possession of the [[British Library]]. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The [[colophon (book)|colophon]], at the inner end, reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''.

[[File:Pen ts'ao, woodblock book 1249-ce.png|thumb|Finely crafted books — like the ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' shown above — were produced in China as early as the ninth century.&lt;ref name="meggs24"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meggs |first=Philip B. |title=A History of Graphic Design |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1998 |page=24 |isbn=0-471-29198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]] of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on [[scroll]]s, but [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|other book formats]] were developed. First came the ''Jingzhe zhuang'' or "sutra binding", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 "butterfly binding" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese woodblock prints===
[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Under the Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]], an [[ukiyo-e]] artist]]
{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

The earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764-770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden [[pagoda]]s containing short printed scrolls—typically {{convert|6|x|45|cm|abbr=on}}—to be distributed to temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2489]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the production of [[Buddhist]] texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-[[Japanese language|Japanese]] dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example.

Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], printing equipment&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Richard Douglas Lane |last=Lane |first=Richard |year=1978 |title=Images of the Floating World |location=Old Saybrook, CT |publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky |page=33 |isbn=1-56852-481-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army seized from [[Korea]] in 1593&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bonds of Civility: Aesthetic Networks and the Political Origins of Japanese Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KsN81J1s70kC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2005-02-28|isbn = 9780521601153|language = en|first = Eiko|last = Ikegami}}&lt;/ref&gt; had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt; using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334–1615 |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kibyōshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Bunraku|jōruri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''jōruri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.

===Diffusion in Eurasia===
The technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the [[Byzantine]] world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic [[Egypt]]. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. "In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of Modern China |edition= |last=Hsü |first=Immanuel C. Y. |year= 1970 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-501240-2 |page= 830}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after paper became available in Europe. The [[old master print|print]] in [[woodcut]], later joined by [[engraving]], quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as [[playing cards]] and other uses.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

Many early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few "single-leaf" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century.

===15th-century Europe===
[[File:BibliaPauperum.jpg|thumb|upright|Three episodes from a block-book [[Biblia Pauperum]] illustrating [[typology (theology)|typological]] correspondences between the Old and New Testaments: [[Eve]] and the serpent, the [[Annunciation]], [[Gideon]]'s miracle]]
{{Main|block book}}

Block-books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. [[Allan H. Stevenson]], by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the "heyday" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"&gt;[[#Carter|Carter]] p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan H. Stevenson, ''The Quincentennnial of Netherlandish Blockbooks'', British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 3/4 (Spring 1967), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  Block books continued to be  printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"/&gt;

The most famous block-books are the [[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]] and the [[Ars moriendi]], though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The [[Biblia pauperum]], a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (''See also:'' [[Old master print]].)

Most block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper&amp;nbsp;— if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a [[printing-press]] was used.

The method was also used extensively for printing [[playing cards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/0/p/20/ created 2003 - 2005        Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flanders (14th and 15th century)]. Retrieved 28 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development in East Asia===
[[File:Woodblock printing, Sera, 1993.JPG|thumb|Woodblock printing, [[Sera Monastery]], Tibet. The distinctive shape of the pages in the Tibetan books (called [[Pecha]]s) goes back to [[Palm leaf manuscript]]s in ancient Buddhist India]]
[[File:Woodblocks for printing, Sera monastery in Tibet.jpg|thumb|Woodblocks for printing, Sera monastery in Tibet]]

In East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press.

In countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the [[Qur'an]] were sometimes printed by [[lithography]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Zwemer/Translations/index.htm |title=Qur'an translations |publisher=Answering-islam.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Nianhua]] were a form of [[color|coloured]] woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]].

Dr. Henry, in his "Notes on the Economic Botany of China," refers to your wish to obtain specimens of the woods used in China for printing blocks. The name which the neighbouring city of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] enjoys for the excellence of its printing work has led me to inquire into the woods used there, and I am sending you specimens of them by parcel post. The wood which is considered the best is the Veng li mu, which has been identified as the [[Pyrus communis|Pyrus betulcefolia]], Bunge., and which grows in this Province. Slabs of this wood 1 ft. x 6 ins. x 1^ in. cost 150 cash, or about 5½.d. A cheaper wood generally used for printing proclamations is the tu chung mu. [[Eucommia ulmoides]], Oliv., has been determined to be the tu chung mu. The tu chung here used is a native of this Province. A wood used in [[Kiangsu]] is the yin hsing mu, which is one of the names of the Salisburia adiantifolia. Boxwood, huang yang mu, is obtained from [[Szechuen]], but only in small pieces, which are mainly used for cutting the stamps used for private seals on letters and documents. &lt;br&gt;

In the third volume of the Japanese work, the "So Mokn Sei Fu," a drawing is given of the huang yang, together with a quotation from the Chinese Materia Medica, which speaks of the tree as growing an inch a year, except in these years which have an intercalary moon, when it grows backwards. From this it would appear to be a slow growing tree.

Block printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as [[Textile|fabric]]s, [[leather]]s and [[wallpaper]]. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of [[motif (art)|motifs]] that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks). For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing [[wallpaper]] until the early 20th century, and is still used by a few traditionalist firms. It also remains in use for making cloth, mostly in small artisanal settings, for example in [[India]].

[[William Morris]] was one artist who used woodblock printing to produce patterned wallpaper and textiles during the late 19th century. Examples of Morris' work are housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The museum also holds a number of Morris' original woodblocks, which are still in limited use.

It is commonly called a form of [[Qigong]], despite the differences from other Qigong methods in Zhan zhuang's orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bluestein (2014). Research of Martial Arts.

==History==
The original Zhan zhuang were health methods used by [[Daoism|Daoists]]; in recent centuries, martial artists who already had static standing methods combined these with the internal mechanics of Zhan zhuang to create a superior exercise. The goal of Zhan zhuang in martial arts has always been to develop a martially capable body structure,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Bluestein (2014). Research of Martial Arts. Amazon CreateSpace. {{ISBN|978-1499122510}}. Pages 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; but nowadays most practitioners have again returned to a health-preservation orientation in their training, and few teach Zhan Zhuang as a martial method.

The word ''Zhan zhuang'' is the modern term; it was coined by [[Wang Xiangzhai]]. Wang, a student of [[Xing Yi Quan]], created a method of Kung Fu-based entirely upon Zhan zhuang, known as [[Yiquan]], "Intent Fist." Yiquan's method of study is Zhan zhuang plus movements that continue the feeling of the Standing Post in action.

The most common Zhan zhuang method is known as ''Hún Yuán'' (浑圆, "Completely Round," "Round Smoothness") or ''Chēng Bào'' (撑抱, "Tree Hugging" stance). This posture is entirely Daoist in its origins, has many variations, and is the main training posture in all branches of Yiquan. This practice has recently also become common practice in Taiji and Qigong schools. In Xing Yi Quan, the practice of ''Sān Tǐ Shì'' (三體勢 / 三体势, ''Heaven, Earth, and Man'') has been a root practice for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ymaa.com/articles/fundamental-moving-patterns-of-xingyiquan

Those unfamiliar with Zhan zhuang can experience severe muscle fatigue and subsequent trembling at first. Later, once sufficient stamina and strength have been developed, the practitioner can use Zhan zhuang to work on developing the sensation of "opposing forces," as well as one's central equilibrium and sensitivity to specific areas of tension in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dandjurdjevic.blogspot.co.il/2013/11/zhan-zhuang-grounding-structure.html|title=Zhan zhuang: grounding, structure, intention and qi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhan Zhuang has a strong connection with [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]. Some schools use the practice as a way of removing blockages in [[Qi]] flow. This blockage removal occurs because Zhan zhuang, when correctly practiced, has a normalizing effect on the body. Any habitual tension or tissue shortening (or lengthening) is normalized by the practice, and the body regains its natural ability to function optimally. It is thought that a normalized body will be less prone to muscular-skeletal medical conditions, and it is also believed that Zhan zhuang, when practiced for developing relaxed postures, will lead to a beneficial calming effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zhanzhuangsydney.com/?page_id=14|title=Qigong Essentials of Practice - Qigong Sydney|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wujifaliangong.blogspot.co.il/2011/10/wujifa-zhan-zhuang-relaxing-belly.html|title=Wujifa Zhan Zhuang: Relaxing the Belly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dantian|Dan Tian]] is also involved in the practice of Zhan zhuang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il/2014/07/dan-tian-in-internal-martial-arts.html|title=Dan Tian in Internal Martial Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of time spent practicing Zhan zhuang varies between styles and schools; one may spend anywhere from two minutes to two hours standing in one posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/pangen.html|title=pangen|first=Joseph|last=Crandall|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many styles, especially the [[Neijia|internal]] styles, combine Post Standing with Qigong training and other coordinated-body methods to develop [[Neijin|whole-body coordination]] for martial purposes. The martial practice is thought to strengthen the body's [[Central Nervous System]] and develop the coordination required for effective martial performance. In Yiquan, a clear distinction is made between ''health'' postures and ''martially oriented'' postures. In [[Baguazhang|Bagua Zhang]]'s circle-walking practice, the upper body is held as a Zhan zhuang posture, while the lower body is more dynamic.
