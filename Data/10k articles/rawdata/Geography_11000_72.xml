'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|i|ə}} {{Respell|AY|shee-ə}}; [[minor planet designation]] '''67 Asia''') is a bright [[asteroid]] from the [[asteroid belt]]. It was discovered by [[Norman Robert Pogson|N.R. Pogson]] on April 17, 1861, from the [[Madras Observatory]].

Pogson chose the name to refer both to [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]ess in [[Greek mythology]], and to the [[Asia|continent of Asia]], because the asteroid was the first to be discovered from that continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmadel|first=Lutz D.|title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWrB1jPCa8AC&amp;pg=PA22|year=2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-00238-3|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometry]] from the Oakley Observatory during 2006 produced a [[lightcurve]] that indicated a [[sidereal rotation period]] of {{Val|15.90|0.02}} with an [[amplitude]] of {{Val|0.26|0.04}} in magnitude.&lt;ref name=Ditteon2007/&gt; It has a 2:1 [[Commensurability (astronomy)|commensurability]] with [[Mars]], having an [[orbital period]] double that of the planet.&lt;ref name=Platsino1992/&gt;

The [[United States]] does not recognise territorial boundaries within Antarctica, so ACAN will assign names to features anywhere within the continent, in consultation with other national nomenclatural bodies where appropriate.

ACAN has a published policy on naming, based on priority of application, appropriateness, and the extent to which usage has become established.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/antex.html Policy Covering Antarctic Names]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anabar''' is a [[district]] in the [[Pacific]] [[country]] of [[Nauru]]. 

==Geography==
It is part of the [[Anabar Constituency]]. It is located in the northeast of the island, covers an area of 1.5&amp;nbsp;km² and has a population of 452 (2011).

==History==
Anabar, along with neighboring district of [[Ijuw District|Ijuw]], are believed to be the 3rd areas to submerged after Buada first and Anibare second about 3000+ years ago.

Its first inhabitants are Deiboe clans people, led by [[Deianoang District|Deianoang]], who fled to save his family of three daughters, from the raging war of Atemor's open field between Eamwit clans men off Anuquoge village and his clan, the [[Deiboe people]] from [[Ganokoro]].

[[Irutsi]] clan was born amongst the rocky regions of Abodeatsi where three men slaves and two slave women met during a month-long hide amidst the rocky region, who five slave people later intermarried each other to expand the population along the rocky regions of Anabar.

Anabar's pond 'Tibinor' was the deepest pond on the island. Such legends like the ones of 'Amwieob' originated in Anabar.

Like [[Buada District|Buada]], Anabar had its own dialect, a way of speaking which the natives refer to as the "Kin'nir", nothing similar to the "E'koro" language in the Arenibok village.

==Notable people==
*[[Ludwig Scotty]], [[President of Nauru]] in 2003, and from 2004 to 2007, represented Anabar in [[Parliament of Nauru]].

The '''Caspian Hyrcanian Mixed Forests''' [[ecoregion]], in the [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]], is an area of lush lowland and montane forests covering about {{convert|55000|km2|mi2}} near the southern shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The forest is named after the ancient region of [[Hyrcania]] (''"wolf land"'').

==Setting==
In [[Iran]], this [[ecoregion]] includes the coast along the Caspian Sea and the northern slopes of the [[Alborz|Alborz Mountains]]. It covers parts of five provinces of Iran from east to west including: [[North Khorasan Province]], [[Golestan Province]] (entirely southern and southwestern areas as well as parts of the eastern regions of the Gorgan plain, totaling an area of {{convert|421373|ha|acre}}), [[Mazandaran Province]], [[Gilan Province]] and [[Ardabil Province]]. The total [[wood]] production from these forests is estimated at {{convert|269022|m3|ft3}}. [[Golestan National Park]] and Shastkolateh forest watershed are located in Golestan Province), [[Mazandaran Province]] (the total area of the Hyrcanian forest is estimated at {{convert|965000|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. From these forests, {{convert|487195|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are used commercially, {{convert|184000|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are protected and the rest are regarded as forest lands or over-used forests. The total of the forest woods used in this province is estimated at {{convert|770551|m3|ft3}}. The Kojoor, Dohezar and Sehezar forest watersheds are located in Mazandaran province), [[Gilan province]] (these forests are graded from 1 to 3 with an area of {{convert|107894|ha|acre|abbr=on}}; {{convert|182758|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and {{convert|211972|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, respectively. The commercial utilization is {{convert|184202|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} and the non-commercial utilization is {{convert|126173|m3|ft3|abbr=on}}. Masooleh, Ghaleh Roodkhan and Astara forest watersheds are located in Gilan province) and [[Ardabil Province]]. At higher elevations to the south, the ecoregion grades into the [[Elburz Range forest steppe]] ecoregion.

In southeast [[Azerbaijan]], this ecoregion includes the [[Lankaran Lowland]] and the [[Talysh Mountains]].

The ecoregion’s climate is [[humid subtropical]], in middle altitude locations, [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and in the mountains, [[humid continental]] with most precipitation occurring in fall, winter, and spring. The [[Alborz]] mountain range is the highest mountain range in the [[Middle East]] which captures the moisture of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|900|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the east to {{convert|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the west, making this ecoregion much lusher than the desert, semi-desert, and steppe ecoregions on its borders.

[[File:Ghaleye Rud Khan (40) 4.jpg|left|thumb|Broadleaf deciduous forest in [[Gīlān Province]], [[Iran]]]]
The natural forest vegetation is temperate [[deciduous]] [[broadleaved]] forest. 32.7 percent of volume of Hyrcanian forest is of Oriental Beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]''). A main feature of the region is the lack of [[conifer]]s; only relics of coniferous species are present, which include European yew (''[[Taxus baccata]]''), Junipers (''[[Juniperus]]'' spp.), Mediterranean Cypress (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'' var. ''horzontalis'') and Chinese Arborvitae (''[[Platycladus orientalis]]'').

The Caspian Sea coastal plains were once covered by Chestnut-leaved Oak (''[[Quercus castaneifolia]]''), European Box (''[[Buxus sempervirens]]''), Black Alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]] ''subsp.'' barbata''), Caucasian Alder (''[[Alnus subcordata]]''), Caspian Poplar (''[[Populus caspica]]'') and Caucasian Wingnut (''[[Pterocarya fraxinifolia]]''), but these forests have been almost entirely converted to urban and agricultural land. (Mosadegh, 2000; Marvie Mohadjer, 2007)

The lower slopes of [[Talysh Mountains|Talysh]] and Alborz Mountains below {{convert|700|m|ft}} harbor diverse humid forests containing Chestnut-leaved Oak, European Hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''), Persian Ironwood (''[[Parrotia persica]]''), Caucasian Zelkova (''[[Zelkova carpinifolia]]''), Persian Silk Tree (''[[Albizia julibrissin]]''), and Date-plum (''[[Diospyros lotus]]'') along with shrubs holly (''[[Ilex]] hyrcana''), ''[[Ruscus]] hyrcanus'', ''Danaë racemosa'' and ''[[Atropa pallidiflora]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rechinger, Karl Heinz and Schönbeck-Temesy, Eva 1972. Solanaceae. Nº 100, 102 pp. - a fascicle of Flora Iranica: Flora des iranischen Hochlandes und der umrahmenden Gebirge; Persien, Afghanistan, Teile von West-Pakistan, Nord-Iraq, Azerbaidjan, Turkmenistan (Translation: 'Flora Iranica: Flora of the Iranian Highlands and the adjoining mountain ranges; Iran, Afghanistan, parts of Western Pakistan, Northern Iraq, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan').&lt;/ref&gt; and lianas ''[[Smilax]] excelsa'' and ''[[Hedera pastuchovii]]''&lt;ref name="WWF Full"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|id=pa0407|name=Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Mosadegh, 2000; Marvie Mohadjer, 2007). Persian Ironwood is endemic to the Talysh Mountains and northern Iran and nearly pure stands of the tree can be particularly dramatic, with lichen-covered branches twisting together and only dead leaves in the deep shade of the forest floor. In addition, the ironwood's yellow leaves turn a faint lilac in the fall.&lt;ref name="mobot Azerbaijan"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|url=http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/russia/azerbaijan.shtml|title=Ornamental plants from Azerbaijan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At middle elevations between {{convert|700|and|1500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, Oriental Beech is the dominant tree species in this cloudy zone in pure and mixed stands with other noble [[hardwood]]s such as Chestnut-leaved Oak, Caucasian Oak (''[[Quercus macranthera]]''), European Hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''), Oriental Hornbeam (''[[Carpinus orientalis|C. orientalis]]'') and Sweet Chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]'').&lt;ref name="CEPF"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Conservation International |url=http://www.cepf.net/xp/cepf/where_we_work/caucasus/full_strategy.xml |title=Ecosystem Profile: Caucasus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725052824/http://www.cepf.net/xp/cepf/where_we_work/caucasus/full_strategy.xml |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From its floristic composition, these beech forests are linked with [[Europe]]an forests and with affinities to the beech forests of the [[Balkans]]. However, local conditions of [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] and [[edaphic]] factors, such as [[soil]] moisture and depth, are all of importance in determining the composition of the vegetation, which leads to the establishment of different beech subcommunities. (Mosadegh, 2000; Marvie Mohadjer, 2007)

Upper mountain and subalpine zones are characterized by Caucasian Oak, Oriental Hornbeam, [[shrubland]]s and [[steppe]]s. [[Alpine tundra]] and meadows occur at the highest elevations.

Other native tree species include Caspian Locust (''[[Gleditsia caspica]]''), Velvet Maple (''[[Acer velutinum]]''), Cappadocian Maple (''[[Acer cappadocicum]]''), European Ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''), Wych Elm (''[[Ulmus glabra]]''), Wild Cherry (''[[Prunus avium]]''), Wild Service Tree (''[[Sorbus torminalis]]'') and lime tree (''[[Tilia platyphyllos]]'').

==Fauna==
The Caspian tiger (''[[Panthera tigris virgata]]'') once roamed these mountains, but is now extinct. Other large mammals here are the Caucasus leopard (''[[Persian leopard|Panthera pardus]] ciscaucasica''), lynx (''[[Lynx lynx]]''), brown bear (''[[Ursus arctos]]''), wild boar (''[[Sus scrofa]]''), wolf (''[[Canis lupus]]''), golden jackal (''[[Canis aureus]]''), jungle cat (''[[Felis chaus]]''), badger (''[[Meles meles]]''), and otter (''[[Lutra lutra]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF Full"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geptner1972"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Heptner, V.

This ecoregion is an important resting area for birds migrating between [[Russia]] and [[Africa]] and is thus a key habitat for many bird species.  Some outstanding birds that can be found here are the greylag goose (''[[Anser anser]]''), white-fronted goose (''[[Anser albifrons]]''), Little bustard (''[[Tetrax tetrax]]''), glossy ibis (''[[Plegadis falcinellus]]''), Eurasian spoonbill (''[[Platalea leucorodia]]''), night heron (''[[Nycticorax nycticorax]]''), red-breasted goose (''[[Branta ruficollis]]''), peregrine falcon (''[[Falco peregrinus]]''), Dalmatian pelican (''[[Pelecanus crispus]]''), Western cattle egret (''[[Bubulcus ibis]]''), squacco heron (''[[Ardeola ralloides]]''), greater flamingo (''[[Phoenicopterus roseus]]''), white-headed duck (''[[Oxyura leucocephala]]''), and Caspian snowcock (''[[Tetraogallus caspius]]'').&lt;ref name="WWF Full"/&gt;

==Protected areas==
The diversity and endemism of the species represented in the ecoregion make it an important area for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/g200/g078.html|title=Caucasus-Anatolian-Hyrcanian Temperate Forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The habitats in this ecoregion are threatened by conversion into tea, vegetable, fruit, and vine plantations, unsustainable forestry and poaching.

[[Image:C-front2x.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cemetery of the Lost Cemeteries in [[Gdańsk]]]]
The monument commemorates the necropolis which no longer exists in the city of [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]].

It is dedicated to the citizens of [[Gdańsk]] who were once buried in one of the city’s 27 graveyards either destroyed during World War II or bulldozed on purpose after the end of the war. 

The monument was designed to resemble a temple. 

The main memorial is surrounded by broken gravestones representing all faiths, and includes a poem by the Jewish poet [[Mascha Kaléko]] (1912–1975), whose poetry was burned on the direct orders of Hitler in May 1933. 

==Project Designers==
The designers of the project are:
*Hanna Klementowska, [[Jacek Krenz]] 
*Design Team: [[Katarzyna Krenz|Katarzyna Bogucka-Krenz]], Michał Krenz, Andrzej Wójcicki,  
*Sculptors: Zygfryd Korpalski, Witold Głuchowski 
*Funded by: the Gdańsk City Hall in 2002

It is located at 3 Maja Street in the park between the Church of Corpus Christi and the bus station.

==Stone and light, the symbolic meaning==
The layout of the Cemetery of the Lost Cemeteries echoes a temple interior. The colonnade of trees creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the main nave and side aisles. The stone columns are in the shape of trunks, symbolizing withered trees long since dead, but thanks to the light which pervades from within are brought back to life. The granite slab placed on a foundation of broken fragments of gravestones forms both a sacrificial altar and a symbolic tomb. The inscription which is engraved around the granite comes from a poem by [[Mascha Kaléko]] whose volumes of poetry were among the books burnt on the pyre in May 1933 on Hitler’s orders. Thus, from the ashes these poetic words will now speak again chiseled in stone to last. The lights set within the granite altar project upwards leading our thoughts to transcendence and thus binding the many burial places of various faiths into one metaphysical unity. These columns of light represent the firm faith of the people and seen within the light wisps of smoke from the votive candles remind us at the same time of the fragility of human life. Behind the altar there is a hedge cut into the shape of a semicircular apse which provides a final screen to this natural sanctuary. In the middle of the hedge there is an opening behind which we can see a wall of whitened stone - a symbolic passage for the dead who proceed towards eternity. 

==The Living Memory==
The Cemetery of the Lost Cemeteries is meant to be a place of our common prayer commemorating all those generations who have lived and died in [[Gdańsk]] before us and whose place of burial no longer exists. It is a peaceful place for silent reflection, unifying all people regardless of their social status, race, nationality or religious adherence. Here the citizens of our town may ponder in peace the fate of their forefathers. Here they also may place the few remaining fragments which have been retrieved from the cemeteries which no longer exist. 

Thanks to the memories of individuals who will visit this place we will be able to recreate in our hearts a symbolic map of the common past of our town which - thanks to its close proximity to the sea and rich trading links - has always been the home to people of many different faith and nations.

A '''defoliant''' is any [[Herbicide|herbicidal]] chemical sprayed or dusted on plants to cause their [[Leaf|leaves]] to fall off. Defoliants are widely used for the selective removal of weeds in managing croplands and lawns. Worldwide use of defoliants, along with the development of other herbicides and [[Pesticide|pesticides]], allowed for the [[Green Revolution]], an increase in agricultural production in mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invention of Ecocide|last=Zierler|first=David|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2011|isbn=9786613110404|location=Athens, Georgia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defoliants have also been used in warfare as a means to deprive an enemy of food crops and/or hiding cover, most notably by the [[United States]] [[Agent Orange|in the Vietnam War]].

== Use and application ==
A primary application of defoliants is the selective killing of plants. Two of the oldest chemical [[Herbicide|herbicides]] used as defoliants are [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T). 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T are absorbed by broad-leafed plants, killing them by causing excessive hormonal growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These [[Phenoxy herbicide|phenoxy herbicides]] were designed to selectively kill weeds and unwanted plants in croplands. They were first introduced at the beginning of [[World War II]] and became widespread in use in agriculture following the end of the War.

Defoliants have a practical use in the harvesting of certain crops, particularly [[cotton]], in the [[United States]] as well as a number of other cotton-producing countries. The use of defoliants aids in the effective harvesting of cotton and finer lint quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snipes|first=Charles E.|last2=Cathey|first2=George W.|date=1992|title=Evaluation of defoliant mixtures in cotton|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0378429092900185|journal=Field Crops Research|volume=28|issue=4|pages=327–334|doi=10.1016/0378-4290(92)90018-5|issn=0378-4290|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of defoliant use in cotton harvesting depends on the type of defoliant(s) used, the number of applications, the amount applied, and environmental variables. Common harvest-aiding chemical defoliants include tribufos, dimethipin, and [[thidiazuron]]. According to a 1998 report by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] (NASS), tribufos and thidiazuron accounted for 60% of crop area that was treated by defoliants during that crop year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potter|first=Thomas L.|last2=Marti|first2=Luz|last3=Belflower|first3=Sally|last4=Truman|first4=Clint C.|date=2000|title=Multiresidue Analysis of Cotton Defoliant, Herbicide, and Insecticide Residues in Water by Solid-Phase Extraction and GC−NPD, GC−MS, and HPLC−Diode Array Detection|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf9909104|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=4103–4108|doi=10.1021/jf9909104|issn=0021-8561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NASS (1999).

In 1998, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (U.S. EPA) concluded that the use of agricultural defoliants led to increased risks of water contamination and dangers to freshwater and [[marine life]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; High doses of tribufos were labeled as a possible [[carcinogen]] and a toxin to freshwater and marine [[Invertebrate|invertebrates]]. Dimethipin has also been labeled as a possible human carcinogen.

A published study in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'' reported that through successive [[surface runoff]] events in defoliated cotton fields, defoliant concentrations decreased exponentially within the test area and could negatively affect marine life in the runoff zones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A '''digital elevation model''' ('''DEM''') is a [[3D computer graphics|3D CG]] [[3D modeling|representation]] of a [[terrain]]'s surface – commonly of a [[planet]] (e.g. [[Earth]]), [[moon]], or [[asteroid]] – created from a terrain's [[elevation]] data. A "global DEM" refers to a  [[Discrete Global Grid]].

== Terminology ==
There is no universal usage of the terms ''digital elevation model'' (DEM), ''digital terrain model'' (DTM) and ''digital surface model'' (DSM) in scientific literature. In most cases the term ''digital surface model'' represents the earth's surface and includes all objects on it. In contrast to a DSM, the ''digital terrain model'' (DTM) represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and buildings (see the figure on the right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intermap Digital Surface Model: accurate, seamless, wide-area surface models |url=http://www.intermap.com/en-us/nextmap/digitalsurfacemodel.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170504/http://www.intermap.com/en-us/nextmap/digitalsurfacemodel.aspx |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Z., Zhu, Q. and Gold, C. (2005): title=Digital terrain modeling: principles and methodology|. CRC Press. Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:DTM DSM.svg|thumb|Surfaces represented by a Digital Surface Model include buildings and other objects. Digital Terrain Models represent the bare ground.]]

DEM is often used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs,&lt;ref name=Hirt2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=C.|title=Digital Terrain Models.|journal=Encyclopedia of Geodesy |pages=1–6|isbn=  978-3-319-01868-3|url=http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au:80/R?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;local_base=gen01-era02&amp;object_id=227150|accessdate=February 10, 2016|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02370-0_31-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; only representing height information without any further definition about the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Peckham, Robert Joseph; Jordan, Gyozo (Eds.)(2007):  Development and Applications in a Policy Support Environment Series: Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography.  Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other definitions equalise the terms DEM and DTM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Podobnikar |first=Tomaz |year=2008 |title=Methods for visual quality assessment of a digital terrain model |journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S |volume=1 |issue=2 |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index738.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;, equalise the terms DEM and DSM &lt;ref&gt;Adrian W.

Most of the data providers ([[USGS]], [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ERSDAC]], [[CGIAR]], [[Spot Image]]) use the term DEM as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs. All datasets which are captured with satellites, airplanes or other flying platforms are originally DSMs (like [[SRTM]] or the [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER GDEM]]). It is possible to compute a DTM from high resolution DSM datasets with complex algorithms (Li ''et al.'', 2005).
In the following, the term DEM is used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs.

==Types of DEM==
[[Image:srtm ramp2.world.21600x10800.jpg|thumb|Heightmap of Earth's surface (including water and ice) in [[equirectangular projection]], normalized as 8-bit grayscale, where lighter values indicate higher elevation]]
A DEM can be represented as a raster (a grid of squares, also known as a [[heightmap]] when representing elevation) or as a vector-based [[triangular irregular network]] (TIN). The TIN DEM dataset is also referred to as a primary (measured) DEM, whereas the Raster DEM is referred to as a secondary (computed) DEM.&lt;ref&gt;RONALD TOPPE (1987): [http://hydrologie.org/redbooks/a162/iahs_162_0629.pdf Terrain models — A tool for natural hazard Mapping]. In: Avalanche Formation, Movement and Effects (Proceedings of the Davos Symposium, September 1986). IAHS Publ. no. 162,1987
&lt;/ref&gt;  The DEM could be acquired through techniques such as [[photogrammetry]], [[lidar]], [[IFSAR|IfSAR]], [[land surveying]], etc. (Li et al. 2005). DEMs are commonly built using data collected using remote sensing techniques, but they may also be built from land surveying. DEMs are used often in geographic information systems, and are the most common basis for digitally produced relief maps. While a DSM may be useful for landscape modeling, city modeling and visualization applications, a DTM is often required for flood or drainage modeling, land-use studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racurs.ru/www_download/articles/Balenovic.pdf I.

Mappers may prepare digital elevation models in a number of ways, but they frequently use [[remote sensing]] rather than direct [[Surveying|survey]] data. One powerful technique for generating digital elevation models is [[interferometric synthetic aperture radar]] where two passes of a radar satellite (such as [[RADARSAT-1]] or [[TerraSAR-X]] or [[Cosmo SkyMed]]), or a single pass if the satellite is equipped with two antennas (like the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] instrumentation), collect sufficient data to generate a digital elevation map tens of kilometers on a side with a resolution of around ten meters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligence-airbusds.com/worlddem/|title=WorldDEM(TM): Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.intelligence-airbusds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other kinds of [[stereoscopic]] pairs can be employed using the [[digital image correlation]] method, where two optical images are acquired with different angles taken from the same pass of an airplane or an [[Earth Observation Satellite]] (such as the HRS instrument of [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT5]] or the [[VNIR]] band of [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]]).&lt;ref name=Nikolakopoulous&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolakopoulos |first1=K. G. |last2=Kamaratakis |first2=E. K |last3=Chrysoulakis |first3=N. |date=10 November 2006 |title=SRTM vs ASTER elevation products.

The [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT 1 satellite]] (1986) provided the first usable elevation data for a sizeable portion of the planet's landmass, using two-pass stereoscopic correlation. Later, further data were provided by the [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite]] (ERS, 1991) using the same method, the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM, 2000) using single-pass SAR and the [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer]] (ASTER, 2000) instrumentation on the [[Terra satellite]] using double-pass stereo pairs.&lt;ref name=Nikolakopoulous/&gt;

The HRS instrument on SPOT 5 has acquired over 100 million square kilometers of stereo pairs.

Older methods of generating DEMs often involve [[interpolation|interpolating]] digital contour maps that may have been produced by direct survey of the land surface. This method is still used in [[mountain]] areas, where [[interferometry]] is not always satisfactory. Note that [[contour line]] data or any other sampled elevation datasets (by GPS or ground survey) are not DEMs, but may be considered digital terrain models. A DEM implies that elevation is available continuously at each location in the study area.

The quality of a DEM is a measure of how accurate elevation is at each pixel (absolute accuracy) and how accurately is the morphology presented (relative accuracy). Several factors play an important role for quality of DEM-derived products: 
*terrain roughness;
*sampling density (elevation data collection method);
*grid resolution or [[pixel]] size;
*[[interpolation]] algorithm;
*vertical resolution;
*terrain analysis algorithm;
*Reference 3D products include quality masks that give information on the coastline, lake, snow, clouds, correlation etc.

==Sources==
A free DEM of the whole world called [[GTOPO30]] (30 [[arcsecond]] [[Angular resolution|resolution]], approx. 1&amp;nbsp;[[km]]  along the equator ) is available, but its quality is variable and in some areas it is very poor. A much higher quality DEM from the [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer]] (ASTER) instrument of the [[Terra satellite]] is also freely available for 99% of the globe, and represents elevation at 30 [[meter]] resolution. A similarly high resolution was previously only available for the [[United States territory]] under the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM) data, while most of the rest of the planet was only covered in a 3&amp;nbsp;arc-second resolution (around 90&amp;nbsp;meters  along the equator). SRTM does not cover the polar regions and has mountain and desert no data (void) areas. SRTM data, being derived from radar, represents the elevation of the first-reflected surface &amp;mdash; quite often tree tops.  So, the data are not necessarily representative of the ground surface, but the top of whatever is first encountered by the radar.

Submarine elevation (known as [[bathymetry]]) data is generated using ship-mounted [[depth sounding]]s. When land topography and bathymetry is combined, a truly [[Global Relief Model]]  is obtained.   The SRTM30Plus dataset (used in [[NASA World Wind]]) attempts to combine GTOPO30, SRTM and bathymetric data to produce a truly global elevation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrainmap.com/downloads/Gamache_final_web.pdf|title=Martin Gamache's paper on free sources of global data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Earth2014 global topography and relief model &lt;ref name=HirtRexer2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=C.|last2=Rexer|first2=M.|title=Earth2014: 1 arc-min shape, topography, bedrock and ice-sheet models - available as gridded data and degree-10,800 spherical harmonics|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|volume=39|pages=103–112|url=http://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/models/Earth2014/Hirt_Rexer2015_Earth2014.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides layered topography grids at 1 arc-minute resolution. Other than SRTM30plus, Earth2014 provides information on ice-sheet heights and bedrock (that is, topography below the ice) over Antarctica and Greenland. Another global model is Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) with 7.5 arc second resolution. It is based on SRTM data and combines other data outside SRTM coverage. A novel global DEM of postings lower than 12&amp;nbsp;m and a height accuracy of less than 2&amp;nbsp;m is expected from the [[TanDEM-X]] satellite mission which started in July 2010.

The most common grid (raster) spacing is between 50 and 500&amp;nbsp;meters. In gravimetry e.g., the primary grid may be 50&amp;nbsp;m, but is switched to 100 or 500&amp;nbsp;meters in distances of about 5 or 10 kilometers.

Since 2002, the HRS instrument on SPOT 5 has acquired over 100 million square kilometers of stereo pairs used to produce a DTED2  format DEM (with a 30-meter posting) DEM format DTED2 over 50 million km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/66-geo-elevation-and-dem|title=GEO Elevation Services : Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.astrium-geo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radar satellite [[RADARSAT-2]] has been used by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.]] to provide DEMs for commercial and military customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.mdacorporation.com/Mapping/DigitalElevationModels.aspx|title=International - Geospatial|website=gs.mdacorporation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, acquisitions from radar satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X will be available in the form of a uniform global coverage with a resolution of 12&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/terrasar-x/|title=TerraSAR-X : Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.astrium-geo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALOS provides since 2016 a global 1-arc second DSM free of charge &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/aw3d30/|title=ALOS World 3D - 30m|website=www.eorc.jaxa.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a commercial 5 meter DSM/DTM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aw3d.jp/en/products/|title=ALOS World 3D|website=www.aw3d.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many national mapping agencies produce their own DEMs, often of a higher resolution and quality, but frequently these have to be purchased, and the cost is usually prohibitive to all except public authorities and large corporations. DEMs are often a product of [[national lidar dataset]] programs.

Free DEMs are also available for [[Mars]]: the MEGDR, or Mission Experiment Gridded Data Record, from the [[Mars Global Surveyor]]'s Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument; and NASA's Mars Digital Terrain Model (DTM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~somalley/DemTutorial/#DEM|title=A basic guide for using Digital Elevation Models with Terragen|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519135415/http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~somalley/DemTutorial/#DEM|archivedate=2007-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dwarfing''' is a process in which a [[breed]] of animals or [[cultivar]] of plants is changed to become significantly smaller than standard members of their species. The effect can be induced through human intervention or non-human processes, and can include genetic, nutritional or hormonal means.  Used most specifically, dwarfing includes pathogenic changes in the structure of an organism (for example, the bulldog, a genetically [[achondroplastic]] dog breed), in contrast to non-pathogenic proportional reduction in stature (such as the [[whippet]], a small greyhound dog breed).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K.A. and Watson, A. D. J. "Skeletal Disorders" Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine, 5th Ed. Saunders(2000) Philedephia Vol 2 pg 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
In animals, including humans, dwarfism has been described in several ways. Shortened stature can result from [[growth hormone deficiency]], [[starvation]], [[portal systemic shunts]], [[renal disease]], [[hypothyroidism]] [[diabetes mellitus]] and other conditions.  Any of these conditions can be established in a population through [[genetic engineering]], [[selective breeding]], or [[insular dwarfism]], or some combination of the above.

Dwarfing can produce more practical breeds that can fit in small accommodations, or may appeal aesthetically, as well as other associated side effects.  Smaller stature may be a deliberate goal of breeding programs, or it may be a side effect of other breeding goals.

===Nonpurposeful dwarfing===

In some husbandry conditions, humans created dwarf breeds, or allowed them to develop, without specifically selecting for smaller animals.  It is likely that the [[Shetland sheep]] breed, Shetland collie breed of dogs, and various pony breeds of horses developed in this manner.  In the case of the Shetland sheep and collies, it is likely that environmental conditions, such as a lack of abundant fodder, led to farmers selecting smaller animals who continued to reproduce on limited food over larger animals who did not reproduce well on limited diets.  In this case, the emphasis was on selecting for survival and reproduction, not size.

===Purposeful dwarfing===

Humans have encouraged the deliberate development of dwarf breeds of many domestic animals, including horses, cattle, dogs, and chickens.  Some have been breeds of smaller animals that were not originally selected for size, but are now held to specific sizes by a breed standard. In many cases, the exact physiological mechanism that alters the growth of individuals in that breed is not well known, and some breeds have multiple mechanisms at play.

As the genetic mutations that cause dwarfing occur in many species, dwarf animals can be the offspring of normal-appearing animals.  Even in breeds which have not been selected for dwarfing, some genetic lines may show a tendency to produce dwarfs, which may be encouraged by deliberate breeding.  This often takes the form of in-breeding to concentrate recessive genes, and can result in other genetic abnormalities being established in the population.

Some animal breeds that have been formally subject to dwarfing include:

* Rabbits ([[American Fuzzy Lop]], [[Britannia Petite]](US), [[Dwarf Hotot]], [[Florida White Rabbit]], [[Jersey Wooly]], [[Lionhead rabbit|Lionhead]] [[Polish rabbit|Polish]] (UK), [[Holland Lop]] [[Netherland Dwarf]], [[Mini Rex]], [[Mini Satin]], others)
* Dogs ([[English Bulldog]], [[French Bulldog]], [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], [[Corgi (disambiguation)|Corgi]], [[Whippet]], [[Miniature Pinscher]], others)
* Poultry (Bantum chickens, Call Ducks)
* Goats ([[Nigerian Dwarf (goat)|Nigerian Dwarf]], [[Pygmy Goat]])
* Cattle (Dwarf Brahman, [[Lowline cattle]] Guinea Cracker Cattle, [[Dexter cattle]])
* Equines (Miniature Donkey, [[Fell Pony]], [[Hackney Pony]] [[Miniature horse]], [[Shetland Pony]], others)

As with animals, plants can be dwarfed through [[genetic engineering]] and [[selective breeding]], but can also undergo natural, morphological changes to acclimatize to environmental stresses such as soil quality,&lt;ref name=hut1994&gt;Hutchings, M.

Plants dwarfed due to environmental stress are said to be "[[stunt (botany)|stunted]]." The majority of dwarfing in plants occurs not from the damage environmental stresses inflict on them, but instead by hormones produced in response to the stress.&lt;ref name="zhatur08"&gt;Zhang, Y.; Turner, J.

===Dwarfing trees===

In [[horticulture]], dwarfing can be considered a desirable characteristic in modern [[orchard]]s. This kind of dwarfing can be attained through [[selective breeding]], [[genetic engineering]], or more often, scions are [[grafting|graft]]ed on to dwarfing rootstocks.&lt;ref&gt;http://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/story.php?S_No=975&amp;storyType=garde&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all modern [[apple]]s in commercial use are propagated as dwarf or semi-dwarf trees for ease of picking and spraying.

Dwarfing fruit trees acts through a reduction in the nutrients which travel from the roots through the trunk to the leaves and buds.  Many commercial orchards of various species use this technique to improve the overall health and productivity of the individual trees.  An individual tree may be made up of three or more separate cultivars - one for the root system, which is generally selected for good stability and resistance to soil-borne diseases, one for the trunk, which modifies the overall height of the tree, and one for the productive limbs and buds, which actually produces the fruit.  Frequently, the root system stock is the most resistant to cold damage - both by natural selection and by protection from the cold air by the earth.  When frost severely damages a tree, the more productive branch and bud cultivar may be killed off, leaving the root to sprout new stalks.  In the case of oranges and other citrus, this results in sweet orange trees being frozen back so that the more hardy, cold-tolerant sour orange rootstock puts out new growth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Dwarfing grains===

Dwarfing genes are widely used in creating more productive food plants, such as grains. One condition that results in loss of grain crops is called 'lodging', where heavy ears of almost ripe grain bend the stalk until the grain touches the ground, becomes wet, and spoils. During the [[Green Revolution]], research that identified wheat reduced-height genes (''Rht'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appleford NE |title=Decreased shoot stature and grain alpha-amylase activity following ectopic expression of a gibberellin 2-oxidase gene in transgenic wheat |journal=J.

{{Fantasy}}
A '''fantasy world''' is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games.  Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', pp. 166–7, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, either a [[historical]] or [[futuristic]] theme. Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

The '''Fraser Tombs''' are a [[necropolis]] located {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Al Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]], [[Upper Egypt]].

These tombs were first discovered in the fall of 1853 by the German Egyptologist [[Heinrich Brugsch]] and first described by the British civil engineer [[George Willoughby Fraser]], whose name was given to these tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Warren R. Dawson, Eric P. Uphill: ''Who was who in Egyptology.'' 3rd revised edition, by Morris L. Bierbrier. The Egypt Exploration Society, London 1995, {{ISBN|0-85698-125-7}}, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tombs belong to a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long necropolis of the ancient town of Mer-nefer(et) (also Per-Imen-mAt-chent(j), TA-dehenet, or [[Akoris, Egypt|Akoris]]). The tomb owners were stewards of the royal estate. In the fifth dynasty, they were [[Hathor]] priests and there is a temple to Hathor nearby.&lt;ref name="GoogleEarthVideo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geens|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Ruins of Akoris|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xioApGEPvFU|website=360cities / Youtube|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the fifteen (numbered) tombs contain statues and carved [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] dating from the Old Kingdom. The most important of the sepulchres is the second tomb which is probably the tomb of Ni-ankh-kay (Neka-Ankh), which has the shape of a [[mastaba]]. The decoration of the small and long offering room consists of statues of his family.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaofArcheologyofEgypt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=I.

The Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt says there are many tombs and ancient ruins in [[Tihna el-Gebel]] which are available to the public. The Fraser Tombs are open to the public but are rarely visited by tourists, perhaps because the only way to reach it is by taxi with a police escort, due to heightened security in the area.&lt;ref name="Tuna"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tuna el-Gebel|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SITE_Tuna.htm|website=Supreme Council of Antiquities Egypt|accessdate=22 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013171540/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SITE_Tuna.htm|archivedate=13 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeniMazar"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Beni Mazar, Egypt|url=http://www.ask-aladdin.com/Egypt_cities/City-of-Beni-Mazar.html|website=Ask Aladdin|accessdate=22 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022091528/http://www.ask-aladdin.com/Egypt_cities/City-of-Beni-Mazar.html|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An excellent video of the exterior of the area is a [[YouTube|360° video]] available and narrated on Youtube, and available as virtual reality on [[Google Cardboard]], Google's virtual reality platform.

'''Freeden Bank''' ({{coord|76|20|S|28|50|W}}) is a [[submarine bank]] named for [[Wilhelm von Freeden]], the founder of the [[Norddeutsche Seewarte]], the forerunner of the [[German Hydrographic Office]].

'''Germany''' is a country in [[Western Europe|west]]-[[central Europe]], that stretches from the [[Alps]], across the [[North European Plain]] to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. [[Germany]] has the second largest population in Europe (after the [[Europe]]an part of [[Russia]]) and is [[Area and population of European countries#Area|seventh largest in area]]. The territory of Germany covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and  {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of waters.

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the northwest and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the northeast. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Neuendorf-Sachsenbande]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1}} below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major [[river]]s such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Germany |work=CIA World Factbook |date=November 14, 2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930072310/https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html |archivedate=September 30, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany shares borders with nine European countries, second only to Russia: [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Switzerland]] (its only non-[[European Union|EU]] neighbor) and [[Austria]] in the south, [[France]] in the southwest and [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the west.

==Area==
Germany is in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe|Central]] [[Europe]], bordering [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west, and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] (the tip of [[Sylt]] is just north of 55°), and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. The territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water. It is the seventh largest country by area in Europe and the 63rd largest in the world.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;

==Physical geography==
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|left||Topographic map of Germany]]

The northern third of the country lies in the [[North European Plain]], with flat terrain crossed by northward-flowing watercourses ([[Elbe]], [[Ems (river)|Ems]], [[Weser]], [[Oder]]). [[Wetlands]] and marshy conditions are found close to the Dutch border and along the [[Frisia]]n coast. Sandy [[Mecklenburg]] in the northeast has many glacier-formed [[Mecklenburg Lake District|lakes]] dating to the [[last glacial period]].

Moving south, central Germany features rough and somewhat patternless hilly and mountainous countryside, some of it formed by ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.  The [[Rhine]] valley cuts through the western part of this region. The central uplands continue east and north as far as the [[Saale]] and merge with the [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] on the border with the [[Czech Republic]].  Upland regions include the [[Eifel]], [[Hunsrück]] and [[Palatine Forest]] west of the Rhine, the [[Taunus]] hills north of [[Frankfurt]], the [[Vogelsberg]] massif, the [[Rhön]], and the [[Thüringer Wald]].  South of [[Berlin]], the east-central part of the country is more like the low northern areas, with sandy soil and river wetlands such as the [[Spreewald]] region.

Southern Germany's landforms are defined by various linear hill and mountain ranges like the two adjacent ranges of the [[Swabian Alb|Swabian]] and [[Franconian Alb]] (reaching approximately from the source of the [[Danube]] in the southwest of [[Baden-Württemberg]], south of [[Stuttgart]], across [[Swabia]] into [[Central Franconia]] and to the valley of the river [[Main (river)|Main]]) and the [[Bavarian Forest]] along the border between Bavaria and the Czech Republic.  The [[Alps]] on the southern border are the highest mountains, but relatively little Alpine terrain lies within Germany (in southeastern Swabia and [[Upper Bavaria]]) compared to Switzerland and Austria.  The [[Black Forest]], on the southwestern border with France, separates the Rhine from the headwaters of the [[Danube]] on its eastern slopes.

[[File:Germany Köppen.svg|thumb|300px|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Germany]]
The North-South difference in Germany, between N 55:03 (at [[List, Germany|List]] on [[Sylt]]) and N 47:16 (around [[Oberstdorf]], [[Bavaria]]) equals almost eight [[Latitudes]] (or 889 km), but this can't largely be seen in different average temperatures. There is sooner a stronger West-East temperature factor instead. This is explained by the North's flat and open landscapes and its closeness to the sea, and South's higher terrain, larger distance from the sea, and the [[Alps]]. These mountains prevents much of the usually warmer [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] air to blow up into southern Germany. And north of the Alps and the [[Carpathians]], the farther away from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with for its Latitudes warm current, known as the [[Gulf Stream|Gulfstream]] - and the closer to [[Russia]]'s and [[Siberia]]'s extremely cold winter winds, one gets, the local climate becomes colder, even at the same Latitude and altitude. Even if Siberian winter winds are not dominating, when they do hit Germany, temperatures can in extreme cases fall to -30 C and below during the nights, and this has an effect on the average temperatures of November to March. Although rare, when such cold air reaches Germany, the Eastern parts becomes more affected compared to the Western parts.     
These factors results in, that [[Hamburg]] in the North has the same annual average temperature as [[Munich]] in the South has. The annual average temperature in Hamburg is +9.5 C and +9.7 in Munich&lt;ref&gt;See "HAMBURG-FUHLS.(FLUGWEWA)", "HAMBURG-NEUWIEDENTHAL" and "HAMBURG-WANDSBEK" (for Hamburg)- altitudes are 3,11 and 18 meters; and "MUENCHEN-STADT (WST)" for Munich - altitude is 515 meters, at [https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/mittelwerte/temp_8110_fest_html.html?view=nasPublication&amp;nn=16102]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[Berlin]] has an annual average temperature of +9.9 C.&lt;ref&gt;See "BERLIN-TEMP. (WST)" (altitude 48 meters) at [https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/mittelwerte/temp_8110_fest_html.html?view=nasPublication&amp;nn=16102]&lt;/ref&gt;    

The warmest area in Germany is the area bordering to [[France]] and west of the [[Black Forest|Schwarzwald]] hills. Roughly between [[Karlsruhe]] in the north, and down to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] border. Whilst the coldest area (except for mountain peaks) is found in the southeastern parts of eastern Germany, around [[Dresden]] and [[Görlitz]]; roughly just two Latitudes higher.
But the difference at annual average base, isn't extreme. [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] (located a little south of Karlsruhe) has an average annual temperature of +11.4 C, [[Görlitz]] has an equal value of +8.8 C. A difference of 2.6 degree C.&lt;ref&gt;See "FREIBURG I.BR. (AWST)" (altitude 236 meters) and  "GOERLITZ (WEWA)" (altitude 238 meters) at [https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/mittelwerte/temp_8110_fest_html.html?view=nasPublication&amp;nn=16102]&lt;/ref&gt; Colder meteorological stations in Germany can be found, but mainly at notably higher altitudes.      

Germany's [[climate]] is [[temperate]] and [[Oceanic climate|marine]], with cold, cloudy, wet winters and moderate warm summers and in the south occasional warm [[föhn wind]]. The greater part of Germany lies in the cool/temperate climatic zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. In the northwest and the north, the climate is oceanic and rain falls all the year round. Winters there are relatively mild and summers comparatively cool. In the east, the climate shows clear continental features; winters can be very cold for long periods, and summers can become very warm. Dry periods are often recorded.

In the centre and the south, there is a transitional climate which may be predominantly oceanic or continental, according to the general weather situation. Winters are mild and summers tend to be cool, though maximum temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}} for several days in a row during heat waves. The warmest regions of Germany can be found in the south-west (see [[rhine rift]], [[German Wine Route]] and [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]). Here summers can be hot with many days exceeding {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}}. Sometimes, minimum temperatures do not drop below {{convert|20|°C|°F|lk=on}}, which is relatively rare in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbuch-deutschland.de/book/en/002_001_001.html German Climate] Handbuch Deutschland.

===Land use===
[[File:Hintersee.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alps|Alpine]] scenery in [[Bavaria]]]]

Germany covers a total of {{Convert|357,021|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which {{Convert|5,157|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is [[irrigated land]] and {{Convert|8,350|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is covered by water, the largest lakes being [[Lake Constance]] (total area of {{Convert|536|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with 62% of the shore being German; international [[border]]s are not defined on the lake itself), [[Müritz]] ({{Convert|117|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Chiemsee]] ({{Convert|80|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The majority of Germany is covered by either [[arable land]] (33.95%); permanent crops cover 0.57% of the land.
 
Germany has a total of {{Convert|2,389|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline, and borders totaling {{Convert|3,714|km|mi|abbr=on}} (clockwise from north: [[Denmark]] {{Convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Poland]] {{Convert|467|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Czech Republic]] {{Convert|704|km|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html | title = CIA – The World Factbook – Germany | work = [[The World Factbook]] | publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | date = April 26, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria]] {{Convert|801|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Switzerland]] {{Convert|348|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[France]] {{Convert|418|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Luxembourg]] {{Convert|128|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Belgium]] {{Convert|133|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Netherlands]] {{Convert|575|km|mi|abbr=on}}).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Germany is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The territory of Germany can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: European-Mediterranean montane mixed forests and Northeast-Atlantic shelf marine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/ecoregion_list/ List of Ecoregions: Terrestrial Ecoregions] WWF. Retrieved 21 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Germany is covered by either [[arable land]] (33%) or [[forestry]] and [[woodland]] (31%). Only 15% is covered by permanent pastures.

Plants and animals are those generally common to middle Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute one-third of the forests; conifers are increasing as a result of reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Fish abound in the rivers and the North Sea. Wild animals include deer, wild boar, mouflon, fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of beaver. Various migratory birds cross Germany in the spring and autumn.

The [[List of national parks of Germany|national parks in Germany]] include the [[Wadden Sea National Parks]], the [[Jasmund National Park]], the [[Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park]], the [[Müritz National Park]], the [[Lower Oder Valley National Park]], the [[Harz National Park]], the [[Saxon Switzerland National Park]] and the [[Bavarian Forest National Park]].

Germany is known for its many [[zoological garden]]s, wildlife parks, aquaria, and bird parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eupedia.com/europe/zoological_gardens_europe.shtml List of famous Zoological gardens in European countries] www.eupedia.com.

===Demographics===
[[File:Pop density of Germany.png|thumb|upright|Population density]]
{{Main article|Demographics of Germany}}

With an estimated 81.8&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants in January 2010, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the [[List of countries by population|15th largest country]] in the world in terms of population. Its [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|population density]] stands at {{Convert|229.4|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}. 
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] lists Germany as host to the [[List of countries by immigrant population|third-highest number of international migrants worldwide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2006Migration_Chart/Migration2006.pdf |title=International Migration 2006 |publisher =UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs |accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 20% of Germany´s population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.

===Administrative divisions===
Germany comprises [[States of Germany|sixteen states]] that are collectively referred to as ''Länder''.&lt;ref&gt;The individual denomination is either ''Land'' [state], ''Freistaat'' [free state] or ''Freie (und) Hansestadt'' [free (and) Hanseatic city].&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bundesrat.de/nn_11006/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/laender-en-node.html?__nnn=true|title= The Federal States|publisher=[[Bundesrat of Germany]]|work = www.bundesrat.de|accessdate=17 July 2011}} &lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Infoservice/Terminologie/Bundeslaender/Uebersicht_node.html|title = Amtliche Bezeichnung der Bundesländer|work = www.auswaertiges-amt.de|publisher = [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]]|language = German|trans-title=Official denomination of federated states|format = PDF; download file „Englisch“|accessdate = 22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to differences in size and population the [[States of Germany#Further subdivisions|subdivision of these states]] varies, especially between [[city states]] (''Stadtstaaten'') and states with larger territories (''Flächenländer''). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 [[Regierungsbezirke|Government Districts]] (''Regierungsbezirke''). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 [[Districts of Germany|districts]] (''Kreise'') on municipal level, these consist of 301 [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]] and 102 [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Aktuell/04__KreiseAktuell,property=file.xls |title=Kreisfreie Städte und Landkreise nach Fläche und Bevölkerung 31.12.2009 |format=XLS |date=October 2010 |publisher=[[Statistisches Bundesamt]] Deutschland |language=German |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110428135732/http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Statistiken/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Aktuell/04__KreiseAktuell%2Cproperty%3Dfile.xls |archivedate=April 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Himalayan states''' are a group of countries straddling the [[Himalaya]]n [[mountain range]] in [[Asia]]. The area is divided between the [[Western Himalaya]] and the [[Eastern Himalaya]]. Two [[sovereign state]]s, [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]], are located almost entirely within the mountain range. The range also covers the southern [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] of [[China]], the [[Indian Himalayan Region|Indian Himalayan states]] of [[North India|North]] and [[Northeast India|Northeast]] [[India]] and northern [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop|first=Barry|authorlink=Barry Bishop (mountaineer)|title=Himalayas (mountains, Asia)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266037/Himalayas|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of this region are mostly of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] or [[Tibeto-Burman]] descent while the main religions are [[Himalayan Buddhism|Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chatterjee|first=Shiba|title=Himalayas (mountains, Asia)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Himalayas/People|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the world's major trans-boundary [[river]]s originate in the Himalayas, including the [[Indus]], [[Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra]] and [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=RYlRJgUpE8QC&amp;pg=PT188&amp;dq=himalayan+countries&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPy5vPue3MAhXCXaYKHTJeAUcQ6AEIPTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=himalayan%20countries&amp;f=false |title=International Conflict over Water Resources in Himalayan Asia - R.

'''Historic roads''', or '''[[trail]]s in USA and Canada''', are [[road]]s, and [[Ancient trackway|tracks]], that "have great historical importance or fame".&lt;ref&gt;"Historic", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples exist from [[prehistoric]] times until the early twentieth century. This includes [[trackway]]s, tracks, or roads that existed in "the period of history before the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]" in 476 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; "The first roads were paths made by animals and later adapted by humans."&lt;ref&gt;"Roads", ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Post Track]], a prehistoric [[causeway]] in the valley of the [[River Brue]] on the [[Somerset Levels]], England, is one of the oldest known constructed trackways and dates from around 3838 BCE.

Many historic roads, such as the [[Silk Road]], the [[Amber Road]], and the [[Royal Road]] of the [[Persian Empire]], existed before the [[Christian era]] and covered great distances. The [[Roman roads|Romans]] were the most significant road builders of the ancient world. At the peak of Rome's development, there were more than {{convert|400000|km|mi|lk=out|abbr=off}} of roads, of which over {{convert|80,500|km}} were stone-paved.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Richard A. ''The Great Armies of Antiquity''. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant, ''History of Rome'' (New York: Charles Scribner, 1978), 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inca road system]] was an extensive and advanced transportation system in [[pre-Columbian South America]]. 

Historic roads from the nineteenth century include the [[Red River Trails]] between Canada and the USA.

[[File:Silk route.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Silk Road]]. Both the land and sea routes]]
=== East Asia ===
==== China ====
The [[Silk Road]] was a major trade route between China and India, Europe, and Arabia, that derives its name from the lucrative trade in [[silk]] carried out along its length, beginning in the [[Han dynasty]] (207 BCE–220 CE). The Han dynasty expanded the [[Central Asia]]n section of the trade routes around 114 BCE through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy [[Zhang Qian]].&lt;ref name="boulnois"&gt;{{Cite book|first= Luce |last= Boulnois | author-link = Luce Boulnois | year= 2005|title= Silk Road: Monks, Warriors &amp; Merchants|publisher= Odyssey Books|location= Hong Kong|page= 66|isbn= 962-217-721-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese took great interest in the safety of their trade products and extended the [[Great Wall of China]] to ensure the protection of the trade route.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru, Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2010), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gallery road]] and [[Stone Cattle Road]] were two other ancient routes. 

[[File:明月峡古栈道遗址照片.JPG|150px|left|thumb|Reconstructed ancient cliff path of Mingyue Gorge,Northern [[Sichuan]], China,  part of the [[Shudao]] road system]]The [[Shudao]] ({{zh|c=蜀道|p=Shǔdào}}), or the "Road(s) to Shu", is a system of mountain roads linking the Chinese province of [[Shaanxi]] with [[Sichuan]] (Shu), built and maintained since the  4th century BC. Technical highlights were the [[gallery road]]s, consisting of wooden planks erected on wooden or stone beams slotted into holes cut into the sides of cliffs. The roads join three adjacent basins separated and surrounded by high mountains. Like many ancient road systems, the Shu Roads formed a network of major and minor roads with different roads being used at different historical times. However, a number of roads are commonly identified as the main routes.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Zhiqin, Yan Shoucheng &amp; Hu Ji (1986). ''Ancient records of the Shu Roads''. Xi’an, Northwest University Press.

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Asahina kiridoshi -03.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kamakura]] Kaidō ]]

====Japan====
{{nihongo|[[Kaidō]]|街道|road}} were roads in [[Japan]] dating from the [[Edo period]] (between 1603 and 1868). They act important roles in transportation like the [[Appian way]] of ancient Roman roads. Major examples include the [[Edo Five Routes]], all of which started at [[Edo]] (modern-day [[Tokyo]]).&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Japan |title=Gokaidō |url=http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |accessdate=2012-11-10 |year=2012 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |oclc=56431036 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825113418/http://rekishi.jkn21.com/ |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor examples include sub-routes such as the [[Hokuriku Kaidō]] and the [[Nagasaki Kaidō]].

''Kaidō'', however, do ''not'' include [[San'yōdō]], [[San'indō]], [[Nankaidō]] and [[Saikaidō]], which were part of the even more ancient system of Yamato government called [[Gokishichidō]]. This was the name for ancient administrative units and the roads within these units,
organized in Japan during the [[Asuka period]] (AD 538–710), as part of a [[Ritsuryō|legal and governmental system]] borrowed from the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). "''Goki-shichidō''" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 255|page=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Many [[highway]]s and [[railway]] lines in modern Japan follow the ancient routes and carry the same names. The early roads radiated from the capital at [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] or [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]]. Later, Edo was the reference, and even today Japan reckons directions and measures distances along its [[highway]]s from [[Nihonbashi]] in [[Chūō, Tokyo]].

=== South Asia ===
====Indian subcontinent====
The [[Grand Trunk Road]] in [[South Asia]] was the main road from modern day [[Bangladesh]] to northern [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. A route since antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2016/dinner-on-the-grand-trunk-road/|title=Dinner on the Grand Trunk Road|last=Bhandari|first=Shirin|date=2016-01-05|website=|publisher=Roads &amp; Kingdoms|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was constructed into a coherent highway by the [[Maurya Empire]] in 300BC. Soon after, the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] (c. 350 – c. 290 BC) wrote of his travels along the road to reach Hindu kingdoms in the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=61-62}} After invading India over 1,500 years later, [[Mughals]] extended the Grand Trunk Road westwards from [[Lahore]] to [[Kabul]] (the capital of Afghanistan) crossing the [[Khyber Pass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/07/03/where-do-borders-need-to-be-redrawn/permeable-lines-on-the-grand-trunk-road|title=How to Redraw the World Map|last=Khanna|first=Parag|date=|work=|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The road was later improved and extended from [[Calcutta]] to [[Peshawar]] by the British rulers of [[colonial India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Arnold (historian)]];

The Grand Trunk Road remains under use for transportation in  India. The [[Khyber Pass]] was an all-season mountain pass connecting [[Afghanistan]] to western [[Pakistan]].

== Europe ==

[[Image:Danewerk.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Hærvejen]] crossing the [[Danevirke|Dannevirke]]]]
Except for [[Roman roads]], European pathways were rarely in good shape and depended on the [[topology]] and [[geography]] of the region. In the early [[Middle Ages]], people often preferred to travel along elevated [[drainage divide]]s to lower down.  This was due to thick forests and other natural obstacles in valleys.

The [[Amber Road]] was an ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]] from coastal areas of the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/241848/Amber_in_the_Ancient_Near_East   Graciela Gestoso Singer, "Amber in the Ancient Near East", ''i-Medjat'' No. 2 (December 2008).  Papyrus Electronique des Ankou.]&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistoric [[trade route]]s between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade.  As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed "the gold of the north", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] over a period of thousands of years.

[[Hærvejen]] (Danish, meaning ''the army road'') ran from [[Viborg, Denmark]] through [[Flensburg]] (in the present northern German state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) to [[Hamburg]]

=== Roman Empire ===
{{Main|Roman road}}
[[File:Carved steps along Ancient Roman Road.jpg|thumb|Carved steps along ancient Roman road leading from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Beit Gubrin]], Israel]]
[[Appian Way]] (of the [[Roman Empire]]) was a service road from [[Rome]] to south-east [[Italy]].
[[Watling Street]], originating in [[Roman Britain]], was an Imperial service road from [[Dover]] through [[London]] to [[Wroxeter]].

=== Frankish Empire ===
The [[Frankish Empire]] was the predecessor of the modern states of France and Germany.

[[File:Alte Salzstrasse Breitenfelde.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Old Salt Route]]: historical pavement near [[Breitenfelde]], N. Germany]]

The [[Old Salt Route]] or ''Alte Salzstraße'' ([[Hanseatic League]]) was a [[salt]] trade route from [[Lüneburg]] to [[Lübeck]].

The [[Rennsteig]] was a connecting road between small independent states in [[Thuringia]].  As of 2013, it is a hiking trail.  The route crosses the [[Thuringia Forest]] and the slate mountains of Thuringia and [[Frankenwald]], stretching from [[Hörschel]] at the river [[Werra]] (near [[Eisenach]]) to [[Blankenstein]] at the river [[Saale]].  It is part of the [[European long-distance paths]] network.

The [[Via Regia#The "Via Regia"|Via Regia]] (King's road) ran from [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Görlitz]] in south-west [[Poland]].

The [[Via Tolosana]] (as the most important town along the way is [[Toulouse]]), also known as the the [[Arles]] Route is one of the 4 medieval pilgrim routes described by Aimery Picaud in his 12th c Pilgrim’s Guide. Used by pilgrims from southern and eastern Europe on the [[Way of St. James|Way of St James]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]], and in reverse, by Spanish, Portuguese and French pilgrims to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Confraternity of Saint James, [https://www.csj.org.uk/planning-your-pilgrimage/routes-to-santiago/the-routes-today/the-arles-route/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birkenhainer Landstraße]] was a [[Wine]] trade road.  It ran between [[Bergische Eisenstraße]], [[Deitweg]], [[Eselsweg]], [[Way of St. James]] and [[Schwabenweg]].

[[Antsanvia]] (from the Latin ''antiana via'', old road) was a trade road that ran from [[Mainz]] to [[Thuringia]]. Due to wide visibility from the [[Rhön Mountains|Rhön]] mountains, places along the road became sites for hilltop castles in the [[Middle Ages]]. An example is [[Hauneck#History|Hauneck Castle]] (Burg Hauneck) on the [[Stoppelsberg]], the ruins of which are still visible. It served to oversee and protect traffic on Antsanvia and protect the villages in the [[Haune|Haune Valley]].

[[Elisabethenstraße]] ran from the district of [[Mainz-Kastel]] through [[Hofheim, Hesse|Hofheim am Taunus]] to [[Oppidum]] [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Nida]] and into [[Wetterau]].

=== Germany  ===
The [[Wittmoor Bog Trackway]]s are two prehistoric trackways discovered in Wittmoor in northern [[Hamburg]]. The trackways date to the 4th and 7th century AD, both linked the eastern and western shores of the formerly inaccessible, swampy bog. A part of the older trackway No. II dating to the period of the [[Roman Empire]] is on display at the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Mobility, Show case no. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication - Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | date =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =108 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amber Road]] (Bernsteinstraße) was an [[amber]] trade route from [[Lithuania]] to northern [[Italy]].

The [[Hellweg]] was an ancient route through Germany. It ran from the [[Rhine]] in the east to the mountains of the [[Teutoburger Wald]] in the west, and [[Duisburg]] (the confluence of the Rhine and [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] rivers) to [[Paderborn]].  The [[Sauerland]] was to its south.

The [[Ortesweg]] &lt;ref&gt;"Ortsweg", ([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortesweg])&lt;/ref&gt; was a path from [[Marburg]] to [[Bamberg]].

The [[Kulmer Steig]] is a byword for transport links from the Elbe valley over the eastern part of the Eastern Ore Mountains to Bohemian Chlumec u Chabařovic (German: ''Kulm'')

===Great Britain===
The [[Post Track]] and [[Sweet Track]], [[causeways]] or timber trackways, in the [[Somerset levels]], near [[Glastonbury]], are believed to be the oldest known purpose built roads in the world and have been dated to the [[3800s BC]].&lt;ref Name="Current_Archaeology_somerset-levels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=The Somerset Levels|pages=139–143|volume=XV (4)|issue=172 (Special issue on Wetlands)|work=Current Archaeology|publisher=Current Archaeology|date=February 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were walkways consisting mainly of planks of [[oak]] laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of [[ash tree|ash]], oak, and [[Tilia|lime]], driven into the underlying peat.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/section_of_the_sweet_track.aspx|title=1986,1201.1–27 Sweet Track exhibition highlight|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=19 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101940/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/section_of_the_sweet_track.aspx|archivedate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were used to link the [[fen]] islands across the [[marshes]].

It fits within a trend of narrowing width and increased sophistication during the third millennium BC. Some argue that this shift could relate to the growing complexity of [[wheel]]ed transport at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Chapman |first = Henry |title = A Neolithic Trackway on Hatfield Moors – a significant discovery |url = http://www.thmcf.org/downloads/Trackway_talk_notes.pdf |website = Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum |format = [[Portable document format |PDF]] |accessdate = 20 August 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208140447/http://www.thmcf.org/downloads/Trackway_talk_notes.pdf |archivedate = 8 December 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Martha Hill.jpg|thumb|The [[Pilgrims' Way]] climbing St Martha's Hill, near [[Guildford]], England]]
Tracks provided links between farmsteads and fields, other farmsteads, and neighbouring [[long barrow]] tombs. They also joined the separate localities to the camp meeting places and cross-country flint roads. Others were more likely to have been processional ways, such as the one leading to the gigantic temple at [[Avebury]] in Wiltshire. On British hills, the line of tracks often run [[Ridgeway (road)|a little below the actual crest of a ridge]], possibly to afford some shelter from the wind or to avoid travellers presenting themselves to marauders as a target on the skyline.&lt;ref&gt;West, Graham. ''The Technical Development of Roads in Britain''. Ashgate, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include the [[Harrow Way]] and the [[Pilgrims' Way]], running along the [[North Downs]] in southern England. The [[Harrow Way]] (also spelled as "Harroway") is another name for the "Old Way", an ancient trackway in the south of England, dated by archaeological finds to 600&amp;ndash;450&amp;nbsp;BC, but probably in existence since the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref name=Brayley&gt;{{cite book|last=Brayley|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Wedlake Brayley|title=A topographical history of Surrey|volume=4|year=1850|publisher=G Willis|location=London|page=218|oclc=4601837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Margary&gt;{{cite book

Later the eastern part of the Harrow Way become known as the [[Pilgrims Way]], following the canonisation of [[Thomas Becket]]t and the establishment of a shrine in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]]. This [[pilgrimage]] route ran from [[Winchester]], [[Hampshire]], via [[Farnham]], [[Surrey]], to [[Canterbury]] [[Kent]]. The western section of the Harrow Way ends in Farnham, the eastern in Dover.

[[The Ridgeway]] similarly keeps to high ground and for at least 5,000 years travellers have used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/The-Ridgeway/|title=The History of the Ridgeway, an ancient pathway|website=www.historic-uk.com|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ridgeway provided a reliable trading route running along [[Downland|chalk hills]] from the [[Dorset]] coast to [[the Wash]] in [[Norfolk]]. The high dry ground made travel easy and provided a measure of protection by giving traders a commanding view, warning against potential attacks. The [[Icknield Way]] follows the [[chalk]] [[escarpment]] that includes the [[Berkshire Downs]] and [[Chiltern Hills]], in southern and eastern England, from [[Norfolk]] to [[Wiltshire]].

Other examples of historic roads in [[England]] include the [[Long Causeway]], a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[packhorse]] route that ran from [[Sheffield]] to [[Hathersage]] and The Mariners' Way in Devon. The latter was created by sailors in the eighteenth century, or earlier, travelling between the ports of [[Bideford]] and [[Dartmouth, Devon]], who linked existing lanes, tracks and footpaths to form a direct route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinersaway.org.uk/html/mariners_way.html Mariners Way]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]], many trackways were built upon by the Romans to form the foundations for their roads. Prior to this, people used trackways to travel between settlements but this was unsuitable for the swift movement of troops and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/early_history/transport_rs.shtml Dartford Town Archive - Roman and Saxon Roads and Transport]&lt;/ref&gt; Mastiles Lane was a Roman marching road and later an important route for monks leading sheep from [[Fountains Abbey]] to summer pasture on higher ground. Also known as the Old Monks' Road,&lt;ref&gt;[[National Trust]], [https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/malham-tarn-estate/trails/malham-tarn-archaeology-walk Malham Tarn archaeology walk], accessed 19 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; this is now a [[Yorkshire Dales|Dales]] walking track.

In [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Scotland]], ancient tracks include the [[Causey Mounth]], an ancient [[drovers' road]] over the coastal fringe of the Grampian Mountains and [[Elsick Mounth]], which was one of the few means of traversing the Grampian [[Mounth]] area in [[prehistoric]] and [[medieval]] times.&lt;ref&gt;[[W.

=== Greece ===
The [[Via Pythia]] (or Pythian road) was the route to [[Delphi]]. It was revered{{citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=Claims like this need to sourced, otherwise they appear to be peacocky}} throughout the [[Ancient Greek world]] as the site of the [[Omphalos]] stone (the centre of the earth and universe).

[[The Sacred Way]] ({{lang-grc|Ἱερὰ Ὁδός}}, ''Hierá Hodós''), in ancient [[Greece]], was the road from [[Athens]] to [[Eleusis]]. It was so called because it was the route taken by a procession celebrating the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. The procession to Eleusis began at the [[Sacred Gate]] in the [[Kerameikos]] (the Athenian cemetery) on the 19th [[Attic calendar|Boedromion]]. In the present day, the road from central Athens to [[Aegaleo]] and [[Chaidari]] (the old route to Eleusis) is called the [[Iera Odos]] after the ancient road.

===Ireland===
{{Main|History of roads in Ireland}}
[[File:Corlea_ancient_trackway.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Corlea Trackway]], Ireland]]
The [[Corlea Trackway]] is an ancient road built on a bog consisting of packed hazel, birch and alder planks placed lengthways across the track, and occasional cross timbers for support. Other bog trackways or "toghers" have also been discovered dating to around 4000 BC. The Corlea trackway dates from approx 148 BC and was excavated in 1994. It is the largest trackway of its kind to be uncovered in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithicireland.com/Corlea%20Trackway.html Corlea Trackway]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's prehistoric roads were minimally developed, but oak-plank pathways covered many bog areas, and five great 'ways' (''slighe'') converged at the [[Hill of Tara]]. An ancient avenue or trackway in Ireland is located at [[Rathcroghan]] Mound and the surrounding earthworks within a 370m circular enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fenwick |first1=Joe |last2=Geraghty |first2=Louise |last3=Waddell |first3=John |title=The Innermost Secrets of Rathcroghan Mound |journal=Archaeology Ireland |date=Summer 2006 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=26-29 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559140 |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Esker Riada]], a series of glacial [[eskers]] formed at the end of the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]], formed an elevated pathway from east to west, connecting  [[Galway]] to [[Dublin]].

===Russia===
The [[Siberian Route]] ({{lang-ru|Сибирский тракт}}; ''Sibirsky trakt''), also known as the "Moscow Highway"  and "Great Highway" , was a historic route that connected [[European Russia]] to [[Siberia]] and [[China]]. 

The construction of the road was decreed by the Tsar two months after the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], on 22 November 1689, but it did not start until 1730 and was not finished until the mid-19th century. Previously, Siberian transport had been mostly by river via [[Siberian River Routes]]. First Russian settlers arrived in Siberia by the [[Cherdyn Route|Cherdyn river route]] which was superseded by the [[Babinov Road|Babinov overland route]] in the late 1590s. The town of [[Verkhoturye]] in the Urals was the most eastern point of the Babinov Road.

The much longer Siberian route started in [[Moscow]] as the [[Vladimir Highway]] (a medieval road) and passed through [[Murom]], [[Kozmodemyansk]], [[Kazan]], [[Perm]], [[Kungur]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Tyumen]], [[Tobolsk]], [[Tara, Russia|Tara]], [[Kainsk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Yeniseysk]] and [[Irkutsk]]. After crossing [[Lake Baikal]] the road split near [[Verkhneudinsk]]. One branch continued east to [[Nerchinsk]] while the other went south to the border post of [[Kyakhta]] where it linked to camel caravans that crossed [[Mongolia]] to a [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] gate at [[Zhangjiakou|Kalgan]].

In the early 19th century, the route was moved to the south. From [[Tyumen]] the road proceeded through [[Yalutorovsk]], [[Ishim, Tyumen Oblast|Ishim]], [[Omsk]], [[Tomsk]], [[Achinsk]] and [[Krasnoyarsk]] before rejoining the older route at Irkutsk. It remained a vital artery connecting Siberia with [[Moscow]] and Europe until the last decades of the 19th century, when it was superseded by the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] (built 1891-1916), and the [[Amur Cart Road]] (built 1898-1909). The contemporary equivalent is the [[Trans-Siberian Highway]].

== Middle East ==
The [[Royal Road]] was an ancient highway reorganized and rebuilt by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] king [[Darius the Great]] (Darius I) of the first ([[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]]) Persian Empire in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Persian Royal Road System'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Darius built the [[road]] to facilitate rapid communication throughout his very large empire from [[Susa]], [[Syria]] to [[Sardis]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, ''Alexander the Great'', 1973:96.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:3|NKJV}} suggests that roads were built to facilitate ease of access to the three regional [[Cities of Refuge]] in [[Ancient Israel|Israel]]. Deuteronomy has been dated to the seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Rofé, Alexander (2002). ''Deuteronomy: Issues and Interpretation''. T&amp;T Clark, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Some translations imply this e.g. the [[King James Version]]: ''Thou shalt prepare thee a way'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:3|KJV}}: [[King James Version]]&lt;/ref&gt; while some more modern interpretations make it more explicit: ''You shall prepare and maintain for yourself the roads [to these cities]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:3|AMP}}: [[Amplified Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the road network was built by cultures that precede the Inca Empire, notably the [[Wari culture]]. During the Spanish colonial era, parts of the road system were given the status of ''Camino Real''. In 2014 the road system became a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How the Inca Empire Engineered a Road Across Some of the World's Most Extreme Terrain|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/how-inca-empire-engineered-road-would-endure-centuries-180955709/|website=Smithsonianmag.com|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Natchez Trace]], also known as the "Old Natchez Trace", is a historic forest trail within the [[United States]] which extends roughly {{convert|440|mi|km}} from [[Natchez, Mississippi]], to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], linking the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]], [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]], and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers.
[[File:OldTraceSunken.jpg|left|thumb|Sunken stretch of the [[Natchez Trace]] ]]
The trail was created and used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for centuries, and was later used by early European and American explorers, traders, and emigrants in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

In the [[American Old West]], the [[Oregon Trail]] was a 19th century [[American pioneer|pioneer]] route from [[Illinois]] to [[Oregon]]. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] was a major commercial and military artery from [[Missouri]] to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].
In modern times, the [[Lincoln Highway]] (dedicated 1913) was the first road for the automobile across the United States of America, spanning 3389 miles coast-to-coast from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]].  
====Corduroy road====	
[[Corduroy road]]s were used extensively in the [[American Civil War]], between Shiloh and Corinth after the battle of Shiloh,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Ulysses, Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant, Chapter 26 (1885).&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[William Tecumseh Sherman#Final campaigns in the Carolinas|Sherman's march through the Carolinas]]&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Ulysses, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4367/4367-h/4367-h.htm#ch62 Personal Memoirs of U.

====Plank road====
A [[plank road]] is a [[road]] composed of [[Plank (wood)|wooden planks]] or puncheon logs, which were commonly found in the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] as well as the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] of the United States in the first half of the 19th century. They were often built by [[toll road|turnpike]] companies.
 		
The [[Plank Road Boom]] was an economic boom that happened in the [[United States]]. Largely in the [[Eastern United States]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], the boom lasted from 1844 to the mid 1850s. In about 10 years, over 3,500 miles of plank road were built in New York alone{{en dash}}enough road to go from [[Manhattan]] to [[California]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coin|first1=Glen|title=Central NY was the center of the wooden roads boom in the US - until they rotted|url=http://www.syracuse.com/empire/index.ssf/2016/06/central_ny_was_the_center_of_the_wooden_roads_boom_in_the_us_until_they_rotted.html|website=Syracuse.com|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 10,000 miles of plank road were built countrywide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|title=Turnpikes and Toll Roads in Nineteenth Century America|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/turnpikes-and-toll-roads-in-nineteenth-century-america/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], the [[Carlton Trail]] was a [[fur trade]] route from south-west [[Manitoba]] to [[Fort Edmonton]] in [[Alberta]]. 
[[Image:Red Rivers carts at Fort Smith.jpg|thumb|250px|right| Red River ox cart train on the Carlton Trail]]
The [[Red River Trails]] were a network of ox cart routes connecting the [[Red River Colony]] (the "Selkirk Settlement") and [[Fort Garry]] in [[British North America]] with the head of navigation on the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States. These trade routes ran from the location of present-day [[Winnipeg]] in the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]] across the Canada–United States border, and thence by a variety of routes through what is now the eastern part of [[North Dakota]] and western and central [[Minnesota]] to [[Mendota, Minnesota|Mendota]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] on the Mississippi.

Travellers began to use the trails by the 1820s, with the heaviest use from the 1840s to the early 1870s, when they were superseded by railways. Until then, these cartways provided the most efficient means of transportation between the isolated Red River Colony and the outside world. They gave the Selkirk colonists and their neighbours, the [[Métis]] people, an outlet for their furs and a source of supplies other than the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which was unable to enforce its monopoly in the face of the competition that used the trails.

{{Politics of Brunei}}

The '''House of Bolkiah''' is the ruling [[royal family]] of [[Brunei Darussalam]]. It is composed of the descendants of the 1st sultan [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Sultan Muhammad Shah]] and his family. The '''[[Sultan of Brunei]]''' is the [[head of state]] and [[absolute monarch]] of [[Brunei]]. He is also [[head of government]] in his capacity as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web |title=Prime Minister |url=http://www.jpm.gov.bn/ |publisher=The Prime Minister's Office of Brunei Darussalam |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since independence from the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1984, only one Sultan has reigned, though the royal institution dates back to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sultan-Sultan Brunei |language=Malay |url=http://www.history-centre.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm |publisher=Government of Brunei |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415152209/http://www.history-centre.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan of Brunei can be thought of as synonymous with the ruling House of Bolkiah, with descendency being traced from the 1st sultan, temporarily interrupted by the 13th sultan [[Abdul Hakkul Mubin]] who in turn was deposed by a member of the House of Bolkiah. It is not clear when the house became known as the 'House of Bolkiah', and whether it was named after the current sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]], or the 5th sultan [[Bolkiah]] .{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Hassanal Bolkiah's family==
Almost every direct descendent of [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] had Bolkiah name as their last name.

==Title==
The full title of the Sultan is: '''''His Majesty'' The Sultan tai
 and [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara|Yang Di-Pertuan]] of Brunei Darussalam'''(Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Sultan dan Yang di-Pertuan Negara Brunei Darussalam).&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

Today, the surname Bolkiah is carried by any descendant of the House of Bolkiah. Members of the royal household  hold high and influential positions in government.

Sons and grandsons of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah are referred to in the style "His Royal Highness" (HRH) or "''Pengiran Muda''" in Malay, differing from the royals belonging to the cadet branches which are addressed as "The Lord" (HH) or "''Pengiran Anak''" in Malay.

'''Lanište''' is a neighborhood in the [[Novi Zagreb - zapad]] city district in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. It is located along the [[Jadranska Avenue]], south of the [[Sava]] River, across from the neighbourhood of [[Jarun]]. It has a population of 3,468.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zagreb.hr/default.aspx?id=15051&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main thoroughfares are Jadranska Avenue, Lanište Road and Remetinečka Road. It is the site of the [[Arena Zagreb]], and Arena Center, shopping center to be built. 

The area was neglected for a long time, but in the last few years many new apartment buildings were built, and [[real estate]] prices have risen considerably. 

The neighborhood is badly connected to the [[ZET|Zagreb tram system]], with residents having to walk to [[Western Rotary]] to board the trams. A tram line extension together with a new [[rail yard]] located near [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]], southwest of Lanište, is planned.

are a [[archipelago|group of island]]s in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], north of [[Australia]]. Together with the [[Greater Sunda Islands]] to the west they make up the [[Sunda Islands]].  The islands are part of a [[volcanic arc]], the [[Sunda Arc]], formed by [[subduction]] along the [[Sunda Trench]] in the [[Java Sea]].

The main Lesser Sunda Islands are, from west to east: [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Flores]], [[Sumba]], [[Timor]], [[Alor archipelago]], [[Barat Daya Islands]], and [[Tanimbar Islands]].

== Administration ==
The Lesser Sundas comprise many islands, most of which are part of [[Indonesia]] and are administered as the [[provinces of Indonesia|provinces]] of [[Bali]], [[West Nusa Tenggara]], [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and southern part of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]].

The eastern half of [[Timor]] is part of [[East Timor]].

== Geology ==
The Lesser Sunda Islands consist of two geologically distinct archipelagos.&lt;ref name="Audley-Charles"&gt;Audley-Charles, M.G. (1987) "Dispersal of Gondwanaland: relevance to evolution of the Angiosperms" ''In'': Whitmore, T.C. (ed.) (1987) ''Biogeographical Evolution of the Malay Archipelago'' Oxford Monographs on Biogeography 4, Clarendon Press, Oxford, pp. 5–25, {{ISBN|0-19-854185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern archipelago, which includes [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Flores]] and [[Wetar]], is volcanic in origin. A number of these [[volcano]]es, like [[Mount Rinjani]] on Lombok, are still active while others, such as [[Kelimutu]] on Flores with its three multi-coloured crater lakes, are extinct. The northern archipelago began to be formed during the [[Pliocene]], about 15 million years ago, as a result of the collision between the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Australian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Asian plates]].&lt;ref name="Audley-Charles"/&gt; The islands of the southern archipelago, including [[Sumba]], [[Timor]] and [[Babar Islands|Babar]], are non-volcanic and appear to belong to the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Australian plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Veevers, J.J. (1991) "Phanerozoic Australia in the changing configuration of ProtoPangea through Gondwanaland and Pangea to the present dispersed continents" ''Australian Systematic Botany'' 4: pp. 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; The geology and ecology of the northern archipelago share a similar history, characteristics and processes with the southern [[Maluku Islands]], which continue the same island arc to the east.

There is a long history of geological study of these regions since [[Dutch East Indies|Indonesian colonial times]]; however, the geological formation and progression is not fully understood, and theories of the geological evolution of the islands changed extensively during the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Monk 1996, page 9"&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |page=9|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lying at the collision of two [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], the Lesser Sunda Islands comprise some of the most geologically complex and active regions in the world.&lt;ref name="Monk 1996, page 9"/&gt;

There are a number of volcanoes located on the Lesser Sunda Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/region.cfm?rnum=0604|title=Volcanoes of Indonesia: Lesser Sunda Islands|work=Global Volcanism Program|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lesser Sunda Islands differ from the large islands of [[Java]] or [[Sumatra]] in consisting of many small islands, sometimes divided by deep [[oceanic trench]]es. Movement of flora and fauna between islands is limited, leading to the evolution of a high rate of localized species, most famously the [[Komodo dragon]].&lt;ref name="Monk 1996, page 9"/&gt; As described by [[Alfred Wallace]] in ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'', the [[Wallace Line]] passes between Bali and Lombok, along the deep waters of the [[Lombok Strait]] which formed a water barrier even when lower sea levels linked the now-separated islands and landmasses on either side. The islands east of the Lombok Strait are part of [[Wallacea]], and are thus characterised by a blend of wildlife of [[Asia]]n and [[Australasia]]n origin in this region.&lt;ref&gt;Monk (1996), page 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Asian species predominate in the Lesser Sundas: [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]], which marks the boundary between the parts of Wallacea with mainly Asian and Australasian species respectively, runs to the east of the group. These islands have the driest climate in Indonesia.

=== Deciduous forests ===
A number of the islands east of the Wallace line, from Lombok and Sumbawa east to Flores and Alor, having original vegetation of dry forest rather than the rain forest that covers much of the Indonesian region, have been designated by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the Lesser Sundas deciduous forests [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Lesser Sundas deciduous forests|id=aa0201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher slopes of the islands contain forests of tall [[Podocarpus]] conifers and [[Engelhardia]]s with an undergrowth of [[liana]]s, [[epiphyte]]s, and orchids such as ''[[Corybas (plant)|Corybas]]'', ''[[Corymborkis]]'', and ''[[Malaxis]]'' (adder's mouth), while the coastal plains were originally [[savanna]] grasses such as the savanna with [[Borassus flabellifer]] palm trees on the coasts of Komodo, Rincah and Flores. Although most of the vegetation on these islands is dry forest there are patches of rainforest on these islands too, especially in lowland areas and riverbanks on Komodo, and there is a particular area of dry thorny forest on the southeast coast of Lombok. Thorn trees used to be more common in coastal areas of the islands but have largely been cleared.

These islands are home to unique species including seventeen endemic birds (of the 273 birds found on the islands). The endemic mammals are the endangered Flores shrew ''([[Suncus mertensi]])'', the vulnerable Komodo rat ''([[Komodomys rintjanus]])'', and Lombok flying fox ''([[Pteropus lombocensis]])'', Sunda long-eared bat ''([[Nyctophilus heran]])''  while the carnivorous Komodo dragon, which at three metres long and ninety kilograms in weight is the world's largest lizard, is found on Komodo, Rincah, Gili Motang, and the coast of northwestern Flores.

=== Threats and preservation  ===
[[File:Rinca Island.jpg|thumb|[[Rinca]] island]]
[[File:Komodo dragon at Komodo National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Komodo dragon]] at Komodo National Park]]
More than half of the original vegetation of the islands has been cleared for planting of rice and other crops, for settlement and by consequent forest fires. Only Sumbawa now contains a large area of intact natural forest, while Komodo, Rincah and Padar are now protected as [[Komodo National Park]].

While many ecological problems affect both small islands and large landmasses, small islands suffer their particular problems and are highly exposed to external forces. Development pressures on small islands are increasing, although their effects are not always anticipated. Although Indonesia is richly endowed with natural resources, the resources of the small islands of Nusa Tenggara are limited and specialised; furthermore human resources in particular are limited.&lt;ref name="Monk 1996, page 1"&gt;Monk (1996), page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

(both cited in Monk)&lt;/ref&gt; about small islands that can be applied to Nusa Tenggara include:&lt;ref name="Monk 1996, page 1"/&gt;

* A higher proportion of the landmass will be affected by [[List of volcanoes in Indonesia|volcanic activity]], earthquakes, landslips, and cyclone damage;
* Climates are more likely to be [[maritime climate|maritime]] influenced;
* [[drainage basin|Catchment area]]s are smaller and degree of [[erosion]] higher;
* A higher proportion of the landmass is made up of coastal areas;
* A higher degree of environmental specialisation, including a higher proportion of [[Endemism|endemic]] species in an overall [[Depauperate]] community;
* Societies may retain a strong sense of culture having developed in relative isolation;
* Small island populations are more likely to be affected by economic migration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20905">This is a list of '''[[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS]] 10-4''' [[List of FIPS region codes|country code]]s for ''Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions''.

The two-letter country codes were used by the US government for geographical data processing in many publications, such as the [[CIA World Factbook]]. The standard is also known as [[DAFIF]] 0413 ed 7 Amdt. No. 3 (Nov 2003) and as DIA 65-18 ([[Defense Intelligence Agency]], 1994, "Geopolitical Data Elements and Related Features").

The FIPS standard includes both the codes for independent countries (similar but sometimes incompatible with the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] standard) and the codes for top-level subdivision of the countries (similar to but usually incompatible with the [[ISO 3166-2]] standard). The ISO 3166 codes are used by the United Nations and for Internet top-level country code domains.

Non-sovereign entities are in italics.

On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by [[NIST]] as a [[Federal Information Processing Standard]].&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=51276&amp;dbname=2008_register

===Historical flags (1652–1928)===
* Many flags were used in South Africa prior to [[Union of South Africa|political unification]] in 1910.  
* The original [[Dutch East India Company]] colony at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] (1652–1795) flew the Dutch flag, with the [[Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie | VOC]] logo in the centre. This flag was also flown during the period of [[Batavian Republic]] rule (1803–06).
* The [[Boer Republics]], i.e. the [[Orange Free State]] (1854–1902), the [[South African Republic]] (1857–1902), [[Stellaland]] (1882–85), [[Stellaland|Goshen]] (1883–85), the [[Nieuwe Republiek]] (1884–88), and the [[Klein Vrystaat]] (1886–1891) had their own flags. Several derived from the Dutch flag.
* The British colonies that existed in the 19th century flew the British flags, and from the early 1870s some, i.e. [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Cape Colony]], and later the [[Orange River Colony]] and the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], added their own colonial flag badges.
* The '''Union of South Africa''', formed in 1910, initially used a [[red ensign]] defaced with a badge depicting the Union coat of arms. The first South African national flag, introduced in 1928, superseded it.

===National flag (1928–1994)===
{{see also|Flag of South Africa (1928–1994)}}
* The [[James Barry Munnik Hertzog|Hertzog]] administration introduced the flag after several years of political controversy. Approved by Parliament in 1927, it was first hoisted on May 31, 1928.
* The flag reflected the Union's predecessors. The basis was the [[Prince's Flag]] (royal tricolour) of the Netherlands, with the addition of a Union Jack to represent the Cape and Natal, the former Orange Free state flag, and the former South African Republic flag.
* Until 1957, the flag was flown subordinate to the British Union Jack.
* The flag remained unchanged when South Africa became a republic on May 31, 1961. However, there was pressure to change the flag, particularly from [[Afrikaners]] who resented the fact that the Union Flag was a part of the flag. The then prime minister, Dr [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], had a "clean" flag, comprising three vertical stripes of orange, white, and blue, with a leaping [[Springbok (antelope)| springbok]] over a wreath of six [[protea]]s in the centre, designed, but he was assassinated before he could introduce it, and the project died with him in 1966.

===Homeland flags (1966–1994)===
* Nine of the ten Black 'homelands' which were created inside South Africa under the apartheid system, had their own flags, i.e. [[Transkei]] (1966–94), [[Bophuthatswana]] (1973–94), [[Ciskei]] (1973–94), [[Gazankulu]] (1973–94), [[Venda]] (1973–94), [[Lebowa]] (1974–94), [[QwaQwa]] (1975–94), [[KwaZulu]] (1977–94), and [[KwaNdebele]] (1982–94).
* All these flags became obsolete when South Africa reincorporated the homelands on April 27, 1994.

=== National flag (1994–present)===
* South Africa was reconstituted as a democratic state, with equal rights for men and women of all races, in 1994. The old flag's long association with the [[apartheid]] era made it unacceptable for the new dispensation, and the [[Bureau of Heraldry|State Herald]], [[Frederick Brownell]] therefore designed a new flag. Approved by the [[Transitional Executive Council]] (TEC) on March 20, 1994, and officially authorised by state president [[Frederik Willem de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]] on April 20, 1994, it was officially hoisted a week later, on April 27, 1994.
* The new flag was intended as an interim measure, but it proved so popular that when the final Constitution was prepared in 1996, it became the permanent flag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17661">A '''coalition government''' is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[government]] in which several [[political party|parties]] cooperate. The usual reason given for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a [[majority]] in the [[parliament]]. A [[coalition government]] might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis, for example during wartime, to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political science)|political legitimacy]] it desires whilst also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed '''all-party coalitions''' ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.

For the purposes of this list, coalitions can come in two forms. The first is produced by two or more parties joining forces after fighting elections separately to form a majority government. However, some coalitions (or alliances) are already decided before elections to give the parties the best chance of immediate government after the election.

[[File:Territorial waters Oceania.png|350px|thumb|[[Exclusive economic zone]]s of the islands of Oceania and neighboring areas.]]

This is a '''list of [[sovereign state]]s and [[dependent territory|dependent territories]] in [[Oceania]]'''. Although it is mostly ocean and spans many continental plates, Oceania is often listed with the [[continent]]s.

This list follows the boundaries of geopolitical Oceania, which includes [[Australasia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. The main continental landmass of Oceania is [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/island_continent.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030820155859/http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/island_continent.html |archivedate=2003-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary between [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]] is not clearly defined. For political reasons, the United Nations considers the boundary between the two regions to be the Indonesian–[[Papua New Guinea]]n border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endpoverty2015.org/en/asia/news/marcos-diaz-crosses-oceania-asia-border-raise-awareness-mdgs/13/may/10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724124146/http://endpoverty2015.org/en/asia/news/marcos-diaz-crosses-oceania-asia-border-raise-awareness-mdgs/13/may/10 |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papua New Guinea is occasionally considered Asian as it neighbours Indonesia, but this is rare, and it is generally accepted to be part of Oceania. Geographically, [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] provinces are part of Oceania.

===Non-United Nations member states===
The two entries in this section ([[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]) are states in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. While maintaining a close constitutional and political relationship with New Zealand, both states are members of several [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations specialized agencies]] with full treaty-making capacity, and have independently engaged in diplomatic relations with sovereign states under their own name. Both are also full members of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. Because of these features, they are sometimes considered to have ''de facto'' status as sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/7589/thesis.pdf?sequence=3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sovereign territories==
The following are entities considered to be within Oceania which are either:

1. [[Federation|Federal territories]] of sovereign states located outside these states' mainland.

2. Territories that constitute integral parts of sovereign states in some form other than a federal relationship, where a significant part of the sovereign state's landmass is located outside Oceania or the territory is located outside the sovereign state's mainland. Many of these territories are often described as [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] or [[list of autonomous areas by country|autonomous areas]].

3. [[Dependent territory|Dependent territories]] of sovereign states.

Two of these territories ([[French Polynesia]] and [[New Caledonia]]) are associate members of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], while five others ([[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Tokelau]], and [[Wallis and Futuna]]) hold observer status within the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2162">A '''macroregion''' is a geopolitical subdivision that encompasses several traditionally or politically defined regions. The meaning may vary, with the common denominator being cultural, economical, historical or social similarity within a macroregion. The term is often used in the context of [[globalization]].

*It may refer to various kinds of grouping of [[nation state]]s basing on geographical proximity.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Dunning (2000) "Regions, Globalization, and the Knowledge-Based Economy", {{ISBN|0-19-829536-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Romania]],  [[Macroregiune|macroregiuni]] ("macroregions") are a higher-level subdivision of the country.
*Sometimes  the [[Greater Region]] of [[Saarland]]-[[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]-[[Luxembourg]] -[[Rhineland-Palatinate]]-[[Wallonia]]-[[French Community of Belgium]]- and [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which has not found a specific shortcut yet, is called "the macroregion".
*[[Physiographic macroregions of China]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Skinner (ed.) (1977) "The City in Late Imperial China." ''[[Stanford University Press]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Regions of Brazil]] are often referred to as "macroregions", to avoid the confusion of the common word "[[region]]".&lt;ref&gt;p. 100, ''Trade, networks, and hierarchies: modeling regional and interregional economies'', edited by Geoffrey Hewings, Michael Sonis, and David E. Boyce, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|3-540-43087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other uses==
The term "macroregion" may be also used in the context of [[natural region]]s, like in [[Slovenia#Natural regions|Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zrc-sazu.si/Zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modern climate change in Slovenia |accessdate=1 April 2008 |last=Ogrin |first=Darko |date=August 2004 |work=Slovenia: a geographical overview |publisher=Association of the Geographical Societies of Slovenia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820073301/http://www.zrc-sazu.si/zgds/glasgow/9.pdf |archivedate=August 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maximilianus Transylvanus (Transilvanus, Transylvanianus)''', also '''[[Maximilian]]us of [[Transylvania]]''' and '''Maximilian (Maximiliaen) von Sevenborgen''' (c. 1490 &amp;ndash; c. 1538), was a sixteenth-century author based in [[Flanders]] who wrote the earliest account published on [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano's]] first [[circumnavigation]] of the world (1519–22). Written after he interviewed the survivors of the [[Victoria (ship)|''Victoria'']], and being a relative of sponsor [[Christopher de Haro]], his account ''De Moluccis Insulis'' is a main source about the expedition along with that of [[Antonio Pigafetta]].

In 1520, Transylvanus had published, at [[Augsburg]], a work in [[Latin]] that describes the reception that nominated [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I, King of Spain]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519 at [[Molins de Rei]], in Spain.  This is the ''Legatio ad sacratissimum ac invictum Caesarem divum Carolum .... ab reverendissimis et illustrissimis principibus ... qua functus est ...Federicus comes palatinus in Molendino regio vlt. Novembris Anno MDXIX'' ([[Augsburg]]: Sigismund Grimm und Marx Wirsung, 1520).  At this point, Maximilianus seems to have already been serving as personal secretary to Charles V, as well as accompanying the monarch on his travels.

As Secretary to Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, for whom Magellan had sailed, Transylvanus interviewed the survivors of the voyage when Magellan's surviving ship ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'' returned to Spain in September 1522.  This group included [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], [[Francisco Albo]], and [[Hernando de Bustamante]].  The result was ''Maximiliani Transyluani Caesaris a secretis epistola, de admirabili &amp; novissima hispanoru&lt;!-- is an M missing? --&gt; in orientem navigatione, que auriae, &amp; nulli prius accessae regiones sunt, cum ipsis etia moluccis insulis'', published in [[Cologne]] in 1523.

Maximilianus, a pupil of [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], interviewed the surviving members of the expedition when they presented themselves to the Spanish court at [[Valladolid]] in the fall of 1522.  Eager to acquire fame as a writer, he produced his tract ''De Moluccis Insulis'' as a letter to [[Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg]], the [[Archbishop of Salzburg|Cardinal-Archbishop of Salzburg]], who had suggested that he perform the interviews in the first place.{{ref|morison1}}  It may have also been Vermigli who suggested the project to the young courtier.  Vermigli, was, after all, very interested in overseas exploration.

Maximilianus' letter is dated 24 October 1522, and his account was sent to Lang, whom he calls ambiguously ''domine mi unice'' ("my sole lord"), while the cardinal-archbishop was attending the [[Diet of Nuremberg]].  This diet was concerned with pacifying the first [[Protestants]], which resulted in the sending of a letter of appeal to [[Pope Adrian VI]].

Maximilianus' letter reached the hands of a [[Cologne]] printer, [[Eucharius Cervicornus]] (a Latinized rendering of "Hirtzhorn"), and the first edition of ''De Moluccis Insulis'' was printed in January 1523.  Despite the war that had erupted between Charles V and [[Francis I of France]] (see [[Italian War of 1521]]), this first edition reached Paris, where it was printed anew by [[Pierre Viart]] in July 1523.  A subsequent edition was printed at Rome by [[Minutius Calvus]] (Minizio Calvo), in November 1523.

==Origins and paternity==
Maximilianus Transylvanus' origins and paternity are a matter of dispute among historians.

===Flemish origins===
In spite of his surname, Transylvanus is said to have come from Flanders, not Transylvania, and to have been a natural or [[Illegitimacy|bastard]] son of Archbishop Lang von Wellenburg.

Scholars point to a Flemish provenance due to the fact that:

*Transylvanus was married to Frances, who was a niece of [[Christopher de Haro]], the [[Lisbon]]-based merchant who was a friend of Magellan's as well as his financial backer.  She was the daughter of Jacob de Haro, the head of a commercial firm based in [[Antwerp]].
*Transylvanus had many ties with Brussels.  A piece of Latin poetry he wrote in Faria argues that Transylvanus received his surname from the fact that he was a member of one of the many diplomats sent to Transylvania, which was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. 
*Lang von Wellenberg, born in 1469 to a burgher family, took holy orders much later in life (in 1519). 
*Transylvanus died in [[Brussels]] around 1538.

===Transylvanian origins===
In an 1891 letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', a scholar (identified only as "L.L.K.") wrote:

:"I am anxious to trace the origin of the fable about the parentage of this writer.  In several books and booksellers' catalogues, he is stated to be the natural son of Matthew Lang, Archbishop of Salzburg, (cf., e.g., ''The Life of Ferdinand Magellan'', by Dr. Guillemard, p. 146).  This is absolutely false.  The father of Maximilian was a Transylvanian nobleman, who was killed in the [[battle of Mohács]] in 1526.  Cf. the letter of Don Martin de Salinas to King Ferdinand, dated Valladolid, 11 March 1527, in [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce|Gayango’s]] 'Spanish Calendar.'  It has been suggested to me that a passage in Peter Martyr's ''Epistola DXLIII.'', dated "Guadaluppe III. Kal. Jan. 1515," might have given rise to the fable; but the passage is so clear that it is difficult to imagine how it could be mistranslated."{{ref|naq1}}

In 1916, the same scholar wrote in to state:

:"The Catalogue of the fifth portion of the Huth Collection is still repeating that ancient myth that Maximilian had addressed his famous letter ''De Moluccis Insulis'' to 'his father, the Cardinal Archbishop of Salzburg.'  His father was 'Maître Luc dit Transilvain ou de Transilvanie (Van Sevenborge)," according to a deed seen by the late M. Alphonse Wauters.  Cf. ''Histoire des Environs de Bruxells'' (1855), vol. ii. p. 288."{{ref|naq2}}

''[[Sigismund von Herberstein]]'' (1486-1566), the diplomat, writer, historian mentions him as Maximilian von ''Sibenpergen'' {{ref|naq3}}, while [[Konrad Peutinger]] (1465-1547) the humanists knows him as Maximilian ''Sybenberger''{{ref|naq4}}, both clearly referring to the German names of Transylvania: ''Siebenbürgen''.  Both were also contemporaries and probably personal friends of Maximilianus .
 
One of the main arguments in favor of Maximilianus' Transylvanian origin: The renowned humanist and  Bishop of [[Pécs]]  (later archbishop of [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]]) [[Nicolaus Olahus]]' 1534 dated letter mentions "''noster'' Maximilianus Transylvanus", that is "''our'' Transylvanian Maximilianus", with whom he became a close friend in  Brussels bonded by the shared heritage: "''Based on our common fatherland we are in great intimacy with one another , as he says , and I believe (pro ea, quae inter nos ob patriam communem intercedit familiaritas ut ipse dicit, ergo qouque ita credo, non vulgaris)''”{{ref|naq5}}. It is also well known that Nicolaus Olahus was born  in Hermannstadt (in Hungarian: Nagyszeben; today in Rumanian: [[Sibiu]]) in Transylvania.

[[File:Nicolaus Olahus Letter.png|thumb|450px|center|Fragment of the letter of Nicolaus Olahus (1534)]]

==''De Moluccis Insulis''==
Transylvanus had a lively interest in Magellan's expedition around the world.  However, his information should not be entirely accepted at face value, as Transylvanus uncritically accepted the testimony he took down from the surviving crew members.  He was also in a hurry to get his letter published.{{ref|Joyner}}

The account written by [[Antonio Pigafetta]], the expedition's official chronicler and one of the survivors of the voyage, did not appear until 1525, in Paris, and was not wholly published until the last year of the 18th century; this was the edition by [[Carlo Amoretti]] published in 1800. This edition is now famously called the Ambrosiana codex.{{fact|date=January 2017}} It is through Transylvanus' account that Europe was informed of the first circumnavigation of the globe.

Transylvanus recorded gossip on board about the mutiny that occurred during Magellan's voyage, calling it a "shameful and foul conspiracy" among the Spanish officers and men.{{ref|morison2}}  Pigafetta and Transylvanus differ on who was responsible for the massacre that occurred at [[Cebu (island)|Cebu]] in the [[Philippines]].  Transylvanus states that it was [[João Serrão]] who mistreated [[Enrique of Malacca|Enrique de Malacca]], Magellan's former slave, thereby causing Enrique to plot the massacre; Pigafetta, who did not attend the banquet that served as the trap, blames [[Duarte Barbosa]].

Transylvanus' text also includes a fairly accurate description of how [[spices]] were grown.  "The natives share groves of this tree among themselves," he writes, “just as we do vineyards."{{ref|morison3}}

A surviving copy of the first edition of his work can be found in the [[Beinecke Library]] ([[Yale University]]).  A second edition can be found at the [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum]] (Amsterdam). [[Princeton University Library]] has copies of the Cologne and Rome printings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11655">A '''monastic garden''' was used by many and for multiple purposes.  In many ways, [[gardening]] was the chief method of providing food for households, but also encompassed orchards, cemeteries and pleasure gardens, as well as medicinal and cultural uses. Gardening is the deliberate cultivation of plants [[herbs]], [[fruits]], [[flowers]], or [[vegetables]]. 

Furthermore, gardening was especially important in the monasteries, as they were used extensively by the monks and created a way of life, supplying their overall livelihood.&lt;ref name=AngloPlant&gt;Voigts, L.E. (1979). Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons. Isis, 70(2): 250-268&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, many of the fruits, vegetables, and herbs that were grown were utilized in multiple ways and over multiple parts of the garden, such as peaches grown in orchards as well as used for closing bleeding wounds.&lt;ref name=Medicine&gt;Wallis, F. (2010). Medieval Medicine: A Reader. Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical evidence ==
[[File:Codex Sangallensis 1092 recto.jpg|thumb|upright|Plan of St Gallen]]
The majority of data about the methods and means of gardens in the [[Middle Ages]] comes through [[archaeology]], surviving textual documentation, and surviving artworks such as [[paintings]], [[tapestry]] and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. 
The [[early Middle Ages]] brings a surprisingly clear snapshot of the European gardening situation at the time of [[Charlemagne]] with the survival of three important documentations: the ''[[Capitulare de villis]]'', [[Walafrid Strabo]]'s poem ''Hortulus'', and the [[plan of St Gall]] which depicts three garden areas and lists what was grown.

== Main uses ==

Gardens were seen mainly in monasteries and manors, but were also used by peasants.  Gardens were used as kitchen gardens, herbal gardens, and even orchards and cemetery gardens, among others. Each type of garden had their own purpose and meaning including medicinal, food, and spiritual purpose.

=== Medicinal ===
Gardening was particularly important for medicinal use.  Monks and healers alike used plants and herbs for different medical remedies.&lt;ref name=AngloPlant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Medicine /&gt;&lt;ref name=Astronomy&gt;McCluskey, S.C. (1990). Gregory of Tours, Monastic Timekeeping, and Early Christian Attitudes to Astronomy. Isis, 81(1): 8-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hildegard&gt;Sweet, V. (1999). Hildegard of Bingen and the Greening of Medieval Medicine. Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 73(3): 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;  Some herbs, such as poppies, could be used in helping an open wound. When the peel of the poppy stalk was ground and mixed with honey, it could be used as a plaster for wounds.&lt;ref name=Medicine /&gt; Other herbs and plants were used for internal complications, such as a headache or stomachache.  For instance, almonds were said to make a person sleepy, provoke urination, and induce menstruation.&lt;ref name=Medicine/&gt; Other herbs include roses, lilies, sage, rosemary and other aromatic herbs.&lt;ref name= Garden&gt;http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/ml_gothein_history_garden_art_design/monastery_garden_plans&lt;/ref&gt;

Monks not only used these medicinal herbs on themselves but also on the local community.  One prominent healer was [[Hildegard of Bingen]], a woman who lived in a double monastery that housed both men and women and eventually was elected magistra and later cared for her own secluded monastery.&lt;ref name=Hildegard /&gt; Besides the extensive writing she did, Hildegard was regularly visited by people throughout Europe, including [[Henry II of England]], the Holy Roman Emperor, and the empress of Byzantium, as well as the local community. Hildegard was seen as the “first woman physician” because of her work as a healer and medical text writings.&lt;ref name=Hildegard /&gt;

=== Food ===
[[File:Mount Grace Priory View of the reconstructed monk's cell from its associated garden.JPG|thumb|Garden of the reconstructed monks' cell at the [[Mount Grace Priory]]]]
A general garden was needed that was for their food supply.  Some of the vegetables could also be used for medicinal purposes, such as garlic, but this was not always the case. The monks had a mainly vegetable and fruit diet.&lt;ref name=Garden /&gt; Vegetables high in starch or in flavor were sought after for the gardens. Cottage gardens were widely used to house vegetables, and typically looked like more wild. However, patches in the cottage garden were found to be grouped by vegetable family, such as the ''[[Allium]]'' family. This family consisted of the leek (''[[Allium porrum]]''), onion (''[[Allium cepa]]''), and garlic (''[[Allium sativum]]''). 
Common vegetables included: 

{{cmn |colwidth=30em|
* Leek (''[[Leek|Allium porrum]]'') 
* Onion (''[[Allium cepa]]'') 
* Garlic (''[[Allium sativum]]'')

* Carrots (''[[Daucus carota]]'')

* Beans (''[[Faba vulgaris]]'')&lt;ref name=Renaissance&gt;http://renaissancegardens.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kitchengardenreport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

=== Orchards and cemetery gardens ===
Orchards and cemetery gardens were also tended to in medieval monasteries. The vegetation would provide fruit, such as apples or pears, as well as manual labor for the monks as was required by the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]].  According to Saint Benedict, idleness is the enemy of the soul, and for a monk, daily life was meant to be spent learning about the Lord and fighting that spiritual battle for the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://christdesert.org/Detailed/918.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513104609/http://christdesert.org/Detailed/918.html |archivedate=2014-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  So, monks used manual labor and spiritual reading to keep busy and avoid being idle.   Cemetery gardens, which tended to be very similar to generic orchards, also acted as a symbol of Heaven and Paradise, and thus provided spiritual meaning.

Monks of this time typically would use astronomy and the stars to determine religious holidays for every year.  They also used astronomy to help in figuring the best time of year to plant their gardens as well as the best time to harvest.&lt;ref name=Astronomy /&gt; 
Concerning the structure of the gardens, they often were enclosed with fences, walls or hedges in order to protect them. Stone and brick walls were typically used by the wealthy, such as manors and monasteries. However, wattle fences were used by all classes and were the most common type of fence. They were made using local saplings and woven together. They were easily accessible and durable, and could even be used to make beds.  Bushes were also used as fencing, as they provided both food and protection to the garden. Gardens were typically arranged to allow for visitors, and were constructed with pathways for easy access.&lt;ref name=Renaissance /&gt;  However, it was not uncommon for the gardens to outgrow the monastery walls, and many times the gardens extended outside of the monastery and would eventually include vineyards as well.&lt;ref name=Garden /&gt;

An irrigation and water source was imperative to keeping the garden alive.  The most complicated irrigation system used canals dug into the earth. This required that the water source be placed at the highest part of the garden so gravity could aid in the distribution of the water. This was more commonly used with raised bed gardens, as the channels could run in the pathways next to the beds. Kitchen garden ponds also were used come the 14th and 15th centuries, and were meant to offer ornamental value as well.  Manure was placed in the ponds to provide fertilization and water was taken straight from the pond to water the plants.

The tools that were used at the time were similar to what gardeners use today. For instance, shears, rakes, hoes, spades, baskets, and wheel barrows were used and are still important today. There was even a tool that acted much like a watering can, called a thumb pot.  Made from clay, the thumb pot has small holes at the bottom and a thumb hole at the top.  The pot was submerged in water, and the thumb hole covered until the water was needed.  A perforated pot was also used to hang over plants for constant moisture.&lt;ref name=Renaissance /&gt;

'''Municipalities in Bolivia''' are administrative divisions of the entire national territory governed by local elections. Municipalities are the third level of administrative divisions, below [[Departments of Bolivia|departments]] and [[Provinces of Bolivia|provinces]]. Some of the provinces consist of only one municipality. In these cases the municipalities are identical to the provinces they belong to.

==History of governance==
Municipalities in Bolivia are each led by a mayor, an executive office. Mayors were appointed by the national government from 1878 to 1942 and from 1949 to 1987.&lt;ref name=WB-BC13&gt;{{Citation | publisher = World Bank | last = Burki | first = Shahid Javed |author2=Guillermo E.

In 1994, the entire territory of Bolivia was merged into municipalities, where previously only urban areas were organized as municipalities. As an effect of d[[Decentralization|ecentralization]] through the 1994 [[Law of Popular Participation]] the number of municipalities in Bolivia has risen from an initial twenty-four (in 1994) to 327 (in 2005), to 337 (at the time of the [[Bolivian regional election, 2010|2010 elections]]),&lt;ref name=Castel2010&gt;Jorge Castel, "[http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20100328_007045/nota_257_979891.htm 10 nuevos municipios elegirán a sus autoridades en los comicios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331134913/http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20100328_007045/nota_257_979891.htm |date=2010-03-31 }}," ''La Razón'', 29 Marzo 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bolivia.com/noticIAS/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia42293.asp www.bolivia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to 339 ({{as of|lc=y|August 2010}}).&lt;ref name=Aug2010&gt;{{Cite news | title = Se crean dos nuevos municipios en La Paz | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2012-01-02 | date = 2010-08-09 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20100809/se-crean-dos-nuevos-municipios-en-la-paz_84269_160598.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065547/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20100809/se-crean-dos-nuevos-municipios-en-la-paz_84269_160598.html | archivedate = 2015-05-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 327 municipalities existing after 2005, 187 are inhabited by mainly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population; 184 of these are located in the five Andean departments, with the remaining three in Santa Cruz department.&lt;ref&gt;According to a definition where a majority identify with an indigenous people and speak an indigenous language, with a two-thirds majority meeting looser criteria. {{Cite book | publisher = Vicepresidencia del Estado Plurinacional | last = Albó | first = Xavier |author2=Carlos Romero | title = Autonomías Indígenas en la realidad boliviana y su nueva Constitución | location = La Paz | date = April 2009 | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; New municipalities must have at least 10,000 residents, or 5,000 in the case of border areas.&lt;ref name=Castel2010 /&gt;

'''Nicholas Lane''' was an English [[surveying|surveyor]] and [[cartography|cartographer]], active in the early part of the seventeenth century, rising to prominence in his works for [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].

Lane's early work included a plan of Oxdownes, [[Cobham, Surrey]] dated 1618, a copy of which is held in the [[Surrey History Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www30.us.archive.org/stream/surreyarchaeol62surr#page/85/mode/2up |title=Surrey Archaeological Collections |editor-first=E.

In the 1620s he mapped land at [[Chessington]] belonging to [[Merton College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/GetRecord/SHHER_4263 |title=HER 4263 – Park Pale |publisher=Exploring Surrey's Past |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was the subject of a long running [[manor]] boundary dispute between the College's land and Royal land of [[Nonsuch Park|Nonsuch Great Park]] the part of which that subsequently became known as [[Worcester Park]]. Lane's map of 1627 documents the final resolution of the dispute, a decision subsequently re-confirmed by Charles I in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www30.us.archive.org/stream/surreyarchaeol64surr#page/85/mode/1up |title=Surrey archaeological collections |volume=64

Charles I commissioned Lane to map the proposed site of his new hunting park at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. This pre-enclosure map of [[Richmond Park]], surveyed in 1632 but completed in 1637/8, depicts the mixture of [[common land]] and private holdings and the route of the projected wall to surround the new park. Annotations on the map are believed to be in the hand of Charles I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C6019998-details |title=Surrey: Richmond.

Lane's [[Nobility|noble]] clients included [[Francis Browne, 3rd Viscount Montagu]], who, in 1635, commissioned Lane to survey his holdings at [[Cowdray House|Cowdray]], [[Easebourne Priory]] and [[Verdley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/A2A/records.aspx?cat=182-cowdray_1-2&amp;cid=1-1-2#1-1-2 |title=EASEBOURNE COWDRAY/1627 1635/6 |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1637 Lane produced several maps of areas of [[fen]]land including Great Common Fen at [[Wisbech]], others between [[Crowland]] and [[Eye, Cambridgeshire|Eye]] and a sketch map of Laddus Fen near [[Upwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C4559318 |title=Cambridgeshire: Wisbech.

A '''screened porch''' is a type of [[porch]] or similar structure on or near the exterior of a [[house]] that has been covered by [[window screen]]s in order to hinder insects, debris, and other undesirable objects from entering the area inside the screen.  Typically created to enhance the [[Quality of life|liveability]] of a structure that would otherwise be exposed to the annoyances of the outdoors, screened porches often permit residents to enjoy an indoor environment outdoors.

Screened porches can be built in a manner similar to that of [[Pole building framing|pole barns]], with the screens added after the structure of the walls and the roof is completed.  While screen porches are often attached to houses, they are sometimes built separately in order to simplify the construction process.  In order to ensure that the porch be impervious to insects and other intrusions, a [[screen door]] is typically added to facilitate entry.  Because screens can reduce the amount of light that enters the porch's interior, some screened porches are built so that the screens can be removed at times when insects and sunlight are less of a problem to the resident.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Carter, Tim.

Accessed 2013-09-12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some homeowners fill their porches with furniture and amenities typically found indoors, such as tables, chairs, and [[couch]]es, [[ceiling fan]]s, imitation hardwood floors, electrical outlets, painted elements,&lt;ref name=megan&gt;Buerger, Megan.

Homeowners sometimes use their screened porches in lieu of [[climate control]] when the latter is unavailable.  For example, when the loss of electricity prevents [[air conditioning]] systems from working, a screened porch may be a cooler [[Sleeping porch|sleeping location]].  At the same time, screened porches can be used to permit an outdoors experience while being sheltered from direct sunlight and flying insects;&lt;ref name=megan /&gt; some builders even include [[skylight]]s in their designs when a porch would otherwise be excessively dark.  Some people experience a sense of intimacy and quiet privacy when spending their leisure hours on a screened porch.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Tim.

The '''Suam–Endebess–Kitale–Eldoret Road''', is a rural road in [[Kenya]].

==Overview==
This road, together with the Ugandan road that connects to it, the [[Kapchorwa–Suam Road]], form an important transport corridor between the two countries, sometimes refereed to as the ''Kapchorwa–Suam–Endebess–Kitale–Eldoret Road Corridor''. Both people and goods move along this corridor, with Ugandans buying fuel, fertilizer, and maize seeds from Kenya and Kenyans buying bananas, sugar, electric power and rental accommodation from Uganda.&lt;ref name="Seek"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=27 March 2016|date=30 December 2015| url=http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/Kenya--Uganda-seek-transport-corridor-funds-with-eye-on-trade/-/2560/3014256/-/136xd56z/-/index.html| first=Stellar |last=Murumba |newspaper=[[The EastAfrican]]|location=Kampala|

==Updating to bitumen surface==
The governments of Kenya and Uganda though the Kenya National Highways Authority and the [[Uganda National Roads Authority]] are seeking funds from the [[African Development Bank]] to improve the road along with the Kapchorwa–Suam Road on the Ugandan side, to grade II bituminous surface with shoulders and culverts. Some parts of this road are already tarmacked. However a new bypass around the town of Eldoret is part of the planned upgrade. The contract distance on this road is {{convert|76|km|0}}.&lt;ref name="Seek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Study"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=27 March 2016|date=22 December 2015|

In August 2018, [[William Ruto]], the deputy president of Kenya, and [[Yoweri Museveni]], the president of Uganda, officially jointly kick-started the rehabilitation and improvement of this road, and the contiguous [[Kapchorwa–Suam Road]]. The projected cost estimate is US$147.3 million, financed by loans from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and African Development Fund (ADF) and counterpart funding by the Government of Kenya. The improvement to the {{convert|77|km|0}} road, is expected to last 30 months.&lt;ref name="6R"&gt;{{cite web|date=19 August 2018 | url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Museveni--Kenya-s-DP-Ruto-flag-off-Kapchorwa-Suam-/688334-4720010-b0cljcz/index.html | title=Museveni, Kenya's DP Ruto flag off Kapchorwa-Suam road project works |access-date=22 August 2018 |author=Monitor Reporter |newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="7R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=22 August 2018 | url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1483926/museveni-ruto-commission-kapchorwa-suam-road |title=Museveni, Ruto Commission Kapchorwa-Suam Road |date=19 August 2018 |first=Tracy |last=Gwambe |newspaper=[[New Vision]] |location=Kampala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General chronology ==
There are two contrasting models for supercontinent evolution through geological time. The first model theorizes that at least two separate supercontinents existed comprising [[Vaalbara]] (from ~3636 to {{nobr|2803 Ma}}) and [[Kenorland]] (from ~2720 to {{nobr|2450 Ma}}). The [[Neoarchean]] supercontinent consisted of Superia and Sclavia. These parts of Neoarchean age broke off at ~2480 and {{nobr|2312 Ma}} and portions of them later collided to form [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] (Northern Europe North America) ({{nobr|~1820 Ma}}). [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] continued to develop during the [[Mesoproterozoic]], primarily by lateral [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of juvenile arcs, and in {{nobr|~1000 Ma}} [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Nuna]] collided with other land masses, forming [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Between ~825 and {{nobr|750 Ma}} [[Rodinia]] broke apart.&lt;ref name='donnadieu'&gt;Donnadieu, Yannick et al. "A 'Snowball Earth' Climate Triggered by Continental Break-Up Through Changes in Runoff." Nature, 428 (2004): 303–306.&lt;/ref&gt; However, before completely breaking up, some fragments of Rodinia had already come together to form [[Gondwana]] (also known as Gondwanaland) by {{nobr|~608 Ma}}. [[Pangaea]] formed by {{nobr|~336 Ma}} through the collision of [[Gondwana]], Laurasia ([[Laurentia]] and [[Baltica]]), and Siberia.

The second model (Kenorland-Arctica) is based on both palaeomagnetic and geological evidence and proposes that the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from {{nobr|~2.72 Ga}} until break-up during the [[Ediacaran]] Period after {{nobr|~0.573 Ga}}. The [[plate reconstruction|reconstruction]]&lt;ref name='piper1'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "A planetary perspective on Earth evolution: Lid Tectonics before Plate Tectonics." Tectonophysics. 589 (2013): 44–56.&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the observation that palaeomagnetic poles converge to quasi-static positions for long intervals between ~2.72–2.115, 1.35–1.13, and {{nobr|0.75–0.573 Ga}} with only small peripheral modifications to the reconstruction.&lt;ref name='piper2'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "Continental velocity through geological time: the link to magmatism, crustal accretion and episodes of global cooling." Geoscience Frontiers. 4 (2013): 7–36.&lt;/ref&gt; During the intervening periods, the poles conform to a unified apparent polar wander path. Because this model shows that exceptional demands on the paleomagnetic data are satisfied by prolonged quasi-integrity, it must be regarded as superseding the first model proposing multiple diverse continents, although the first phase (Protopangea) essentially incorporates [[Vaalbara]] and [[Kenorland]] of the first model. The explanation for the prolonged duration of the Protopangea-Paleopangea supercontinent appears to be that [[lid tectonics]] (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) prevailed during [[Precambrian]] times. [[Plate tectonics]] as seen on the contemporary Earth became dominant only during the latter part of geological times.&lt;ref name=piper2 /&gt;

The [[Phanerozoic]] supercontinent Pangaea began to break up {{nobr|215 Ma}} and is still doing so today. Because Pangaea is the most recent of Earth's supercontinents, it is the most well known and understood. Contributing to Pangaea's popularity in the classroom is the fact that its reconstruction is almost as simple as fitting the present continents bordering the Atlantic-type oceans like puzzle pieces.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

== Supercontinent cycles ==
A [[supercontinent cycle]] is the break-up of one supercontinent and the development of another, which takes place on a global scale.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Supercontinent cycles are not the same as the [[Wilson cycle]], which is the opening and closing of an individual oceanic basin. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of Pangaea and Rodinia.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

Secular trends such as [[carbonatite]]s, [[granulite]]s, [[eclogite]]s, and [[greenstone belt]] deformation events are all possible indicators of [[Precambrian]] supercontinent cyclicity, although the Protopangea-Paleopangea solution implies that [[Phanerozoic]] style of supercontinent cycles did not operate during these times. Also there are instances where these secular trends have a weak, uneven or lack of imprint on the supercontinent cycle; secular methods for supercontinent reconstruction will produce results that have only one explanation and each explanation for a trend must fit in with the rest.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

==Supercontinents and volcanism==
[[File:FigureSlabAvalanche.jpg|thumb|As the slab is subducted into the mantle, the more dense material will break off and sink to the lower mantle creating a discontinuity elsewhere known as a slab avalanche.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;]]
[[File:FigureSupercontinentBreakup.jpg|thumb|The effects of mantle plumes possibly caused by slab avalanches elsewhere in the lower mantle on the breakup and assembly of supercontinents.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;]]

The causes of supercontinent assembly and dispersal are thought to be driven by [[convection]] processes in the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Approximately 660&amp;nbsp;km into the mantle, a discontinuity occurs, affecting the surface crust through processes like [[Mantle plume|plume]]s and "[[superplume]]s". When a slab of subducted crust is denser than the surrounding mantle, it sinks to the discontinuity. Once the slabs build up, they will sink through to the lower mantle in what is known as a "slab avalanche". This displacement at the discontinuity will cause the lower mantle to compensate and rise elsewhere. The rising mantle can form a plume or superplume.

Besides having compositional effects on the upper mantle by replenishing the [[Incompatible element|large-ion lithophile elements]], volcanism affects plate movement.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; The plates will be moved towards a geoidal low perhaps where the slab avalanche occurred and pushed away from the geoidal high that can be caused by the plumes or superplumes. This causes the continents to push together to form supercontinents and was evidently the process that operated to cause the early continental crust to aggregate into Protopangea.&lt;ref name='piper3'&gt;Piper, J.D.A. "Protopangea: palaeomangetic definition of Earth's oldest (Mid-Archaean-Paleoproterozoic) supercontinent." Journal of Geodynamics. 50 (2010): 154–165.&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersal of supercontinents is caused by the accumulation of heat underneath the crust due to the rising of very large [[convection cell]]s or plumes, and a massive heat release resulted in the final break-up of Paleopangea.&lt;ref name='piper4'&gt;Piper, J.D.A., "Paleopangea in Meso-Neoproterozoic times: the paleomagnetic evidence and implications to continental integrity, supercontinent from and Eocambrian break-up." Journal of Geodynamics. 50 (2010): 191–223.&lt;/ref&gt; Accretion occurs over geoidal lows that can be caused by avalanche slabs or the downgoing limbs of convection cells. Evidence of the accretion and dispersion of supercontinents is seen in the geological rock record.

The influence of known volcanic eruptions does not compare to that of [[flood basalt]]s. The timing of flood basalts has corresponded with large-scale continental break-up. However, due to a lack of data on the time required to produce flood basalts, the climatic impact is difficult to quantify. The timing of a single lava flow is also undetermined. These are important factors on how flood basalts influenced [[paleoclimate]].&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinents and plate tectonics==
Global [[paleogeography]] and plate interactions as far back as [[Pangaea]] are relatively well understood today. However, the evidence becomes more sparse further back in geologic history. [[Paleomagnetism|Marine magnetic anomalies]], [[passive margin]] match-ups, geologic interpretation of [[orogenic belt]]s, paleomagnetism, [[paleobiogeography]] of fossils, and distribution of climatically sensitive strata are all methods to obtain evidence for continent locality and indicators of environment throughout time.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

[[Phanerozoic]] (541 Ma to present) and [[Precambrian]] ({{nobr|4.6 Ga}} to {{nobr|541 Ma}}) had primarily [[passive margin]]s and detrital [[zircon]]s (and [[orogenic]] [[granite]]s), whereas the tenure of Pangaea contained few.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Matching edges of continents are where passive margins form. The edges of these continents may rift. At this point, [[seafloor spreading]] becomes the driving force. Passive margins are therefore born during the break-up of supercontinents and die during supercontinent assembly. Pangaea's supercontinent cycle is a good example for the efficiency of using the presence, or lack of, these entities to record the development, tenure, and break-up of supercontinents. There is a sharp decrease in passive margins between 500 and {{nobr|350 Ma}} during the timing of Pangaea's assembly. The tenure of Pangaea is marked by a low number of passive margins during 336 to {{nobr|275 Ma,}} and its break-up is indicated accurately by an increase in passive margins.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt;

[[Orogenic belt]]s can form during the assembly of continents and supercontinents. The orogenic belts present on continental blocks are classified into three different categories and have implications of interpreting geologic bodies.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Intercratonic orogenic belts are characteristic of ocean basin closure. Clear indicators of intercratonic activity contain [[ophiolite]]s and other oceanic materials that are present in the suture zone. Intracratonic orogenic belts occur as thrust belts and do not contain any oceanic material. However, the absence of ophiolites is not strong evidence for intracratonic belts, because the oceanic material can be squeezed out and eroded away in an intercratonic environment. The third kind of orogenic belt is a confined orogenic belt which is the closure of small basins. The assembly of a supercontinent would have to show intercratonic orogenic belts.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; However, interpretation of orogenic belts can be difficult.

The collision of [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] occurred in the late [[Palaeozoic]]. By this collision, the [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan mountain range]] was created, along the equator.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;  This 6000-km-long mountain range is usually referred to in two parts: the [[Variscan orogeny|Hercynian mountain range]] of the late [[Carboniferous]] makes up the eastern part, and the western part is called the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]], uplifted in the early [[Permian]]. (The existence of a flat elevated plateau like the [[Tibetan Plateau]] is under much debate.) The locality of the Variscan range made it influential to both the northern and southern hemispheres. The elevation of the Appalachians would greatly influence global atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinental climate==
Continents affect the climate of the planet drastically, with supercontinents having a larger, more prevalent influence. Continents modify global wind patterns, control ocean current paths and have a higher albedo than the oceans.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt; Winds are redirected by mountains, and albedo differences cause shifts in onshore winds. Higher elevation in continental interiors produce cooler, drier climate, the phenonmenon of [[continentality]]. This is seen today in [[Eurasia]], and rock record shows evidence of continentality in the middle of Pangaea.&lt;ref name=rogers /&gt;

===Glacial===

The term glacio-epoch refers to a long episode of glaciation on Earth over millions of years.&lt;ref name='eyles'&gt;Eyles, Nick. "Glacio-epochs and the Supercontinent Cycle after ~3.0 Ga: Tectonic Boundary Conditions for Glaciation." Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 258 (2008): 89–129. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciers have major implications on the climate particularly through [[sea level change]]. Changes in the position and elevation of the continents, the [[paleomagnetism|paleolatitude]] and ocean circulation affect the glacio-epochs. There is an association between the rifting and breakup of continents and supercontinents and glacio-epochs.&lt;ref name=eyles /&gt; According to the first model for Precambrian supercontinents described above the breakup of [[Kenorland]] and [[Rodinia]] were associated with the [[Paleoproterozoic]] and [[Neoproterozoic]] glacio-epochs, respectively. In contrast, the second solution described above shows that these glaciations correlated with periods of low continental velocity and it is concluded that a fall in tectonic and corresponding volcanic activity was responsible for these intervals of global frigidity.&lt;ref name='piper2'/&gt; During the accumulation of supercontinents with times of regional uplift, glacio-epochs seem to be rare with little supporting evidence. However, the lack of evidence does not allow for the conclusion that glacio-epochs are not associated with collisional assembly of supercontinents.&lt;ref name=eyles /&gt; This could just represent a preservation bias.

During the late [[Ordovician]] (~458.4 Ma), the particular configuration of [[Gondwana]] may have allowed for glaciation and high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to occur at the same time.&lt;ref name='crowley'&gt;Crowley, Thomas J., "Climate Change on Tectonic Time Scales". Tectonophysics. 222 (1993): 277–294.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some geologists disagree and think that there was a temperature increase at this time. This increase may have been strongly influenced by the movement of Gondwana across the South Pole, which may have prevented lengthy snow accumulation. Although late Ordovician temperatures at the South Pole may have reached freezing, there were no ice sheets during the early [[Silurian]] {{nobr|(~443.8 Ma)}} through the late [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] {{nobr|(~330.9 Ma).}}&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt; Agreement can be met with the theory that continental snow can occur when the edge of a continent is near the pole. Therefore, Gondwana, although located tangent to the South Pole, may have experienced glaciation along its coast.&lt;ref name=crowley /&gt;

===Precipitation===

Though precipitation rates during monsoonal circulations are difficult to predict, there is evidence for a large orographic barrier within the interior of [[Pangaea]] during the late Paleozoic {{nobr|(~251.902 Ma).}} The possibility of the SW-NE trending [[Variscan orogeny|Appalachian-Hercynian Mountains]] makes the region's monsoonal circulations potentially relatable to present day monsoonal circulations surrounding the [[Tibetan Plateau]], which is known to positively influence the magnitude of monsoonal periods within [[Eurasia]]. It is therefore somewhat expected that lower topography in other regions of the supercontinent during the [[Jurassic]] would negatively influence precipitation variations. The breakup of supercontinents may have affected local precipitation.&lt;ref name="baum"&gt;Baum, Steven K., and Thomas J. Crowely. "Milankovitch Fluctuations on Supercontinents." Geophysical Research Letters. 19 (1992): 793–796. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; When any supercontinent breaks up, there will be an increase in precipitation runoff over the surface of the continental land masses, increasing [[Silicate mineral|silicate]] [[weathering]] and the consumption of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=donnadieu /&gt;

===Temperature===

Even though during the [[Archean|Archaean]] solar radiation was reduced by 30 percent and the [[Cambrian]]-[[Precambrian]] boundary by six percent, the Earth has only experienced three ice ages throughout the Precambrian.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt; Erroneous conclusions are more likely to be made when models are limited to one climatic configuration (which is usually present day).&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

Cold winters in continental interiors are due to rate ratios of radiative cooling (greater) and heat transport from continental rims. To raise winter temperatures within continental interiors, the rate of heat transport must increase to become greater than the rate of radiative cooling. Through climate models, alterations in atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content and ocean heat transport are not comparatively effective.&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models suggest that values were low in the late [[Cenozoic]] and [[Carboniferous]]-[[Permian]] glaciations. Although early [[Paleozoic]] values are much larger (more than ten percent higher than that of today). This may be due to high seafloor spreading rates after the breakup of Precambrian supercontinents and the lack of land plants as a carbon sink.&lt;ref name=crowley /&gt;

During the late [[Permian]], it is expected that seasonal [[Pangaea]]n temperatures varied drastically. Subtropic summer temperatures were warmer than that of today by as much as 6–10 degrees and mid-latitudes in the winter were less than −30 degrees Celsius. These seasonal changes within the supercontinent were influenced by the large size of Pangaea. And, just like today, coastal regions experienced much less variation.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

During the [[Jurassic]], summer temperatures did not rise above zero degrees Celsius along the northern rim of [[Laurasia]], which was the northernmost part of Pangaea (the southernmost portion of Pangaea was Gondwana). Ice-rafted [[dropstone]]s sourced from Russia are indicators of this northern boundary. The [[Jurassic]] is thought to have been approximately 10 degrees Celsius warmer along 90 degrees East [[paleomagnetism|paleolongitude]] compared to the present temperature of today's central [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

===Milankovitch cycles===

Many studies of the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]] fluctuations during supercontinent time periods have focused on the Mid-[[Cretaceous]].  Present amplitudes of [[Milankovitch cycles]] over present day Eurasia may be mirrored in both the southern and northern hemispheres of the supercontinent Pangaea.  Climate modeling shows that summer fluctuations varied 14–16 degrees Celsius on Pangaea, which is similar or slightly higher than summer temperatures of Eurasia during the [[Pleistocene]]. The largest-amplitude Milankovitch cycles are expected to have been at mid- to high-latitudes during the [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]].&lt;ref name=baum /&gt;

==Proxies==
[[File:FigureUPbZircons.jpg|thumb|U–Pb ages of 5,246 concordant detrital zircons from 40 of Earth's major rivers&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, Ian H., Charlotte M. Allen. "Formation of Supercontinents Linked to Increases in Atmospheric Oxygen." Nature. 1 (2008): 554–558.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Granites]] and detrital [[zircon]]s have notably similar and episodic appearances in the rock record. Their fluctuations correlate with Precambrian supercontinent cycles. The U–Pb [[zircon]] dates from orogenic granites are among the most reliable aging determinants. Some issues exist with relying on granite sourced zircons, such as a lack of evenly globally sourced data and the loss of granite zircons by sedimentary coverage or [[pluton]]ic consumption. Where granite zircons are less adequate, detrital zircons from [[sandstone]]s appear and make up for the gaps. These detrital zircons are taken from the sands of major modern rivers and their drainage basins.&lt;ref name=bradley /&gt; Oceanic magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic data are the primary resources used for reconstructing continent and supercontinent locations back to roughly 150 Ma.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

==Supercontinents and atmospheric gases==
Plate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere (specifically [[greenhouse gas]]es) are the two most prevailing factors present within the [[geologic time scale]]. [[Continental drift]] influences both cold and warm climatic episodes. Atmospheric circulation and climate are strongly influenced by the location and formation of continents and megacontinents. Therefore, continental drift influences mean global temperature.&lt;ref name=flutaeu /&gt;

Oxygen levels of the [[Archean|Archaean]] Eon were negligible and today they are roughly 21 percent. It is thought that the Earth's oxygen content has risen in stages: six or seven steps that are timed very closely to the development of Earth's supercontinents.&lt;ref name=campbell /&gt;
# Continents collide
# Supermountains form
# Erosion of supermountains
# Large quantities of minerals and nutrients wash out to open ocean
# Explosion of marine algae life (partly sourced from noted nutrients)
# Mass amounts of oxygen produced during photosynthesis
The process of Earth's increase in atmospheric oxygen content is theorized to have started with continent-continent collision of huge land masses forming supercontinents, and therefore possibly supercontinent mountain ranges (supermountains). These supermountains would have eroded, and the mass amounts of nutrients, including [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]], would have washed into oceans, just as we see happening today. The oceans would then be rich in nutrients essential to photosynthetic organisms, which would then be able to respire mass amounts of oxygen. There is an apparent direct relationship between orogeny and the atmospheric oxygen content). There is also evidence for increased sedimentation concurrent with the timing of these mass oxygenation events, meaning that the organic carbon and [[pyrite]] at these times were more likely to be buried beneath sediment and therefore unable to react with the free oxygen. This sustained the atmospheric oxygen increases.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt;

During this time, {{nobr|2.65 Ga}} there was an increase in [[Isotopes of molybdenum|molybdenum isotope]] fractionation. It was temporary, but supports the increase in atmospheric oxygen because molybdenum isotopes require free oxygen to fractionate. Between 2.45 and {{nobr|2.32 Ga,}} the second period of oxygenation occurred, it has been called the 'great oxygenation event.' There are many pieces of evidence that support the existence of this event, including [[red beds]] appearance {{nobr|2.3 Ga}} (meaning that Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was being produced and became an important component in soils). The third oxygenation stage approximately {{nobr|1.8 Ga}} is indicated by the disappearance of [[iron]] formations. [[Neodymium]] isotopic studies suggest that iron formations are usually from continental sources, meaning that dissolved Fe and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; had to be transported during continental erosion. A rise in atmospheric oxygen prevents Fe transport, so the lack of iron formations may have been due to an increase in oxygen. The fourth oxygenation event, roughly {{nobr|0.6 Ga,}} is based on modeled rates of [[Isotopes of sulfur|sulfur isotopes]] from marine carbonate-associated [[sulfate]]s. An increase (near doubled concentration) of sulfur isotopes, which is suggested by these models, would require an increase in oxygen content of the deep oceans. Between 650 and {{nobr|550 Ma}} there were three increases in ocean oxygen levels, this period is the fifth oxygenation stage. One of the reasons indicating this period to be an oxygenation event is the increase in [[redox]]-sensitive molybdenum in black [[shale]]s. The sixth event occurred between 360 and {{nobr|260 Ma}} and was identified by models suggesting shifts in the balance of &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in sulfates and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in carbonates, which were strongly influenced by an increase in atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gday-mate-17-billion-year-old-chunk-of-north-america-found-in-australia/ar-AAv5aZn|title=G'day mate: 1.7-billion-year-old chunk of North America found in Australia|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125134510/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/gday-mate-17-billion-year-old-chunk-of-north-america-found-in-australia/ar-AAv5aZn|archivedate=2018-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Surveying and Mapping Act''' was assented to by the [[President of Pakistan]] in May 2014 after being passed by the  [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] in order to regulate [[geospatial]] data.&lt;ref name="isda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idsa.in/policybrief/beyond-cartographic-assertion-pakistan-occupied-kashmir_psingh_290716|title=Beyond Cartographic Assertion: A Roadmap on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir|last=Singh|first=Priyanka|date=2016-08-01|publisher=[[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]]|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2012, the Land Surveying and Mapping Bill was proposed to entrust all mapping responsibilities in Pakistan to the [[Survey of Pakistan]]. The proposed bill would require all government and private agencies involved in surveying and mapping to register with the Survey of Pakistan; failure to comply would be punished with one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to one million [[Pakistani rupees|rupees]].&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/765795|title=Pakistanis lost without maps|last=Haider|first=Murtaza|date=2012-11-21|access-date=2018-05-23|newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|publisher=[[Pakistan Herald Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence]] argued that the mapping activities of unauthorised firms could go unchecked without a law or regulatory authority. The objectives of the proposed bill would be to prevent the unauthorised mapping of sensitive areas (a potential security risk), prevent damage to survey markers, avoid duplication of mapping efforts, and to make the Survey of Pakistan a [[National Mapping Agency]].&lt;ref name="brecorder"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.brecorder.com/market-data/stocks-a-bonds/0/1257979/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011609/https://www.brecorder.com/market-data/stocks-a-bonds/0/1257979/|date=2012-11-14|title=Survey of Pakistan to be made national mapping agency: draft|last=Ghumman|first=Mushtaq|newspaper=[[Business Recorder]]|place=Karachi, Pakistan|archive-date=2015-06-16|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was passed by Pakistan's National Assembly in 2014.&lt;ref name="thewire"&gt;{{cite news|date=2016-05-18|access-date=2018-05-23|title=Pakistan Objects to India's Map Bill But its Own 2014 Law Regulates Geospatial Data Too|newspaper=[[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]]|place=New Delhi, India|publisher=Foundation for Independent Journalism|last=Mitra|first=Devirupa|url=https://thewire.in/external-affairs/pakistani-complaint-to-un-over-geospatial-bill-is-a-silly-issue-experts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Syed Ali Asjad Naqvi, Research and Training Director at the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP), expressed bafflement towards the proposed bill, stating that it will hinder ongoing humanitarian efforts which employ mapping. Naqvi added that bills should be proposed by public representatives rather than the military.&lt;ref name="techpres"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/23188/pakistan-considering-bill-would-ban-independent-mapping-projects|title=Pakistan Considering Bill that Would Ban Independent Mapping Projects|last=Dad|first=Nighat|author-link=Nighat Dad|date=2012-11-28|newspaper=[[techPresident]]|access-date=2018-05-23|publisher=Personal Democracy Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Svobodny''' ({{lang-ru|Свобо́дный}}) was a [[Russia]]n [[rocket]] launch site located approximately 15km north of [[Svobodny, Amur Oblast]]. The [[cosmodrome]] was originally constructed as a launch site for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s called ''Svobodny-18''. It was initially selected as a replacement for [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became independent as [[Kazakhstan]] after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. However the development of Svobodny was subsequently ended in 2007 in favour of a totally new space port, the [[Vostochny Cosmodrome]].

The breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] left the primary cosmodrome, to be used by successor state [[Russia]], at Baikonur in a foreign country, Kazakhstan. An arrangement to rent the facilities for $115 million annually was arranged. Launches were moved to other facilities, like [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], but this location is too far north to be useful for many launches. Studies for a far-east location closer to the latitude of Baikonur started,{{when|date=November 2014}} and initially settled on the existing missile base at Svobodny. This was located near the railway station of [[Ledyanaya railway station|Ledyanaya]], and had been used for several decades by the 27th rocket division of Strategic Rocket Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asimov.esrin.esa.it/export/SPECIALS/ESA_Permanent_Mission_in_Russia/SEMMBS0XDYD_0.html|title=Svobodny|publisher=ESA permanent mission to Russia|date=22 September 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070609125952/http://asimov.esrin.esa.it/export/SPECIALS/ESA_Permanent_Mission_in_Russia/SEMMBS0XDYD_0.html|archivedate=9 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1994 president Yeltsin visited the town of [[Blagoveshensk]] and the modification of the launch pads in the site began shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The rebirth of the Russian space program: 50 years after Sputnik|page=228|last=Harvey|first=Brian|year=2007|publisher=Springer Praxis|isbn=978-0-387-71354-0 |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71356-4_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1996 the Russian president issued a decree formally declaring the site as a cosmodrome.&lt;ref&gt;Russian space chronology – from Yuri Gagarin to the international space station&lt;/ref&gt;

Launches from Svobodny began in 1997, primarily the ''[[Start-1]]'' type, converted ICBMs. The facilities can also host rockets of the [[Rokot]] ([[UR-100N|SS-19]] based) class. Only five launches have taken place at the underused Svobodny site, the best known being the [[Israel]]i [[EROS B]] satellite on 25 April 2006 aboard a Start class rocket.

In 2005, after the lease renewal of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the [[Russian Space Agency]] decided it did not require a second space launch complex, and in February 2007 president [[Vladimir Putin]] ordered Svobodny closed.&lt;ref name="defensebrief"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ionin|first=Andrey|title=Russia's Space Program in 2006: Some Progress but No Clear Direction|journal=[[Moscow Defense Brief]]|publisher=[[Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies]]|issue=2/2007|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, a [[ukaz|presidential decree]] formalized the closure of the launch facility in Svobodny. According to the Russian press, in the previous three years, government investments in Svobodny reached 350 million rubles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The following '''telephone numbers in Armenia''' are destination codes for international calls terminating in Armenia as well as the procedures for dialing internationally from within Armenia.

==Dialing plan==
The dialing plan is as below:

===Calling Armenia from abroad===
From abroad to [[Yerevan]], regions, mobile network, [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] fixed telephone network and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] mobile network:
   '''+ 374 + Destination Code + Subscriber Number'''           (to Yerevan, regions)
   '''+ 374 + Mobile Network Code + Mobile Subscriber Number''' (to mobile network)
   '''+ 374 + 47 + Subscriber Number'''                         (to Artsakh fixed telephone network)
   '''+ 374 + 97 + Subscriber Number'''                         (to Artsakh mobile network)

===Calling from Armenia===
From [[Yerevan]], regions, mobile network and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] to abroad:
   '''00 + Country Code + Destination Code + Subscriber Number'''

===Calling within Armenia and Artsakh===
   '''0 + Destination Code + Subscriber Number'''

===Calling Artsakh from Armenia===
From [[Yerevan]], regions and mobile network to [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] fixed telephone network and [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] mobile network:
   '''0 + 47 + Subscriber Number'''                      (to Artsakh fixed telephone network)
   '''0 + 97 + Subscriber Number'''                      (to Artsakh mobile network)

===Example===
An example for calling telephones in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]] is as follows:
                '''Subscriber Number'''  (within Yerevan)
   '''    0 + 10 + Subscriber Number'''  (within Armenia and Artsakh)
   '''+ 374 + 10 + Subscriber Number'''  (outside Armenia and Artsakh)

'''Trehörningen''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "The Triangle"&lt;ref&gt;''Trehörningen'' literary translates to "The Three-Corner", a name most likely referring to the three "bays" of the laks.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a small [[lake]] located in the municipality [[Huddinge]] in southern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  As part of the [[Tyresån]] [[lake system]], Trehörningen receives water from Lake [[Gömmaren]] and supplies water to [[Ågestasjön|Lake Ågesta]].

== History ==
The area surrounding Trehörningen, [[Orlången]] and [[Ågestasjön]], is a fine example of a historical landscape evolving from a prehistoric settlement into a traditional agricultural village discontinued in the 19th century, encompassing structures from all interjacent eras. It is one of the few areas in Stockholm which escaped the creation of the widespread 20th century suburbs around the historical city of Stockholm, and, consequently, the area is considered as having cultural and historical values of national interest. The landscape include open cultivated and grazed fields next to steep rocks, pine and deciduous forests. Several grave fields, hillforts, and other archaeological structures, reflects the area was connected to the [[Baltic Sea]] in prehistoric times. During medieval times, the area contained the only farmstead exempt from land dues (i.e. owned by a member of the [[Swedish nobility]]) in Huddinge. In the area traces from the [[Stone Age]] and some [[cairn]]s from the [[Bronze Age]] have been found, and parts of the present road network is left unaltered for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="lansmuseum"&gt;[[Stockholm County Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Three fourth of the catchment area is used for settlements, including the commercial centre of Huddinge (''Huddinge Centrum'') and half a dozen residential neighbourhoods.  Nevertheless, the shores of the lakes are of significant recreational importance as they border the [[Orlången Nature Reserve]] and contain several cliffs popular for bathing and angling.  Both major inflows, [[Fullerstaån]] and [[Solfagradiket]], are guided through culverts under neighbouring settlements, but reaches the lake through open ditches.  Today, motor-driven boats are not permitted on the lake and restrictions are imposed on angling.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-site"&gt;Huddinges sjöar (site)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
The lake used to receive waste water from both settlements and other neighbouring operations 1951-1971, but the inflow is today reduced to [[stormwater]] - the old usage still echoing in [[oxygen depletion]] and [[phosphorus]] release at the lake bottom, and [[algae bloom]] and limited water transparency.  To restrict future influence to a minimum, reduction in incoming flows are given priority rather than any actions to the lake itself.  The lake was drudged in 1975-76, the product of which was pumped over to the lake's western bay where embankments prevents it from pouring back into the lake.  Additionally, [[reed bed]]s were removed and other measures were taken to clean the lake.  Vegetation has been cleared annually since.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-site" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
As a locale for birds, the lake was significantly deteriorated by the mid-1970s drudging{{Clarify|date=April 2015|reason=Should this be 'dredging'?}} which caused a colony of [[black-headed gull]] to disappear.  Today, the lake has a regular presence of [[mallard]], [[Eurasian coot]], [[great crested grebe]], [[common goldeneye]]; regular visits of [[common gull]], [[Ardea (genus)|heron]], [[common merganser]], [[osprey]], [[marsh warbler]], [[great reed-warbler]], and [[grasshopper warbler]]; and some uncommon guests such as [[common kingfisher]] and [[black-throated diver]]; the lake itself thus still being of [[ornithology|ornithological]] interest, while the forests surrounding the lake attracts [[long-tailed tit]] and [[lesser spotted woodpecker]].&lt;ref name="Huddinge-site" /&gt;

[[Aquatic plant]]s, in addition to [[Phragmites|reed]] and [[Schoenoplectus|club-rush]], includes several species of [[Lemna|duckweed]] and [[Stellaria media|chickenwort]].  Along the shore are some 30 species of trees and plants, including [[alder]], [[birch]], [[aspen]], [[spruce]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[loosestrife]], [[Myosotis scorpioides|forget-me-nots]], [[Potentilla|cinquefoils]], and [[water-pepper]].&lt;ref name="Huddinge-site" /&gt;

The [[common frog]] and [[common toad]] have been observed by the lake, as have [[bat]]s such as the [[northern bat]] and [[Daubenton's bat]].  No observations of [[Odonata|dragonflies]] had been reported until July 2014, when two American visitors saw a small red dragonfly and a large black dragonfly.&lt;ref name="Huddinge-site" /&gt;
