'''''A Number''''' is a 2002 play by the [[English people|English]] [[playwright]] [[Caryl Churchill]] which addresses the subject of [[human cloning]] and identity, especially [[nature versus nurture]]. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one.

==Contextual Information==
''A Number'' is an original work published in 2002 in association with the Royal Court Theatre of London.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Caryl. A Number. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
The play was written during a time of public debate over the ethics of cloning. The cloning of [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] the sheep, the creation of human embryos at [[Ocata Therapeutics|Advanced Cell Technology]], and the cloning of a kitten&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Warm and Fuzzy Forever? With Cloning, Kitty - New York Times." The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia. 27 Feb. 2009 &lt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=.&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to controversy concerning possible human cloning.

==Plot synopsis==
A Number is set in the near future where human cloning has become possible, albeit still looked down upon and possibly illegal. 

Bernard 2 discovers that he is actually a clone of his "brother" (Bernard 1), who was sent to a clinical home years before by his father (Salter) after the suicide of his mother, which left him in a constant state of fear and pain. Salter explains that he agreed to a cloning experiment to try again at parenting another version of his son. But, unbeknownst to Salter, the doctors had unethically made several more clones. Salter decides that they should sue the doctors, which soothes the shaken Bernard 2. 

In the next scene, angry Bernard 1 visits Salter for the first time since his childhood while Bernard 2 is away. He has learned about the clones, and is furious at his father for doing it. Salter then admits that the clones were meant to give him another chance at raising Bernard, without any of his many parental mistakes. Bernard 1 grows increasingly agitated, before threatening to murder Bernard 2. 

Later, after Bernard 1 has left, Bernard 2 returns, having met Bernard 1 in the park. He has learned the truth about the situation, and now hates Salter for what he has done. Bernard 2 decides to leave the country for a while, both to get away from Salter and because he fears that Bernard 1 might try to kill him. Salter tries to convince him not to go, or at least to come back soon, but Bernard 2 refuses, saying he needs to go. 

Some time later, Bernard 1 returns and tells Salter that he followed and killed Bernard 2 after he left the country. Salter, stricken with grief, demands to know the details, but Bernard 1 refuses to say anything. Bernard 1 then leaves and kills himself, leaving Salter alone. Salter then decides to meet the other clones of his son, starting with the one named Michael Black. Michael, who never knew Salter, is a happily married maths teacher with three children. He is completely undisturbed that he is a clone, and tells Salter that he does not care. Salter demands to know more about him, particularly about something personal and unique, but Michael cannot answer. Salter then becomes unsatisfied with what Michael can give him.

==Characters==
*'''Salter''': a man in his early sixties, he was married and had one son. His wife committed suicide by throwing herself under a train when their son was only two. He would raise their son alone, but due to his drinking and the son's issues, he would neglect him and eventually send him away. He would then clone his son (Bernard 2) in an attempt to try again to be a better father. A pathological liar, he attempts to hide the truth of what he's done from his sons. 
*'''Bernard (B2)''': His son, thirty-five, intended clone of his first son, made to replace his original son, Bernard 1. He is very mild-mannered and emotional. 
*'''Bernard (B1)''': His son, forty. First and original son of Salter. He was a difficult and disturbed child, who Salter sent away when he was 4. He would grow to have an explosive temper and hate Salter for what he did to him. 
*'''Michael Black''': His son, thirty-five. An unauthorized clone of Salter’s first son. He is married with three children, the oldest aged twelve, and is a mathematics teacher.

==Staging==
Churchill gives no stage directions and no indication of a setting for the play. In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a “bare blank design” with “no relation to domestic realism.” &lt;ref name="Jongh, Nicholas 2002"&gt;De Jongh, Nicholas. "A Number." Evening Standard [London] 27 Sept. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design. Salter always wore a rumpled looking suit, sometimes expensive looking, but sometimes not. The various Bernards usually wore jeans and a T-shirt, but sometimes a sweatshirt.&lt;ref&gt;Basset, Kate. "A Number". ''Independent on Sunday'' [London] 29 Sept. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Nikolaevich Volkov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''Александр Николаевич Волков'''; August 31, 1886, in [[Fergana]] &amp;ndash; December 17, 1957, in [[Tashkent]]) was an avant-garde [[Russia]]n painter and [[poet]].

==Early life==
Alexander Volkov was born in [[Fergana]], near [[Tashkent]] in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Энциклопедия Кругосвет: Универсальная научно-популярная онлайн-энциклопедия|language=Russian|title=ВОЛКОВ, АЛЕКСАНДР НИКОЛАЕВИЧ|accessdate=November 15, 2012|url=http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/VOLKOV_ALEKSANDR_NIKOLAEVICH.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Nikolai Ivanovich Volkov, was a lieutenant-general in the medical corps, and his mother, Feodosia Filippovna Volkova-Davydova, by some accounts, was a gypsy camp follower.&lt;ref name=apchinskaya&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Colour of Pomegranate|journal=The Tretyakov Gallery Magazine|number=2|year=2007|author=Natalia Apchinskaya|publisher=Tretyakov Gallery|location=Moscow|url=http://www.tg-m.ru/img/mag/2007/2/062-069.pdf|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1888 and 1900 he studied in primary schools in Tashkent. Between 1900-1905 Volkov was enrolled with the Second Orenburg Cadets Corps. In 1906, he started his college study in the Physics and Mathematics Faculty at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg University]],&lt;ref name=bowlt&gt;{{cite journal|title="A Silken Whirlwind of Unbridled Colors": Aleksander Volkov and HIs Pictorial Legacy|author=John E. Bowlt|format = PDF|url=http://www.alexander-volkov.com/f/Volkov_Bowlt1.pdf|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abandoned it two years later to join the studio of [[Vladimir Makovsky]], who at the time was an instructor at the Superior School of Art at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; A big influence on his artistic development was his attendance at the private studio of M.D. Bernstein, where some of his teachers were [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Ivan Bilibin]] and [[Leonid Sherwood]].&lt;ref name=yermakova&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Tretyakov Gallery Magazine|number=2|year=2007|title=On the 120th Anniversary of Alexander Volkov's Birth|publisher=Tretyakov Gallery|format = PDF|url=http://www.tg-m.ru/img/mag/2007/2/062-069.pdf|author=Tatyana Yermakova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Volkov moved to Kiev to train at the Kiev School of Arts.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1915, the painter married Maria Ilyinichna Taratutina (1898–1925). In 1916, after finishing his training, Volkov returned to Uzbekistan where he lived till the end of his life.

==Artistic career==
[[File:Volkov Persian woman.jpg|right|thumb|Persian Woman (1916)]]
From 1916 his style was [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionistic]] and then [[Neo-primitive|neo-primitivist]] which derived partly from Russian sign painting. Initially Volkov was under the strong influence of [[Mikhail Vrubel|Vrubel]]&lt;ref name=theo&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: Theodora Clarke meets Meruyert Kaliyeva at Christie’s to discuss their Alexander Volkov exhibition|url=http://www.russianartandculture.com/interview-theodora-clarke-discusses-the-current-alexander-volkov-exhibition-with-christies-meruyert-kaliyeva/#|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012|work=Russian Art and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Roerich|Roerich]]. Then he started painting in the same way as early [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]. After moving to Uzbekistan, Volkov's works became marked by the influence of [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[André Derain|Derain]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]]. Then he went on to experimenting in the field of near-abstract art and became close in his manner to [[Vladimir Tatlin|Tatlin]] and [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]].

In 1919 Volkov was named the first director of the State Museum of Arts of Central Asia, which had been given the former palace of the Grand Duke [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Constantine Romanov]] in Tashkent to house its collection.

From 1920 to 1946, Volkov taught at the Tashkent School of Arts.&lt;ref name=gse&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|title=Волков Александр Николаевич|language=Russian|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%20%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87/|year=1969–78|publisher=Советская энциклопедия|location=Moscow|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1930, Volkov was a member of a local union ''Masters of the New East''.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

In 1931-1932 Volkov organized the so-called Volkov's Brigade of painters, art critics and journalists, with the purpose of creating objects and propaganda of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savitskycollection.org/Russian/Galleries/Uzbeks/Volkov_Gallery_R.html|title=Alexander Volkov|publisher=Karakalpak Museum of Art|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Volkov went to Moscow to participate in his first big exhibition held at the State Museum of Arts of the Peoples of the Orient. After this exhibition, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the [[Tretyakov Gallery|State Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Russian Museum|State Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg.

That same year, Volkov's picture ''Morning in Shakhimardan'' was for the first time exhibited in the West, at the Soviet Art exhibition in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="ArtInstitute1934"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Drevin|author2=Udaltsova|author3=Kurdov|others=Foreword by Fiske Kimball. Introduction and Catalogue by Christian Brinton|title=The Art of Soviet Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGstAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 November 2012|year=1934|publisher=American Russian Institute for Cultural Relations|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1934 - 1936 the political campaign of fighting formalism in art began in USSR. Volkov's art was declared formalist and anti-socialist.&lt;ref name=bowlt/&gt; His canvases were labeled as counterrevolutionary.

In 1946 Volkov was awarded the title of the [[People's Artist of the Uzbek SSR|People's Artist of Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name=museumnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.ru/N30365|work=Museum News|script-title=ru:Выставка А.Волкова в Третьяковской галерее на Крымском Валу|date=March 15, 2007|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the campaign against free-thinking artists, writers and painters began in the USSR following orders from [[Stalin]], Volkov along with writer [[Mikhail Zoshenko]], poet [[Anna Akhmatova]], painters [[Alexander Osmerkin]] and [[Robert Falk]] was labeled as an anti-communist formalist and abstractionist. He was fired from all his posts, lost all his earnings and money, and was committed to living in full isolation.&lt;ref name=museumnews/&gt;

In the following three years, all of Volkov's pictures were removed from the leading Russian museums. Indeed, until his death in 1957, the leaders of the Uzbekistan Union of Painters, after orders from Moscow, fully isolated Volkov from any contact with any painters, art critics and lovers of art who chanced to come to Tashkent. To anyone who wanted to meet Volkov, they declared that the painter was too severely ill to see them.

===Style===
Volkov's style was a mixture of Modernism and traditional Russian art. Much of his work has been informed by [[Cubo-Futurism]]. Volkov, as an ethnic Russian who lived most of his life in Turkestan, often felt himself an outsider, yet was a keen observer of the daily life. This lends him a feeling of celebration and joy. Despite Vrubel's influence on his style and composition, he did not succumb to the former's preoccupation with tragedy.&lt;ref name=theo/&gt; Instead, referring to his generation as "nomads", he found joy in the Uzbek land, and the desert was a metaphor for the familiar and melodic, so distant from Vrubel's agonies.&lt;ref name=bowlt/&gt;

In his undergraduate years as a biology student at St Petersburg University, he was fascinated by the microscope and its revelation of the ''harmony, beauty and majesty of living matter'', resulting in the crystalline structure of his compositions.&lt;ref name=bowlt/&gt;

Volkov, too, learned from the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] aesthetic, and was interested in frescoes and murals. He considered his work as a contribution to the natural architecture of Uzbekistan, although he only received one major fresco commission, that of the Turkestan Pavilion at the ''All Russian Agricultural Exhibition'' in Moscow (1923).&lt;ref name=bowlt/&gt;

Religious - both [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Paganism|pagan]] - themes colour Volkov's work. For example, his ''Lamentation'' (1921) is nominally about the bereavement of Christ's mother, yet depicts three bare-breasted women that hearken to the local legend of a god whose death is lamented by these women.&lt;ref name=theo/&gt; At the same time, this was a severely dissident action on the part of the artist during a period when the Bolsheviks were busy destroying houses of worship, which speaks to his adherence to the principle of freedom of individual belief.&lt;ref name=bowlt/&gt;

Volkov was keen to depict the quotidian rhythms and viewscapes of Turkestani life. He painted tea-houses (''chaikhanas''), caravans, roads, mountains. He would spend hours walking across the country, making studies and then painting them intensively, irritable at any interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Christie's|title=SALE 8003 / LOT 75: Alexander Volkov: Kok-su mountain river|url=http://m.christies.com/sale/lot/sale/23168/lot/5509995/p/4/from//?KSID=569bafd69f99b078f02f978bbb3971ad|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Volkov is moved by fire - by the purple and the gold. His skies are golden and the ground is multicoloured, and an unquenchable flame lurks beneath.''&lt;ref name=jura&gt;{{cite journal|script-title=ru:Живая земля: Туркестан в произведениях художника Волкова|author=Jura (Yu. I. Poslavskii)|journal=Красный звон|number=5-6|date=August 11, 1919|format = PDF|url=http://www.alexander-volkov.com/f/djura_web.pdf|accessdate=November 15, 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the art historian Alexei Sidorov said of Volkov's work: ''...by their rich colours and rhythm provide a description of the East which cannot be found elsewhere. His art is European and leftist in form. In many works, there is more Paris than Tashkent, more Matisse and Picasso than an Eastern carpet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|type = PDF|publisher=[[Sotheby's]]|year=2012|title=Important Russian Art, Lot 22: Aleksandr Volkov - Caravan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volkov himself said of his work:&lt;ref name="Bown1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew C. Bown|title=Art of the Soviets: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in a One-Party State, 1917-1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3i7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=15 November 2012|year=1993|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|isbn=978-0-7190-3735-1|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The painting of the East is built chiefly on the primitive and on a painterly, decorative beginning. This is the basis of my work. Elaborating works of primitive flatness, I have introduced a whole system of triangles and other geometric forms and arrived at the depiction of man based on the triangle, that being the simplest of forms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In view of the politicisation of Soviet art and the demands of creating a nationalist art form that was distinct from modernism, Volkov used this argument to support his use of geometry (informed by Cubo-Futurism) as an overlay on an Uzbek sensibility.&lt;ref name="Bown1993"/&gt;

==Poetry==
Volkov wrote verses in the 1920s that served to illustrate his creativity. [[Sergei Yesenin]] visited him in Tashkent in those years, and impressed by his poetry, encouraged him to join the [[Imaginism|Imaginists]].&lt;ref name=apchinskaya/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1925, Volkov's first wife Maria Taratutina died. He married Elena Semenovna Volkova-Melnikova (1901–1959) the following year. In 1928 his first son Valery Volkov was born, who became a famous painter and art critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexander-volkov.com/eng/bio/?page=3|title=Chronicle of Life and Work: 1925-1930|publisher=Alexander Volkov|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Volkov's younger son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov was born, who later became a painter and sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexander-volkov.com/eng/bio/?page=4|title=Chronicle of Life and Work: 1931-1940|publisher=Alexander Volkov|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volkov died in 1957, and was buried in Tashkent.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; The concrete bust on his grave was created by his son Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexander-volkov.com/eng/bio/?page=5|title=Chronicle of Life and Work: 1941-1957|publisher=Alexander Volkov|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous Acclaim==

In 1960, several of Volkov's canvases were acquired by the famous collector [[George Costakis]]. They now appear at the Costakis collection of the [[State Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekstatemuseum.com/kmst/collections/db/search.html?primary_control_0=AN&amp;secondary_control_0=S&amp;tertiary_control_text_0=Volkov%20Aleksandr&amp;sort_order=1|title=Aleksandr Volkov|work=[[State Museum of Contemporary Art]]|location=Thessaloniki|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Volkov's first posthumous exhibition was held at the State Museum of Oriental Art - 33 years after his very first exhibition there - organised by his son Alexander Alexandrovich Volkov.&lt;ref name=fergana&gt;{{cite news|agency=Fergana|url=http://fergananews.mirror.tengu.ch/article8c64.html?id=4815|date=December 29, 2006|author=Nigora Khasanova|script-title=ru:Александр Волков - один из тех людей, кто создавал искусство эпохи подлинного соцреализма|language=Russian|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a grand exhibition ''Alexander Volkov. The Sun and the Caravan'' celebrating the 120th anniversary of the artist's birth was held at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.&lt;ref name=yermakova/&gt;

The highest price paid for a Volkov painting at auction is £909,000 for the ''Listening to the Bedana'' (oil on canvas, laid on board, 97.5 by 97.5&amp;nbsp;cm), sold at [[MacDougall's]] in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BLOUIN ARTINFO|author=Shane Ferro|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=November 15, 2012|title=Classic Russian Art Sells Briskly at London Auctions, Belying Fears of a European Art-Market Slowdown|url=http://origin-www.artinfo.com/news/story/752883/classic-russian-art-sells-briskly-at-london-auctions-belying-fears-of-a-european-art-market-slowdown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the first solo-exhibition of Volkov's work outside the erstwhile Soviet Union was held at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/sales/alexander-volkov-london-september-2012/|title=Alexander Volkov: Of Sand and Silk|work=Christie's|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series debuted on December 19, 2014, on [[Netflix]] when the first five 22-minute episodes were released.&lt;ref name=PRNJulienDebuts&gt;{{cite press release|author1=DreamWorks Animation|title=The Wildest Party Ever Hits the Jungle When the Netflix Original Series ALL HAIL KING JULIEN Debuts Dec. 19|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-wildest-party-ever-hits-the-jungle-when-the-netflix-original-series-all-hail-king-julien-debuts-dec-19-281274061.html|publisher=PR Newswire|access-date=November 3, 2014|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 2 was released on October 16, 2015.&lt;ref name=TZClipOctober16&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liu|first1=Ed|title=CLIP: "All Hail King Julien"'s Return to Netflix on October 16, 2015|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2015/10/clip-all-hail-king-juliens-return-to-netflix-on-october-16-2015/|publisher=ToonZone|access-date=October 15, 2015|date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 3 was released on June 17, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diaz|first1=Eric|title=DreamWorks' All Hail King Julien Pays Tribute to Two Peaks|url=http://nerdist.com/dreamworks-all-hail-king-julien-pays-tribute-to-twin-peaks/|publisher=Nerdist|access-date=August 21, 2016|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and season 4 was released on November 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Netflix's New Releases Coming in November 2016|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/netflix-november-2016-new-releases-tv-movies-940322/item/netflix-nov-11-2016-940337|access-date=November 12, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the series, 65 episodes of All Hail King Julien, excluding the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''Exiled'', released on May 12, 2017, were released over five seasons. The fifth and final season was released on December 1, 2017. It is currently showing reruns on [[Universal Kids]]

==Premise==
When King Julien XII (also known as Uncle King Julien), a very strict and cowardly [[ring-tailed lemur]] is foretold to be eaten by [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] (spelled and pronounced as "foosa"), he [[Abdication|abdicates]] his throne in favor of his nephew, who becomes King Julien XIII, a fun, notorious party animal, who now has an entire kingdom of lemurs to lead on his own. While Uncle King Julien is gone, the new King Julien gets into various troubles in the company of his adviser Maurice, his head of security Clover, and his biggest fan Mort. All the while, his devious uncle returns and tries to get rid of his nephew to reclaim the throne. Aside from Uncle King Julien and the foosa, Julien deals with other threats like the mad [[Malagasy civet|fanaloka]] Karl, and Clover's twin sister Crimson.

At the end of the fourth season, King Julien is dethroned and forced into exile by King Koto and his army but successfully defeats Koto and regains his kingdom in [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], subtitled ''Exiled''. The fifth and final season takes place after Koto's demise; villains such as Karl and Uncle King Julien decide to give up their evil ways and start a new life. This all leads up to the arrival of Alex on Madagascar (setting the stage of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]) just as Clover leaves with her husband, Sage Moondancer, on their honeymoon.

==Reception==
The series has been received favorable reviews. After the initial release of the first five episodes, Robert Lloyd of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in his review that the series "succeeds on matters of style, script, timing and performance, not the number of individual hairs rendered in a patch of fur. And ''Julien'' delivers on all the important accounts."&lt;ref name=LATReview&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Robert|title=Review: 'All Hail King Julien' lets the 'Madagascar' rave begin|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-all-hail-king-julien-20141219-column.html|accessdate=December 20, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Angry Birds''''' (later remarketed as '''''Angry Birds Classic''''') is a [[casual game|casual]] [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rovio Entertainment]]. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for [[iOS]] and [[Maemo]] devices in December 2009.&lt;ref name="ign-ios"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.ign.com/articles/107/1070605p1.html |title=Angry Birds Review |work=IGN.com |date=December 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 6, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504135939/http://wireless.ign.com/articles/107/1070605p1.html |archivedate=May 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=36184|title=Angry Birds |work=Talk.Maemo.org|date=February 11, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]],&lt;ref name="Symbian" /&gt; which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based [[smartphone]]s, most notably those using the [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Symbian]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[BlackBerry 10]] devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated [[video game console]]s and for [[Personal computer|PCs]]. A sequel, titled ''[[Angry Birds 2]]'', was released in July 2015.

In the game, players use a [[slingshot]] to launch birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures with the goal of destroying all the pigs on the playing field. As players advance through the game new types of birds become available, some with special abilities that can be activated by the player. Rovio Mobile has supported ''Angry Birds'' with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has also released stand-alone holiday and promotional versions of the game.

''Angry Birds'' was praised by critics for its success for leveraging a combination of addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price into a viable franchise with long-term potential for profit. The game's popularity has led to the production of additional versions of ''Angry Birds'' for personal computers and [[gaming console]]s, as well as a market for merchandise featuring its characters, [[The Angry Birds Movie|a feature film]] and several seasons of television cartoons. With the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' series having a combined tally of over 2 billion downloads across all platforms as of January 2014, including both regular and special editions,&lt;ref name="EDGE-2B"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125020838/www.edge-online.com/features/two-billion-downloads-were-just-getting-started-says-angry-birds-creator-rovio/|title=Two billion downloads?

==Gameplay==
[[File:Angry-Birds-in-Game-Play-1.jpg|thumb|left|A yellow bird (named Chuck) collapses a structure onto several green pigs.]]
In ''Angry Birds'', the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen by a group of hungry green pigs.&lt;ref name="MacWorld" /&gt; In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Angry Birds|developer=Rovio Mobile|version=2.0.2|scene=Achievements screen|quote=Icepicker: 5000 glass blocks smashed|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs.&lt;ref name="PocketGamer" /&gt; The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs. Also in the levels, players can unlock bonus levels by collecting golden eggs.

There are several different types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape. In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available.&lt;ref name="MacWorld" /&gt; As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available. Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne.&lt;ref name="PocketGamer" /&gt; For example, a yellow bird speeds up, a blue bird fragments into three birds, a black bird explodes, a white bird can drop an egg-shaped projectile, a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles, a green bird boomerangs back, a giant red bird (similar to the original red bird) does more damage to structures than their smaller counterparts, and an orange bird expands and inflates.&lt;ref name="MacWorld" /&gt; The pigs also vary, with hardiness relative to their size. Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat. In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making them even more resistant to damage.

Each level starts with the quantity, types, and firing order of birds predetermined.&lt;ref name="MacWorld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PocketGamer" /&gt; If all of the pigs are eliminated after the last bird is launched, the level is completed and the next level is unlocked.&lt;ref name="MacWorld" /&gt; If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed, the level is incomplete and must be repeated. Points are scored for each pig killed as well as for damage to, or destruction of, structures, and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds. Upon completing each level, players receive one, two, or three stars depending on the score received. Players are encouraged to [[Replay value#Performance grading|repeat any previously beaten levels in which the full three stars weren't awarded in order to fully master them]] and earn the full three star rating.

At the time, the [[2009 flu pandemic|"swine flu" epidemic]] was in the news, so the staff made the birds' enemies pigs.&lt;ref name="PocketGamer2" /&gt; Angry Birds was the studio's 52nd produced game and on its initial release, the game did not sell many copies. After Angry Birds was a featured app on the [[UK]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in February 2010 and quickly reached No.1 there, it reached the No. 1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010 and then stayed there for 275 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2011/05/app-store-500k/ Apple's App Store Surpasses Half-a-Million Apps]. Wired. May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/11/24/in-the-land-of-angry-birds-my-trip-to-rovios-headquarters-photo-gallery/ |title=In the land of Angry Birds: Rovio reveals its global entertainment ambitions |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial cost to develop ''Angry Birds'' was estimated to exceed [[Euro|€]]100,000, not including costs for the subsequent updates.&lt;ref name="MobileWebGo" /&gt; For the iOS version, Rovio partnered with distributor [[Electronic Arts|Chillingo]] to publish the game to the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/20/angry-birds-chillingo/ |title=Angry Birds IP |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chillingo claimed to have participated in final game polishing, such as adding visible trajectory lines, pinch to zoom, pigs' grunts, birds' somersaults on landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/23/chillingo-angry-birds-cut-the-rope-games-ipad-iphone_n_1024434.html |title=Chillingo, 'Angry Birds' Publisher, On Their Favorite Games Ever And What's Next |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then Rovio has self-published almost all of the later ports of the game, with the exception of the PSP version, which was produced under license by Abstraction Games.

When Rovio began writing new versions of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for [[Android (operating system)|Android systems]], they observed the large number of configurations of device types and versions of the Android software.&lt;ref name="PocketGamer2" /&gt; The number of combinations of software version, [[Central processing unit|processor]] speed and even [[user interface]]s was significantly larger than that for the iOS version.&lt;ref name="PCWAnd" /&gt; Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements,&lt;ref name="PocketGamer2" /&gt; even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones.&lt;ref name="PCWAnd" /&gt; It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.&lt;ref name="PCWAnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/211152/angry_birds_devs_angry_at_android_fragmentation.html?tk=mod_rel|title=Angry Birds Devs Angry At Android Fragmentation|author=Daniel Ionescu|work=PCWorld.com|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, Rovio began developing a version of ''Angry Birds'' for Facebook.&lt;ref name="IMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2011/03/13/rovio-angry-birds-facebook/|title=Rovio Has Been Working On The Facebook Version of Angry Birds For A Year|author=Kim-Mai Cutler|work=InsideMobileApps.com|date=March 13, 2011|accessdate=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project became one of the company's largest, with development taking over a year.&lt;ref name="IMA" /&gt; The company understood the challenges of transplanting a game concept between social platforms and mobile/gaming systems. In a March 2011 interview, Rovio's Peter Vesterbacka said, "you can’t take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force-feed it onto another. It's like [[Zynga]]. They can’t just take ''[[FarmVille]]'' and throw it on mobile and see what sticks. The titles that have been successful for them on mobile are the ones they’ve built from the ground up for the platform."&lt;ref name="IMA" /&gt; The Facebook version incorporate social-gaming concepts and in-game purchases and entered  [[Beta test|beta-testing]] in April 2011;&lt;ref name="IMA" /&gt; the game became officially available on Facebook in February 2012.&lt;ref name="AB-FB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/angry-birds-lands-facebook-day-early-195352394.html|title=Angry Birds lands on Facebook a day early|author=Natt Garun|work=digitaltrends.com|date=February 13, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements for the game include the ability to synchronize the player's progress across multiple devices; for example, a player who completes a level on an Android phone can log into their copy of the game on an Android tablet and see the same statistics and level of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phandroid.com/2011/04/13/angry-birds-to-sync-your-progress-across-all-platforms-soon/ |title=Angry Birds to Sync Your Progress Across All Platforms Soon; New Easter Update Screenshots |publisher=Phandroid.com |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial iOS version of the game included a single episode entitled "Poached Eggs", which contained three themed chapters, each with 21 levels. From time to time, Rovio has released free upgrades that include additional content, such as new levels, new in-game objects and even new birds. As updates have been released, they have been incorporated into the game's full version offered for download from each platform's application store.&lt;ref name="MightyEagle" /&gt;

The first update released on February 11, 2010 added a new episode called "Mighty Hoax", containing two new chapters with 21 levels each. Updates released on April 6, 2010 added the "Golden Eggs" feature, which placed hidden golden eggs throughout the game that would unlock bonus content when found, and a new episode called "Danger Above", which initially contained a single chapter of 15 levels. Two later updates added two more chapters to "Danger Above", each with 15 levels.

The Mighty Eagle is offered as a one-time, in-game purchase,&lt;ref name="MightyEagle" /&gt; and was initially only available for iOS, as its App Store customers have [[iTunes]] accounts with pre-linked credit cards.&lt;ref name="WiredUK"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-02/08/angry-birds-android-one-click-payment|title=Android in-app payments begin with Angry Birds|author=Brian X Chen|work=Wired UK|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011, Rovio also added the Mighty Eagle to the Chrome App version of the game. Rovio has begun testing an Android update called the "Bad Piggy Bank" with the Elisa wireless service in Finland and T-Mobile, which allows users to charge in-app purchases, such as the Mighty Eagle, to their mobile phone bills.&lt;ref name="WiredUK" /&gt; The service went live on Android with the release of version 2.2.0 in August 2012, using [[Google Play]]'s transaction system, which allows both mobile billing and credit cards, allowing both Android phones and WiFi-only tablets to unlock the features. This version also added the powerups from the Facebook version and added an option to pay to remove ads, allowing Android players to enjoy the game ad-free as iOS players do.

The sixth episode, "Mine and Dine", was released on June 16, 2011 with 15 new mining-themed levels and a new Golden Egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nexus404.com/Blog/2011/06/16/angry-birds-version-1-6-0-gets-you-15-new-levels-new-angry-birds-version-1-6-0-adds-15-additional-pig-hitting-levels-mining-dining-with-the-burrowing-piggies-theme-brings-our-favorite-birds-un/|title=Angry birds version 1.6.0 gets you 15 new levels}}&lt;/ref&gt; An August 24, 2011 update expanded "Mine and Dine" with two more 15-level chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8|title=iTunes Preview: Angry Birds|work=itunes.apple.com|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh update, "Birdday Party", was released on December 11, 2011 to commemorate the second anniversary of the first release of the iOS version into the iTunes App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5867037/angry-birds-second-birthday-invites-a-new-bird-to-the-party|title=Angry Birds Second Birthday Invites a New Bird to the Party|author=Owen Good|work=Kotaku.com|date=December 11, 2011|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included 15 new birthday cake-theme levels, as well as updated graphics and the addition of elements from the spin-off games, such as the scoring graphic seen in ''[[Angry Birds Rio]]'' and the introduction of the orange bird that first appeared in ''[[Angry Birds Seasons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovio.com/en/news/blog/109/happy-birdday |title=Happy Birdday! - Rovio Entertainment Ltd |publisher=Rovio.com |date= |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was later released for Android and Microsoft Windows. The eighth update was released initially to iOS on March 20, 2012 in a lead-up to the release of ''[[Angry Birds Space]]''. The new update included an animated tutorial, enhanced gameplay, all new UI graphics, and the first 15 levels of "Surf and Turf," the ''Angry Birds Facebook''-exclusive episode (see below), another 15 levels were added later, with the iOS version receiving the power-ups first seen in the Facebook version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Multiformat/Angry+Birds+(iPhone)/feature.asp?c=39022|title=Angry Birds - Surf and Turf, Theme 19 Levels 1 to 15 video walkthroughs (Life's a beach) |publisher=Pocket Gamer|date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SurfTurfiOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovio.com/en/news/blog/144/updates-for-angry-birds-and-angry-birds-rio |title=Updates for Angry Birds and Angry Birds Rio! |publisher=Rovio.com |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322195837/http://www.rovio.com/en/news/blog/144/updates-for-angry-birds-and-angry-birds-rio |archivedate=March 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2012, the final chapter of "Surf and Turf" was released. Along with that, a new episode called "Bad Piggies" was released. This is to advertise the new Rovio game, [[Bad Piggies]]. Another update was released on December 11, 2012, the 3rd anniversary of the game's release, with 15 new levels to "Birdday Party" and 15 new levels to "Bad Piggies". The second set of 15 levels in "Birdday Party" introduced the Pink Bird to the game. 15 more levels were later released for the "Bad Piggies" episode on March 7, 2013. On the same day these final 15 levels were released, Angry Birds became "Free App of the Week" on the Apple App Store until March 14, 2013, and became an instant hit on the Top Free App charts on the App Store until March 18, 2013, when the app returned to the normal price of $0.99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appadvice.com/appnn/2013/03/squawk-original-angry-birds-game-has-gone-free-for-first-time-ever]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2013, Rovio teased on its Facebook page that Red, the main protagonist of the game, would receive an ability in a new episode. On June 26, 2013, Rovio released a YouTube video, uncovering three new facts: the episode would be called Red's Mighty Feathers, the update would come in July, and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angrybirdsnest.com/angry-birds-reds-mighty-feathers-update-coming-in-july/&lt;/ref&gt; On July 3, 2013, the update was released, with fifteen levels of all-new gameplay. Instead of knocking over the pigs' castles, the player's goal is to keep the pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it. The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles, and the only available bird is Red, whose new ability is to target the nearest pig. There is no score, and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try. The first objective is to finish the level without getting the egg stolen. The second is to pop all the pigs in the level. The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain number of birds to clear the level. Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay, Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style. On September 16, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird.

On November 26, 2013, Rovio added a 30-level episode called ''Short Fuse'' that transforms the Bomb's explosions into highly-destructive electrical pulses, adds a powerup that transforms any Bird into a Bomb Bird and 3 different potions that can change the pigs. On December 11, 2013, Rovio added 15 levels to episode ''Birdday Party'' (cake 4) to celebrate its fourth birthday. On March 4, 2014, 15 levels were added to ''Short Fuse'' and the power-up icons were updated. On July 22, 2014, a 15-level episode called "Flock Favorites" that is inspired by fans' favorite episodes (Poached Eggs, Danger Above, Mine and Dine, Bad Piggies, Red's Mighty Feathers, Short Fuse, Surf and Turf) was added.

On November 23, 2014, in partnership with [[Product Red|(RED)]] and [[Apple Inc.]], an update to the app was released that was exclusive to iOS. In this update, there was an added special (RED)-themed Golden Egg level and Red's power from the ''Red's Mighty Feathers'' episode as a stand-alone power-up, that when purchased, can be used indefinitely (1 use per level) and 100% of the money went to the Global Fund to end [[AIDS]]. This purchase was only available until December 7, 2014.

On December 11, 2014, in honor of the Angry Birds' 5th birthday, an episode with 30 user-inspired levels was added. On June 23, 2015, Flock Favorites was added with 15 levels inspired by previous episodes. On December 11, 2015, in honor of Angry Birds 6th birthday, new 15 levels were added to Birdday Party. On December 11, 2016, in honor of Angry Birds' seventh birthday 15 more levels were added to Birdday Party.

On May 16, 2017, a dual virtual currency system was added to the game, in which currency is earned throughout gameplay (or accrued through in-app purchases) and can be used to purchase power-ups and other in-game items.

Since its initial release for the [[Nokia N900|Nokia N900 multimedia Internet device]], and Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch mobile digital devices, Rovio has released versions of ''Angry Birds'' for additional devices.  An [[iPad]]-exclusive version, ''Angry Birds HD'', was released with the iPad mobile digital device in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds-hd/id364234221?mt=8|title=Angry Birds HD for iPad|work=iTunes.apple.com|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, ''Angry Birds'' was made available to the [[Palm Pre]] phone running [[Palm, Inc.|Palm's]] [[webOS]] operating system through its App Catalog online store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/news/2010/08/iphone_game_angry_birds_now_on_palm_webos/|title=iPhone Game Angry Birds now on Palm webOS|author=Dew Alam|work=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbian^3 phones received a version of the game in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2010/10/22/nokia-symbian3-angry-birds-available-in-ovi-store/|title=Nokia Symbian^3 Angry Birds Available in Ovi Store|work=Phones Review|date=October 22, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101024202454/http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2010/10/22/nokia-symbian3-angry-birds-available-in-ovi-store/| archivedate= October 24, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which initially includes only the "Poached Eggs" and "Mighty Hoax" episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech2.in.com/india/news/mobiletablet-apps-software/angry-birds-arrives-for-symbian%5E3/151392/0|title=Angry Birds Arrives for Symbian^3|author=Padmini Harchandrai|work=tech2.0|date=October 22, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101026191115/http://tech2.in.com/india/news/mobiletablet-apps-software/angry-birds-arrives-for-symbian%5E3/151392/0| archivedate= October 26, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angry Birds works on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.

In May 2010, Rovio announced plans for a version for devices using Google's Android operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Angry+Birds/news.asp?c=20741 |title=Angry Birds coming to Android this summer |author=Mark Brown |work=Pocket Gamer |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525071333/http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Angry%2BBirds/news.asp?c=20741 |archivedate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a beta version being released through the Android Market (now [[Google Play]]) in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/angry-birds-here/|title=Angry Birds for Android is here!!!|author=Phil Nickinson|work=Android Central|date=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full Android version of the game was first released instead on [[GetJar]] in October 2010,&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2370850,00.asp |title=Angry Birds for Android Launches as Free GetJar App |author=Leslie Horn |work=PC Magazine |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018052722/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2370850%2C00.asp |archivedate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was subsequently released on Android Market within days.&lt;ref name="Phandroid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phandroid.com/2010/10/15/angry-birds-is-free-its-out/ |title=Angry Birds is Free &amp; It's Out |author=Quentyn Kennemer |work=phandroid.com |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018234751/http://phandroid.com/2010/10/15/angry-birds-is-free-its-out/ |archivedate=October 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rovio officials noted that GetJar had a more global reach than Android Market, and GetJar's availability on other smartphone platforms (including [[Symbian OS|Symbian]]) would make cross-platform promotion of the game easier.&lt;ref name="PCMag" /&gt; Unlike the previous versions, ''Angry Birds'' for Android is a free, ad-supported application, as paid applications aren't available on Android in some nations.&lt;ref name="Phandroid" /&gt; An update called "Bad Piggy Bank" enabled players to buy out the in-game ads.&lt;ref name="TCEurope" /&gt;

In October 2010, Microsoft suggested on one of its websites that a [[Windows Phone]] version of ''Angry Birds'' was in development. Rovio complained that Microsoft had not asked permission to make such a statement, noting that at that time it had not committed to design a Windows Phone version. Although Rovio asked Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game,&lt;ref name="PCMag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esphoneblog.com/2010/10/10/angry-birds-is-coming-to-windows-phone-7/ |title=Angry Birds is Coming to Windows Phone 7 |publisher=Esphoneblog.com |date=October 10, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710201823/http://www.esphoneblog.com/2010/10/10/angry-birds-is-coming-to-windows-phone-7/ |archivedate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/angry-birds-for-windows-phone-7-delayed/8301-17938_105-20064019-1.html|title=Angry Birds for Windows Phone 7 delayed|author=Erica Ogg|work=CNet.com|date=May 18, 2011|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of 2010, Rovio stated that it was developing new ports of the game, this time for devices outside of the mobile phone market. In January 2011, three of those ports launched. First, [[Sony]] announced the release of ''Angry Birds'' for its [[PlayStation Portable]] handheld system in the form of a [[List of PlayStation minis|PlayStation mini]] game that includes nearly 200 levels from the original game; the version is also playable on the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name="PS_Review2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/01/02/the-drop-week-of-jan-3rd-2011-new-releases/|title=The Drop: Week of January 3rd 2011 New Releases|author=Rey Gutierrez|publisher=PlayStation.com|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=January 4, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110209020148/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/01/02/the-drop-week-of-jan-3rd-2011-new-releases/| archivedate= February 9, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Rovio announced the release of a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the game&lt;ref name="AngryBirdsPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techsplurge.com/2762/download-angry-birds-pc-game-intel-appup-store/|title=How to Download Angry Birds PC Game from Intel Appup Store|author=Saket Narayan|work=TechSplurge|date=January 27, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 4, 2011, available for sale exclusively from the [[Intel AppUp]] center, which included 195 levels at launch and plans for exclusive features not available on the smartphone versions.&lt;ref name="AngryPC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375200,00.asp |title=Rovio Releases Angry Birds for PCs, Netbooks |author=Chloe Albanesius |work=PC Magazine |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408103730/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2C2817%2C2375200%2C00.asp |archivedate=April 8, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One day after the Windows version was released, the [[Mac App Store]] launched, with one of the first offerings being its own version of ''Angry Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/mac-os-1066-brings-mac-app-store-angry-birds-to-os-x-updated/9062|title=Mac OS 10.6.6 brings Mac App Store, Angry Birds to OS X (updated)|author=Jason D.

The popularity of ''Angry Birds'' has helped spread the game to other devices that were not initially designed as gaming machines. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] announced that a future update for its [[Nook]] Color e-reader will let the Android-based device run applications, including a port of ''Angry Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2382610,00.asp|title=Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Update Will Bring Email, Apps Like 'Angry Birds'|author=Chloe Albanesius|work=PCMag.com|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Rovio announced plans to partner with [[Roku]] to include a version of ''Angry Birds'' on a new model of its Internet-connected [[set-top box]], the Roku 2 XS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/06/01/angry_birds_game_migrating_to_tv_on_roku_player/|title='Angry Birds' game migrating to TV on Roku player|author=Michael Liedtke|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|publisher=Cox Enterprises|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook version adds a number of new power-up items, with a maximum of two in use per level.&lt;ref name="AB-FB" /&gt; For example, the Super Seeds power-up will make the launched bird larger and thus more powerful, while the King Sling power-up makes the slingshot stronger and able to launch birds higher and faster.&lt;ref name="AB-FB" /&gt; Power-ups can be purchased in-game or given by friends who also play the game.&lt;ref name="AB-FB" /&gt; "Surf and Turf" would later be included in the original mobile versions of the game, starting with iOS.&lt;ref name="SurfTurfiOS" /&gt; The [[Facebook]] version features weekly tournaments among your friends, with the top 3 winners earning free in-game "Bird Coins" which can be used to purchase power-ups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rovio.com/en/support/faq&amp;support_category_id=32 |title=FAQ - Angry Birds Friends on Facebook |publisher=Rovio |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801080433/http://www.rovio.com/en/support/faq%26support_category_id%3D32 |archivedate=August 1, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a unique [[Green Day]] themed chapter, however it was removed in December 2012.

At the 2012 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], Rovio and distribution partner [[Activision]] announced plans to bring ''Angry Birds'' and two of its spin-off games, ''Angry Birds Seasons'' and ''Angry Birds Rio'' to the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] systems.&lt;ref name="3PS360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/10/angry-birds-trilogy-coming-to-ps3-360-and-3ds|title=Angry Birds Trilogy Coming to PS3, 360 and 3DS|author=Greg Miller|work=ign.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundled together as ''Angry Birds Trilogy'', the games were built specifically for their respective consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for [[PlayStation Move]], [[Kinect]], high-definition displays and glasses-free [[Stereoscopy|3D visuals]].&lt;ref name="3PS360" /&gt;  ''Trilogy'' was also ported to the Wii and [[Wii U]] almost a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Workman|first1=Robert|title=Angry Birds Trilogy Coming to Wii and Wii U August 13|url=https://www.primagames.com/games/angry-birds/news/angry-birds-trilogy-coming-wii-and-wii-u-august-13|website=Prima Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for ''Angry Birds'' have been mostly acclaimed. Chris Holt of ''[[Macworld]]'' called the game "an addictive, clever, and challenging puzzler",&lt;ref name="MacWorld"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=356224|title=Angry Birds Review|author=Chris Holt|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100614001150/http://www.macworld.com/appguide/app.html?id=356224| archivedate= June 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pocket Gamer]]'s'' Keith Andrew said ''Angry Birds'' is "a nugget of puzzling purity dished out with relish aplenty".&lt;ref name="PocketGamer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+%28iPhone%29/review.asp?c=17385 |title=Angry Birds (iPhone) review |author=Keith Andrew |work=Pocket Gamer |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620062017/http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry%2BBirds%2B%28iPhone%29/review.asp?c=17385 |archivedate=June 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Liu of [[Wired News]] wrote that "going for the maximum number of stars certainly adds a lot of replay value to a fairly extensive game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/03/iphone-review-angry-birds-make-great-projectiles/ |title=iPhone Review: Angry Birds Make Great Projectiles |date=March 5, 2010 |work=Wired |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |first=Jonathan |last=Liu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727152225/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/03/iphone-review-angry-birds-make-great-projectiles/ |archivedate=July 27, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews for the first versions of the game that did not use a touch-screen, the [[PlayStation 3]]/[[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version and the Windows version, have also been positive, but with some disagreement over the different interfaces. Will Greenwald of ''[[PC Magazine]]'', in his review of the PlayStation Network version, said that the control scheme on these platforms is good, "but they're not nearly as satisfying as the touch-screen controls found on smartphone versions", and that the PlayStation 3 version appeared "blocky and unpleasant, like a smartphone screen blown up to HDTV size".&lt;ref name="PS_Review"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375627,00.asp|title=Angry Birds (for PlayStation 3, PSP)|author=Will Greenwald|work=PCMag.com|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Greg Miller of [[IGN]] preferred the analog control setup of the PSP version, saying it "offered me tiny variances in control that I don't feel like I get with my fat finger on a screen".&lt;ref name="PS_Review2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/114/1143410p1.html|title=Angry Birds Review|author=Greg Miller|work=PCMag.com|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While giving the game a positive review, Miller concluded, "There's no denying that Angry Birds is fun, but it could use polish – such as sharper visuals, a better price and smoother action."&lt;ref name="PS_Review2" /&gt; Damien McFerrin of British website Electric Pig reviewed the PC version, saying "the mouse-driven control method showcases many distinct advantages over its finger-focused counterpart".&lt;ref name="PC_Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricpig.co.uk/2011/01/19/angry-birds-pc-review/|title=Angry Birds PC review|author=Damien McFerrin|work=ElectricPig.co.uk|date=January 19, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angry Birds has also been described critically as impossible to understand the playing rules criteria by game critic Chris Schiller of [[Eurogamer.net]], which has 'a contemptuous attitude towards its players, keeping them just frustrated enough not to switch off and play something else instead.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schilling |first=Chris |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-04-04-why-i-hate-angry-birds-opinion |title=May-15-2012 retrieve |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audimated''' is a social networking website for [[independent music]]ians and their fans. '''Audimated.com''', which launched in June 2010, offers a platform in which both artists and fans can sell music and related products to make a profit. The founders of Audimated.com are Lucas Sommer and Andrew Levine,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gutner |first=Toddi |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704304504574610331674286094 |title=New Graduates Create Their Own Jobs |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-08-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100822112232/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704304504574610331674286094.html| archivedate= 22 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; two alumni from the [[University of Miami Business School]].

==History==
The idea for Audimated came to Lucas and Andrew during their senior year of college together at the [[University of Miami]]. After receiving positive feedback on the idea from their business professors, they put their [[business plan]] into action in 2008 to make their website a reality.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The website name is a combination of the words audio and automated{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, which represents the website's goal of combining music (audio) and automating the process of marketing through social networking (mated) for independent artists.

==Concept==
Audimated.com is an online music community with a variety of unique features. Most notably, fans and artists alike can use the website as a tool for earning money.&lt;ref name="palmbeachpost1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/techtonic/social/social-network-connects-musicians-and-fans-makes-money-for-both/ |title=Social network connects musicians and fans, makes money for both; Tech Tonic |publisher=Blogs.palmbeachpost.com |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=2010-08-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712023510/http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/techtonic/social/social-network-connects-musicians-and-fans-makes-money-for-both/ |archivedate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Audimated.com allows artists to sell their merchandise (songs, concert tickets, etc.) and also lets fans have “stores” where they can add their favorite bands’ products for sale.

In addition to the revenue generating component, Audimated.com also allows the fan user group to find top artists that match their taste, listen to and upload songs on the Audimated.com radio and search specific locations for new musicians of different genres.

While artists upload their creative content onto the website, Audimated.com guarantees that they keep the rights to all creative content of their work. Audimated.com simply offers a platform to increase awareness and interest in independent music. Signing up for Audimated.com is free of charge for artists and their fans. The website business model is to charge a 10% fee of all sale transactions by artists and fans while up-selling{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} premium services to its members.&lt;ref name="palmbeachpost1"/&gt;

==News==
In March 2010, Audimated.com won the annual WeMedia Pitch It! Contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Suzanne McBride |url=http://wemedia.com/2010/03/11/we-media-pitchit-competition-nets-50000-for-news-and-music-start-ups/ |title=We Media PitchIt! competition nets $50,000 for news and music start-ups |publisher=WeMedia.com |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2010-08-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100715094406/http://wemedia.com/2010/03/11/we-media-pitchit-competition-nets-50000-for-news-and-music-start-ups/| archivedate= 15 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grand prize, awarded to Lucas Sommer on behalf of Audimated.com for the best pitch, was $25,000 in start up funds for the website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23256">In [[North American broadcast television frequencies]], '''channel 1''' is a former [[broadcasting|broadcast]] ([[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]]) [[television channel]]. During the [[History of television#Electromechanical television|experimental era of TV operation]], Channel 1 was moved around the lower [[VHF|VHF spectrum]] repeatedly, with the entire band displaced upward at one point due to an early 40&amp;nbsp;MHz allocation for the [[FM broadcast band]].

FM was moved to its current frequencies in 1946. TV Channel 1's last location was 44 to 50&amp;nbsp;MHz.

[[Land Mobile Radio]] and television broadcasters shared the same frequencies until 1948. This shared allocation was eventually found to be unworkable, so the FCC reallocated the Channel 1 frequencies for [[public safety]] and [[land mobile]] use and assigned TV channels 2–13 exclusively to broadcasters. Aside from the shared frequency issue, this part of the VHF band was (and to some extent still is) prone to higher levels of [[radio-frequency interference]] (RFI) than even VHF 2 (System M).

Neither Canada nor Mexico allocated television frequencies until 1946, so the historical Channel 1 (System M) is exclusively a US allocation artifact.

== History ==

Channel 1 was allocated at 44–50 [[MHz]] between 1937 and 1940. Visual and aural carrier frequencies within the channel fluctuated with changes in overall TV broadcast standards prior to the establishment of permanent standards by the [[National Television Systems Committee]].

In 1940, the FCC reassigned 44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz to the [[FM broadcast band]]. Television's channel 1 frequency range was moved to 50–56&amp;nbsp;MHz (see table below). Experimental television stations in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles were affected.&lt;ref&gt;"Threat to Television Is Feared in Frequency Modulation Order", ''New York Times'', May 21, 1940, p. 23. "Gives Du Mont Right to Television Here", ''New York Times, July 21, 1940, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial TV allocations were made by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) under the [[NTSC]] system on July 1, 1941.  Channel 1 was located at 50–56&amp;nbsp;MHz, with visual carrier at 51.25&amp;nbsp;MHz and aural carrier at 55.75&amp;nbsp;MHz. At the same time, the spectrum from 42 to 50&amp;nbsp;MHz was allocated to [[FM radio]]. Several commercial and experimental television stations operated on the 50–56&amp;nbsp;MHz Channel 1 between 1941 and 1946, including one station, WNBT (now [[WNBC]], channel 4) in [[New York City]], which had a full commercial operating license.

In the first postwar allocation in the spring of 1946, Channel 1 was moved back to 44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz, with visual at 45.25&amp;nbsp;MHz and aural at 49.75&amp;nbsp;MHz. FM was moved to its current 88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz band. But WNBT and all other existing stations were moved to other channels, because the final Channel 1 was reserved for low power community stations covering a limited area. While a handful of construction permits were issued for this final version of Channel 1, no station ever actually broadcast on it before it was removed from use in 1948.

When the FCC initially [[frequency allocation|allocated]] broadcast television frequencies, channel 1 was logically the first channel. These U.S. TV stations originally broadcast on the 50–56&amp;nbsp;MHz channel 1
* W2XBS/WNBT (today's [[WNBC]]), [[New York City]] (1941–1946), reassigned in 1946 to channel 4;
* W6XAO/KTSL (today's [[KCBS-TV]]), [[Los Angeles]], reassigned post-war to channel 2;
* W9XZV [[Chicago]], [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith's]] experimental station, billed as the first all-electric TV station in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zenith-Electronics-Corporation-Company-History.html&lt;/ref&gt; Reassigned post-war to Channel 2,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/w9xzv.html Zenith Enters FM and TV Broadcasting]", ''The Zenith Story'' (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; it broadcast an early form of monochrome [[pay television|pay-TV]] in 1951 as K2XBS [[Phonevision]] and conducted early [[NTSC|color television]] experiments before ultimately going [[dark (broadcasting)|dark]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotelevision.com/timeline.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Its transmitters were donated to [[WTTW]] ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] 11 Chicago)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compassrose.org/uptown/WBKBChicago.html CompassRose.org: WBKB Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt; and its channel 2 assignment was taken by [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station|O&amp;O]] [[WBBM-TV]].
* KARO, [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]]; never began broadcasting, no current VHF allocation;
* WSBE, [[South Bend]], [[Indiana]]; never began broadcasting on channel 1, but was reallocated to UHF channel 34 in the 1952 revised channel allocation table, where it went on the air as [[WSBT-TV]] that year.  As part of a consolidation of the Elkhart and South Bend communities into a single television market, WSBT-TV was moved in 1958 to UHF channel 22, where it remains as a [[digital television|digital]] [[CBS Television Network|CBS]] [[network affiliate|affiliate]] today; channel 34 became the home of PBS member station [[WNIT (TV)|WNIT]]. No full-service VHF TV allocations were made available to [[South Bend]] due to its proximity to [[Chicago]], making the city a [[UHF_television_broadcasting#UHF_islands|UHF island]].
 
By September 1945, additional stations temporarily granted construction permits to operate on channel 1 included: 
* W8XCT ([[WLW]]) [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] ultimately built on channel 4 as commercial station [[WLWT]], later moved to channel 5.
* W9RUI [[Iowa City]], [[Iowa]] held an unbuilt construction permit, and additionally given a channel 12 assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/prewar_stations.html |title=Television stations authorized by the FCC, January 1, 1941 |publisher=RCA Radio Travel-Log |date=1941 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818042243/http://www.earlytelevision.org/prewar_stations.html |archivedate=August 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* W8XGZ [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]], [[West Virginia]], licensed to a chemical company, also held a channel one construction permit; there is no indication the stations ever got on the air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anarc.org/wtfda/channel1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

''See also [[list of experimental television stations]] for additional channel one pioneers.''

=== Community television ===
In 1946, prior to [[cable TV]] and the invention of [[public-access television]] channels,  the FCC decided to reserve channel 1 for low-power [[Community television]] stations, and moved existing channel 1 stations to higher frequencies. Community television stations covered smaller cities and were allowed to use less radiated power. None of these stations were built before the FCC imposed a freeze on all television station construction permits in mid-1948, and removed the channel one allocations.

=== A shared (non-primary) allocation ===
From 1945 to 1948 TV stations in the U.S. shared Channel 1 and other channels with fixed and mobile services. The FCC decided in 1948 that a primary (non-shared) allocation of the [[VHF]] [[radio spectrum]] was needed for television broadcasting. Except for selected VHF frequencies in Alaska and Hawaii (and some overseas territories) the FCC-administered VHF band is primarily allocated for television broadcasting to this day.

The FCC in May 1948 formally changed the rules on TV band allocations based on propagation knowledge gained during the era of shared-user allocations. The 44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz [[band (radio)|band]] used by Channel 1 was replaced by lower-power narrowband users.

Channel 1 was reassigned to fixed and mobile services (44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz) in order to end their former shared use of other VHF TV frequencies. Rather than [[Numbering scheme|renumber]] the TV channel table, it was decided to merely remove Channel 1 from the table.

===Modern allocations 43–50 MHz===
As of September 2000, the Federal Spectrum Use of the band (which is regulated by the NTIA and not the FCC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/LRSP/LRSP5a.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018041344/http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/LRSP/LRSP5a.htm |archivedate=2009-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was as follows:

*'''43.69–46.6 Non-Military Land Mobile Radio (LMR)''':&lt;br&gt;Primarily used by Federal agencies for mutual aid response with local communities.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: Used by the military services for tactical and training operations on a non-interference basis. (Band is otherwise non-government exclusive).
*'''46.6–47 Govt. FIXED MOBILE Allocation''': &lt;br&gt;Non-Military LMR: Extensive use of this band is for contingency response to various national disasters. Others uses are for national resources management, law enforcement, tornado tracking, and various meteorological research support. &lt;br&gt; Military LMR: This band is used primarily for tactical and training operations by [[U.S. military]] units for combat net radio operations that provide command and control for combat, combat support, and combat service support units. Frequencies also used for air-to-ground communications for military close air support requirements as well as some other tactical air-ground and air-air communications.
*'''47–49.6 Experimental''':&lt;br&gt;Used for experimental research to observe and measure currents in harbor areas in support of vessel safety.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: Used by the military services for tactical and training operations on a non-interference basis. (Band is otherwise non-government exclusive).
*'''49.6–50 Govt. FIXED MOBILE Allocation''':&lt;br&gt; Non-Military LMR: This band is used extensively to support contingencies or ecological emergencies, some public safety requirements, MARS system, and air-quality measurements.&lt;br&gt; Experimental: Research is performed in various regions of the atmosphere as well as experimental development of portable space orbital debris ground radars.&lt;br&gt; Military LMR: This band is used primarily for tactical and training operations by U.S. military units for combat net radio operations that provide command and control for combat, combat support, and combat service support units. Frequencies also used for air-to-ground communications for military close air support requirements as well as some other tactical air-ground and air-air communications.

FCC (NON-Federal) allocations for the band:
*Primarily Land Mobile use from 43-46.6.
*46.61-46.89 is used by older cordless phone base stations. The handsets use the 49.61 - 49.89 range for transmitting to the base unit.
*47.0-49.60 is used by LMR and then the cordless phone range. Early experiments with meteor scatter one way messaging was in the 49 - 50 range back in the early 1990s but it no longer exists due to reliable and cheaper satellite communications.

==Channel 1 in other NTSC-using countries==
[[Canada]] did not start regular television broadcasts until after the US had decommissioned Channel 1 (44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz) for television use; [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]] and [[CBLT-DT|CBLT]] signed on in 1952. This TV channel was never used in [[Latin America]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]] as TV broadcasting did not start in these areas until the 1950s.

== Cable television interference issues==
The use of 45.75&amp;nbsp;MHz as an [[Superheterodyne receiver#Overview|intermediate frequency]] within television receivers became commonplace after [[UHF]] reception became an option in 1953. Channel 1's  signal on this frequency (over the air, or on analogue cable) could create interference internally within TV's.

Most cable systems use frequencies below 54&amp;nbsp;MHz (VHF TV 2) for communication back to the cable provider from [[cable modem]]s and digital apparatus, so any "Cable 1" channel needs to avoid operation on the original VHF Channel 1 frequencies from the pre-1948 bandplans. As such, "cable 1" is not related to the original 44–50&amp;nbsp;MHz VHF channel except in name. It operates always at some higher frequency - often with channels 00 and 01 merely aliased to 98/99 or 100/101.

[[Harmonically related carriers|HRC]] and [[Incrementally related carriers|IRC]] systems increase the spacing between channels 4 and 5 to a non-standard 6&amp;nbsp;MHz, inserting "cable 1" between channels four and five. This non-standard spacing is rarely used, is not compatible with all television receivers and has the effect of pushing channel six partially into the [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast band]].

== Other reassigned channels ==
Channel 1 is not the only "missing" channel. In most countries, no stations are assigned to [[Channel 37|UHF Channel 37]] (608 to 614&amp;nbsp;MHz), which is reserved for [[radio astronomy]].  It remains on TV sets and tuners. There are a few Channel 37 stations operating in countries such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] and [[The Philippines]].

Other channels have been removed and reassigned as well, but only from the higher UHF bands. Channels 14 to [[Channel 83|83]] (except 37), from 470 to 890&amp;nbsp;MHz, were originally added by the FCC in 1952 for the rapidly expanding TV service in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889476,00.html TV Thaw]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', April 21, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, channels 70 to 83 (806 to 890&amp;nbsp;MHz) were removed for [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS mobile phone]] services (leading to one side of some conversations being heard on older TV sets on those channels). On June 12, 2009, channels 52 to 69 (698 to 806&amp;nbsp;MHz)  were removed and will be reallocated for other uses. These same channels were reallocated in Canada on August 31, 2011. In South Korea and the Philippines, Channels 60 to 69 are no longer used. In Brazil, these channels are used only for linking{{clarify|date=June 2016}} (it will be phased out in the future&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direitoacomunicacao.org.br/content.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=990]&lt;/ref&gt;) or government-based networks.&lt;ref group=NB&gt;{{pt icon}} [[:pt:Anexo:Lista de canais da televisão digital brasileira#São Paulo 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* On August 22, 2011, the [[United States of America|United States]]' [[Federal Communications Commission]] announced a freeze on all future applications for broadcast stations requesting to use channel 51,&lt;ref name="FCCUHF51"&gt;FCC [http://transition.fcc.gov/Document_Indexes/Media/2011_index_MB_Public_Notice.html Public Notice DA-11-1428A1]:

* [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-11-1428A1.txt Plain Text format]&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent [[adjacent-channel interference]] to the A-Block of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.  Later that year (on December 16, 2011), [[Industry Canada]] and the [[Canadian Radio-Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] followed suit in placing a moratorium on future television stations using [[Channel 51 (disambiguation)|Channel 51]] for broadcast use, to prevent [[adjacent-channel interference]] to the A-Block of the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz band.&lt;ref name="ICUHF51"&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf10161.html Industry Canada Advisory Letter - Moratorium on the Use of Television Channel 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], other recently abandoned TV channels are being used for [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] [[digital radio]], in VHF [[band III]].

== Current uses ==
In the 1990s, it was decided that [[digital television]] would be limited to the current channels [[North American broadcast television frequencies|Channel 2]] through 51, so that another 18 channels (Channels 52 to 69, 698 to 806&amp;nbsp;MHz) could be auctioned for private use by [[mobile phone]] and wireless network providers; four of the channels were to be reserved for emergency services such as police radios. Renumbering in this case is not relevant, as [[virtual channel]]s can maintain the original analog TV station brand number, although the station  [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmits]] on another channel.

===Digital television===
The [[ATSC]] standard allows for a major [[virtual channel]] number from 1 to 99, followed by a separator ('.' or '-') and a [[digital subchannel]] number from 1 to 99 (for broadcast TV) or 1 to 999 ([[datacasting]] or [[cable TV]]). As such, it does not preclude the creation of a virtual channel 1.1 or a virtual channel [[channel 37|37.1]]:
:"The major_channel_number shall be between 1 and 99. The value of major_channel_number shall be set such that in no case is a major_channel_number / minor_channel_number pair duplicated within the TVCT."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsc.org/standards/a65.php ATSC standard A/65C], page 32, Advanced Television Systems Committee, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the specification does not define any criteria to determine whom (if anyone) could ultimately be assigned the 1.1 virtual channel series for over-the-air broadcast in a local community; it merely defines a procedure to allocate virtual channels 02–69 based on holders of the corresponding (former) analogue NTSC licenses and designates virtual channels 70–99 for possible use to carry additional, unrelated programming via the facilities of these same broadcasters. (99 was used briefly by the now-defunct [[USDTV]], for instance, although such applications are rare.)

[[KAXT-LD]] of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, won permission to use digital virtual channel 1.x, effective September 1, 2009, on technical grounds, asserting that existing virtual channel numbering (22.x) conflicted with that employed by [[educational television|educational broadcaster]] [[KRCB]] [[Cotati, California|Cotati]].

===Cable television===
[[Cable television]] channel numbering is at the discretion of the cable system operator. [[North American cable television frequencies]] (analog System M) include a formally defined and allocated Channel 1.  Cable TV's use of Channel 1 is rare and its frequency assignment is sometimes inconsistent.

[[Digital cable]] subscribers in many areas, such as those serviced by [[Comcast]] and [[Charter Communications]], can find [[video on demand]] content at Channel 1.

Cable subscribers in the [[New York City]] area receive local [[news channel]] [[NY1]] on channel one (actually 101), served by [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Altice USA]]. [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]], South Dakota [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] affiliate [[KNBN]] has also used a "channel one" brand and logo, based on its former cable converter channel position (over-the-air, KNBN is [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 21, and KNBN is now carried by area cable systems on channel 10).

===Satellite television===
[[Satellite television]] channel assignments depend on the receiver. Most [[FTA receiver]]s will by default assign the first channel located during an initial signal scan as "Channel 0001" while package receivers sold by individual pay-TV providers will often use the SID, a virtual identifier sent as part of the satellite signal, as a channel number.

The original [[Dish Network]] DishPlayer [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] (model 7100/7200) displayed a PTV Services menu listing recorded videos and upcoming scheduled recordings if tuned to channel 1. This menu is internal to the personal video recorder and does not correspond to a broadcast signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwantptv.com/dishplayer/dishplayerguide.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206055209/http://www.iwantptv.com/dishplayer/dishplayerguide.htm |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cinema of [[Bolivia]]''' comprises the film and videos made within the nation of Bolivia or by Bolivian filmmakers abroad. Though the country’s film infrastructure is too small to be considered a [[film industry]], Bolivia has a rich film history. Bolivia has consistently produced feature-length films since the 1920s, many of which are documentary or take a documentary approach to their subject. Film historian José Sánchez-H has observed that the predominant theme of many Bolivian films is the country's indigenous cultures and political oppression.&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sánchez-H|first=José|title=The Art and Politics of Bolivian Cinema|location=Lanham, Md|publisher=Scarecrow Press|date=1999|isbn=0-8108-3625-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first motion picture was shown in Bolivia on June 21, 1897, probably on a [[Vitascope]]. The press paid more attention to "illicit acts" committed in the dark theater than to the pictures themselves, and authorities made it difficult to hold screenings, some of which were held in people's homes. The [[Cinematograph|Biograph]] was introduced in 1899, and by 1905 popular exhibitions were held in [[La Paz]]. A wave of documentary films emerged in the 1910s and 1920s directed by pioneer multitalented filmmakers working in an artisanal mode. Of note is ''La Gloria de la Raza'' (1926),directed by Luis Castillo in collaboration with anthropologist Arturo Posnasky. Optical effects and miniature models were used to depict the decline and disappearance of Tiahuanaco culture, and the film helped to spur the formation of Condor Mayku Films.

The first motion picture made in Bolivia was ''[[Personajes históricos y de actualidad]]'' in 1904. The only surviving film from Bolivia’s silent era is ''[[Wara Wara]]'', directed by José Velasco Maidana in 1930.&lt;ref name="Wara Wara trailer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dHnRC5mcBA |title=Wara Wara - Trailer |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sound film was ''Infierno Verde'' (''aka'' ''''La Guerra del Chaco'' , 1936) directed by Luis Bazoberry. The first color film was ''[[Donde nace un imperio]]'' (1957) directed by Jorge Ruiz.&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"/&gt;

===Instituto Cinematográfico Boliviano===
The Instituto Cinematográfico Boliviano (ICB) was created in March 1953 to promote the government of [[Victor Paz Estenssoro]] in the wake of the national revolution of 1952. [[Waldo Cerruto]] was the ICB's first director. At the time, the government had a monopoly on film. The ICB created 136 newsreels between 1952 and 1956. In 1956, [[Jorge Ruiz (director)|Jorge Ruiz]] became the next director of the ICB, and then was succeeded by [[Jorge Sanjinés]] in 1965. Two years later, the government shut the ICB down after Sanjinés exhibited his film ''[[Ukamau]]'' (1966), which authorities feared would incite [[Aymara people]]. Everyone involved with the film was fired, and the equipment and projects were transferred to Channel 7 - a station developed by the military government of General René Barrientos. Sanjinés and his crew founded a new group film, which they named after ''Ukamau''.&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"/&gt;

===New Bolivian Cinema===
In the 1960s, [[Latin American cinema]] saw a common shift towards intellectualism and examining similar political themes, including  [[underdevelopment]] and economic strife. Following Brazil's [[Cinema Novo]] and Argentina's [[Third cinema]], New Bolivian Cinema sought to define a national identity. Ideologically, New Bolivian Cinema sought to make film for people together with people. The movement was a rejection of Hollywood style filmmaking, and is characterized by filming at real locations, working with non-professional actors, and inexpensive equipment. Jorge Sanjinés is considered a leader of the movement, with films like ''Yawar Malku'' (1969) and ''La Nación Clandestina'' (1989) which examined the historical and current treatment of Aymara peoples.&lt;ref name="NewAndOld"&gt;{{cite web|title=The "new" and the "old" in Bolivian cinema|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc54.2012/tibbits-cordova/text.html|publisher=JUMP CUT|accessdate=16 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many filmmakers battled with both censorship by government authorities and mainstream media criticism within Bolivia, which attacked the films for their leftist social critiques and for focusing on indigenous peoples. For example, in 1953 Bolivian authorities tried to block ''[[Vuelve, Sebastiana]]'' from entering the Servicio Oficial de Difusión Radiotelevisión y Espectáculos film festival because “a movie about Indians couldn’t possibly represent Bolivia in a film festival in a foreign country.”&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"/&gt; However, the Bolivian Ambassador smuggled a copy of the film and entered it into the festival, where ''Vuelve, Sebastiana'' won first prize in the festival’s ethnographic category.&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"/&gt;

===Law of Bolivian Film===
In 1991 the Bolivian government passed a law establishing the Consejo Nacional Autónomo del Cine (CONACINE). The council's film development fund lends "up to one hundred thousand dollars for the production of films at a 7% interest rate and with only two years to pay it back." Filmmaker Jorge Ruiz felt the law was not applied effectively, and it remains difficult to secure the basic funds for film production in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="ArtPolitics"/&gt;

===Digital era===
Bolivian cinema transformed with the advent of digital formats. Computer-based editing allowed smaller, cheaper productions to be made. This led to a jump from an average of two feature-length movies a year being produced to over a dozen in 2010.&lt;ref name = "Going beyond Sanjinés"&gt;{{cite web|title=Going Beyond Sanjinés|url=http://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/book/crash-course-bolivian-cinema|publisher=ReVista: Harvard Review of Latin America|accessdate=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though production budgets can be much lower than in the past, independent filmmakers still have to make sacrifices to fund their projects. Patrick Cordova, writer, director, and producer of ''Erase una ves en Bolivia'' had to sell his car to finish the film.&lt;ref name="Interview with Patrick Cordova"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Patrick Cordova|url=http://www.frontlip.eu/2011/11/interview-with-patrick-cordova-director-of-bolivian-film-erase-una-vez-en-bolivia/|publisher= Front Lip|accessdate = 25 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the films made are still about [[social realism]], but there are also genre films and [[auteur cinema]]. Notable directors include Juan Carlos Valdivia, Eduardo López, and [[Alejandro Pereyra]].

Accessible formats have also allowed Bolivia to foster a strong indigenous film community. The Cinematography Education and Production Center (CEFREC) is an organization dedicated to promoting film and video production among indigenous nations in Bolivia. Ian Sanjinés, Jorge Sanjinés’ son, founded the Center in 1989. CEFREC offers technical training in sound, film production, post-production, and script writing for the indigenous nations of Ayamara, Guarani, Trinitatio and Quechua. One of the indigenous filmmakers involved with CEFREC explains, “Video serves as a medium to save that which our grandparents can no longer tell.” &lt;ref name="Bolivian Links: Indigenous Media"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivian Links: Indigenous Media|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2446/bolivian-links-indigenous-media|publisher=BOMB —Artists in Conversation|accessdate=26 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compilation film''', or '''compilation movie''' is a film edited from previously released or [[archive footage]], but compiled in a new order of appearance.

The video footage can be combined with new commentary and new footage, but most of the footage of a compilation film consists of archive or [[stock footage]] that has been used in earlier, different movies. Sometimes it can also be older material shot again, but with a higher budget.

The quality of these types of films is variable. Sometimes the archive footage is just edited behind each other, without adding anything new. Because of running time limits some footage can be shortened or expanded with short, new footage in an effort to make everything seamlessly flow together into each other. These transitions are not always unnoticeable.

==Propaganda==
Some of the earliest compilation movies were [[propaganda film]]s. A famous example is the German [[Nazi propaganda film]] ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (1940), where only a small part consisted of new footage, namely the scenes with Jews in a Polish ghetto and the animated maps. The lion's share of the film was filled with old [[newsreel]] footage showing [[Albert Einstein]], [[Anna Stern]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] and clips from movies with and by [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and [[Fritz Lang]]. Other countries, including the United States and Great Britain, also made propaganda films with archive footage to present themselves in the style of a documentary.

==Compilation films based on popular film and television series==
{{See also|List of films based on television programs#Programs re-edited for release as feature-length films}}

In the years before the invention of [[video store]]s film companies released compilation films in which the best episodes of a film [[serial film|serial]] were put into one movie. One of the earliest examples were [[Walt Disney]]'s "[[Anthology film|package films]]", based on his popular short animated films.

Film serials shown during a [[wikt:matinée|matinée]] were also sometimes edited into one long movie and re-released again. Today, most of these serials are only available in this form. A well known example is ''[[The Phantom Creeps]]'' (1939). During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970S many old film serials were re-edited and compiled into one film, for instance the [[slapstick]] movie compilation films ''[[4 Clowns]]'' and ''[[The Golden Age of Comedy]]''. Since in those days the general public had no other way to see these old movies (once again) these compilation movies were very successful and guaranteed theatres full of spectators.

After television became popular during the 1950s some television series were compiled and edited into one film. Even people who had already seen everything on TV enjoyed experiencing the entire series again in one row. A famous example was the 1955 TV series ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', which was released as the cinematic feature ''[[Davy Crockett and the River Pirates]]'' (1956).

When television started to repeating several old films and TV series on a regular basis compilation films became less popular. Films consisting of almost or nothing more than previously released footage, like ''[[Godzilla's Revenge]]'' (1969) and ''[[Trail of the Pink Panther]]'' (1982) left the audience with the feeling that they had been tricked into seeing the same material again, while expecting a fully original film with new, authentic material. The arrival of video and DVD, where several episodes or seasons of a series could be entirely collected, also took the need for compilation films away.

==Musical compilation films==
Another popular form is the musical compilation film, where clips from [[film musical]]s, [[concert]]s or [[music video]]s could be brought together into one format. Famous examples are the movies ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' (1974), ''[[That's Entertainment, Part II]]'' (1976) and ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]'' (1994), all documentaries about [[Hollywood]]musicals, in which the narration is frequently interrupted to show full scenes from these musical films. Another example is the movie ''[[Moonwalker]]'' (1988) with pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] which mostly consists of older footage from his music videos and concerts, and some newer footage to give some resemblance of a story.

==Compilation films with new footage==

A special kind of compilation films are movies where old footage is simply filmed again, but on a higher budget. A famous example is the first [[Monty Python]] movie ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'' (1973), where most of the scenes are recreations of the most popular sketches from the first two seasons of the TV series ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. So although the footage is new, the content is mostly not.

==Anime==
{{original research|section|date=May 2010}}
In Japanese [[anime]], is a feature film that is mostly composed of footage from a television [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. These typically compress the plot of a [[story arc]] from about eight to thirteen broadcast hours to a bit more than two hours without commercials.  Additional animation may be added that is either of a superior quality to that made for television or which changes story details, often making the ending lead to a sequel not suggested in the original show. Such films may be put on video or DVD, recently even without being shown theatrically.

A compilation movie is often the most available source for the content of the TV series for persons outside the range of broadcasting. Release rights to other countries are often given for compilation movies well before the entire serial is similarly released. A compilation movie does not contain the characterization developed through the series, but it does not have filler material or extraneous plot.

===Examples===
Examples of compilation films include the ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' films ''The Laughing Man'' and ''Individual Eleven'', ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (1977 film)|Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1977) and the first three ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' films. The series ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' also derived a compilation film. Most of [[Gerry Anderson]]'s ''[[Supermarionation]]'' series were made into compilation movies during the 1980s by ITC Entertainment under the package title of ''Super Space Theater''.

==Difference between a compilation film and an anthology film==

An [[anthology film]] looks stylistically like a compilation film and some anthology films are compilation films, but certainly not all of them. What distinguishes an anthology film from a compilation movie is the fact that a compilation film by definition shows archive or stock footage shown before, while the short segments in an anthology film are new material.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age version===
The unnamed man that would become Doctor Light held a faculty position at Ivy League University until he was fired for conducting dangerous experiments on university grounds. This caused the former faculty member to become Doctor Light where he wielded light-based technology and turned to a life of crime. At 3:00 a.m. in a New York town, he generated enough light to make it feel like it is the middle of the day which caused the [[police officer]]s and [[security guard]]s that were working the night shift to stare at this phenomenon. This served as a distraction so that Doctor Light can rob the armored vault that's in the factory of its weekly payroll. Doctor Light's crime spree was noticed by [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] who tracked him down and fought him. Doctor Light gained the upper hand in the fight which resulted in Doctor Mid-Nite getting a twisted ankle while Doctor Light got away. The next time Doctor Mid-Nite confronted Doctor Light, he brought his Blackout Bombs with him. Doctor Light was at a disadvantage where he was defeated by Doctor Mid-Nite and arrested by the police. Months later, Doctor Mid-Nite resurfaced and created a replica of the [[Colosseum]] by passing it off as a remnant of an ancient civilization and used it as a front to sell counterfeit relics. Doctor Mid-Nite figured out the plot where he defeated Doctor Light and handed him over to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''All-American Comics'' #82&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctor Light used his light-based gadgets to make plants grow to enormous size where he used them as living weapons. Anyone that came in contact with these plants developed murderous intentions and uncontrollable rage. Doctor Mid-Nite put a stop to Doctor Light's plot.&lt;ref&gt;''All-American Comics'' #91&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
* A different version of Doctor Light appeared in the ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' episode "The Eyes Have It" played by [[David Bowe (actor)|David Bowe]]. He was a scientist named Doctor Arthur Leit who had stolen an ultraviolet light beam from Doctor Neal Faraday that blinded Superman.

'''''Drakensang: The River of Time''''' is a role-playing video game developed by Radon Labs. Drakensang TROT is the second video game in [[The Dark Eye]]-universe since [[Attic Entertainment Software|Attic's]] Northlands Trilogy from the 1990s (''[[Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny]]'', ''[[Realms of Arkania: Star Trail]]'' and ''[[Realms of Arkania: Shadows over Riva]]'').

==Story==
Though released after ''[[Drakensang: The Dark Eye]]'', and playable as stand-alone game, in-story it serves as a prequel. The game takes place around the city of Nadoret. Nadoret lies south of the city of Ferdok, the main hub of the first installment. From Nadoret the player travels the Great River to reveal a series of pirate attacks. Over the course of the game he teams up with Ardo of Boarstock, the thief Cuano and the dwarf Forgrimm, who also appeared in ''Drakensang: The Dark Eye''.

==Gameplay==
Just like the original Drakensang, it has a traditional RPG party-based style, with a 'real-time with pause' round-based playmode as seen in games like [[Baldur's Gate]] or [[Neverwinter Nights]].&lt;ref name="armchair2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beekers2011_1" /&gt;  Using a largely faithful version of the pen and paper rules, statistics, skills and talents are leveled up through universal experience points which can be applied to anything from skills which increase the amount of information found on the minimap to skills useful for combat or negotiation.  The River of Time also addressed minor criticisms of the first game, such as the player's inability to return to most areas once completed.

It was released in Germany in February 2010, followed by an expansion pack called ''Phileasson's Secret'' in August 2010. It was released in English in January 2011,&lt;ref name="turner2011" /&gt; Phileasson's Secret in May 2011.&lt;ref name="beekers2011_2" /&gt;

== Reception ==

{{Video game reviews
| GR = 75.00% (2 reviews)&lt;ref name="gamerankings" /&gt;
| PCGUS = 80%&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;
}}

Drakensang: The River of Time was received positively in the German press and generally praised as an improvement over the first title.&lt;ref name="critify" /&gt; It won the "Best RPG 2010" at the German Developer Awards in Essen, Germany.&lt;ref name="golem2010" /&gt;

However, this second game of the franchise did not fare well financially, and subsequently Radon Labs were declared bankrupt&lt;ref name="wolf2010" /&gt; and acquired by [[Bigpoint Games]].&lt;ref name="caoili2010" /&gt; The Drakensang brand was then turned into an online browser game franchise, that no longer connects to The Dark Eye franchise.&lt;ref name="buffed2010" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">'''Feller's coin-tossing constants''' are a set of numerical constants which describe [[asymptotic]] [[probability|probabilities]] that in ''n'' independent tosses of a [[fair coin]], no run of ''k'' consecutive heads (or, equally, tails) appears.

[[William Feller]] showed&lt;ref&gt;Feller, W. (1968) An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Volume 1 (3rd Edition), Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-25708-7}} Section XIII.7&lt;/ref&gt; that if this probability is written as ''p''(''n'',''k'') then

:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} p(n,k) \alpha_k^{n+1}=\beta_k
&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the smallest positive real root of

:&lt;math&gt;x^{k+1}=2^{k+1}(x-1)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_k={2-\alpha_k \over k+1-k\alpha_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Values of the constants==
{|border=1

!k !!&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; !!&lt;math&gt;\beta_k&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|4||1.03758012...||1.13268577...
|}

For &lt;math&gt;k=2&lt;/math&gt; the constants are related to the [[golden ratio]], &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, and [[Fibonacci numbers]]; the constants are &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{5}-1=2\varphi-2=2/\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1+1/\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;. The exact probability ''p''(n,2) can be calculated either by using [[Fibonacci_number|Fibonacci numbers]], ''p''(n,2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{F_{n+2}}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; or by solving a direct [[recurrence relation]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quora.com/You-toss-a-fair-coin-12-times-What-is-the-probability-that-two-heads-do-not-occur-consecutively Quora Question: "You toss a fair coin 12 times. What is the probability that two heads do not occur consecutively?"]&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the same result. For higher values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the constants are related to [[Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers#Fibonacci_numbers_of_higher_order|generalizations of Fibonacci numbers]] such as the tribonacci and tetranacci numbers. The corresponding exact probabilities can be calculated as ''p''(n,k)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{F^{(k)}_{n+2}}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CoinTossing.html Coin Tossing at WolframMathWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
If we toss a fair coin ten times then the exact probability that no pair of heads come up in succession (i.e. ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) is ''p''(10,2)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{64}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.140625. The approximation &lt;math&gt;p(n,k) \approx \beta_k / \alpha_k^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; gives 1.44721356...&amp;times;1.23606797...&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.1406263...

'''Fossil Fools Day''' is an environmental demonstration day.  It occurs on April 1.  The name is a play on the term [[fossil fuel]]s and [[April Fools' Day]].

Fossil Fools Day began in 2004 with coordinated actions across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Teplitzky (October 25, 2004), “Declaring Independence from Dirty Energy.” Wiretap Magazine. {{cite web |url=http://www.wiretapmag.org/stories/20291 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029000950/http://www.wiretapmag.org/stories/20291/ |archivedate=2008-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Fossil Fools Days have been held in many cities around the world, and are generally organized by one or more environmental organizations with funding from [[Energy Action Coalition]] and [[Rising Tide North America|Rising Tide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://energyactioncoalition.org/whatwedo Energy Action: What we do]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fossilfoolsdayofaction.org/2009/ Fossil Fools Day 2009], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726063356/http://www.fossilfoolsdayofaction.org/2009/ archived] at the Internet Archive, July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Don't be 'fossil fools' on April 1st urge Rising Tide campaigners", ''Leamington Spa Courier'', March 27, 2008, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177153118.html online] at Highbeam (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Cullen, "Tires 'Fossil Fools' Targets More than 100 Vehicles in Madison Had Tires Deflated in What Some Call 'Eco-Terrorism'", ''The Wisconsin State Journal'', April 2, 2008, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177397917.html online at Highbeam], (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Fletcher, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/39327 "First Fossil Fools' Day in Australia"], Green Left, April 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beth Daley, [http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/greenblog/2009/04/clean_coal_april_fools_says_gr_1.html "Clean coal?

'''i-Generation Wrestling Superstars of Wrestling''' was a small series of [[professional wrestling]] shows in 2000.

The roster consisted of wrestlers who had previously achieved fame in other promotions. The tour promoted a World Championship, an International Championship and a Tag Team Championship.

i-Generation performed one tour of [[Australia]]. One event was filmed and broadcast as a pay-per-view event, later released on video. The show featured [[Dennis Rodman]] in the main event, and was advertised as ''Rodman Down Under''.

==Superstars of Wrestling==
'''Superstars of Wrestling''' was a [[pay-per-view]] event held by i-Generation. It took place on July 30, 2000 (and aired in the [[United States]] on December 1, 2000) from the [[Acer Arena|Sydney SuperDome]] in [[Sydney|Sydney, Australia]]. With the subtitle ''"Rodman Down Under"'', it was promoted largely for its main event which pitted the scientific veteran Curt Hennig against the controversial [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] star Dennis Rodman.

Vince Mancini and [[Ted DiBiase]] provided commentating for the event. Between each match, a female dance team known as the i-Generettes (similar to the [[Nitro Girls]]) performed at the entry way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2617">The '''Israel Film Festival''' is a [[film festival]] that takes place annually in the United States in three cities: Los Angeles, New York and Miami. It is the largest showcase of Israeli cinema in the United States. Founded in 1982 by Meir Fenigstein, a former drummer for the Israeli rock band, [[Kaveret]], the festival is the premier showcase for new work from Israeli independent filmmakers. The festival comprises official sections for Israeli dramatic and documentary films, both feature-length films and short films, and television dramas.

The festival is a production of IsraFest Foundation, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles whose mission is to enrich the American vision of Israeli life and culture through the medium of film, and to foster an intercultural dialogue through conversations with visiting Israeli artists. The festival is credited with helping Israeli films get Hollywood exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Mermelstein, David. ''Israel Film Fest a national celebration''. Variety, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the festival hosts a Gala Awards Dinner at the [[Beverly Hilton]] with a ''Hollywood Salute to Israel'' and bestows coveted '''IFF Awards''' to individuals for Acting, Producing, Visionary and Lifetime Achievements. On October 20, 2010, IFF Awards were presented to [[Richard Dreyfuss]] (Career Achievement Award), [[Ryan Kavanaugh]] (Outstanding Achievement in Film Award), [[Jon Landau]] (Visionary Award) and [[Avi Lerner]] (Lifetime Achievement Award).&lt;ref&gt;Mermelstein, David. ''Israel Film Festival honors four''. Variety, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israel Film Festival has distinguished itself from other festivals by being a traveling event that has been held in four major American cities: New York, Miami, Chicago and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Ryan. ''Israel Film Festival Celebrates 25th Anniversary''. The Hollywood Reporter, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bland was one{{which|date=November 2015}} of 8 children born in [[Flushing, Queens, New York|Flushing, New York]], to a free family.  His father was one of the first U. S. Negro college graduates ([[Oberlin College]], 1845).&lt;ref name="Spreadin'8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasen|first1=David A.|last2=Jones|first2=Gene|title=Spreadin' Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters 1880-1930|date=1998|publisher=Schimer Books|location=New York|isbn=0028647424|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with an eight-dollar [[banjo]] purchased by his father, he was performing professionally by age 14.

Bland was educated in Washington, DC and graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1873.&lt;ref name="Spreadin'9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasen|first1=David A.|last2=Jones|first2=Gene|title=Spreadin' Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters 1880-1930|date=1998|publisher=Schimer Books|location=New York|isbn=0028647424|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote over 700 songs, including "[[In the Morning in the Bright Light]]" (1879), "[[In the Evening by the Moonlight]]" (1879), "[[Oh! Dem Golden Slippers]]" (1879) (the theme song for the long-running Philadelphia [[Mummers Parade]]), "[[Hand Me Down My Walking Cane]]" (1880) and "[[De Golden Wedding]]" (1880). His best-known song is "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]" (1878),&lt;ref name="Spreadin'9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasen|first1=David A.|last2=Jones|first2=Gene|title=Spreadin' Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters 1880-1930|date=1998|publisher=Schimer Books|location=New York|isbn=0028647424|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in a slightly modified form, was the official State Song of [[Virginia]] from 1940 to 1997. It was retired and designated "state song emeritus" in the latter year, because of controversy over its racial nature.

Often called "The World's Greatest Minstrel Man", Bland toured the United States, as well as Europe. Bland's earliest recorded minstrel performance was with the Original Black Diamonds of Boston in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Black Diamonds Playbill, 1875. American minstrel show collection, 1823–1947: MS Thr 556.251. Harvard Theatre Collection, Houghton Library, Harvard College Library, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1881, he spent 20 years in London before returning to the United States.  Bland toured Europe in the early 1880s with Haverly's Genuine Colored Minstrels and remained in England to perform as a singer/banjo player without blackface. Appearing as "The Prince of Negro Songwriters," he was invited to give command performances for Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. Music historian Alec Wilder calls Bland the black writer who "broke down the barriers to white music publishers' offices." Bland was one of the most prolific minstrel composers of all time; he is reputed to have written over six hundred songs, though only about fifty were published under his name.&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Charles.  "Bland, James A.." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed December 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

James A. Bland spent his later years in obscurity. He died from tuberculosis May 5, 1911, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Spreadin'13"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasen|first1=David A.|last2=Jones|first2=Gene|title=Spreadin' Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters 1880-1930|date=1998|publisher=Schimer Books|location=New York|isbn=0028647424|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bland was buried in an unmarked grave without a funeral at Merion Memorial Park, [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]].

In 1939, his grave was found by [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) with the assistance of the editor of ''[[The Etude]]'' magazine, [[James Francis Cooke]]. His grave was landscaped and a monument was erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/bio/C187 James Bland Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/bland-james-1854-1911 |website=blackpast.org |title=Bland, James A. (1854–1911) |accessdate=December 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions Club of Virginia also assisted in this effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valions.org/Bland.html Lex, Joe. ''A Short History of James A. Bland'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lions Clubs of Virginia sponsor a music contest for school students called the "Bland Contest" in honor of James A. Bland. The Annual Bland Music Scholarships Program was established in 1948 to assist and promote cultural and educational opportunities for the musically talented youth of Virginia.

James Bland was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970. A housing project in [[Flushing, Queens]], is named after him. A separate housing project in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], is also named for Bland.

Joypolis centers have since opened in several cities in Japan and China with the parks featuring arcade games and amusement rides based on [[Sega]] [[intellectual properties]].

Overall, 9 Joypolis theme parks have been opened, but as of 2016, only five parks remain operational: three in Japan ([[Odaiba]], [[Tokyo]]; [[Umeda]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]] and [[Okayama]]) and two in [[China]] ([[Qingdao]] and [[Shanghai]]). The rest of the parks have closed due to low visitor numbers. The Odaiba, Umeda and Qingdao parks are currently operated by [[CA Sega Joypolis]], With the Okayama park operated by Sega Entertainment, and the Shanghai park is operated by Hong Kong-based ChinaAnimation. Sega announced in 2016 that China Animations would acquire a majority stake in Sega Live Creation (now CA Sega Joypolis) for 600 million yen, effective January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXLASDZ31H5F_R31C16A0000000|title=セガサミー、「ジョイポリス」を香港企業に売却|website=www.nikkei.com|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parks are no longer fully controlled by Sega with the exception of the Joypolis in Okayama.

Similar parks, owned in whole or part by Sega, called [[SegaWorld]] or [[GameWorks]] are also in existence.

==Accident history==
On April 20, 2005, Sega Corp. closed its Tokyo Joypolis ([[Odaiba]] area) theme park temporarily, pending a police investigation and an internal investigation into park safety procedures. The action came in the wake of an accident on the previous Monday in which a 30-year-old man died after he fell out of a ride. The ride, called "Viva! Skydiving," is a simulator ride that is designed to give passengers an experience of [[virtual reality|virtual]] [[skydiving]]. Apparently, the ride's operators allowed the overweight man to board the ride, even though the safety belt was not long enough to fit around his body. The man was secured only by an over-the-shoulder restraint, but Sega president [[Hisao Oguchi]] says that the restraint was locked in a "more loose position," causing the man to fall out. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
Reports indicate that, while Sega's official park operations manual forbids riders from riding without seat belts, Tokyo Joypolis had given its employees an unofficial manual that allowed ride operators to use their own discretion as to whether a person could board a ride. Sega says it was unaware that the park had its own manual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rideaccidents.com/2005.html#apr20b RideAccidents.com - 2005 Accident Reports and News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KILOO''' is a Danish games development company.  It was
founded in 2000 by Jacob Møller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: CEO of KILOO, Maker of App Store C64 Emulator|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/22510/Interview_CEO_of_Kiloo_Maker_of_App_Store_C64_Emulator|work=OSNews|publisher=OSNews|accessdate=27 January 2013|date=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a focus on developing entertainment content for [[Video game console|game console]] and handheld devices. In 2008, he was joined by his brother, Simon Møller. Together, they both run Kiloo.

KILOO's best known game, ''[[Subway Surfers]]'', was released in the spring of 2012 and was developed in cooperation with [[SYBO Games]]. A few weeks after its release, the free running game for iOS was named Game of the Week for 31 May 2012 by AppAdvice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chan|first=Christine|title=AppAdvice Game Of The Week For May 31, 2012|url=http://appadvice.com/appnn/2012/05/appadvice-game-of-the-week-for-may-31-2012|work=AppAdvice|publisher=AppAdvice|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the game made its way to Android and gathered even more enthusiastic players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grush|first=Andrew|title=Highly Popular iOS game, Subway Surfers, comes to Android|url=http://www.mobilemag.com/2012/09/21/highly-popular-ios-game-subway-surfers-comes-to-android/|work=Mobile Magazine|publisher=Mobile Magazine|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One month after the Android release, ''Subway Surfers'' made it into the top 20 growing Facebook apps by [[monthly active users]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darwell|first=Brittany|title=Farmville 2, Instagram, Zuma Blitz, Subway Surfers and more on this week’s top 20 growing Facebook apps by MAU|url=http://www.insidefacebook.com/2012/10/08/farmville-2-instagram-zuma-blitz-subway-surfers-and-more-on-this-weeks-top-20-growing-facebook-apps-by-mau/|work=Inside Facebook|publisher=Inside Facebook|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the game exceeded five hundred million downloads across all platforms. In September 2015 the download numbers reached 1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/62038/subway-surfers-does-1-billion-downloads-boasts-27-million-daily-active-players/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
KILOO was founded in 2000, in a small apartment in Aarhus, Denmark, as a two-person company. In 2002, the partnership dissolved and KILOO changed into a private company. In the same year, KILOO won the [[Nokia]] Mobile Challenge in the games category&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia Mobile Challenge awards winners for most innovative and useful Java(TM) applications|url=http://press.nokia.com/2002/03/07/nokia-mobile-challenge-awards-winners-for-most-innovative-and-useful-javatm-applications/|work=Press Release|publisher=Nokia|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of 500 competing companies, with their game ''Popstar'', built on a ''[[Tamagotchi]]''-like concept of managing the career and basic needs of an upcoming pop music star.

KILOO later entered an agreement with [[THQ Wireless]] to develop the game ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' for mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worms game page|url=http://www.ign.com/games/worms/cell-684312#|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KILOO also cooperated with [[Interactive Television Entertainment|ITE]] on the development and distribution of mobile content based on the TV and game character [[Hugo (franchise)|Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITE and KILOO expands Agreement|url=http://www.hugo-troll.de/weltweit/news/01092003.html|work=Press Release|publisher=hugo-troll.de|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, the Hugo games had been bought by 1 million people.

Between 2006 and 2009, KILOO had the exclusive mobile rights for [[LEGO]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomsen|first=Casper|title=Fodbold indleder millionsalg af Lego-mobilspil|url=https://www.computerworld.dk/art/32729/fodbold-indleder-millionsalg-af-lego-mobilspil|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, KILOO broke into Børsen’s "Fast Track 100", which placed it in the league of Denmark’s fastest growing private companies. In the same year, KILOO acquired the exclusive rights for Whac-a-Mole worldwide with reference to developing and selling Whac-a-Mole mobile content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whac-a-Mole™ by KILOO Exceeds 1,500,000 U.S. Downloads on iPhone Over the 12 Days of Christmas|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/02/prweb3566194.htm|work=Press Release|publisher=PRWeb|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 KILOO raised capital from Danish VC FirmaInvest for further growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lubbe|first=Anne|title=Mobile phone game developer KILOO raises fresh capital|url=http://www.investindk.com/News-and-events/News/2008/Mobile-phone-game-developer-Kiloo-raises-fresh-capital|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 KILOO licensed the full suite of Wham-O rights for mobile (HackySack, SuperBall, Frisbee and Hula Hoop), which so far has resulted in ''[[Frisbee Forever]]'' and ''[[Frisbee Forever 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Jon|title=Kiloo and Wham-O link up for iOS title Frisbee Forever|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Frisbee+Forever/news.asp?c=28687|publisher=pocketgamer.co.uk|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LCD crosstalk''' is a visual defect in an [[LCD screen]] which occurs because of interference between adjacent [[pixel]]s.

Owing to the way rows and columns in the display are addressed, and charge is pushed around, the data on one part of the display has the potential to influence what is displayed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;P. M. Alt, P. Pleshko ''Scanning limitations of liquid-crystal displays,'' IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, vol. ED-21, pp. 146–155, Feb. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally known as [[cross-talk]], and in matrix displays typically occurs in the horizontal and vertical directions. Cross-talk used to be a serious problem in the old [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix (STN) displays]], but is rarely discernable in modern [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix (TFT) displays]].

A fortunate side-effect of inversion (see above) is that, for most display material, what little cross-talk there is largely cancelled out. For most practical purposes, the level of crosstalk in modern LCDs is negligible.

Certain patterns, particularly those involving fine dots, can interact with the inversion and reveal visible cross-talk. If you try moving a small Window in front of the inversion pattern (above) which makes your screen flicker the most, you may well see cross-talk in the surrounding pattern.

Different patterns are required to reveal cross-talk on different displays (depending on their inversion scheme).

The '''murder of Christopher Wallace''', better known by his stage names "[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]" and "Biggie Smalls", occurred in the early hours of March 9, 1997. The [[hip hop]] artist was shot four times in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], one of which was fatal. Despite numerous witnesses and enormous media attention and speculation, no one was ever formally charged for the murder of Wallace. The case remains officially unsolved, as police have searched for years for more details without success.

In 2006, Wallace's mother, Voletta Wallace; his widow, Faith Evans and his children, T'yanna Jackson and Christopher Jordan Wallace (CJ) filed a $500 million wrongful death lawsuit against the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] alleging that [[police corruption|corrupt]] LAPD officers were responsible for Wallace's murder. Retired LAPD Officer [[Greg Kading]] alleged that [[Suge Knight|Marion "Suge" Knight]], the head of [[Death Row Records]], hired fellow [[Bloods|Blood]] gang member Wardell "Poochie" Fouse to murder Wallace and paid Poochie $13,000. He also alleged that Theresa Swan, the mother of Knight's child, was also involved in the murder, and was paid $25,000 to set up meetings both before and after the shooting took place. In 2003, Poochie himself was murdered in a drive-by by rival gang members.

==Prior events==
Christopher Wallace traveled to Los Angeles, California in February 1997 to promote his upcoming second studio album, ''[[Life After Death]]'', and to film a [[music video]] for its lead single, "[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]". On March 5, he gave a radio interview with ''[[The Dog House (talk show)|The Dog House]]'' on [[San Francisco]]'s [[KYLD]], in which he stated that he had hired security because he feared for his safety. Wallace cited not only the ongoing [[East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry|East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud]] and the [[murder of Tupac Shakur]] six months prior, but his role as a high-profile [[celebrity]] in general, as his reasons for the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1425831/19970312/notorious_big.jhtml |title=Biggie Told Interviewer He Worried About Safety |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=March 12, 1997 |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Life After Death'' was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997.

On March 7, Wallace presented an award to [[Toni Braxton]] at the [[1997 Soul Train Music Awards]] in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience.&lt;ref name="Court TV"&gt;Bruno, Anthony [http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/4.html The Murders of gangsta rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234501/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/4.html |date=2007-04-07 }} ''Court TV Crime Library''. Retrieved January 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The following evening, March 8, he attended an after-party hosted by [[Vibe (magazine)|''Vibe'' magazine]] and [[Qwest Records]] at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]] in West Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Court TV"/&gt; Other guests included [[Faith Evans]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Sean Combs]], and members of the [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]] gangs.&lt;ref name="rolling stone murder"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/8898338/the_unsolved_mystery_of_the_notorious_big |title=The Unsolved Mystery of the Notorious B.I.G. |publisher=Rolling Stone |author=Sullivan, Randall |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=October 7, 2006|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090429075620/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/8898338/the_unsolved_mystery_of_the_notorious_big|archivedate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
On March 9, 1997, at 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]), Wallace left with his entourage in two [[Chevrolet Suburban]]s to return to his hotel after the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] closed the party early because of overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/10/us/rapper-is-shot-to-death-in-echo-of-killing-6-months-ago.html |title=Rapper Is Shot to Death in Echo of Killing 6 Months Ago|last=Purdum|first=Todd S.|date=March 10, 1997|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace traveled in the front passenger seat alongside his associates Damion "D-Roc" Butler, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]] member [[Lil' Cease]], and driver Gregory "G-Money" Young. Combs traveled in the other vehicle with three bodyguards. The two SUVs were trailed by a [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] carrying [[Bad Boy Records]]' director of security.&lt;ref name="rolling stone murder"/&gt;

By 12:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PST]]), the streets were crowded with people leaving the event. Wallace's SUV stopped at a red light on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and South Fairfax Avenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nevereatshreddedwheat # |url=http://popturf.com/locations/music/the-notorious-big/where-biggie-smalls-was-shot-and-killed |title=where biggie smalls was shot and killed in los angeles : the notorious b.i.g. &amp;#124; music at popturf |publisher=Popturf.com |date=March 9, 1997 |accessdate=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; just {{convert|50|yd|m}} from the museum. A dark-colored [[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation .28Impala SS.2C 1994.E2.80.931996.29|Chevrolet Impala SS]] pulled up alongside Wallace's SUV. The driver of the Impala, a black male dressed in a blue suit and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a 9&amp;nbsp;mm blue-steel pistol and fired at the Suburban; four bullets hit Wallace.&lt;ref name="rolling stone murder"/&gt; Wallace's entourage rushed him to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], where doctors performed an emergency [[thoracotomy]], but he was pronounced dead at 1:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. (PST). He was 24 years old.
 
His [[autopsy]] was released to the public in December 2012, fifteen years after his death. According to the report, three of the four shots were not fatal. The first bullet hit his left forearm and traveled down to his wrist; the second hit him in the back, missing all vital organs, and exited through his left shoulder; and the third hit his left thigh and exited through his inner thigh. The report said that the third bullet struck "the left side of the scrotum, causing a very shallow, {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0|disp=sqbr}} linear laceration." The fourth bullet was fatal, entering through his right hip and striking several vital organs, including his [[Large intestine|colon]], [[liver]], [[heart]], and the upper lobe of his left [[lung]], before stopping in his left shoulder area.&lt;ref name="autopsy"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Horowitz | first = Steven J. | title = Notorious B.I.G.

Wallace's death was mourned by fellow hip hop artists and fans worldwide. Rapper [[Nas]] felt at the time of Wallace's death that his passing, along with that of [[Tupac Shakur]], "was nearly the end of rap."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/8930/20140818/nas-interview-tupac-b-g-deaths-nearly-end-rap.htm|title=Nas Interview: Tupac, B.I.G.

==Investigation==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Sketch of the suspect.jpg|thumb|right|Composite sketch of the suspect in the shooting]] --&gt;
Immediately following the shooting, reports surfaced linking Wallace's murder with that of Shakur six months earlier, due to similarities in the drive-by shootings and the highly publicized East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud, of which Shakur and Wallace had been central figures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cathy Scott]]. [https://archive.is/20120912033731/http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/031097similar.html "Rap slaying similar to Shakur's"]. ''Las Vegas Sun''. March 10, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Media reports had previously speculated that Wallace was in some way connected to Shakur's murder, though no evidence ever surfaced to seriously implicate him. Shortly after Wallace's death, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writers [[Chuck Philips]] and Matt Lait reported that the key suspect in his murder was a member of the Southside Crips acting in service of a personal financial motive, rather than on the gang's behalf.&lt;ref name="March 1997 police probe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips Laitt|first=Chuck Matt|title=Personal Dispute Is Focus of Rap Probe|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-18/local/me-39352_1_southside-crips-gang-members|accessdate=September 18, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation stalled, however, and no one was ever formally charged.

In a 2002 book by [[Randall Sullivan]], called ''LAbyrinth'', information was compiled about the murders of Wallace and Shakur based on information provided by retired LAPD detective [[Russell Poole]].&lt;ref name="rolling stone murder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="popmatters review"/&gt; In the book, Sullivan accused Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records and a known Bloods affiliate, of conspiring with corrupt LAPD officer [[David Mack (police officer)|David Mack]] to kill Wallace and make both deaths appear to be the result of the rap rivalry.&lt;ref name="ew labyrinth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="la times debunk"/&gt; The book stated that one of Mack's alleged associates, Amir Muhammad, was the [[hitman]] who killed Wallace. The theory was based on evidence provided by an [[informant]]&lt;ref name="Lawsuit witness admits to false declaration"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Witness in B.I.G. case says his memory's bad|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-biggie20jun20,0,1053108.story|accessdate=October 3, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=June 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general resemblance of Muhammad to the [[facial composite]] generated during the investigation.&lt;ref name="ew labyrinth"&gt;Serpick, Evan (April 12, 2002).

Retrieved January 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la times debunk"/&gt; In 2002, filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]] released a documentary, ''[[Biggie &amp; Tupac]]'', based on information from the book.&lt;ref name="popmatters review"&gt;Fuchs, Cynthia (September 6, 2002). "[http://www.popmatters.com/film/reviews/b/biggie-and-tupac.shtml Biggie and Tupac review]" ''PopMatters''. Retrieved January 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described Broomfield's low-budget documentary as a "largely speculative" and "circumstantial" account relying on flimsy evidence, failing to "present counter-evidence" or "question sources."&lt;ref name="leland2002"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leland|first=John|title=New Theories Stir Speculation On Rap Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/arts/new-theories-stir-speculation-on-rap-deaths.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the motive suggested for the murder of Wallace in the documentary—to decrease suspicion for the Shakur shooting six months earlier—was, as ''The New York Times'' put it, "unsupported in the film."&lt;ref name="leland2002"/&gt;

An article published in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' by Sullivan in December 2005 accused the LAPD of not fully investigating links with Death Row Records based on Poole's evidence. Sullivan claimed that Combs "failed to fully cooperate with the investigation", and according to Poole, encouraged Bad Boy staff to do the same.&lt;ref name="rolling stone murder"/&gt; The accuracy of the article was later challenged in a letter by the Assistant Managing Editor of the ''Los Angeles Times'', who accused Sullivan of using "shoddy tactics." Sullivan, in response, quoted the lead attorney of the Wallace estate calling the newspaper "a co-conspirator in the cover-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9142533/la_times_responds_to_biggie_story |title=L.A.

More recently, a Hollywood film was produced based on the Poole's investigation and Sullivan's book: ''[[LAbyrinth (2017 film)|LAbyrinth]],'' starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Poole, is scheduled to be released in 2018.

In examining Sullivan's assertion that the ''Los Angeles Times'' was involved in a cover-up conspiracy with the LAPD, it is instructive to note that conflicting theories of the murder were offered in different sections of the ''Times''. The Metro section of the ''Times'' wrote that police suspected a connection between Wallace's death and the [[Rampart scandal|Rampart police corruption scandal]], consistent with Sullivan and Poole's theory.&lt;ref name="Brills content on Metro B.I.G. story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=John|title=Notorious LAT|url=http://www.brillscontent.com/notorious05_23_00.html|accessdate=August 1, 2012|newspaper=Brills Content|date=May 23–26, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809155422/http://www.brillscontent.com/notorious05_23_00.html|archive-date=2012-08-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metro section also ran a photo of Muhammad, identified by police as a mortgage broker unconnected to the murder who appeared to match details of the shooter, and the paper printed his name and driver's license. But Chuck Philips, a staff writer for the Business section of the ''Times'' who had been following the investigation and had not heard of the Rampart–Muhammad theory, searched for Muhammad, whom the Metro reporters could not find for comment. It took Philips only three days to find Muhammad, who had a current ad for his brokerage business running in the ''Times''. Muhammad, who was not an official suspect at the time, came forward to clear his name. The Metro section of the paper was opposed to running a retraction, but the business desk editor, Mark Saylor,&lt;ref name="Mark Saylor obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Trounson|first=Rebecca|title=Mark Saylor dies at 58; former Times editor oversaw Pulitzer-winning series|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/22/local/la-me-mark-saylor-20130223|accessdate=April 28, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; said, "Chuck is sort of the world's authority on rap violence" and pushed, along with Philips, for the ''Times'' to retract the article.&lt;ref name="Brills content on Metro B.I.G. story"/&gt;

The May 2000 ''Los Angeles Times'' correction article was written by Philips, who quoted Muhammad as saying, "I'm a mortgage broker, not a murderer" and asking, "How can something so completely false end up on the front page of a major newspaper?"&lt;ref name="Chuck Philips on Amir Muhammed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Man No Longer Under Scrutiny in Rapper's Death|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/03/local/me-26105|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story cleared Muhammad's name.&lt;ref name="Brills content on Metro B.I.G. story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Notorious LAT; by original Brill's content author of eponymous article John Cook"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=John|title=Notorious LAT|url=http://www.referencetone.com/2005/06/notorious-lat.html|publisher=Reference tone|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2005 story by Philips showed that the main informant for the Poole-Sullivan theory was a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] with admitted memory lapses known as "Psycho Mike" who confessed to [[hearsay]].&lt;ref name="Chuck Philips on Biggie murder"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Informant in Rap Star's Slaying Admits Hearsay|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/03/local/me-biggie3|accessdate=September 15, 2013|newspaper=LA Times|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cook of ''[[Brill's Content]]'' noted that Philips' article "demolished"{{r|Notorious LAT; by original Brill's content author of eponymous article John Cook}} the Poole-Sullivan theory of Wallace's murder.

In the 2000 book ''[[The Murder of Biggie Smalls]]'', investigative journalist and author [[Cathy Scott]] suggested that Wallace and Shakur's murders might have been the result of the East Coast–West Coast feud and motivated by financial gain for the record companies, because the rappers were worth more dead than alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bruno |first=Anthony |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/5b.html |title=Hip-Hop Homicide — "Worth More Dead Than Alive" — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181241/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/5b.html |archive-date=2013-11-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal investigation into Wallace's murder was re-opened in July 2006 to look for new evidence to help the city defend the civil lawsuits brought by the Wallace family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Philips |first=Chuck |title=LAPD Renews Search for Rapper's Killer |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 31, 2006 |url=http://www.lapd.com/article.aspx?&amp;a=4084 |accessdate=January 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021051439/http://www.lapd.com/article.aspx?&amp;a=4084 |archivedate=October 21, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=LAPD launching new Notorious BIG task force |agency=Associated Press |date=August 3, 2006 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14118674/ |accessdate=September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired LAPD detective [[Greg Kading]], who worked for three years on a gang task force that included the Wallace case, alleges that the rapper was shot by Wardell "Poochie" Fouse, an associate of Knight, who died on July 24, 2003, after being shot in the back while riding his motorcycle in [[Compton, California|Compton]].

In December 2012, the LAPD released the autopsy results conducted on Wallace's body to generate new leads. The release was criticized by the long-time lawyer of his estate, Perry Sanders Jr., who objected to an autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/12/08/lawyer-for-notorious-b-i-g-blasts-lapd-over-autopsy-report/ |title=Lawyer For Notorious B.I.G.

==Lawsuits==
===Wrongful death claim===
In March 2006, Wallace's mother Voletta filed a [[wrongful death claim]] against the City of Los Angeles based on the evidence championed by Poole.&lt;ref name="la times debunk"&gt;Philips, Chuck [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/04/local/me-biggie4 "Slain rapper's family keeps pushing suit"] ''Los Angeles Times'', February 7, 2007. Retrieved April 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed the LAPD had sufficient evidence to arrest the assailant, but failed to use it. David Mack and Amir Muhammad (a.k.a. Harry Billups) were originally named as defendants in the [[Lawsuit|civil suit]], but were dropped shortly before the trial began after the LAPD and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] dismissed them as suspects.&lt;ref name="la times debunk"/&gt;

The case came for trial before a jury on June 21, 2005. On the eve of the trial, a key witness who was expected to testify, Kevin Hackie, revealed that he suffered memory lapses due to psychiatric medications. He had previously testified to knowledge of involvement between Knight, Mack, and Muhammed, but later said that the Wallace attorneys had altered his declarations to include words he never said. Hackie took full blame for filing a false declaration.&lt;ref name="Lawsuit witness admits to false declaration"/&gt;

Several days into the trial, the plaintiffs' attorney disclosed to the Court and opposing counsel that he had received a telephone call from someone claiming to be a LAPD officer and provided detailed information about the existence of evidence concerning the Wallace murder. The court directed the city to conduct a thorough investigation, which uncovered previously undisclosed evidence, much of which was in the desk or cabinet of Det. Steven Katz, the lead detective in the Wallace investigation. The documents centered around interviews by numerous police officers of an incarcerated informant, who had been a cellmate of imprisoned Rampart officer [[Rafael Pérez (police officer)|Rafael Perez]] for some extended period of time. He reported that Perez had told him about his and Mack's involvement with Death Row Records and their activities at the Peterson Automotive Museum the night of Wallace's murder. As a result of the newly discovered evidence, the judge declared a [[mistrial]] and awarded the Wallace family its attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;Estate of Wallace v. City of Los Angeles, 229 F.R.D. 163 (C.D. Cal. 2005);Reid, Shaheem (July 5, 2005). [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1505321/20050706/notorious_big.jhtml "Notorious B.I.G. Wrongful-Death Case Declared A Mistrial"]. [[MTV News]]. Retrieved February 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2007, relatives of Wallace filed a second wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles. The suit also named two LAPD officers in the center of the investigation into the Rampart scandal, Perez and [[Nino Durden]]. According to the claim, Perez, an alleged affiliate of Death Row Records, admitted to LAPD officials that he and Mack (who was not named in the lawsuit) "conspired to murder, and participated in the murder of Christopher Wallace". The Wallace family said the LAPD "consciously concealed Rafael Perez's involvement in the murder of ... Wallace".&lt;ref name="E!

Online|accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States District Judge]] [[Florence-Marie Cooper]] granted [[summary judgment]] to the city on December 17, 2007, finding that the Wallace family had not complied with a California law that required the family to give notice of its claim to the State within six months of Wallace's death.&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Christopher G.L.

City of Los Angeles, et al.'', 2:07-cv-02956-FMC-RZx (C.D. Cal. May 27, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The suit against the City of Los Angeles was finally dismissed in 2010. It was described by ''The New York Times'' as "one of the longest running and most contentious celebrity cases in history."&lt;ref name="Wrongful-Death suit dismissed"/&gt; The Wallace suit had asked for $500 million from the city.&lt;ref name="Wrongful-Death suit dismissed"/&gt;

'''Muscle reading''', also known as "[[Axel Hellstrom|Hellstromism]]",  "Cumberlandism" or "contact mind reading", is a technique used by [[Mentalism|mentalists]] to determine the thoughts or knowledge of a subject, the effect of which tends to be perceived as a form of [[Telepathy|mind reading]]. The performer can determine many things about the mental state of a subject by observing subtle, involuntary responses to speech or any other stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1996). ''The Illustrated History of Magic''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner Martin]]. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-20394-8}} "The unwitting translation of thoughts into muscular action is one of the most firmly established facts of psychology. In individuals particularly prone to it, it is responsible for such "occult" phenomena as the movement of a Ouija board, table tipping, and automatic writing. It is the basis of a type of mind reading known in the magic profession as "muscle reading." Someone hides a pin in a room, and the performer finds it quickly by having a spectator take hold of his hand. The spectator thinks he is being led by the magician, but actually the performer permits the spectator to lead him by unconscious muscular tensions. Many famous muscle readers are able to dispense with bodily contact altogether, finding the hidden object merely by observing the reactions of spectators in the room."&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to the [[ideomotor effect]], whereby subtle movements made without conscious awareness reflect a physical movement, action or direction which the subject is thinking about. The term "muscle reading" was coined in the 1870s by American neurologist [[George M. Beard]] to describe the actions of mentalist [[J. Randall Brown]], an early proponent of the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Jay  | first = Ricky  | authorlink = Ricky Jay  | title = Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women  | publisher = [[Villard Books]]  | year = 1986  | location = New York City  | pages = 175  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-HHYAAAAMAAJ  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon During|During, Simon]].

== History ==

Muscle reading is also known by the names of those who have used it in popular performances. The success of one early performer, [[Stuart Cumberland]], led to the technique's alternate name of Cumberlandism. The fame of the [[mentalist]] [[Axel Hellstrom]] led to it widely being called Hellstromism. Performers such as [[J. Randall Brown]], [[Erik Jan Hanussen]], [[Franz Polgar]], and [[Kreskin]] have also used muscle reading successfully in their acts. 

In 1924, magician [[Carl Hertz]] noted that "mind-reading is nothing but muscle-reading. In all the cases where the mind-reader is supposed to lead a person to a hidden object, the spectator is guided entirely by an involuntary movement of the subject's muscles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Hertz|Hertz, Carl]]. (1924). ''A Modern Mystery Merchant''. Hutchinson &amp; Company. p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; The mentalist [[Washington Irving Bishop]] could drive a car blindfolded by muscle reading techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Neher, Andrew. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. p. 33. {{ISBN|0-486-26167-0}} "Washington Irving Bishop could drive blindfolded through city streets, guided by the involuntary muscle reactions of a passenger who placed his hand on Bishop. In addition, Bishop could drive to a location anywhere in the city where his passenger had hidden an object and, still through reading his guide's muscle reactions, would locate the object in its hiding place."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kreskin, one of the most accomplished performers of muscle reading in modern times, can tell a driver where to go in a car while a subject holds his wrist (or vice versa). In one of his books he relates the technique to the children's game within which a hidden object is located by feedback of "hot" or "cold".

[[June Downey]] had studied the practice of muscle reading from a psychological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Roeckelein, Jon E. (2004). ''Imagery in Psychology: A Reference Guide''. Praeger. p. 238. {{ISBN|0-313-32197-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been described as an expert on the subject of muscle reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apadivisions.org/division-35/about/heritage/june-downey-biography.aspx "June Etta Downey (1875-1932)"]. Society for the Psychology of Women.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The technique relies on the assertion that the subject will subconsciously reveal their thoughts through very slight involuntary physical reactions, also known as ideomotor responses. The performer can determine what the subject is thinking by recognising and interpreting those responses. Muscle reading may be billed by some entertainers as a [[psychic]] phenomenon, where the audience will be told that by creating physical contact with the subject, a better psychic connection can be formed. In fact, the contact allows the performer to read more subtle reactions in the subject's motor functions that may not be apparent without contact, such as muscle control and heart rate.

Because muscle reading relies so heavily on the subject's subconscious reactions to their environment and situation, this technique is used commonly when performing stunts dealing with locating objects in an auditorium or on stage, and as such, it can be done 'clean' by the magician skilled in [[Kinesics|reading body language]].

Performers often instruct the subject to imagine voicing instructions, which presumably amplifies the reactions of the subject, thus promoting the idea that the trick involves genuine thought tranference or mind-reading. However the subject who is "thinking directions" has a physical, kinaesthetic reaction that guides the performer so that he or she can, for example, locate a specific place on a wall on which to place a pin, without prior knowledge of where the pin should go.

Knowledge of muscle reading is a technique that is also reportedly used by poker players to hide their reactions to the game, as well as to read the other players for potential bluffs and/or better hands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9444">The '''Muslim social''' is a [[film genre]] in [[Hindi cinema]] that portrays and critiques [[Islamic culture]] in [[India]]. It flourished in the 1950s and 1960s and lasted till the early 1980s. Muslim socials are divided into two categories: "classic Muslim socials" that explore [[nawab]]i culture and focus on upper class or elite Muslim families, and "new wave Muslim socials" that portray middle class Muslim families who experience economic problems, [[discrimination]] and [[communal violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Islamicate Cultures of Bombay Cinema |last= Allen  |first= Richard|author2=Ira Bhaskar |year= 2009 |publisher= Tulika Books |isbn= 978-81-89487-53-9|pages= 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslim socials often include [[Filmi-ghazal|ghazal]]s, [[qawwali]]s, [[Urdu poetry]] and expressions, and musical forms commonly associated with Islamic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Media and the Transformation of Religion in South Asia |last= Babb |first= Lawrence A.  |author2=Susan S.

Director [[M.S. Sathyu]] who made ''[[Garam Hava]]'' (1973), called it "a skewed way to look at cinema. When there is no Hindu social or Christian social, how can there be a Muslim social".&lt;ref name=hindu14&gt;{{cite web | title = Back with the wind |work=The Hindu | url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/back-with-the-wind/article6596295.ece |date=November 14, 2014| accessdate = 2014-11-14  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest Muslim socials were made in the 1930s after the advent of [[Sound film|sound]] and continued to be popular until the 1980s. The genre's popularity was partly due to the financial success of [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Najma (film)|Najma]]'' (1943), which became the blueprint for Muslim socials that followed, which too delved on social issues around Muslim families, no matter what the setting, giving the genre its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Women, Islam and cinema|last=  Dönmez-Colin |first=  Gönül |year= 2004 |publisher= Reaktion Books |location= London|isbn= 1-86189-220-9 |page= 93 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pWhZ0hgH80cC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tri/&gt;

Based on the life of [[Mughal Emperor]], [[Jahangir]], ''[[Pukar (1939 film)|Pukar]]'' (1939) made by [[Sohrab Modi]], known for his historicals, is the first notable film in this genre.&lt;ref name=ru189/&gt; Soon Hindi cinema based in [[Mumbai]] became the hub for Muslim socials, and it employed a large number of Muslim producers, director, screenwriters, music directors, lyricists and actors,&lt;ref name=ru189/&gt; most notably [[Mehboob Khan]], [[K. A. Abbas]], [[Kamal Amrohi]], [[Abrar Alvi]], [[Abdul Rashid Kardar]], [[Saadat Hassan Manto]], [[Ismat Chugtai]], [[Ghulam Haider (composer)|Ghulam Haider]], [[Khayyam]], [[Sahir Ludhianvi]], [[Majrooh Sultanpuri]], [[Shakeel Badayuni]],  [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Talat Mahmood]], [[Shamshad Begum]].&lt;ref name=cine/&gt;  Numerous films were made about the Mughals, including ''[[Humayun (film)|Humayun]]'' (1945) by [[Mehboob Khan]], ''[[Shahjehan]]'' (1946) by [[Abdul Rashid Kardar]], ''[[Taj Mahal (1963 film)|Taj Mahal]]'' (1963) by M. Sadiq, and ''[[Jahan Ara (film)|Jahan Ara]]'' (1964), however the pinnacle of this royalty theme was ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960) by [[K. Asif]], about [[Akbar]], his son [[Prince Salim]] (later known as Jahangir), and the courtesan [[Anarkali]], who itself became the theme of other films, like ''[[Anarkali (1953 film)|Anarkali]]'' (1953).&lt;ref name=ru189&gt;[[#Ru|Ruthven, 189]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular theme of the period was centered on the nawabi culture, especially the culture of [[Awadh]], present day [[Lucknow]], it produced films marked by elaborate production, music and highlighting the sophistication of language and lifestyle, like ''[[Mirza Ghalib (film)|Mirza Ghalib]]'' (1954), ''[[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]]'' (1960), ''[[Mere Mehboob]]'' (1963), ''[[Dil Hi To Hai (1963 film)|Dil Hi To Hai]]'' (1963) and ''[[Pakeezah]]'' (1972) by [[Kamal Amrohi]], starring [[Meena Kumari]], which spent over a decade in making.&lt;ref name=cine/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu241/&gt;

Thereafter the films in this genre shifted from regal that of fading Nawabi culture - ''[[Bahu Begum]]'' (1967).  After experiencing its height in the 1970s, the genre descended to being a mere stereotypical and kitschy representation complete a ''kotha'' of a courtesan or a nawab stricken with poverty. One exception was ''[[Umrao Jaan (1981 film)|Umrao Jaan]]'' (1981) directed by [[Muzaffar Ali]] based on 1905 historical novel ''[[Umrao Jaan Ada]]'' by [[Mirza Hadi Ruswa]].

Musical romances were also prepared in this genre which included [[H. S. Rawail]]'s ''Mere Mehboob'' (1963),  ''[[Mehboob Ki Mehndi]]'' (1971) and ''[[Laila Majnu (1976 film)|Laila Majnu]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name=sify&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/h-s-rawail-death-of-a-faded-giant-news-bollywood-kkfvH8fifge.html|title=H.S. Rawail: Death of a faded giant|author=[[Subhash K. Jha]]|publisher=[[sify.com]]|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More over reflecting on the changing times, themes shifted regal to middle class [[North India]]n Muslims, and from mainstream Bollywood to [[parallel cinema]] or the new wave cinema, starting with  ''[[Dastak (1970 film)|Dastak]]'' (1970), ''[[Garm Hava]]'' (1973), ''[[Bazaar (1982 film)|Bazaar]]'' (1982) and ''[[Nikaah]]'' (1982). Besides that Ali made ''[[Anjuman (1986 film)|Anjuman]]'' (1986), and [[Saeed Akhtar Mirza]] made ''[[Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro]]'' (1989) and ''[[Naseem (film)|Naseem]]'' (1995). Gradually the genre lost both nuanced depiction of its hey days was imitated by the cinema many Muslim countries, and audiences as well, and few notable additions were made to this genre, and too sporadic.&lt;ref name=tri&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Mystique in Indian films |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050122/saturday/main1.htm|author=Nirupama Dutt |publisher= The Tribune|date=January 22, 2005 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ru189/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu241/&gt;

The genre resurfaced in works of the screenwriter [[Khalid Mohammed]], ''[[Mammo]]'' (1994), ''[[Sardari Begum]]'' (1996), ''[[Fiza]]'' (2000) and   ''[[Zubeidaa]]'' (2001), Mohammed directed ''Fiza'', while the rest were directed by art film master [[Shyam Benegal]], Benegal had previously directed, and ''[[Junoon (1978 film)|Junoon]]'' (1978) set in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], stories with marked political content.&lt;ref name=cine&gt;{{cite web |title=Ghararas To Guns-From The Muslim Social To The Muslim Political |url=http://cineblitz.liveinstyle.com/features/detail/ghararas-to-guns-from-the-muslim-social-to-the-muslim-political |date= December 2012|publisher=Cine Blitz |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Marañón''' was founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1976 to further the integral development of the people in northern [[Peru]]. It is headquartered in the [[Apostolic Vicariate of Jaén in Peru|Apostolic Vicariate of Jaén]] which is also administered by the [[Jesuits]], and is named for the chief source of the [[Amazon River]], the [[Marañón River]], which flows through [[Jaén Province, Peru|Jaén]]. 

==History==
After 1985, the Educational Institute of Radio Marañón (INTERAMA) was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LineaDeFormacionEInvestigacionDeAler|title=Linea de Formacion e Investigacion de ALER|last=Radionauta}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1994 it became a member of the Latin American Association of Radio Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sistema.aler.org/?q=afiliadas-sitio-web&amp;field_afiliada_pais_tid=33|title=Nuestras Afiliadas {{!}} Sistema ALER|website=sistema.aler.org|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later of the [[World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters]]. During the repressive, right-leaning [[Alberto Fujimori|Fujimori]] 1990s, seven Radio Marañón journalists were threatened and one narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VeI76JSJZAC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Radio+Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M9k3f-5JRf&amp;sig=kQTFTXi1rNY2vifLVdsAWgVwhy8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9hKSr45nXAhUFy2MKHRsDCFQ4PBDoAQg5MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Radio%20Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n&amp;f=false|title=World Report 2000|last=(Organization)|first=Human Rights Watch|last2=Staff|first2=Human Rights Watch|date=1999|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=9781564322388|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 FM Stereo Marañón 96.1 "Atrévete" was initiated as a commercial station.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2003 the station was one of eight recipients of the Eloy Arribas award bestowed by Peru's National Radio Coordinator (CNR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.caretas.pe/2003/1794/articulos/cnr.html|title=CARETAS HOME PAGE|website=www2.caretas.pe|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 CNR decried unjust charges against Francisco Muguiro Ibarra, director of Radio Marañón de Jaén, in which Panamericana Televisión accused him and several communal leaders of supporting a violent terrorist network because they defended local communities from the intrusion of foreign mining companies. CNR also mentioned Fr. Muguiro’s active participation in the Life and Peace National Campaign in the 1980s, when he received a death threat from the [[Shining Path]] communist party in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.servindi.org/actualidad/135|title=Perú: Rechazan acusaciones contra vicario apostólico y director de Radio Marañón {{!}} Servindi - Servicios de Comunicación Intercultural|website=www.servindi.org|language=es|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the programming of FM and AM were unified with programs reaching both rural and urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiomaranon.org.pe/index.php/institucional/historia|title=Historia - ::Radio Marañón::|last=Master|first=Web|website=www.radiomaranon.org.pe|language=es-es|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7033">In mathematics, the '''replicator equation''' is a deterministic monotone non-linear and non-innovative game dynamic used in [[evolutionary game theory]]. The replicator equation differs from other equations used to model replication, such as the [[quasispecies]] equation, in that it allows the [[fitness function]] to incorporate the distribution of the population types rather than setting the fitness of a particular type constant. This important property allows the replicator equation to capture the essence of [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Unlike the quasispecies equation, the replicator equation does not incorporate [[mutation]] and so is not able to innovate new types or pure strategies. 

== Equational forms ==

The most general continuous form is given by the [[differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x_i} = x_i [ f_i(x) - \phi(x)], \quad \phi(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j f_j(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of type &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; in the population, &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the distribution of types in the population, &lt;math&gt;f_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the fitness of type &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (which is dependent on the population), and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the average population fitness (given by the weighted average of the fitness of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; types in the population). Since the elements of the population vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; sum to unity by definition, the equation is defined on the n-dimensional [[simplex]].

The replicator equation assumes a uniform population distribution; that is, it does not incorporate population structure into the fitness. The fitness landscape does incorporate the population distribution of types, in contrast to other similar equations, such as the quasispecies equation.

In application, populations are generally finite, making the discrete version more realistic. The analysis is more difficult and computationally intensive in the discrete formulation, so the continuous form is often used, although there are significant properties that are lost due to this smoothing. Note that the continuous form can be obtained from the discrete form by a [[limiting]] process.

To simplify analysis, fitness is often assumed to depend linearly upon the population distribution, which allows the replicator equation to be written in the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x_i}=x_i\left(\left(Ax\right)_i-x^TAx\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[payoff matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; holds all the fitness information for the population: the expected payoff can be written as &lt;math&gt;\left(Ax\right)_i&lt;/math&gt; and the mean fitness of the population as a whole can be written as &lt;math&gt;x^TAx&lt;/math&gt;.

== Analysis ==

{{Main|Evolutionarily stable state}}

The analysis differs in the continuous and discrete cases: in the former, methods from differential equations are utilized, whereas in the latter the methods tend to be stochastic. Since the replicator equation is non-linear, an exact solution is difficult to obtain (even in simple versions of the continuous form) so the equation is usually analyzed in terms of stability. The replicator equation (in its continuous and discrete forms) satisfies the [[Folk theorem (game theory) | folk theorem]] of evolutionary game theory which characterizes the stability of equilibria of the equation. The solution of the equation is often given by the set of [[evolutionarily stable state]]s of the population.

In general nondegenerate cases, there can be at most one interior evolutionary stable state (ESS), though there can be many equilibria on the boundary of the simplex. All the faces of the simplex are forward-invariant which corresponds to the lack of innovation in the replicator equation: once a strategy becomes extinct there is no way to revive it.

Phase portrait solutions for the continuous linear-fitness replicator equation have been classified in the two and three dimensional cases. Classification is more difficult in higher dimensions because the number of distinct portraits increases rapidly.

== Relationships to other equations ==

The continuous replicator equation on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; types is equivalent to the [[Generalized Lotka&amp;ndash;Volterra equation]] in &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. The transformation is made by the change of variables 
:&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{y_i}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}} \quad i=1, \ldots,n-1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}{y_j}},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the Lotka&amp;ndash;Volterra variable.

The continuous replicator dynamic is also equivalent to the [[Price equation]] (see Page &amp; Nowak's (2002) paper Unifying Evolutionary Dynamics).

== Generalizations ==

A generalization of the replicator equation which incorporates mutation is given by the replicator-mutator equation, which takes the following form in the continuous version:

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x_i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n}{x_j f_j(x) Q_{ji}} - \phi(x)x_i, &lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[transition probabilities]] for the mutation of type &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to type &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. This equation is a simultaneous generalization of the replicator equation and the [[quasispecies]] equation, and is used in the mathematical analysis of language.

The replicator equation can easily be generalized to [[asymmetric games]]. A recent generalization that incorporates population structure is used in [[evolutionary graph theory]].

'''''Rio''''' is a 2011 American [[3D film|3D]] [[Computer-animated film|computer-animated]] [[Adventure film|adventure]]-[[Comedy film|comedy]] film produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] and directed by [[Carlos Saldanha]]. The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt; where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[George Lopez]], and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a cockatoo. The theme song, "Telling the World," was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].

Saldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at Blue Sky. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.

''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011, in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], and had its general release on April 15, 2011 in [[North America]], by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received generally positive reviews from film critics. Observers praised the visuals, voice acting, and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song "Real in Rio", but lost to the other nominee, "[[Man or Muppet]]" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. --&gt;
In [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,&lt;ref name="TeleRhap" /&gt; Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly domesticated and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.

One day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. At Túlio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel. While Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on "pretty birds" after his role on a television program had been ruined by one. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain. He attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel hires a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the two birds to a Rio-style dance party, where they perform a duet and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]]. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover that the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who is a [[bulldog]], who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.

Pedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and Túlio have spotted the smuggler's parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and Túlio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]]. During the flight, Blu destroys his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and Túlio for help. Later, they adopt Fernando and organize a sanctuary to protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three children together, and fly above the jungle, joined by Linda, Luiz, and Túlio in a hang-glider. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.

==Production==
Saldanha first had the idea for the film in 1995, involving a penguin being washed up on the beaches of Ipanema; it was changed to the current story after he learned of ''[[Happy Feet]]'' and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (two other films involving penguins) being produced. He pitched the idea to Chris Wedge at Blue Sky in 2006.&lt;ref name="TeleRhap"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8398693/Rio-Brazilian-rhapsody.html |title=Rio: Brazilian rhapsody |first=Craig |last=McLean |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=March 28, 2011 |issn=0307-1235 |oclc=49632006 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saldanha showed the animators maps and books with geographic landmarks and measurements, from which they built a digital version of Rio. Later, a group of artists from the company visited Rio to see the various story locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/312336/rio-director-pays-homage-hometown-with-new-animated-movie |title='Rio' director pays homage to hometown with new animated movie |first=Annie |last=Alejo |work=Manila Bulletin |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animators also met with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to gain insight into their movement and personalities.&lt;ref name="WSJCarlos"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/04/14/director-carlos-saldanha-returns-home-with-rio/?mod=google_news_blog |title=Director Carlos Saldanha Returns Home with 'Rio' |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |first=Julie |last=Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saldanha himself is a Brazilian from Rio de Janeiro; such elements of Brazilian culture and landmarks were also influenced from Saldanha growing up in Brazil.&lt;ref name="WSJCarlos"/&gt;

The lead voice actors were approached in 2009.&lt;ref name="TeleRhap" /&gt; Jemaine Clement was approached to do the film after seeing test shots of his character Nigel doing a speech from ''[[Flight of the Conchords]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/arts-life/4857420/Another-feather-in-his-cap |title=Another feather in his cap |first=Tom |last=Cardy |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was done prior to a script being finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/film/interview-jemaine-clement |title=Interview: Jemaine Clement|work=ThisIsFakeDIY.co.uk |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Patrick Harris]] was supposed to voice Blu, but had other commitments outside production;&lt;ref name="CinemaBlend" /&gt; he was later replaced by [[Jesse Eisenberg]]. Eisenberg was asked during the filming of ''[[The Social Network]]'' if he would do his voice recording on the weekends, and he agreed after reading the script, saying: "It was the perfect antidote to get out of the mindset of my character in ''Social Network'' who was so severe, and in some ways so joyless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/04/15/jesse-eisenberg-goes-from-facebook-to-rio |title=Jesse Eisenberg Goes from Facebook to 'Rio' |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |first=Julie |last=Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For music, they brought on board [[Sérgio Mendes]] to act as music guru and online living library.&lt;ref name="WSJCarlos" /&gt; He in turn was able to reach out to artists such as will.i.am and [[Carlinhos Brown]] to provide music for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-10/ae/29404021_1_rio-fox-animation-division-ice-age |title='Ice Age' team goes to 'Rio' |first=Tom |last=Russo |work=Articles.Boston.com |date=April 11, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway, who voiced Jewel, had acted together before when both were still teenagers, when they played siblings in the short-lived 1999 TV show ''[[Get Real (U.S. TV series)|Get Real]]''. Hathaway stated in an interview that she didn't see Eisenberg during production of ''Rio'' except "socially throughout the process," but that she was "very happy for all of his success."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Rebecca |title=Inside 'Rio' with Anne Hathaway, Jamie Foxx, and George Lopez |url=http://movies.about.com/od/rio/a/rio-cast-interview.htm |work=About.com |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |date=January 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916205908/http://movies.about.com/od/rio/a/rio-cast-interview.htm |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its first weekend overseas (the weekend before its release in North America) it topped the box office with $54.9 million from 11,714 screens in 72 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3136&amp;p=.htm |title=Around-the-World Roundup: 'Rio' Livens Up Foreign Box Office |first=Ray |last=Subers |publisher=IMDb |work=Box Office Mojo |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its second weekend it earned $55.4 million, still on top of the overseas box office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3144&amp;p=.htm |title=Around-the-World Roundup: 'Rio' Continues to Soar Overseas |first=Ray |last=Subers |publisher=IMDb |work=Box Office Mojo |date=April 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on its third weekend it remained at the summit of the box office, grossing an estimated $44.3 million.

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''Rio'' received positive reviews from film critics. The [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 71% rating based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus is: "This straightforward movie hits great heights thanks to its colorful visual palette, catchy music, and perfect vocal performances."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes" /&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 63 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rio |title=Rio |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a mixed "C" rating. Gleiberman praised the animation in ''Rio'' and its music, and later went on to say that the film is "less a Pixar-level pleasure than a busy, frantic, and overstuffed dessert of a movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20481533,00.html |title=Rio |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave a positive review and praised the film for its comic action and the voices, as well as the visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/15/entertainment/la-et-rio-20110415 |title='Rio' review |last=Sharkey |first=Betsy |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State of War''' is a [[real-time strategy]] game, developed by [[Cypron Studios]] and [[Cinemax (video game developer)|Cinemax]] and published by [[Crystal Interactive]] in 2001.
See also [[State of War web game]] for the web based game released in 2008.

== Story ==

This description is told by narrator at the beginning of the game.

After centuries of continuous struggles, war and turmoil; humankind finally came together and founded the ''United Federation of Seven Continents (UFSC)''. It was decided that every member of the Federation would provide their armed forces to build a single military unit with the goal to protect the Earth and settle eventual conflicts. Thus it was no longer possible for any individual group to use military force to resolve their personal aim.

Within several years, the Federation created a Global Defense Network, known as "Overmind". Actually, it was a super intelligent mainframe computer - a unique work of hundreds of the most gifted scientists on the planet. It was operated by an intelligent software and consisted of 22 military bases worldwide located far from populated areas ready to act in case of the conflict. Since then, no machinery was ever controlled by man. Only the formal approval to activate "Overmind" had to be given by each UFSC representative.

Global society, however, carried its burdens. People suffering from spiritual emptiness sought refuge in organizations that offered salvation. The most influential among them was the ''Beho-Sunns''. Charismatic leaders of the cult used their personal charm and rhetorical skills to attract more and more people. Their audience included every social group from workers, scienties, lawyers to elite politicians. Behind it all, there was the wicked plan to get hold of "Overmind". None of the Beho-Sunns followers knew that during their meditation seasons the cult gathered all kinds of information from their minds. Over years, the Beho-Sunns discovered much about Overmind's mechanics and were able to hack the software which controls Overmind.

It so happened that the Beho-Sunns leaders tried to hack Overmind, but due to sophisticated [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] protection, they failed. Consequences were fatal. The Global Defense System went out of order and malfunctioned. Members of the Beho-Sunns quickly recovered from their defeat and started occupying defenseless military bases. Their actions must be halted! To do so, the UFSC have declared a [[war|state of war]].

'''''The Boy Who Cried Werewolf''''' is a 2010 [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] [[made-for-television film]] starring [[Victoria Justice]], [[Chase Ellison]], [[Matt Winston]], [[Brooke D'Orsay]], Steven Grayhm, and [[Brooke Shields]]. The screenplay was written by Art Edler Brown and Josh Nick. It was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, taking 2 years to complete.

==Plot==
Jordan Sands ([[Victoria Justice]]) is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother. Her father David ([[Matt Winston]]) is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter ([[Chase Ellison]]) drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, [[Romania]] after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Madame Varcolac ([[Brooke Shields]]).

Varcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg. One day while snooping around Dragomir's lab, Jordan steps on a vial of strange liquid. Hunter manages to pull the pieces out from her foot, but Jordan's behavior changes, such as her allergies disappearing, seeing without glasses, and smelling things very far away. Hunter's friends explain that Jordan's behaviors are akin to those of a werewolf's, and that she is one either because of a bloodline curse, a bite from an infected person, or from getting blood of a werewolf. In Jordan's case, it was revealed to have been LB-217, which is short for "Lycanthrope Blood".

Jordan continues to succumb to the changes, having behavioral changes. After her date with Goran, the young [[butcher]], Jordan turns into a werewolf, which Hunter witnesses. She flees and Hunter contacts his friends for help. They reveal that there is no cure they know of other than shooting a werewolf dead with silver. Hunter refuses to do this to his sister. His friends warn that if Jordan is not cured by the next sunrise, she will always be a werewolf, cursed to shift every night until the end of her life.

They find Varcolac, who reveals that Dragomir was also a werewolf and was the "Wolfsberg Beast"; protector of the castle and Wolfsberg itself. Vampires have attempted to take over the castle, but Dragomir stopped them before he was ultimately killed. Before his death, Dragomir was working on a possible cure to lycanthropy. However, it will take time to gather the ingredients. Paulina offers the siblings a ride home, but Jordan struggles in trying to resist her transformation. The car breaks down and the Vampires come out, along with Paulina, who is a Vampire. As it turns out, she killed Dragomir to get the manor and will now kill Jordan. Jordan and Hunter are locked in the trunk and brought to her hideout, where Jordan succumbs to the change and is restrained. Hunter leads David to the hideout as they witness Paulina attempting to kill Jordan.

Hunter suddenly turns into a werewolf himself; he is a part of the bloodline. The werewolves attack the Vampires before witnessing the rising sun. They use this to their advantage and kill them with the sunlight, with Jordan defeating Paulina in a final showdown. Jordan and Hunter return to the manor, where Hunter's blood is used in the antidote, which successfully cures Jordan. Varcolac is allowed to continue working there, and gives the Sands the money they inherited from Dragomir. Hunter also becomes the Wolfsberg Beast to take Dragomir's place.

The family returns to California where Jordan demonstrates a new confidence and power at school, and Goran transfers to be with her. David also finds a new love interest. In a twist, it turns out that Paulina was not killed by Jordan after all, and has moved to their neighborhood.

The movie ends as the cast sings [[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]] on karaoke.

Within the pandering to preteens salivating after Justice, there is also a solid however flawed and derivative story and some wicked special effects."&lt;ref&gt;Vasquez Jr., Felix.

'''''The Killer Inside Me''''' is a 1952 [[novel]] by American writer [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] published by [[Fawcett Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2009/novemberdecember/feature/soul-writer|work=[[Humanities (magazine)|Humanities]]|title=Soul of a Writer|author=David Geffner|date=November–December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to the anthology ''Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s'', it is described as "one of the most blistering and uncompromising crime novels ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=2|title=Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s|work=[[The Library of America]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s'', by Literary Classics of the United States, Inc. 1997. New York: The Library of America. {{ISBN|1-883011-49-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The story is told through the eyes of its protagonist, Lou Ford, a 29-year-old [[deputy sheriff]] in a small [[Texas]] town. Ford appears to be a regular, small-town cop leading an unremarkable existence; beneath this facade, however, he is a cunning, depraved [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]] with [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] sexual tastes. Ford's main outlet for his dark urges is the relatively benign habit of deliberately needling people with clichés and platitudes despite their obvious boredom: "If there's anything worse than a bore," says Lou, "it's a corny bore."

Despite having a steady girlfriend, Ford falls into a sadomasochistic relationship with a prostitute named Joyce Lakeland. Ford describes their affair as unlocking "the sickness" that has plagued him since adolescence, when he [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] a little girl, a crime for which his elder foster brother Mike took the blame to spare Lou from prison. After serving a jail term, Mike died at a construction site. Lou blamed a local construction magnate for Mike's death, suspecting he was murdered.

To exact revenge, Lou and Joyce blackmail the construction magnate to avoid exposing his son's affair with Joyce. However, Lou double-crosses Joyce: He ferociously batters her, and shoots the construction magnate's son, hoping to make the crimes appear to be a lovers' spat gone wrong. Despite the savage beating, it's revealed that Joyce survives, albeit in a coma.

Ford builds a solid alibi and frames other people for the double homicide. However, to successfully frame others when the evidence starts to go against him, he has to commit additional murders. These only increase suspicion against him however, and his mask of sanity begins to crumble under the pressure.

==Film adaptations==
In 1976, the novel was adapted into a [[The Killer Inside Me (1976 film)|film of the same title]], directed by [[Burt Kennedy]] and starring [[Stacy Keach]] as Lou Ford and [[Tisha Sterling]] as Amy Stanton. A [[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|2010 version]] written by [[John Curran (director)|John Curran]], directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]] and starring [[Casey Affleck]] and [[Jessica Alba]] premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2010, and was released in theaters later that year.&lt;ref name="IFC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/the-killer-inside-me|work=[[IFC Films]]|title=The Killer Inside Me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The novel is referenced in the [[Dead Milkmen]] song "Sri Lanka Sex Hotel", on their 1988 LP, ''[[Beelzebubba]]''.  The song "[[Welcome to My Dream|The Killer Inside Me]]" by experimental hip-hop artist [[MC 900 Ft. Jesus]] is based on the novel.

Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]], who worked with Thompson on the script for the 1956 movie ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'',  praised the novel, stating that it was "probably the most chilling and believable first-person story of a criminally warped mind I have ever encountered."&lt;ref name="IFC"/&gt;

The post-punk/alternative-country rock band [[Green on Red]] titled their 1987 album "[[The Killer Inside Me (album)|The Killer Inside Me]]" after the book.

[[Bruce Springsteen]] has stated that the idea for his 1995 song "My Best Was Never Good Enough" (on the album ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'') came from this book, specifically Ford's penchant for speaking in cliches.

In 2013, the Norwegian band [[The Launderettes]] released their album ''Getaway,'' which was inspired by the novel.  The band uses the album as a "means to end the story differently." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wickedcoolrecords.com/shop/bands/the-launderettes-getway-vinyl.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==See also==
Lou Ford later appears in Thompson's novel ''[[Wild Town]]'' (1957). The Lou Ford character in ''Wild Town'' is a mirror image of the one in ''Killer Inside Me''. In ''Wild Town'' Lou Ford is also a sheriff, he also plays the fool, and he is also smarter and more capable than anyone else in the small town although he keeps it well hidden. He also prefers, and is usually able, to manipulate events rather than directly intervene. However, whereas in ''Killer'' Lou Ford manipulates events to further his own greed and lust, in ''Wild Town'' he manipulates events to bring about justice, to help people, and even to play matchmaker.

The '''Press-Radio War''' in the [[United States]] lasted from 1933 to 1935. [[Newspaper]] publishers were concerned to maintain their own dominance of the news market in the face of the emerging [[radio]] networks. The Press induced the [[wire service]]s to stop providing [[news bulletin]]s to [[radio broadcaster]]s, which then developed their own news-gathering facilities. In response the press launched political, economic and legal campaigns to prevent news being broadcast on radio, culminating in [[The Biltmore Agreement]] by which major networks were compelled to heavily restrict radio news coverage. However, broadcasters soon developed ways to subvert the terms of this agreement, including the use of newly established [[news agency|news agencies]] such as the [[Transradio Press Service]].

==Background==
News was destined to become one of radio's strongest services in the early 1930s, but it still had its struggles. At first, radio announcers would just read newspaper headlines over the air, but gradually networks began purchasing news from [[wire services]]. In 1932 the [[Associated Press]] sold presidential election bulletins to the networks, and programs were interrupted with news flashes. Newspapers objected to this on the grounds that news on radio would diminish the sale of papers.

==The three stages of the Press-Radio War==

===Start of conflict===
Stage one began very slowly, and the newspapers were not at all hostile toward broadcasting. In fact, they were helpful in promoting radio in the early 1920s. Initially, the stations were not seen as channels of news delivery, but as promotional devices for the newspapers that owned them. The prospect of [[wire service]] provision of news to radio upset some print journalists, and that led to the [[Associated Press]] issuing a notice to its members that AP news bulletins were not to be used for purposes of broadcasting. One event that led to conflict between the journalists was the [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 Presidential Election]].

===Wire services===
Stage two, the entry of radio as a new medium was horrifying to the established news distribution source. Prior to radio news moved through wire services, through the newspapers to the people. The press started to fear that if radio started to provide news, then news could bypass the newspapers, thus shifting the flow of news throughout society. This started a fight for self-preservation on the part of newspapers, which could only be won if all journalists stood together. In April 1933 all three wire services agreed to stop providing radio with news bulletins. The anti-radio forces had finally gotten their wish. Broadcasters were now forced to find new ways of obtaining bulletins for their newscasts, and by the fall of 1933 [[CBS]] established a full news division, [[NBC]] followed on a smaller scale and the networks were more independent from print journalists for their news bulletins.

===The Biltmore Agreement and its failure===
Stage three, print journalists had to find ways to prevent and limit the development of broadcasting. The "attack" on broadcasting took three forms, political lobbying, economic boycott, and legal action. At first it worked, only a few months after networks began broadcasting their own news, they appealed to the press to meet and negotiate a "peace agreement".

A meeting of newspaper publishers, network executives, and wire service representatives, held at the [[Biltmore Hotel]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, it established [[The Biltmore Agreement]]. The meeting was called by CBS President [[William S. Paley]] with the purpose to end the long standing dispute as to news broadcasting. It stipulated that networks could air two five-minute newscasts a day, one in the morning after 9:30 A.M. and one in the evening after 9:00 p.m. so they would not compete with the primary hours of newspaper sales. No "hot off the wire" news was to be broadcast, and newscasts were not to have advertising support because this might detract from newspaper advertising. Newspaper publishers ensured that these provisions appeared in [[The Biltmore Agreement]] because they were the more powerful and wealthiest of the meeting participants.

The deal had barely been a few hours old when its intent began to be subverted. The newspaper publishers agreed to allow radio stations and networks to have commentators. Radio took advantage of this provision, and often these commentators became thinly disguised news reporters. NBC and CBS began their own news gathering activities. At NBC, one person gathered news simply by making telephone calls. Sometimes he scooped newspaper reporters because almost anyone would answer a call at NBC. In addition, he could reward news sources with highly prized tickets to NBC's top shows.

Independent broadcasters did not sign the agreement, leaving a big problem for the press, because only 150 of the 600 radio stations were network owned. Before long, news gathering agencies emerged to fill the vacancy of news sources. The most successful of these agencies was the [[Transradio Press Service]], which had over 150 subscribers after only 9 months of operation. There was nothing the press could do and no legal justification for taking action against the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Jackaway, Gwenyth.

Web. 11 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Broadcast journalism did not develop until the mid 1930s. Relationships between the older print media and the newer medium of radio were not friendly, and the journalists of the time needed considerable diplomatic skills in dealing with the wire services and their own employers. By the beginning of the next decade the effectiveness and reliability of broadcast journalism was confirmed by the coverage of [[World War II]].

"'''These Are the Voyages...'''" is the [[series finale]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''. The 22nd episode of the [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 4)|fourth season]] and the 98th of the series overall, it first aired on the [[UPN]] network in the United States on May 13, 2005. "These Are the Voyages..." is a [[frame story]], where the 22nd-century events of ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' are shown through a 24th-century [[holodeck]] re-creation during the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Pegasus (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Pegasus]]". The episode features guest stars [[Jonathan Frakes]], [[Marina Sirtis]], and [[Jeffrey Combs]], as well as a voice cameo from [[Brent Spiner]]. Series creators [[Rick Berman]] and [[Brannon Braga]], who co-wrote the episode, conceived "These Are the Voyages..." as a valentine to [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' fans]].

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first [[Starfleet]] starship ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', registration NX-01. In this episode, the story moves to the year 2370, when Commander [[William Riker]] grapples with making a difficult admission to his commanding officer about a cover-up. Riker, after consulting Counselor [[Deanna Troi|Troi]], turns to the simulated events of the year 2161 for guidance, when the crew of ''Enterprise'' travels home to Earth for both decommissioning and the formation of the [[United Federation of Planets]].

Reaction to "These Are the Voyages..." was negative. Critics and cast alike believed the ''Next Generation'' frame robbed the characters and their fans of closure, and that the death of Commander [[Charles Tucker III|Tucker]] felt forced and unnecessary. The final episode attracted 3.8 million viewers, the highest number since the previous season. After a strong premiere, ''Enterprise'' had grappled with declining ratings throughout its run. By the fourth season, fewer than three million viewers tuned in each week despite what some fans and critics considered an increase in episode quality. After selling the syndication rights, UPN and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] announced in February 2005 that the fourth season would be the show's last. With no new ''Star Trek'' episodes in the fall of 2005, the 2005–2006 season was the first year without a first-run ''Star Trek'' in 18 years. Despite the cancellation, Paramount hoped to revive the series, and Berman began work on a possible new ''Star Trek'' film, which was ultimately rejected in favor of the [[J. J. Abrams]]-directed ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]''.

==Plot==
In 2370, Commander [[William Riker]], aboard [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|''Enterprise''-D]], is troubled by the events of "[[The Pegasus (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Pegasus]]" and seeks guidance. At Lieutenant Commander [[Deanna Troi]]'s suggestion, Riker sets a [[holodeck|holo-program]] to the date 2161, some six years after the events of "[[Terra Prime]]", to a time when the original [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'' (NX-01)]] is due to be decommissioned after ten years of active service. The starship and its crew are also returning to Earth for the signing of the [[United Federation of Planets#Depiction|Federation Charter]], and Captain [[Jonathan Archer|Archer]] frets over the speech he will give to the assembled delegates.

En route, Riker and Troi observe as ''Enterprise'' is contacted by [[Thy'lek Shran|Shran]], a former [[Andorian#History|Andorian Imperial Guard]] who Archer believed was dead. Apparently his young daughter has been kidnapped, and he asks for Archer's help in rescuing her from [[Rigel in fiction#Star Trek|Rigel X]]. Archer decides to assist, despite Commander [[T'Pol]]'s warning that they may be late returning for the ceremony. Riker joins the ''Enterprise'' crew as it assaults Shran's enemies and brings his daughter safely back. Troi also advises that Riker assume the role of ship's chef, hoping to earn the confidence of the simulated crew. As he prepares food with the crew, he learns more about their memories and impressions of [[Trip Tucker|Tucker]].

He also watches as the kidnappers board ''Enterprise'', and how, in order to save Archer's life, Commander Tucker overloads two conduits and dies after becoming mortally wounded. He notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now sure of what course he should take.&lt;ref name="tv-guide"&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.tv.com/star-trek-enterprise/these-are-the-voyages-…/episode/400668/recap.html?tag=episode_tabs;recap |title="These Are the Voyages..."

"These Are the Voyages..." was written by Braga and Berman, the pair's only script of the fourth season. ''Enterprise'' writer [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]] told [[TrekNation]] in May 2005 that Braga had considered the idea of an episode crossover featuring characters from other ''Star Trek'' series prior to the finale. Sussman's original idea for the episode was to have [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Doctor]] of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' treating an ill patient who may or may not have been Archer trapped in the future. Due to the subject matter, Sussman said his version would not have been suitable for the final episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Huntley, Kristine |date=May 12, 2005|url=http://www.treknation.com/interviews/mike_sussman.shtml|title=Interview: Mike Sussman|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|accessdate=January 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180937/http://www.trektoday.com/interviews/mike_sussman.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Berman said that the episode had always been intended as the season finale regardless of cancellation, and gave conflicting answers regarding whether Trip would still have been killed if the show was to continue.&lt;ref name="tvguide-parting shots"&gt;{{cite web|author=Logan, Michael|date=May 23, 2005|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/trek-enterprise-finale/050523-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210083618/http://www.tvguide.com/news/trek-enterprise-finale/050523-05|archivedate=February 10, 2008|title=Trek Star Fires off Parting Shots|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=Jul 25, 2005|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/250705_01.shtml|title=Berman Bothered by 'These Are the Voyages' Criticism|publisher=TrekToday|accessdate=January 18, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715144829/http://www.trektoday.com/news/250705_01.shtml|archivedate=July 15, 2014|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Kroeker]] directed the episode, his third series finale following ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''{{'}}s "[[What You Leave Behind]]" and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''{{'}}s "[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]".&lt;ref name="st-production diary"/&gt; "These Are the Voyages..." featured guest appearances by [[Jonathan Frakes]] and [[Marina Sirtis]] as their ''Next Generation'' characters [[William Riker]] and [[Deanna Troi]]. [[Brent Spiner]], another ''Next Generation'' veteran who had guest-starred earlier in the fourth season of ''Enterprise'', had an off-screen speaking role as the android [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]].&lt;ref name="st-production diary"/&gt; [[Jeffrey Combs]] appeared as the [[Andorian]] [[Thy'lek Shran|Shran]], whom Coto had wanted to be a permanent addition to the cast in the event of another season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date=December 2005 |title=Interview with Mike Sussman|journal=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|volume=1|issue=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming of the final episode began on Friday, February 25, after the first half of the day was spent completing "Terra Prime". Principal photography took eight days to complete, one day longer than usual. The snowy complex set of [[Rigel in fiction#Star Trek|Rigel X]], first seen in the pilot episode, was used, as was the rarely seen ''Enterprise''{{'}}s galley. ''Enterprise''-D locations such as hallways and the observation lounge were re-created. Frakes and Sirtis arrived at the lot at the same time that a "Save Enterprise" rally was being held outside the gates. Similar to "What You Leave Behind", many of the production staff cameoed for a large crowd scene at the end of the episode, as Archer prepares to give his speech. Fifteen "VIPs" including writers [[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]], [[André Bormanis]], and Manny Coto joined two dozen extras in forming part of the audience. The rest of the digital set was filled by a computer-generated crowd. After their parts were finished, the final dismissal of each cast member was met with applause. [[Jolene Blalock]] and [[Scott Bakula]] were the last actors to be released, and Bakula gave a speech thanking the production crew for making the cast feel welcome. Filming ended on Tuesday, March 8, and the sets were struck. Frakes and Sirtis returned on March 9 to complete green screen shots, which would be used when their characters entered or exited the holodeck.&lt;ref name="st-production diary"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stone, Sandy|date=March 10, 2005|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/9996.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321004638/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/9996.html|archivedate=March 21, 2005|title=Production Report: Final Enterprise Episode Wraps|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the episode's release, Berman would not elaborate on the final episode's content, saying "It's going to have some surprising twists and turns.

==Reception and home media release==
[[File:Jolene blalock-comiccon 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jolene Blalock]], who played T'Pol, was highly critical of the series finale.]]
"These Are the Voyages..." was negatively received by both critics and the show's cast. Before the episode aired, Blalock called the episode "appalling."&lt;ref name="scifi-review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lee, Patrick|date=May 14, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101153926/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|archivedate=January 1, 2007|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1662.html|title=Star Trek: Enterprise Series Finale|publisher=[[Syfy#Science Fiction Weekly|Sci Fi Weekly]]|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed up her remarks by saying she was upset over the finale being a ''The Next Generation'' episode rather than an end for ''Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|archivedate=March 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318130122/http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256 |title=Jolene Blalock interview|work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=November 8, 2008}}&lt;!-- http://www.trektoday.com/news/090505_02.shtml--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Connor Trinneer]] (who played Commander [[Trip Tucker]]), felt that the finale should have had a memorable farewell that he described as a "''[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen|M*A*S*H]]'' moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element.&lt;ref name="tvguide-parting shots"/&gt; [[Anthony Montgomery]] (who played Ensign [[Travis Mayweather]]) was similarly displeased with the finale and said, "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the ''Enterprise'' cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leao, Gustavo |date=December 17, 2005 |url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=43a43f1175dcc&amp;topBrowse=all |title=Anthony Montgomery Says "These Are the Voyages..."

Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just ''Enterprise'' but ''Star Trek'' as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sparborth, Christian|date=April 16, 2005|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/160405_02.shtml|title=Braga &amp; Paramount On 'These Are the Voyages...'|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|accessdate=January 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002073543/http://www.trektoday.com/news/160405_02.shtml|archivedate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers were also critical of the ''Next Generation'' tie-in. [[Syfy#Science Fiction Weekly|Sci Fi Weekly]]'s Patrick Lee said the framing story "reduces [the ''Enterprise'' cast] to the status of lab rats." Lee further noted that even without the guest appearances, the episode did not live up to the best offerings of the season, including "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]".&lt;ref name="scifi-review"/&gt; ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s Alex Strachan called the ''Next Generation'' cameos reminders of better ''Star Trek'', compared to the "bad make-up effects, bad acting, bad music" of the latest show.&lt;ref name="nationalpost-review"/&gt; Rob Salem of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' said the cameos served no narrative purpose, and that the episode "robs [the] characters (and their fans) of any significant long-term development or satisfying sense of closure."&lt;ref name="torontostar-review"/&gt; Reviewers also criticized the episode's ending, where viewers never got to see Archer's rousing speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Slotek, Jim|date=May 13, 2005|title=Star Trek: E lamely goes away|work=[[Toronto Sun]] |page=E4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign-rev"/&gt; [[IGN]] said that the episode was "Berman and Braga's parting shot, making sure that everyone knew who was in charge," and that the sharp contrast between "These Are the Voyages..." and "Terra Prime" brought into relief the reason why both should not be allowed to produce ''Star Trek'' ever again.&lt;ref name="ign-rev"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 12, 2005|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/613/613150p1.html|title=Trek Report: Video Report – That's a Wrap, Gang|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Tucker was another object of controversy. Salem described the development as "a major character is pointlessly killed off in service of a pointless plot device,"&lt;ref name="torontostar-review"&gt;{{cite news|author=Salem, Rob|date=May 9, 2005|title=Trek fatigued, producer admits.

The writers, Trinneer contended, wanted to kill off a character to "get the fans talking," and so Trip was killed off simply to manipulate viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Green, Michelle|date=October 24, 2005|url=http://www.treknation.com/articles/trinneer_trektrak2005.shtml|title=Trinneer Regales TrekTrak with Tales of Tucker|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|accessdate=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics ended their reviews by saying that whether fans would be disappointed or pleased by the episode, the majority of casual viewers would not care one way or another.&lt;ref name="nationalpost-review"&gt;{{cite news|author=Strachan, Alex|date=May 13, 2005|title=They've gone here before: Final Star Trek episode falls back on tired old cliches|work=[[National Post]]|page=PM9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Strachan, Alex|date=May 13, 2005|title=Only Trekkers will enjoy this: Star Trek finale's odd plot is jarring|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|page=D10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ryan, Andrew|date=May 13, 2005|title=The season of the fizzle|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=R28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to some of these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story "[[Demons (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Demons]]" and "[[Terra Prime]]" that preceded "These Are the Voyages..." the actual finale of the ''Enterprise'' storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sparborth, Christian|date=May 10, 2005|url=http://www.trektoday.com/news/100505_01.shtml|title=Manny Coto Praises 'These Are the Voyages...'|publisher=[[TrekNation]]|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman said "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [Braga] and I spent a lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a ''Next Generation'' episode than an ''Enterprise'' episode. The only elements of [''The Next Generation''] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after "[[Terra Prime]]"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| date=August 2005 |url=http://www.visimag.com/culttimes/c119_display.htm|title=Star Trek: Enterprise |journal=Cult Times|volume=1|issue=119|accessdate=January 20, 2009|laysummary=http://www.trektoday.com/news/250705_01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series-ending wrap party was held for the cast and crew at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in April. Cast members spoke about their feelings about the end of the series. [[John Billingsley]] said the show "was a great ride, and it changed my life. It's something that will last forever for me." He was happy to say goodbye to the two-hour makeup sessions to create his character, [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Phlox]]. Many of the cast were taking a break and going on vacation before seeking new acting jobs. Among the notable guests were ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' screenwriter [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], who was not affiliated with ''Enterprise'', and [[Peter Weller]], who appeared as a villain in "Terra Prime".&lt;ref name="cast party"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 14, 2005|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/10559.html|title=Enterprise Wrap Party Brings Closure|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Jolene Blalock]] (T'Pol) criticized the early stories as boring and lacking intriguing content. She felt that early ''Enterprise'' scripts ignored basic tenets of ''Star Trek'' chronology, and offered "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives stated that the male-oriented episodes of ''Enterprise'' did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as ''Top Model'' and ''[[Veronica Mars]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt-dry dock"/&gt; [[Brannon Braga]] suggested that the reason for the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that "after 18 years and 624 hours of ''Star Trek'', the audience began to have a little bit of overkill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=May 14, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4535919.stm|title=Final Star Trek spin-off beams up|work=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=January 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring ''Star Trek'' canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for [[Airlock Alpha|SyFy Portal]], stated that in addition to the oversaturation of ''Star Trek'', there "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.'

[[File:Sir-Thomas-Beecham-US-1948.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Beecham rehearsing in 1948]]
'''Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet''', [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]]&lt;/small&gt; (29 April 1879{{spaced ndash}}8 March 1961) was an English conductor and [[impresario]] best known for his association with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]] orchestras. He was also closely associated with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic]] and [[The Hallé|Hallé]] orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and, according to the [[BBC]], was Britain's first international conductor.

Born to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]] with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' and ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' and three operas by [[Frederick Delius]].

Together with his younger colleague [[Malcolm Sargent]], Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the [[Queen's Hall]] in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] and conducted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.

Beecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] and the composer he revered above all others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:BeechamsBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|alt=exterior of nineteenth century industrial building|The Beecham factory in St Helens]]
Beecham was born in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Lancashire]], in a house adjoining the [[Beecham's Pills]] laxative factory founded by his grandfather, [[Thomas Beecham (chemist)|Thomas Beecham]].&lt;ref name=reid19&gt;Reid, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  His parents were [[Sir Joseph Beecham, 1st Baronet|Joseph Beecham]], the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, ''née'' Burnett.&lt;ref name=reid19/&gt; He was an uncle of poet [[Audrey Beecham]]. In 1885, with the family firm flourishing financially, Joseph Beecham moved his family to a large house in Ewanville, [[Huyton]], near [[Liverpool]]. Their former home was demolished to make room for an extension to the pill factory.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham was educated at [[Rossall School]] between 1892 and 1897, after which he hoped to attend a music conservatoire in Germany, but his father forbade it, and instead Beecham went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], to read [[Classics]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;  He did not find university life to his taste and successfully sought his father's permission to leave Oxford in 1898.&lt;ref name=reid27&gt;Reid, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He studied as a pianist, but had difficulty because of his small hands, and any career as a soloist was ruled out by a wrist injury in 1904.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Jefferson, Alan. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30670 "Beecham, Sir  Thomas, second baronet  (1879–1961)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press,  2004, accessed 24 May 2016  {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He studied composition privately with [[Frederic Austin]] in Liverpool, [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] in London, and [[Moritz Moszkowski]] in Paris.{{refn|Beecham had first approached [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], but Stanford did not take private pupils.&lt;ref name=lucas18&gt;Lucas, pp. 12 and 18&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Messager]] recommended Beecham to study with Moszkowski.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} As a conductor, he was self-taught.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Crichton, Ronald, and John Lucas. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/02507 "Beecham, Sir Thomas",] ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, retrieved 13 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First orchestras===
Beecham first conducted in public in St Helens in October 1899, with an ''ad&amp;nbsp;hoc'' ensemble comprising local musicians and players from the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic|Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]] and [[the Hallé]] in Manchester.&lt;ref name=reid27/&gt;  A month later, he stood in at short notice for the celebrated conductor [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]] at a concert by the Hallé to mark Joseph Beecham's inauguration as mayor of St Helens.&lt;ref name=reid27/&gt; Soon afterwards, Joseph Beecham secretly committed his wife to a mental hospital.{{refn|Lucas concludes that Josephine Beecham was suffering from [[post-natal depression]]. As Joseph Beecham was found to be keeping a mistress, his wife was able to obtain a judicial separation, which removed Joseph's right to block her release from the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Thomas and his elder sister Emily helped to secure their mother's release and to force their father to pay annual alimony of £4,500.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 31–34&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Joseph disinherited them. Beecham was estranged from his father for ten years.&lt;ref name=reid62/&gt;

Beecham's professional début as a conductor was in 1902 at the Shakespeare Theatre, [[Clapham]], with [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'', for the Imperial Grand Opera Company.&lt;ref name=lucas20&gt;Lucas, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He was engaged as assistant conductor for a tour and was allotted four other operas, including ''[[Carmen]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]''.&lt;ref name=lucas20/&gt;  A Beecham biographer calls the company "grandly named but decidedly ramshackle",&lt;ref name=lucas20/&gt; though Beecham's Carmen was [[Zélie de Lussan]], a leading exponent of the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham was also composing music in these early years, but he was not satisfied with his own efforts and instead concentrated on conducting.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Beecham told an interviewer in 1910 that he spent a year composing, and produced three operas&amp;nbsp;– two in English and one in Italian&amp;nbsp;– and "once spent three weeks in trying to compose the first movement of a sonata", which led him to conclude that composition was not his forte.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Thomas Beecham", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', October 1910, p. 630&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[Image:Beecham-October-1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Youngish man, with neat imperial beard and moustache, seated, supporting head with left hand|Beecham, c. 1910]]
[[File:Beecham-byEmu-1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=caricature of neatly bearded man in formal dress|Caricature of Beecham by "Emu", 1910]]
In 1906 Beecham was invited to conduct the New Symphony Orchestra, a recently formed ensemble of 46 players, in a series of concerts at the [[Wigmore Hall|Bechstein Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his career, Beecham frequently chose to programme works to suit his own tastes rather than those of the paying public. In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as [[Étienne Méhul]], [[Nicolas Dalayrac]] and [[Ferdinando Paer]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of [[Frederick Delius]], which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the [[Queen's Hall]] Orchestra and the recently founded [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as "even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day".&lt;ref name=reid55&gt;Reid, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were [[Vincent d'Indy|d'Indy]]'s symphonic ballad ''La forêt enchantée'', [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]]'s symphonic poem ''Šárka'', and [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]]'s little-known [[Symphony in G minor (Lalo)|Symphony in G minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.&lt;ref name=salter&gt;Salter, p. 4; and Procter-Gregg, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The treasurer of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] described it thus: "''A'', whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends ''B'' (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. ''B'', without your knowledge or consent, sends ''C'' to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, ''C'' sends ''D'', whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The lines are put into Beecham's mouth in the 1980 play ''Beecham'' by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]].|group= n}} [[Henry Wood]] had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit.&lt;ref name=reid70&gt;Reid, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the [[Royal Albert Hall]] Orchestra.&lt;ref name=reid70/&gt;

In 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=reid71&gt;Reid, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the [[palm court]]s of hotels, and music colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was a youthful team&amp;nbsp;– the typical age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as [[Albert Sammons]], [[Lionel Tertis]], [[Eric Coates]] and [[Eugene Cruft]].&lt;ref name=reid71/&gt;

Because he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts,&lt;ref name=reid62&gt;Reid, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910–1920===
From 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and other houses. In the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary.&lt;ref name=reid98&gt;Reid, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.&lt;ref name=reid98/&gt;

[[File:Beecham-Strauss-Pitt-Walter.jpg|thumb|left|alt=face shots of four middle aged men, one bearded, one moustached, two clean shaven|Clockwise from top left: Beecham, [[Richard Strauss]], [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Percy Pitt]], all in 1910]]
In 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as [[impresario]] for 190&amp;nbsp;performances at Covent Garden and [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]]. His assistant conductors were [[Bruno Walter]] and [[Percy Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  During the year, he mounted 34 different operas, most of them either new to London or almost unknown there.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham later acknowledged that in his early years the operas he chose to present were too obscure to attract the public.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  During his 1910 season at His Majesty's, the rival Grand Opera Syndicate put on a concurrent season of its own at Covent Garden;  London's total opera performances for the year amounted to 273 performances, far more than the box-office demand could support.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 34 operas that Beecham staged in 1910, only four made money: [[Richard Strauss]]'s new operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]],'' receiving their first, and highly publicised, performances in Britain, and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' and ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Of the other operas of Beecham's 1910 seasons, lesser-known pieces, such as ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'' (Delius), ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]], [[The Wreckers (opera)|The Wreckers]]'' ([[Ethel Smyth]]), ''[[L'enfant prodigue]]'' and ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' ([[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]), ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' ([[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]]), ''Shamus O'Brien'' ([[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]]), ''Muguette'' (Edmond de Misa),'' [[Werther]]'' ([[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]), ''[[Feuersnot]]'' (Richard Strauss) and ''A Summer Night'' ([[George Clutsam]]) outnumbered the more popular pieces, such as Wagner's ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' and ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', Bizet's ''Carmen,'' Verdi's ''[[Rigoletto]]'' and five [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] works: ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[Der Schauspieldirektor]]'', ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 111–119&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

In 1911 and 1912, the Beecham Symphony Orchestra played for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]], both at Covent Garden and at the [[Kroll Opera House|Krolloper]] in Berlin, under the batons of Beecham and [[Pierre Monteux]], Diaghilev's chief conductor. Beecham was much admired for conducting the complicated new score of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka]]'', at two days' notice and without rehearsal, when Monteux became unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;Canarina, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Berlin, Beecham and his orchestra, in Beecham's words, caused a "mild stir", scoring a triumph: the orchestra was agreed by the Berlin press to be an elite body, one of the best in the world.&lt;ref name=reid123&gt;Reid, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;  The principal Berlin musical weekly, ''Die Signale'', asked, "Where does London find such magnificent young instrumentalists?"  The violins were credited with rich, noble tone, the [[woodwind]]s with lustre, the brass, "which has not quite the dignity and amplitude of our best German brass", with uncommon delicacy of execution.&lt;ref name=reid123/&gt;

[[File:Karsavina-Salome.jpg|thumb|right|alt=full length portrait of ballerina in exotic costume|[[Tamara Karsavina]] as Salome in the Beecham Russian ballet season, 1913]]
Beecham's 1913 seasons included the British premiere of Strauss's ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' at Covent Garden, and a "Grand Season of Russian Opera and Ballet" at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  At the latter there were three operas, all starring [[Feodor Chaliapin]], and all new to Britain: [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' and ''[[Khovanshchina]]'', and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s [[The Maid of Pskov|''Ivan the Terrible'']]. There were also 15 ballets, with leading dancers including [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Tamara Karsavina]].&lt;ref name=reid142&gt;Reid, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  The ballets included [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Jeux]]'' and his controversially erotic ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'après-midi d'un faune]],'' and the British premiere of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]],'' six weeks after its first performance in Paris.&lt;ref name=reid142/&gt; Beecham shared Monteux's private dislike of the piece, much preferring ''Petrushka''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham did not conduct during this season; Monteux and others conducted the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The following year, Beecham and his father presented Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[The Maid of Pskov]]'' and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]'', with Chaliapin, and Stravinsky's ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]].''&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

During the First World War, Beecham strove, often without a fee, to keep music alive in London, Liverpool, Manchester and other British cities.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;  He conducted for, and gave financial support to, three institutions with which he was connected at various times: the Hallé Orchestra, the LSO and the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1915 he formed the [[Beecham opera company|Beecham Opera Company]], with mainly British singers, performing in London and throughout the country. In 1916, he received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in the [[1916 New Year Honours|New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Honours List", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 January 1916, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded to the [[baronet]]cy on his father's death later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, there were joint Covent Garden seasons with the Grand Opera Syndicate in 1919 and 1920, but these were, according to a biographer, pale confused echoes of the years before 1914.&lt;ref name=reid181&gt;Reid, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;  These seasons included forty productions, of which Beecham conducted only nine.&lt;ref name=reid181/&gt;  After the 1920 season, Beecham temporarily withdrew from conducting to deal with a financial problem that he described as "the most trying and unpleasant experience of my life".&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covent Garden estate===
[[File:Covent-garden-panorama-1913.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=roofscape of inner London in 1913|1913 panorama of the Covent Garden estate]]
Influenced by an ambitious financier, [[James White (financier)|James White]], Sir Joseph Beecham had agreed, in July 1914, to buy the Covent Garden estate from the [[Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and float a [[limited company]] to manage the estate commercially.&lt;ref name=beecham142&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "one of the largest ever carried out in real estate in London".&lt;ref&gt;"Covent Garden Estate: Sale of the Property to Sir Joseph Beecham", ''The Times'', 7 July 1914, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Joseph paid an initial deposit of £200,000 and covenanted to pay the balance of the £2 million purchase price on 11 November. Within a month, however, the First World War broke out, and new official restrictions on the use of capital prevented the completion of the contract.&lt;ref name=beecham142/&gt;  The estate and market continued to be managed by the Duke's staff, and in October 1916, Joseph Beecham died suddenly, with the transaction still uncompleted.&lt;ref name=sol&gt;Sheppard, F. H. W. (ed). [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46089 "The Bedford Estate: The Sale of the Estate",] ''Survey of London, Volume 36: Covent Garden'' (1970), pp. 48–52, retrieved 14 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The matter was brought before the civil courts with the aim of disentangling Sir Joseph's affairs; the court and all parties agreed that a private company should be formed, with his two sons as directors, to complete the Covent Garden contract. In July 1918, the Duke and his trustees conveyed the estate to the new company, subject to a mortgage of the balance of the purchase price still outstanding: £1.25 million.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

Beecham and his brother Henry had to sell enough of their father's estate to discharge this mortgage. For more than three years, Beecham was absent from the musical scene, working to sell property worth over £1 million.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;  By 1923 enough money had been raised. The mortgage was discharged, and Beecham's personal liabilities, amounting to £41,558, were paid in full.&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Thomas Beecham to Pay in Full: The Receiving Order Discharged", ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 29 March 1923, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the Covent Garden property and the pill-making business at St Helens were united in one company, Beecham Estates and Pills. The nominal capital was £1,850,000, of which Beecham had a substantial share.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

===London Philharmonic===
After his absence, Beecham first reappeared on the rostrum conducting the Hallé in Manchester in March 1923, in a programme including works by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], Delius and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Langford|Langford, Samuel]]. "The Hallé Concerts: Sir Thomas Beecham's Return", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 March 1923, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to London the following month, conducting the combined Royal Albert Hall Orchestra (the renamed New Symphony Orchestra) and London Symphony Orchestra in April 1923. The main work on the programme was Richard Strauss's ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Albert Hall Concert: Sir Thomas Beecham's Return", ''The Times'', 9 April 1923, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  No longer with an orchestra of his own, Beecham established a relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra that lasted for the rest of the 1920s. Towards the end of the decade, he negotiated inconclusively with the BBC over the possibility of establishing a permanent radio orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1971), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor [[Malcolm Sargent]] with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the London Symphony Orchestra, but the LSO, a self-governing co-operative, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The principals included [[Paul Beard (violinist)|Paul Beard]], George Stratton, [[Anthony Pini]], [[Gerald Jackson]], [[Léon Goossens]], [[Reginald Kell]], James Bradshaw and Marie Goossens.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opening-concert-Queen's-Hall.jpg|thumb|left|alt=interior of nineteenth century concert hall, with audience in place|250px|The [[Queen's Hall]], the London Philharmonic's first home]]
The orchestra made its debut at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. After the first item, Berlioz's ''[[Overtures by Hector Berlioz#Le carnaval romain|Roman Carnival Overture]]'', the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society alone, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records.&lt;ref name=jefferson89&gt;Jefferson, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berta Geissmar]], his secretary from 1936, wrote, "The relations between the Orchestra and Sir Thomas were always easy and cordial. He always treated a rehearsal as a joint undertaking with the Orchestra.{{space}}… The musicians were entirely unselfconscious with him. Instinctively they accorded him the artistic authority which he did not expressly claim. Thus he obtained the best from them and they gave it without reserve."&lt;ref&gt;Geissmar, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1930s, Beecham had secured substantial control of the Covent Garden opera seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;  Wishing to concentrate on music-making rather than management, he assumed the role of artistic director, and [[Geoffrey Toye]] was recruited as managing director. In 1933, ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' with [[Frida Leider]] and [[Lauritz Melchior]] was a success, and the season continued with the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle and nine other operas.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1934 season featured [[Conchita Supervía]] in ''[[La Cenerentola]],'' and [[Lotte Lehmann]] and [[Alexander Kipnis]] in the ''Ring''.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clemens Krauss]] conducted the British première of Strauss's ''[[Arabella]]''. During 1933 and 1934, Beecham repelled attempts by [[John Christie (opera manager)|John Christie]] to form a link between Christie's new [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Festival]] and the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham and Toye fell out over the latter's insistence on bringing in a popular film star, [[Grace Moore]], to sing Mimi in ''[[La bohème]]''. The production was a box-office success, but an artistic failure.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham manoeuvred Toye out of the managing directorship in what their fellow conductor [[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] described as an "absolutely beastly" manner.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1989), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1935 to 1939, Beecham, now in sole control, presented international seasons with eminent guest singers and conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 178–190&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham conducted between a third and half of the performances each season. He intended the 1940 season to include the first complete performances of Berlioz's ''[[Les Troyens]]'', but the outbreak of the Second World War caused the season to be abandoned. Beecham did not conduct again at Covent Garden until 1951, and by then it was no longer under his control.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 178–190 and 197&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham took the London Philharmonic on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  There were complaints that he was being used by [[Nazi]] propagandists, and Beecham complied with a Nazi request not to play the ''Scottish'' Symphony of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], who was a Christian by faith but a Jew by birth.{{refn|According to the biographer John Lucas, Beecham had intended to insist on including the Mendelssohn symphony, but was dissuaded by his assistant, Berta Geissmar, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Geissmar herself says that she simply passed on a message from the German foreign minister, and the decision was Beecham's.&lt;ref&gt;Geissmar p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the tour, the orchestra flouted the custom of playing the Nazi anthem before concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In Berlin, Beecham's concert was attended by [[Adolf Hitler]], whose lack of punctuality caused Beecham to remark very audibly, "The old bugger's late."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;  After this tour, Beecham refused renewed invitations to give concerts in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 217–218&lt;/ref&gt; although he honoured contractual commitments to conduct at the [[Berlin State Opera]], in 1937 and 1938, and recorded ''The Magic Flute'' for [[EMI Records|EMI]] in the Beethovensaal in Berlin in the same years.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 214–215&lt;/ref&gt;

As his sixtieth birthday approached, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate.&lt;ref name=Lucas239&gt;Lucas, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]] had been seeking for several years to get him to conduct in Australia.&lt;ref name=Lucas239/&gt; The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared.&lt;ref name=reid218&gt;Reid, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===1940s===
[[File:Metropolitan Opera House, a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann - NARA 541890 - Edit.jpg|thumb|right|alt=interior of huge 19th century opera house looking from the stage towards the audience seats|The old [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]], New York, where Beecham conducted from 1942 to 1944]]
Beecham left Britain in the spring of 1940, going first to Australia and then to North America. He became music director of the [[Seattle Symphony]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he joined the [[Metropolitan Opera]] as joint senior conductor with his former assistant Bruno Walter. He began with his own adaptation of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] comic cantata, ''Phoebus and Pan'', followed by ''[[The Golden Cockerel|Le Coq d'Or]]''. His main repertoire was French: ''Carmen, Louise'' (with Grace Moore), ''Manon'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', ''[[Mignon]]'' and ''The Tales of Hoffmann''. In addition to his Seattle and New York posts, Beecham was guest conductor with 18 American orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Beecham returned to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now (after his help in 1939) a self-governing [[cooperative|co-operative]], attempted to hire him on its own terms as its salaried artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  "I emphatically refuse", concluded Beecham, "to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career."&lt;ref name=reid231&gt;Reid, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[Walter Legge]] founded the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.&lt;ref name=reid231/&gt;

In 1946, Beecham founded the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] (RPO), securing an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society that the new orchestra should replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts.&lt;ref name=reid231/&gt;  Beecham later agreed with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne each summer. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated.&lt;ref name=reid231/&gt; As in 1909 and in 1932, Beecham's assistants recruited in the freelance pool and elsewhere. Original members of the RPO included James Bradshaw, [[Dennis Brain]], Leonard Brain, [[Archie Camden]], Gerald Jackson and Reginald Kell.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;  The orchestra later became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, often referred to as "The Royal Family", consisting of [[Jack Brymer]] (clarinet), [[Gwydion Brooke]] (bassoon), [[Terence MacDonagh]] (oboe) and Gerald Jackson (flute).&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2000), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham's long association with the Hallé Orchestra as a guest conductor ceased after [[John Barbirolli]] became the orchestra's chief conductor in 1944. Beecham was, to his great indignation, ousted from the honorary presidency of the Hallé Concerts Society,&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 308–310&lt;/ref&gt; and Barbirolli refused to "let that man near my orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1971), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham's relationship with the Liverpool Philharmonic, which he had first conducted in 1911, was resumed harmoniously after the war. A manager of the orchestra recalled, "It was an unwritten law in Liverpool that first choice of dates offered to guest conductors was given to Beecham. ... In Liverpool there was one over-riding factor – he was adored."&lt;ref&gt;Stiff, Wilfred, ''quoted in'' Procter-Gregg, pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and later years===
Beecham, whom the BBC called "Britain's first international conductor",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zddd4 "CD Review"], BBC Radio 3, 12 March 2011, retrieved 12 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; took the RPO on a strenuous tour through the United States, Canada and South Africa in 1950.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; During the North American tour, Beecham conducted 49 concerts in almost daily succession.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he was invited to conduct at Covent Garden after a 12-year absence.&lt;ref name=reid236&gt;Reid, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  State-funded for the first time, the opera company operated quite differently from his pre-war regime. Instead of short, star-studded seasons, with a major symphony orchestra, the new director [[David Webster (opera manager)|David Webster]] was attempting to build up a permanent ensemble of home-grown talent performing all the year round, in English translations. Extreme economy in productions and great attention to the box-office were essential, and Beecham, though he had been hurt and furious at his exclusion, was not suited to participate in such an undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;Haltrecht, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; When offered a chorus of eighty singers for his return, conducting ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg|Die Meistersinger]]'', he insisted on augmenting their number to 200. He also, contrary to Webster's policy, insisted on performing the piece in German.&lt;ref name=reid236/&gt;  In 1953 at [[Oxford]], Beecham presented the world premiere of Delius's first opera, ''Irmelin,'' and his last operatic performances in Britain were in 1955 at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], with [[André Grétry|Grétry]]'s ''Zémire et Azor''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Between 1951 and 1960, Beecham conducted 92 concerts at the [[Royal Festival Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Characteristic Beecham programmes of the RPO years included symphonies by Bizet, [[César Franck|Franck]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]; Richard Strauss's ''Ein Heldenleben''; concertos by Mozart and [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]; a Delius and [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]] programme; and many of his favoured shorter pieces.&lt;ref&gt;"Concerts", ''The Times'', 13 and 29 September 18 and 25 October 1, 15 and 29 November and 6 December 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  He did not stick uncompromisingly to his familiar repertoire. After the sudden death of the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], Beecham in tribute conducted the two programmes his colleague had been due to present at the Festival Hall; these included Bach's [[Brandenburg concertos|Third Brandenburg Concerto]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Rapsodie espagnole]]'', [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1]], and [[Samuel Barber|Barber]]'s ''Second Essay for Orchestra''.&lt;ref&gt;"Concerts", ''The Times'', 19 and 21 January 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Beecham grave.jpg|thumb|alt=Beecham's gravestone|Beecham's grave at St Peter's Church in [[Limpsfield]], Surrey. His epitaph is from the play ''[[The False One]]'' by [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[Philip Massinger]], Act 2 Scene 1, 169. ]]
In the summer of 1958, Beecham conducted a season at the [[Teatro Colón]], [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, consisting of Verdi's ''[[Otello]],'' Bizet's ''Carmen'', Beethoven's ''[[Fidelio]],'' Saint-Saëns's ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' and Mozart's ''The Magic Flute''. These were his last operatic performances.&lt;ref name=reid238&gt;Reid, pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this season that Betty Humby died suddenly.  She was cremated in Buenos Aires and her ashes returned to England. Beecham's own last illness prevented his operatic debut at Glyndebourne in a planned ''Magic Flute'' and a final appearance at Covent Garden conducting Berlioz's ''The Trojans''.{{refn|Colin Davis, Beecham's assistant for the Glyndebourne production, took on the ''Magic Flute'' performances, and [[Rafael Kubelík]] conducted the Berlioz.&lt;ref&gt;"Sudden Setback for Sir Thomas Beecham", ''The Times'', 13 July 1960, p. 12; and "''The Trojans'' Revived", ''The Times'', 30 April 1960, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Sixty-six years after his first visit to America, Beecham made his last, beginning in late 1959, conducting in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and Washington. During this tour, he also conducted in Canada. He flew back to London on 12 April 1960 and did not leave England again.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 21 and 226–27&lt;/ref&gt;  His final concert was at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]] on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the ''Magic Flute'' Overture, Haydn's [[Symphony No. 100 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 100]] (the ''Military''), Beecham's own Handel arrangement, ''Love in Bath'', Schubert's [[Symphony No. 5 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 5]], ''On the River'' by Delius, and the ''Bacchanale'' from ''Samson and Delilah''.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham died of a [[coronary thrombosis]] at his London flat, aged 81, on 8 March 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried two days later in [[Brookwood Cemetery]], Surrey. Owing to changes at Brookwood, his remains were exhumed in 1991 and reburied in St Peter's Churchyard at [[Limpsfield]], Surrey, close to the joint grave of Delius and his wife [[Jelka Rosen]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
[[File:Adrian-Beecham.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=full length portrait of young man in 1920s clothes|Beecham's son, the composer Adrian Beecham]]
Beecham was married three times. In 1903 he married Utica Celestina Welles, daughter of Dr Charles S. Welles, of New York, and his wife Ella Celeste, ''née'' Miles.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 11, 12 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham and his wife had two sons: Adrian, born in 1904, who became a composer and achieved some celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;"The World of Music", ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 30 September 1922, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas, born in 1909.&lt;ref name=reid62/&gt;  After the birth of his second child, Beecham began to drift away from the marriage. By 1911, no longer living with his wife and family, he was involved as co-respondent in a much-publicised divorce case.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 112–120&lt;/ref&gt; Utica ignored advice that she should divorce him and secure substantial alimony; she did not believe in divorce.&lt;ref name=reid120&gt;Reid, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  She never remarried after Beecham divorced her (in 1943), and she outlived her former husband by sixteen years, dying in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 14 October 1977, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 or early 1910, Beecham began an affair with Maud Alice (known as Emerald), [[Maud Cunard|Lady Cunard]]. Although they never lived together, it continued, despite other relationships on his part, until his remarriage in 1943.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  She was a tireless fund-raiser for his musical enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 134–137&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham's biographers are agreed that she was in love with him, but that his feelings for her were less strong.&lt;ref name=reid120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s, Beecham also had an affair with [[Dora Labbette]], a soprano sometimes known as Lisa Perli, with whom he had a son, Paul Strang, born in March 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 Lady Cunard was devastated to learn (not from Beecham) that he intended to divorce Utica to marry [[Betty Humby Beecham|Betty Humby]], a concert pianist 29 years his junior.&lt;ref name=reid220&gt;Reid, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham married Betty in 1943, and they were a devoted couple until her death in 1958.&lt;ref name=reid238/&gt;  On 10 August 1959, two years before his death, he married in Zurich his former secretary, Shirley Hudson, who had worked for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's administration since 1950. She was 27, he 80.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertoire==

===Handel, Haydn, and Mozart===
[[File:Teyte-Cherubino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|alt=full length portrait of a woman dressed as a boy in eighteenth century military costume|[[Maggie Teyte]] as Cherubino in Beecham's 1910 production of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'']]
The earliest composer whose music Beecham regularly performed was [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], whom he called, "the great international master of all time. ... He wrote Italian music better than any Italian; French music better than any Frenchman; English music better than any Englishman; and, with the exception of Bach, outrivalled all other Germans."&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1992), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his performances of Handel, Beecham ignored what he called the "professors, pedants, pedagogues".&lt;ref name=jefferson236&gt;Jefferson, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed Mendelssohn and Mozart in editing and reorchestrating Handel's scores to suit contemporary tastes.&lt;ref name=jefferson236/&gt;  At a time when Handel's operas were scarcely known, Beecham knew them so well that he was able to arrange three ballets, two other suites and a piano concerto from them.{{refn|The Handel works on which Beecham drew included ''[[Admeto]], [[Alcina]], [[Ariodante]], [[Clori, Tirsi e Fileno]], [[Lotario]], Il Parnasso in Festa, [[Il pastor fido]], [[Radamisto (Handel)|Radamisto]], [[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]], [[Rodrigo]], [[Serse]], [[Teseo]]'' and ''[[The Triumph of Time and Truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, pp 3–6; and Melville-Mason (Handel), pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He gave Handel's oratorio ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'' its first performance since the 18th century, with a text edited by the conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

With Haydn, too, Beecham was far from an authenticist, using unscholarly 19th-century versions of the scores, avoiding the use of the [[harpsichord]], and  phrasing the music romantically.&lt;ref name=gramhaydn/&gt;  He recorded the twelve "[[London symphonies|London]]" symphonies, and regularly programmed some of them in his concerts.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Haydn works were unfamiliar in the first half of the 20th century, but Beecham conducted several of them, including the [[Symphony No. 40 (Joseph Haydn)|Symphony No. 40]] and an early piano concerto.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;  He programmed ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' regularly throughout his career, recording it for [[EMI]] in 1956, and in 1944 added ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' to his repertoire.&lt;ref name=jefferson236/&gt;

For Beecham, Mozart was "the central point of European music,"&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; and he treated the composer's scores with more deference than he gave most others. He edited the incomplete [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]], made English translations of at least two of the great operas, and introduced Covent Garden audiences who had rarely if ever heard them to ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[Der Schauspieldirektor]]'' and ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]''; he also regularly programmed ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Beecham liked to claim that he introduced ''Così fan tutte'' to Britain.&lt;ref name=pg182&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although he gave its first British performance for decades at His Majesty's Theatre in 1910, it had been performed in London in 1811,&lt;ref name=holden&gt;Holden, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"King's Theatre", ''The Times'', 7 May 1811, p. 4; and 29 June 1811, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; in 1818&lt;ref&gt;"King's Theatre", ''The Times'', 12 June 1818, p. 2; and 21 July 1818, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and again by the St. George's Opera Company in 1873, attracting very favourable comment from ''The Times''.&lt;ref&gt;"St. George's Opera", ''The Times'', 21 January 1873, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham was, however, correct when he teased an American lecture audience that ''Così fan tutte'' did not appear in the US until "about thirteen years" after his London production.&lt;ref name=pg182/&gt; The US premiere was in 1922.&lt;ref name=holden/&gt;|group= n}} He considered the best of Mozart's piano concertos to be "the most beautiful compositions of their kind in the world", and he played them many times with Betty Humby-Beecham and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 115 and 238&lt;/ref&gt;

===German music===
[[File:Rosenkavalier-1913.jpg|thumb|left|alt=scene from operatic production, showing a man, woman and girl in 18th century costume|Beecham's 1913 production of Strauss's ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'']]
Beecham's attitude towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success.&lt;ref name=cardus60&gt;Cardus, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; He observed, "Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]] was a hobbledehoy who had no style at all&amp;nbsp;... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth symphony]] was composed by a kind of Mr. [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] of music."&lt;ref name=cardus60/&gt;  Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1988), p. 3; and [http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=worldcat_org_all&amp;q=Beethoven+Thomas+Beecham "Search results: Beethoven/Thomas Beecham"], WorldCat, retrieved 2 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  He conducted the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] with pleasure (recording it with [[Arthur Rubinstein]] and the LPO) but avoided the ''[[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|Emperor Concerto]]'' when possible.&lt;ref name=jefferson235&gt;Jefferson, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham was not known for his Bach&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; but nonetheless chose Bach (arranged by Beecham) for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. He later gave the Third [[Brandenburg concertos|Brandenburg Concerto]] in one of his memorial concerts for Wilhelm Furtwängler (a performance described by ''The Times'' as "a travesty, albeit an invigorating one").&lt;ref&gt;"Concerts", ''The Times'', 19 January 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  In Brahms's music, Beecham was selective. He made a speciality of the [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]]&lt;ref name=jefferson235/&gt; but conducted the [[Symphony No. 3 (Brahms)|Third]] only occasionally,{{refn|Beecham gave a "blazing" performance of it at a memorial concert for [[Arturo Toscanini]] in New York in January 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} the First rarely, and the [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth]] never. He sometimes conducted the German Requiem, but judged it "a ''dull'' piece";&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, Isobel, ''Never Sing Louder than Lovely''&lt;/ref&gt; his 1956 recording of an English-language [[Schicksalslied]] (a work sometimes termed a "Little Requiem")&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Evans.

Reeves, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "a deeply-felt and eloquently expressed performance...[Beecham] gets to the heart of Brahms's serious Germanic inspiration in such revelatory fashion."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/beecham-conducts-brahms&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs he made no mention of any Brahms performance after the year 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Beecham (1959), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham was a great [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]],&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 109; Procter-Gregg, p. 77; and Melville-Mason (Wagner), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; despite his frequent expostulation about the composer's length and repetitiousness: "We've been rehearsing for two hours&amp;nbsp;– and we're still playing the same bloody tune!"&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham conducted all the works in the regular Wagner canon with the exception of ''[[Parsifal]]'', which he presented at Covent Garden but never with himself in the pit.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pg203&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief music critic of ''The Times'' observed: "Beecham's ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' was almost Italian in its lyricism; his ''Ring'' was less heroic than Bruno Walter's or Furtwängler's, but it sang from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Howes, Frank, ''quoted in'' Procter-Gregg, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Strauss had a lifelong champion in Beecham, who introduced ''Elektra'', ''Salome'', ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and other operas to England. Beecham programmed ''Ein Heldenleben'' from 1910 until his last year; his final recording of it was released shortly after his death.&lt;ref name=jefferson235/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Strauss, Richard. ''Ein Heldenleben''", ''The Gramophone'', June 1961, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]], [[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks|Till Eulenspiegel]]'', the ''Bourgeois Gentilhomme'' music and ''[[Don Juan (Strauss)|Don Juan]]'' also featured in his repertory, but not ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also Sprach Zarathustra]]'' or ''[[Death and Transfiguration|Tod und Verklärung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss had the first and last pages of the manuscript of ''Elektra'' framed and presented them to "my highly honoured friend ... and distinguished conductor of my work."&lt;ref&gt;"Composer's Gift to Sir T. Beecham", ''The Times'', 22 April 1938, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===French and Italian music===
In the opinion of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, "Sir Thomas Beecham has done more for French music abroad than any French conductor".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz featured prominently in Beecham's repertoire throughout his career, and in an age when the composer's works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with [[Colin Davis|Sir Colin Davis]], Beecham has been described as one of the two "foremost modern interpreters" of Berlioz's music.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrecht, Norman. [http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/031210-NL-Berlioz.html "Hector Berlioz&amp;nbsp;– the Unloved Genius",] ''The Lebrecht Weekly (La Scena Musicale)'', 10 December 2003, retrieved 31 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham's choices of French music were characteristically eclectic.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] did not feature often, although his orchestral ''[[Pavane (Fauré)|Pavane]]'' was an exception; Beecham's final recording sessions in 1959 included the ''Pavane'' and the ''[[Dolly (Fauré)|Dolly Suite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet was among Beecham's favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included [[Gustave Charpentier]], [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]], [[Henri Duparc (composer)|Duparc]], Grétry, Lalo, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and [[Ambroise Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, pp. 196–203&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of Beecham's later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the [[Orchestre National de France|Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française]]. "''C'est un dieu''", their concertmaster said of Beecham in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2000), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the more than two dozen operas in the [[Verdi]] canon, Beecham conducted eight during his long career: ''[[Il trovatore]]'', ''[[La traviata]]'', ''[[Aida]]'', ''[[Don Carlos]]'', ''[[Rigoletto]]'', ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'', ''Otello'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''.&lt;ref name=pg203/&gt;  As early as 1904, Beecham met [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] through the librettist [[Luigi Illica]], who had written the libretto for Beecham's youthful attempt at composing an Italian opera.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 22–23 and 24–26. Jefferson (pp. 204–205) incorrectly gives the librettist's name as "Giuseppe Illica".&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of their meeting, Puccini and Illica were revising ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' after its disastrous première. Beecham rarely conducted that work, but he conducted ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Turandot]]'' and ''La bohème''.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1956 recording of ''La bohème'', with [[Victoria de los Ángeles]] and [[Jussi Björling]], has seldom been out of the catalogues since its release&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; and received more votes than any other operatic set in a 1967 symposium of prominent critics.&lt;ref&gt;March, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delius, Sibelius and "Lollipops"===
[[File:Fritz Delius (1907).jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=profile portrait of a slim middle-aged man, slightly balding, clean shaven|Delius in 1907]]
Except for Delius, Beecham was generally antipathetic to, or at best lukewarm about, the music of his native land and its leading composers.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, pp. 230–233&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham's championship of Delius, however, promoted the composer from relative obscurity.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 56–61&lt;/ref&gt;  Delius's [[amanuensis]], [[Eric Fenby]], referred to Beecham as "excelling all others in the music of Delius ... [[Charles Groves|Groves]] and Sargent may have matched him in the great choruses of ''[[A Mass of Life]]'', but in all else Beecham was matchless, especially with the orchestra."&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;  In an all-Delius concert in June 1911 Beecham conducted the premiere of ''[[Songs of Sunset]]''. He put on Delius Festivals in 1929 and 1946&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 187–189 and 316–18&lt;/ref&gt; and presented his concert works throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, pp. 56–59.&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted the British premieres of the operas ''[[A Village Romeo and Juliet]]'' in 1910 and ''[[Koanga]]'' in 1935, and the world premiere of ''Irmelin'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, pp. 60, 223, and 329&lt;/ref&gt;  However, he was not an uncritical Delian: he never conducted the [[Requiem (Delius)|''Requiem'']], and he detailed his criticisms of it in his book on Delius.{{refn|Beecham  thought Delius's invention was not of the same level in the ''Requiem'' as in earlier large scale compositions, and that a non-Christian requiem was a miscalculation, particularly at the height of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery and Threlfall, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Another major 20th-century composer who engaged Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised him as a fine conductor of his music (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music).&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's [[Symphony No. 2 (Sibelius)|Second Symphony]] with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.&lt;ref&gt;Originally issued on LP as HMV ALP 1947 in 1962 and subsequently reissued on compact disc as BBC Legends BBCL 415–4 in 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham was dismissive of some of the established classics, saying for example, "I would give the whole of Bach's ''Brandenburg Concertos'' for [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]]'s ''[[Manon]]'', and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;  He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called "lollipops". Some of the best-known were Berlioz's ''Danse des sylphes''; [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]'s ''[[Joyeuse Marche]]'' and [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''Le Sommeil de Juliette''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1991) pp. 4 and 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Main|Thomas Beecham selected discography}}
The composer [[Richard Arnell]] wrote that Beecham preferred making records to giving concerts: "He told me that audiences got in the way of music-making&amp;nbsp;– he was apt to catch someone's eye in the front row."&lt;ref&gt;Arnell, Richard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/944245 "Sir Thomas Beecham: Some Personal Memories",] ''Tempo'', Summer 1961, pp. 2–3 and 17, retrieved 15 March 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'', however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.{{refn|Harvey, reviewing the live 1956 taping of Sibelius's Second Symphony released after Beecham's death, wrote, "It is in one way a sad record, for it reminds one all too vividly of those Beecham occasions which can never happen again and which nobody else seems to be able to provide with so electrifying an atmosphere. … [T]here are those half-strangled yelps that Beecham emitted at moments of stress and climax, which one took to mean 'play, you so-and-so's, play!'&amp;nbsp;– and play the BBC Symphony Orchestra does, like blazes."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Trevor. "Sibelius, Symphony No. 2 in D major", ''The Gramophone'', November 1962, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[File:Thomas Beecham 1919 cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=caricature of a middle-aged man in evening clothes and a youngish woman dressed as Britannia|upright|1919 cartoon of Beecham, with [[Maud Cunard|Lady Cunard]] as Britannia]]
Beecham began making recordings in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras to use only principal instruments, placed as close to the recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for [[The Gramophone Company|HMV]], were of excerpts from [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' and [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]'s ''Die Fledermaus''. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the [[Columbia Graphophone Company]]. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal&amp;nbsp;– his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's ''[[España (Chabrier)|España]]'' was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1992), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, pp. 196–199&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1926 to 1932, Beecham made more than 70 discs, including an English version of Gounod's ''Faust'' and the first of three recordings of Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name=grammessiah/&gt;  He began recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1933, making more than 150 discs for Columbia, including music by Mozart, Rossini, Berlioz, Wagner, Handel, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy and Delius.&lt;ref name=jefferson89/&gt; Among the most prominent of his pre-war recordings was the first complete recording of Mozart's ''The Magic Flute'' with the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]], made for [[The Gramophone Company|HMV]] and supervised by Walter Legge in Berlin in 1937–38, a set described by [[Alan Blyth]] in ''Gramophone'' magazine in 2006 as having "a legendary status".&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, Alan. "Masonic Magic", ''Gramophone'', January 2006, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, during his German tour with the LPO, Beecham conducted the world's first orchestral recording on magnetic tape, made at [[Ludwigshafen]], the home of [[BASF]], the company that developed the process.&lt;ref&gt;Borwick, John. "Commentary: 50 Years of (BASF) Tape", ''Gramophone'', April 1984, p. 91, retrieved 13 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay in the US and afterwards, Beecham recorded for American [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] Records and [[RCA Victor]]. His RCA recordings include major works that he did not subsequently re-record for the gramophone, including [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fourth]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Sibelius's Sixth]] and Mendelssohn's [[Symphony No. 5 (Mendelssohn)|Reformation]] Symphonies.&lt;ref name=jenkins1&gt;Jenkins, Lyndon. "The Beecham Archives", ''Gramophone'', September 1987, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his RCA recordings were issued only in the US, including Mozart's [[Symphony No. 27 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 27]], K199, the overtures to Smetana's ''The Bartered Bride'' and Mozart's ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', the Sinfonia from Bach's ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]'',&lt;ref name=jenkins1/&gt; a 1947–48 complete recording of Gounod's ''Faust'', and an RPO studio version of Sibelius's Second Symphony.&lt;ref name=jenkins1/&gt; Beecham's RCA records that were released on both sides of the Atlantic were his celebrated 1956 complete recording of Puccini's ''La bohème''&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Thomas Beecham Selected Discography", ''Gramophone'', May 2011, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and an extravagantly rescored set of Handel's ''Messiah''.&lt;ref&gt;Culshaw, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The former remains a top recommendation among reviewers,&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/classical/cdreview/composer/giacomo-puccini/ "CD Review: Building a Library Recommendations"], BBC, 14 June 2008, retrieved 13 March 2011; and "Sir Thomas Beecham Selected Discography", ''Gramophone'', May 2001, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter was described by ''Gramophone'' as "an irresistible outrage … huge fun".&lt;ref name=grammessiah&gt;Blyth, Alan. "Music from Heaven", ''Gramophone'', December 2003, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Columbia label, Beecham recorded his last, or only, versions of many works by Delius, including ''A Mass of Life'', ''Appalachia'', ''North Country Sketches'', ''An Arabesque'', ''Paris'' and ''[[Eventyr (Once Upon a Time)|Eventyr]]''.&lt;ref name=jenkins1/&gt; Other Columbia recordings from the early 1950s include Beethoven's ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral]]'' and [[Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)|Eighth]] symphonies, Mendelssohn's ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Mendelssohn)|Italian]]'' symphony, and the Brahms [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]] with [[Isaac Stern]].&lt;ref name=jenkins1/&gt;

From his return to England at the end of the Second World War until his final recordings in 1959, Beecham continued his early association with HMV and British Columbia, who had merged to form EMI. From 1955, his EMI recordings made in London were recorded in stereo. He also recorded in Paris, with his own RPO and with the [[Orchestre National de France|Orchestra National de la Radiodiffusion Française]], though the Paris recordings were in mono until 1958.&lt;ref name=gramhaydn&gt;Wigmore, Richard. "Haydn Symphonies", ''Gramophone'', September 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For EMI, Beecham recorded two complete operas in stereo, ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' and ''Carmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Denis. "Beecham in the Recording Studio: a centenary tribute to Sir Thomas Beecham", ''Gramophone'', April 1979, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; His last recordings were made in Paris in December 1959.&lt;ref name=salter/&gt; Beecham's EMI recordings have been continually reissued on LP and CD. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of Beecham's death, EMI released 34 CDs of his recordings of music from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, including works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Delius, and many of the French "lollipops" with which he was associated.&lt;ref&gt;EMI (2011), "Sir Thomas Beecham Edition", catalogue numbers [http://www.emiclassics.co.uk/release.php?id=5099990991523 9099462], [http://www.emiclassics.co.uk/release.php?id=5099990996429 9099642], [http://www.emiclassics.co.uk/release.php?id=5099991861122 9186112] and [http://www.emiclassics.co.uk/release.php?id=5099990993220 9099322]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with others==
Beecham's relations with fellow British conductors were not always cordial. [[Sir Henry Wood]] regarded him as an upstart and was envious of his success;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 330–332&lt;/ref&gt; the scrupulous [[Sir Adrian Boult]] found him "repulsive" as a man and a musician;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1989), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sir John Barbirolli]] mistrusted him.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Malcolm Sargent]] worked with him in founding the London Philharmonic and was a friend and ally, but he was the subject of unkind, though witty, digs from Beecham who, for example, described the image-conscious [[Herbert von Karajan]] as "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent".&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Beecham's relations with foreign conductors were often excellent. He did not get on well with [[Arturo Toscanini]],&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; but he liked and encouraged [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]],&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; admired [[Pierre Monteux]],&lt;ref&gt;Canarina, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; fostered [[Rudolf Kempe]] as his successor with the RPO, and was admired by [[Fritz Reiner]],&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Klemperer]]&lt;ref&gt;Klemperer, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert von Karajan]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his lordly drawl, Beecham remained a Lancastrian at heart. "In ''my'' county, where ''I'' come from, we're all a bit vulgar, you know, but there is a certain heartiness&amp;nbsp;– a sort of bonhomie about our vulgarity&amp;nbsp;– which tides you over a lot of rough spots in the path. But in ''Yorkshire'', in a spot of bother, they're so damn-set-in-their-ways that there's no doing anything with them!"&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Beecham has been much quoted. In 1929, the editor of a music journal wrote, "The stories gathered around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely to be one of the topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice."&lt;ref&gt;Grew, Sydney. "British Conductors", ''British Musician and Musical News'', June 1929, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  A book, ''Beecham Stories'', was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his ''bons mots'' and anecdotes about him.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including [[Arnold Bax]] and [[Winston Churchill]]; [[Neville Cardus]] admitted to inventing some himself.&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A typical, and well known, Beecham story&amp;nbsp;– which, like many Beecham stories, is much repeated but not reliably verified&amp;nbsp;– is of his meeting a distinguished woman whose face was familiar but whose name he could not remember. After some preliminaries about the weather, and desperately racking his brain, he asked after her family:
:"My brother has been rather ill lately."
:"Ah, yes, your brother. I'm sorry to hear that. And, er, what is your brother doing at the moment?"
:"Well ... he's still King", replied [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;One of the many variants of this story is printed in Atkins, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, "A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it";&lt;ref&gt;Procter-Gregg, p. 154; and Cardus, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; his maxim, "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much";&lt;ref&gt;"Jolts and Jars: some wit and wisdom by Sir Thomas Beecham", ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', 3 October 1974; also heard on the EMI "Beecham in Rehearsal" disc, EMI CDM 7 64465 2 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: "Nothing from Mozart?"&lt;ref&gt;Cardus, p. 125; and Atkins, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

He was completely indifferent to mundane tasks such as correspondence, and was less than responsible with the property of others.  On one occasion, during bankruptcy proceedings, two thousand unopened letters were discovered among his papers.  [[Havergal Brian]] sent him three scores with a view to having them performed.  One of them, the ''Second English Suite'', was never returned and is now considered lost.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Reid, ''Thomas Beecham: An Independent Biography'', 1961, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://klassichaus.us/documents/HavergalBrianSocietyNL228.pdf The Havergal Brian Society Newsletter, No. 228, July-August 2013, p. 3, footnote 28]. Retrieved 23 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and commemorations==
Beecham was knighted in 1916 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father later that year. In 1938 the President of France, [[Albert François Lebrun|Albert Lebrun]], invested him with the [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1955, Beecham was presented with the [[Order of the White Rose of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a Commendatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy and was made a [[Companion of Honour]] in the 1957 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref name=jefferson101/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sir T.

''Beecham'', by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]], is a play celebrating the conductor and drawing on a large number of Beecham stories for its material. Its first production, in 1979, starred [[Timothy West]] in the title role. It was later adapted for television, starring West, with members of the Hallé Orchestra taking part in the action and playing pieces associated with Beecham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/370535 ''Timothy West as Beecham''], BBC TV film, 1979, British Film Institute Film and TV database, retrieved 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind: 30 Plays in 60 Minutes''''' (TMLMTBGB) was the longest running show in [[Chicago]]&lt;ref name="chicagotheaterbeat1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Scotty Zacher |url=http://chicagotheaterbeat.com/2010/03/30/too-much-light-makes-the-baby-go-blind/ |title=REVIEW: Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind (Neo-Futurists) |publisher=Chicago Theater Beat |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only open-run [[Off-Off-Broadway]] show in New York.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins |first=Laura |url=https://www.nytimes.com/theater/show/23737/Too-Much-Light-Makes-the-Baby-Go-Blind/overview |title=Theater |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1988, the show ran 50 weekends of the year until the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/news/ct-greg-allen-too-much-light-neo-futurists-closing-20161130-story.html|title=Longtime favorite 'Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind' to end over dispute|last=Jones|first=Chris|newspaper=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its subtitle states, the show consists of 30 short plays performed in a 60-minute space, written, directed, and performed by a small ensemble called the [[Neo-Futurists]]. The plays tend to be a mixture of autobiography and [[performance art]], as with much of the Neo-Futurists' work. The Neo-Futurists continued their 50 weekend a year performing streak with a new show titled ''The Infinite Wrench'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/news/ct-new-late-night-show-neo-futurists-20170228-story.html|title=New late-night show gets its name at Neo-Futurists|last=Greene|first=Morgan|newspaper=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Neo-Futurism]] as an aesthetic, as well as the format of TMLMTBGB, are both creations of founder Greg Allen, although, due to the changing roster of plays in ''TMLMTBGB'', Allen did not actually have a play in the show at all times during its run. In 2003, Allen ceased to be a member of the performing ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/blog/greg-allen-pulls-too-much-light-from-chicagos-neo-futurists-113016|title=Greg Allen pulls ‘Too Much Light’ from Chicago’s Neo-Futurists|newspaper=Time Out Chicago|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neo-Futurism]] aesthetic is a variant of the early 20th century Italian [[Futurism]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levitt |first=Aimee |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history &amp;#124; Performing Arts Feature |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Allen came up with the name from a young autistic child who would smash light bulbs and say, "Too much light makes the baby go blind". Later, when he was creating this show, the saying came back to his mind.

To date, three volumes of plays from the show have been published.

In November 2016, Allen revoked the Neo-Futurists' rights to perform ''TMLMTBGB'' in a surprise announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/too-much-light-creator-yanks-show-from-neo-futurists/|title='Too Much Light' creator yanks show from Chicago Neo-Futurists|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28th, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/news/ct-new-late-night-show-neo-futurists-20170228-story.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Futurists in Chicago, The San Francisco Neo-Futurists and the New York Neo-Futurists all launched an ongoing run of a new show titled ''The Infinite Wrench''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinfinitewrench.org/ ''The Infinite Wrench'']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Tone of the show==
The show is the work of the [[Neo-Futurism]] movement, a variant of the Italian [[Futurism]] movement &lt;ref name="chicagotheaterbeat1"/&gt; and reflects their aesthetic of non-illusory theater, where, as they describe it, "all of our plays are 'set' on the stage in front of the audience. All of our 'characters' are ourselves... We do not aim to 'suspend the audience's disbelief' but to create a world where the stage is a continuation of daily life" (Allen 3).

==Structure==
The ticket price for the show is random, with a fixed number (currently $9 for the Chicago show, $13 for the New York show, and $10 for the San Francisco show) being added to the roll of a six-sided die for each person. Upon payment, a member of the cast shouts "What's your name?" at the audience member before giving him or her a nametag with a random and unrelated "name". Audience members are given a "menu" of play titles, and plays are selected by audience members shouting their number, with the first number heard being the play performed. Many of the plays contain elements of randomness and audience interaction; plays end when a member of the cast shouts "curtain!" 

The list of plays is perpetually rotating. Every week between two and twelve plays (determined by two rolls of a die by someone in the audience) are removed from the "menu" and replaced with new plays, written in the course of the week.  

As part of a lighthearted tradition, when a particular evening sells out, the cast orders pizza from a local restaurant, allowing the audience to shout out toppings.  Only a single pizza is ordered, however, which the entire audience must share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levitt |first=Aimee |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/too-much-light-makes-the-baby-go-blind/Content?oid=876173 |title=Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind &amp;#124; Performing Arts Review |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York troupe==
A second Neo-Futurist company was founded in [[New York City]] in April 2004. The New York Neo-Futurists perform TMLMTBGB at the Kraine Theater in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. This production has its own ensemble members, and thus contains different short plays from the Chicago show. In 2006, the New York Neo-Futurists were the recipients of the [[New York Innovative Theatre Awards]] Outstanding Performance Art Production.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==San Francisco troupe==
In 2014, a third Neo-Futurist company was founded in [[San Francisco]] by producer Lucy Tafler and New York Neo-Futurist alum Adam Smith, performing in various venues in San Francisco's [[Theater District (San Francisco, California)|Theatre District]]. In 2016, they were voted San Francisco's Best Theater Company in the [[San Francisco Bay Guardian|SF Bay Guardian]]'s "Best of the Bay" Reader's Poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://48hills.org/2016/10/20/best-bay-2016-arts-entertainment/|title=BEST OF THE BAY 2016: ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT WINNERS|last=B|first=Marke|date=2016-10-20|website=48 hills|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the New York Neo-Futurists, the troupe has their own ensemble members and plays. As of July 2015, they perform at SAFEhouse for the Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/SF-Neo-Futurists-win-race-even-if-they-don-t-9126879.php|title=SF Neo-Futurists win race even if they don’t finish|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable productions==
''Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind'' premiered in the state of Tennessee in the spring of 2016 in Nashville with a Gadabout Theater Company production. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nowplayingnashville.com/event/30-neo-futurist-plays-from-too-much-light-makes-the-baby-go-blind-30-plays-in-60-minutes/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uncle John's Bathroom Readers''''' are a series of books containing [[trivia]] and short [[essay]]s on miscellaneous topics, ostensibly for [[Bathroom reading|reading]] in the [[bathroom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9gJKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Vh4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1211,628873&amp;dq=uncle-john%27s-bathroom-reader&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; The books are credited to the Bathroom Readers' Institute, though Uncle John is a real person, and are published by Portable Press, an imprint of [[Printer's Row Publishing Group]]. The introductions in the books, as well as brief notes in some articles, provide small pieces of information about Uncle John. The first book was published in 1988, and in 2012, the series reached its 25th release, The ''Fully Loaded 25th Anniversary Bathroom Reader''.

Volumes dedicated to a single topic have been released, under the title ''Uncle John Plunges Into...'', for example: [[history]], [[President of the United States|presidents]], and the [[universe]]. There are also books on individual [[U.S. state]]s, the [[weather]], [[number]]s, quotes, the year 2000, a special book for mothers, [[cat]] lovers, dog lovers, horse lovers, love, ''Uncle John's Book of the Dumb'', and several ''Bathroom Readers for Kids Only!''. Though most of the books were written by the Bathroom Readers' Institute, some of the ones that are based around a specific subject are written by a lone author, who is not in the Institute. Additionally, the Institute will often publish articles and other contributions sent in from readers. Recurring articles such as "Flubbed Headlines", "Oops", and "Classifieds" often depend on these contributions. Currently, the institute publishes three books a year; a "classic" reader, and two "plunges into" editions, one for a location such as a U.S. state, and another of a specific topic.

Their volumes contain information on subjects such as quotes, dumb criminals, [[palindrome]]s, [[anagram]]s, [[urban legend]]s and [[hoax]]es, failed [[invention]]s, the history of everyday things, and accidental discoveries, as well as articles on [[pop culture]] and '[[celebrity|celebrities]]' such as [[Emperor Norton]] (see [[#Features|Features]]). Throughout the books, there are what the BRI calls "running feet" - short fun facts on the bottom of each page. A typical example is "An object on [[Jupiter]] would weigh 144,000 times more than it would on [[Pluto]]." Some books have one running foot that simply says "Hi, mom.".

Uncle John's also publishes Page-a-Day calendars with [[Workman Publishing Company]].

The series has sold 15 million copies.

== Features ==
Among the regular articles in the books are:

* '''Origins of Words and Phrases'''- the "Familiar Phrases" feature, though having changed names several times throughout the series, has been featured in some form in 16 of the "Classic" books. It is often seen many times in each book, usually three or four times. The "Word Origins" has also had its name changed over the years, and has been seen in every book of the series since its introduction in ''Uncle John's Second Bathroom Reader''
* '''Rumors and Urban Legends''' The "Rumors" article was first seen in the very first book, but has been replaced, starting with the ''10th Anniversary Reader'' with the similar, and very popular "Urban Legends" section.
* '''Famous for 15 Minutes'''- Also originating in the series' first book, "Famous for 15 Minutes" is based on [[Andy Warhol]]'s famous quote that everybody will someday be famous for a short period. The feature describes the stories of those who fit this description, often in a style reminiscent of the [[Darwin Awards]] (i.e., those mentioned often act in a very unbecoming fashion). Also very popular, it has been seen in 15 Bathroom Readers.
* '''Strange Lawsuits''': Bizarre, actual lawsuits. For example, a woman sues [[Bill Clinton]] because aliens have told her that he will enslave all black women.
* '''Oops!''' First seen in ''Uncle John's Sixth Bathroom Reader,'' "Oops!" is a set of newspaper article excerpts describing humorous mistakes in the previous year.
* '''Q&amp;A: Ask the Experts''': Considerably more popular in the Kids Bathroom Reader series, "Ask the Experts" answers questions (e.g. "Do fish drown?"). It was first seen in the 6th Bathroom Reader.
* '''Court Transquips''' Originally called "Disorder in the Court," the feature was introduced in the 5th Bathroom Reader, and pokes fun at things said in court cases (such as 'Were you alone or by yourself?' 'Was that the same nose you broke as a child?'), and unintentionally-humorous exchanges between judges and lawyers, defendants or witnesses ('You've been accused of stealing 15 chickens.  Are you the defendant?' 'No, sir, I'm the guy that stole the chickens.').
* '''They Went That-a-Way''' Accounts of unusual deaths, typically of celebrities—for example, the ironic passing of [[Redd Foxx]]. This first appears in the 2nd bathroom reader under epitaphs.
* '''Uncle John's Stall of Fame'''- Accounts of bathrooms and toilets being used in a positive way.
* '''Uncle John's Stall of Shame''' -- Accounts of bathrooms and toilets being used in a negative way.

== History ==
=== 1988–1991 ===
The Bathroom Readers' Institute began in 1988, with the publishing of the original ''Uncle John's Bathroom Reader'', by St. Martin's Press Publishers. After the book's success, ''Uncle John's 2nd Bathroom Reader'' was published in 1989, with a third and a fourth book being added to the series in the subsequent years. These earlier books are distinct from the rest not only due to their short length, but because of the writing style: Short articles starting with a brief history of the subject, followed by several tidbits on the subject.

=== 1992–1995 ===
After the initial four books, the BRI decided that it would publish further volumes under its own label, and ''Uncle John's 5th Bathroom Reader'' was released in October 1992; notable for a revised writing style, more and longer articles, and the introduction of new recurring features, ''Uncle John's 5th'' set what would become the standard design for every book going forward.  The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Bathroom Reader went out of print in 1994, and would later be re-released as a single volume, ''Uncle John's Legendary Lost Bathroom Reader''. In 1995, the millionth copy of the series was sold, and to celebrate the milestone, the BRI released an eighth volume, ''The Best of Uncle John's Bathroom Reader''.

=== 1996–2002 ===
In 1996, the Bathroom Readers' Institute revised its writing style yet again, adopting a more 'encyclopedic' style, as well as spreading longer articles throughout the book.

=== 2003–present ===
For the first 15 years, "Bathroom Readers" referred to just one series. Now, there were several competitors (none quite as successful) and quite a few series ''within'' the BRI. Books 15–18 began to move away from the format seen in previous books, using two- and three-part articles, and sometimes removing popular recurring features in favor of the longer format. In 2012, ''Uncle John's Bathroom Reader'' celebrated its 25th anniversary with the publication of "Fully Loaded 25th Anniversary Bathroom Reader".

'''''Village of Idiots''''' is a short animated comedy based on the classic humorous [[Jewish]] [[Folklore|folk tales]] of [[Jewish humour#Chelm|Chełm]] directed and animated by [[Eugene Fedorenko]] and [[Rose Newlove]], written by [[John Lazarus (playwright)|John Lazarus]], and produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=33250#nav-prix|title=Village of Idiots|work=National Film Board of Canada Web site|accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fedorenko is the [[Academy Award]]-winning animator of the 1979 NFB short ''[[Every Child (film)|Every Child]]''.

==Summary==
“Outsiders call Chelm the village of idiots," Shmendrick explains, "but our rabbi said we were a city of natural geniuses, with our own way of figuring things out.”

With muted, mesmerizing illustrations and heavy accordion-based music, the film follows Shmendrick as he sets out on a journey away from home for the first time. But along his journey from Chełm to [[Warsaw]], he comes upon a city that is eerily similar to the one he left behind. The rest of us might think Shmendrik just took a wrong turn and ended up back home, but for Shmendrik, this discovery sheds light on holy teachings: “The [[Talmud]] tells us that the world everywhere is the same," he recalls.

==Awards==
''Village of Idiots'' has won eight awards:
*Best Animated Short film at the [[Genie Awards]] 
*Two directing awards at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]]
*Won Animation at the Palm Springs International Short Film Festival
*Centaur Award at the St. Petersburg [[Message to Man]] Film Festival
*Best Animated Film at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]
*Won an award from the [[Writers Guild of Canada]]
*Second prize at the [[Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]]

It was also included in the [[Animation show of shows]].

'''ZAC Browser''' (Zone for Autistic Children) is a [[web browser]] designed specifically for children and teenagers with [[autism]] and [[autism spectrum]] disorders such as [[Asperger syndrome]], [[pervasive developmental disorders|pervasive developmental disorders (PDD)]] and [[PDD-NOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2008-06-03-grandfather-zac-browser_N.htm | title = Grandfather builds Web browser for autistic grandson | publisher = Associated Press via USA Today| last = Bergstein | first = Brian |authorlink=Brian Bergstein | accessdate = 2008-06-03 | date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because autistic children display characteristics such as impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behavior, the standard browser experience can often be overwhelming.  The ZAC browser reduces the number of user interface controls and removes access to much of the [[World Wide Web|Web]] in order to simplify the experience for autistic children.

ZAC browser is available as a free download for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7.  

==History==
John LeSieur had a grandson named Zack who was diagnosed with severe autism at the age of 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/technology/2008/07/zac-browser-brings-autistic-children-into-their-own-digital-realm/ | title = Zac Browser brings autistic children into their own digital realm | publisher = Blast Magazine| last = Schwartz | first = Terry | accessdate = 2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the autism, the child was often very frustrated when using the computer. LeSieur owned People CD Inc., a software production company, and released a web browser for children called KidCD in 2006.  KidCD proved helpful for Zack, as he was able to use the computer on his own.

In 2008, KidCD 2.0 was released and added a feature that automatically switched icons on the screen.  This feature was problematic for autistic children, who generally prefer very organized displays.  LeSieur then developed an alternative version of KidCD 2.0, called ZAC Browser, which added [[aquarium]] graphics to the main page along with stationary icons.  The specialty browser was designed to enable children with autism to use and benefit from the same types of websites other children use, including [[Sesame Street]] and [[PBS Kids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,70549-order,1-page,1-c,allbrowsersclientsdownloads/description.html | title = Editor's Review of ZAC Browser | publisher = PC World| last = Saccio-Kent | first = Kim | accessdate = 2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
