      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3215">The '''Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979''' ({{USPL|96|95}} as amended, {{USStat|93|721}}, codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|16|470aa|470mm}}), also referred to as '''ARPA''', is a [[Law of the United States|federal law]] of the [[United States]] passed in 1979 and amended in 1988. It governs the excavation of [[archaeological site]]s on federal and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] lands in the United States, and the removal and disposition of archaeological collections from those sites.&lt;ref name="Seidemann"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seidemann |first=Ryan M. |date=November 9, 2006 |title=The Reason Behind the Rules: The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and Scientific Study |series=bepress Legal Series, Working Paper 1874 |publisher=[[Berkeley Electronic Press]] |url=http://law.bepress.com/expresso/eps/1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARPA was launched in the 1970s after the [[Antiquities Act]] of 1906 was declared “unconstitutionally vague”. The Antiquities Act was unable to protect historical sites from criminal looting. Several attempts by the federal land-managing agencies and prosecutors to use this act resulted in judges saying that it was unconstitutionally vague making it unenforceable.(Harmon 172) ARPA regulates access to archaeological resources on federal and Indian lands. Uniform regulations were issued by the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Department of Defense. Archaeological resources are defined as "Any material remains of human life or activities which are at least 100 years of age, and which are archaeological interest."(King 252) Also defined is "Of archaeological interest" which is "Capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior, cultural adaption, and related topics."(King 252) ARPA forbids anyone from excavating or removing archaeological resources from federal or Indian land without a permit from a land managing agency. ARPA also forbids any sales, purchase, exchange, transport, or receipt. Those who violate can face substantial fines and even a jail sentence if convicted. They will also confiscate any object that has been declared as an archaeological resource.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}

=== Origin ===
It is believed that "Arirang" originated in [[Jeongseon County|Jeongseon]], [[Gangwon Province, South Korea|Gangwon Province]]. According to one legend, the name is derived from the story of a bachelor and a maiden who fell in love while picking [[camellia]] blossoms near the wharf at Auraji ({{Lang|ko|아우라지}}). In one version of the story, the bachelor cannot cross the Auraji to meet the maiden because the water is too high, and they sing a song to express their sorrow. In another version of the story, the bachelor attempts to cross the Auraji and drowns, singing the sorrowful song after he dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsR3BgAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature|last=The National Folk Museum of Korea|first=|publisher=길잡이미디어|year=2014|isbn=8928900840|volume=Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture Vol. III|location=|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories on the origin of the name "Arirang" point to [[Lady Aryeong]], wife of the first king of [[Silla]]; "arin," the [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]] word for "hometown"; and a [[China|Chinese]] song named "Airang."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/08/135_126317.html|title=From lyrical folk song to cheering song: variations of 'Arirang' in Korean history|last=|first=|date=2012-12-06|work=The Korea Times|access-date=2017-12-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|agency=Yonhap News Agency|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to {{nowrap|prof.

=== First recording ===
The first known recording of "Arirang" was made in 1896 by American [[Ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Alice Cunningham Fletcher|Alice C. Fletcher]]. Fletcher recorded three Korean students singing a song she called, "Love Song: Ar-ra-rang," in her home in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170927000618|title=Oldest recorded Arirang to be on display in Seoul|last=Yoon|first=Min-sik|date=2017-09-27|work=The Korea Herald|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2012/05/04/25/0701000000AEN20120504002500315F.HTML|title=Arirang under renewed light ahead of UNESCO application|last=Kim|first=Hyeh-won|date=2012-05-11|website=Yonhap News Agency|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source suggests that the students belonged to noble Korean families and were studying abroad at [[Howard University]] during the period the recording was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ikorea.ac.kr/File/intro/Fletcherpreliminaryarticle.pdf|title=Alice Fletcher's Notes on the Earliest Recordings of Korean Music|last=Provine|first=Robert C.|date=|work=The Academy of Korean Studies|access-date=2017-12-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recordings are currently housed in the U.S. [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lccn.loc.gov/2015655305|title=Alice C Fletcher collection of Korean cylinder recordings|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance anthem ===
During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] from 1910 to 1945, "Arirang" became a resistance anthem against [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] rule.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atkins|first=E.

Many of the variations of "Arirang" that were written during the occupation contain themes of injustice, the plight of laborers, and guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The most well-known lyrics to "Arirang" first appeared in the 1926 [[silent film]] ''[[Arirang (1926 film)|Arirang]],'' directed by [[Na Woon-gyu]]. ''Arirang'' is now considered a [[lost film]], but various accounts say the film was about a Korean student who became mentally ill after being imprisoned and tortured by the Japanese. The film was a hit upon its release and is considered the first Korean nationalist film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Film Out of Bounds: Essays and Interviews on Non-Mainstream Cinema Worldwide|last=Edwards|first=Matthew|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=147660780X|location=|pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Divine Work, Japanese Colonial Cinema and its Legacy|last=Taylor-Jones|first=Kate|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|year=2017|isbn=1501306138|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popularity in Japan ===
Japan experienced a craze for Korean culture in general and for "Arirang" in particular during its occupation of Korea. Over 50 Japanese versions of "Arirang" were released between 1931 and 1943, in genres including [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Zdravica-št4-rokopis1.jpg|thumb|''Zdravljica'', the poem by the Slovene poet France Prešeren, is a ''carmen figuratum'' because each stanza has the shape of a wine cup.]]
'''''Carmen figuratum''''' (plural: ''carmina figurata'') is a [[poem]] that has a certain shape or pattern [[poetry#Form|formed]] either by all the words it contains or just by certain ones therein. An example is [[France Prešeren]]'s ''[[Zdravljica]]'', where the shape of each stanza resembles a wine cup. The term derives from the ''[[carmina figurata]]'' of Renaissance texts - works in which a sacred image was picked out in red letters against a field of black type so that a holy figure could be seen and meditated on during the process of reading.

The '''Center for Jewish Art''' ('''CJA''') is a research institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], devoted to the documentation and research of Jewish visual culture. Established in 1979, it documented and researched objects of Jewish art in ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries. Today, the Center's archives and collections constitute the largest and most comprehensive body of information on Jewish art in existence. The CJA’s research and documentation is included in the Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art.

==History==
The Center for Jewish Art at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established in 1979 by Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]], [[Israel Prize]] laureate, with an aim to document objects of Jewish art and produce a comprehensive iconographical index of Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/About_Us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was an outcome of Narkiss’s iconographical research of medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, which he initiated with Professor Gabrielle Sed-Rajna in 1974. The Index initially consisted of four sections: a Section of Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts, of Sacred and Ritual Objects, of Ancient Jewish Art, and of Modern Jewish Art.

Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]] headed the CJA until 1991. The next director, Professor Aliza Cohen-Mushlin, established a fifth section for Jewish Ritual Architecture and Funerary Art. Under her leadership the CJA undertook many research expeditions to post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, in order to measure endangered synagogues and tombstones in regions, which were previously inaccessible to western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thesourceisrael.com/issue19/tour_article/ |title=Center for Jewish Art &amp;#124; The Source |website=Thesourceisrael.com |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from 1994 CJA documented those synagogues in Germany which survived the Nazi regime and were not demolished in [[Kristallnacht]]. The documentation projects in Germany were done in cooperation with the Department of Architectural History at the Technical University in Braunschweig, headed by Professor Harmen H. Thies. In 1997 this cooperation was institutionalized as Bet Tfila Research Unit for Jewish Architecture in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/indexen.html |title=Bet Tfila – Forschungsstelle |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
* ''Jewish Art'' (in 1974-1985, ''Journal of Jewish Art'') is an annual devoted to the research of Jewish art. Its editors were [[Bezalel Narkiss]] and Aliza Cohen-Mushlin; Professors Ziva Amishai-Maisels and Bianca Kühnel served as guest editors of two issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/JA.html |title=Jewish Art Journal |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rimonim'' (רימונים) is a Hebrew journal on Jewish art, aiming at bringing the results of academic research to a wider Israeli audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/RIMONIM.html |title=Rimonim |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1976-1994 the Center for Jewish Art published ten volumes of ''Jerusalem Index of Jewish Art'' as collections of card on Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, ritual objects and ancient Jewish art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/Publications/ija2.html |title=The Center for Jewish Art |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 2007, Beit Tfila publishes a series of monographs on Jewish architecture and a series of smaller studies on individual Jewish buildings. The editors of both series are Aliza Cohen-Mushlin and Harmen Thies, and they are published by the Imhoff Verlag in English and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/en/p-publ.htm |title=Publications of the Bet Tfila – Research Unit |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art==
The Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art is a largest virtual Jewish museum in the word, which includes about 250,000 images from ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries, as well as architectural plans of ca. 1,500 synagogues documented in situ. The images are classified according to their iconographical subject, type of objects, origin, and date. The digitization of the Index is being undertaken in cooperation with the [[National Library of Israel]] and the Judaica Division of [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.1641039 |title=המרכז לאמנות יהודית יזכה לתמיכה של 3 מיליון שקל - אמנות - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/digitallibrary/cja/Pages/default.aspx |title=The Center for Jewish Art Collection |publisher=Web.nli.org.il |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.slideshare.net/evaminerva/d1-vladimir-levincenterforjewish-artevaminerva2013 |title=D1 vladimir levin center for jewish art eva minerva 2013 |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cleavage english.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Cleavages in society according to Lipset/Rokkan]]
In [[political science]], '''cleavage''' is the division of voters into [[voting bloc]]s.  

The preliminary assumption is that voters do not come in predefined groups of pros and cons for or against a certain subject.  Ballot analysis assumes that voters opt for a certain party or decide for the solution or option that comes closest to their own position.  Cleavage separates the voters into advocates and adversaries on a certain issue, or voting for a certain party.  If you imagine parties on a horizontal line for a certain issue, cleavage is the vertical line that divides the parties into supporters and opponents of the issue.

==Examples==
There are numerous cleavages in society, but [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] and [[Stein Rokkan]] (1967) defined four basic cleavages for western civilization after the [[Industrial Revolution]]. According to Lipset and Rokkan, these cleavages determined the emergence and the content of all European political parties. 
* {{em|Centre versus periphery:}} between elites in the urban areas and those in more outlying areas.  This usually expresses itself in terms of [[Regionalism (politics)|regional nationalism]].  For example, in [[Spain]] many regions have regionalist or [[Separatism|separatist]] parties.  This division is, according to Lipset and Rokkan, caused by the creation of modern [[nation-state]]s, where some states were better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation.
* {{em|State versus church:}} between religious and secular voters. In the Netherlands until the 1970s there were five major parties: the [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), the Protestant [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) and [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU), the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA), and the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), the last two being secular.
* {{em|Owner versus worker:}} a class cleavage, causing the formation of parties of the left and parties of the right. Sometimes it is argued that this cleavage represents a conflict between the rich and poor.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, M., Laver, M., Mair, P. (2006), ''Representative Government in Modern Europe''. New York: McGraw-Hill, pp. 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt; Various parties have claimed to represent either interest, though this may or may not be genuine.
* {{em|Land versus industry:}} continued state exercise of control over tariffs, against freedom of control for industrial enterprise.

Contemporary ballot analysis speaks of the emergence of new cleavages. The traditional opposition between owner and worker (capital and labour) is being differentiated further among those who have work/are employable and those who are not. Further, sex becomes another cleavage, especially in regard to getting and maintaining a paid labour position.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

In some 21st century Western European countries like Austria, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland), a new cultural divide is suggested to have arisen, challenging the old primary political cleavage over economic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Oesch |first=Daniel |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=31-52 |chapter=The Class Basis of the Cleavage between the New Left and the Radical Right: an analysis for Austria, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation has occurred since the late 1960s, with the [[New Left]] that arose in this period espousing [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and universalistic values, and a populist right reaction arising from the 1980s espousing traditionalist and [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornschier |first=Simon |last2=Kriesi |first2=Hanspeter |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=10-29 |chapter=The populist right, the working class, and the changing face of class politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3333">'''Coherence''' in [[linguistics]] is what makes a text [[semantics|semantically]] meaningful.
It is especially dealt with in [[text linguistics]]. Coherence is achieved through syntactical features such as the use of [[deictic]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] and [[cataphora|cataphoric]] elements or a logical tense structure, as well as [[presupposition]]s and [[logical consequence|implications]] connected to general world knowledge. The purely linguistic elements that make a text coherent are subsumed under the term [[Cohesion (linguistics)|cohesion]].

However, those text-based features which provide cohesion in a text do not necessarily help achieve coherence, that is, they do not always contribute to the meaningfulness of a text, be it written or spoken. It has been stated that a text coheres only if the world around is also coherent.

[[Robert De Beaugrande]] and [[Wolfgang U. Dressler]] define coherence as a “continuity of senses” and “the mutual access and relevance within a configuration of concepts and relations”.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaugrande, Robert /Dressler, Wolfgang: ''Introduction to Text Linguistics''. New York, 1996. P. 84 – 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereby a textual world is created that  does not have to comply to the real world. But within this textual world the arguments also have to be connected logically so that the reader/hearer can produce coherence.

"Continuity of senses" implies a link between cohesion and the theory of Schemata initially proposed by [[Frederic Bartlett|F. C. Bartlett]] in  1932&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932).
 Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady Wagoner. ''[https://www.academia.edu/1851721/Culture_and_mind_in_reconstruction_Bartletts_analogy_between_individual_and_group_processes Culture and mind in reconstruction: Bartlett's analogy between individual and group processes]''. Aalborg University, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; which creates further implications for the notion of a "text".  Schemata, subsequently distinguished into Formal and Content Schemata (in the field of [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]]&lt;ref&gt;Carrell, P.L. and Eisterhold, J.C. (1983) "Schema Theory and ESL Reading Pedagogy", in Carrell, P.L., Devine, J. and Eskey, D.E. (eds) (1988) Interactive Approaches to Second Language Reading. Cambridge: CUP.&lt;/ref&gt;) are the ways in which the world is organized in our minds. In other words, they are mental frameworks for the organization of information about the world. It can thus be assumed that a text is not always one because the existence of  coherence is not always a given. On the contrary, coherence is relevant because of its dependence upon each individual's content and formal schemata.

'''Comparative religion''' is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's [[religion]]s. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and forms of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a broadened and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Religion in the Middle East|Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], [[African religions]], [[Native American religion|American religions]], [[Religion in Oceania|Oceanic religions]], and 
[[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[Hellenistic religion]]s.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Social scientists in the 19th century took a strong interest in comparative and "primitive" religion through the work of [[Max Müller]], [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[William Robertson Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Émile  Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Rudolf Otto]].&lt;ref&gt; Hans Kippenberg, ''Discovering Religious History in the Modern Age'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas de Lange]], Professor of Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[Cambridge University]], says that

{{quote|The comparative study of religions is an academic discipline which has been developed within Christian theology faculties, and it has a tendency to force widely differing phenomena into a kind of strait-jacket cut to a Christian pattern. The problem is not only that other 'religions' may have little or nothing to say about questions which are of burning importance for Christianity, but that they may not even see themselves as religions in precisely the same way in which Christianity sees itself as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Geographical classification ==
According to Charles Joseph Adams, in the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification discerns&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] as follows:&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

# Middle Eastern religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and a variety of ancient cults; 
# East Asian religions, the religious communities of China, Japan, and Korea, and consisting of Confucianism, Daoism, the various schools of [[Mahayana]] (“Greater Vehicle”) Buddhism, and [[Shinto|Shintō]];

==== Abrahamic or Western Asian religions ====
{{Main|Abrahamic religion|Western religion|Islamic religion}}

In the study of comparative religion, the category of Abrahamic religions consists of the three [[monotheistic]] religions, [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], which claim [[Abraham]] (Hebrew ''Avraham'' אַבְרָהָם; Arabic ''Ibrahim'' إبراهيم ) as a part of their sacred history. Smaller religions such as [[Bahá'í Faith]] that fit this description are sometimes included but are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html Why Abrahamic?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908060636/http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/abrahamic.html |date=8 September 2007 }} Lubar Institute for the Study of the Abrahamic Religions at the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

The original belief in the [[One God]] of Abraham eventually became strictly monotheistic present-day [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Christians believe that Christianity is the [[Supersessionism|fulfillment]] and continuation of the Jewish [[Tanakh|Old Testament]]. Christians believe that [[Jesus]] (Hebrew ''Yeshua'' יֵשׁוּעַ) is the [[Messiah]] (Christ) foretold in the [[Old Testament]] [[prophecy]], and believe in subsequent New Testament revelations based on the divine authority of Jesus in Christian belief (as the [[Incarnation|Incarnation of God]]). Islam believes the present Christian and Jewish scriptures have been [[Tahrif|corrupted]] over time and are no longer the original divine revelations as given to the [[Revelation#Mass revelation|Jewish people]] and to [[Mosaic authorship|Moses]], [[Pauline Christianity|Jesus]], and other prophets. For Muslims, the [[Qur'an]] is the final, complete revelation from [[God]] (Arabic الله ''[[Allah]]''), who believe it to have been [[divine revelation|revealed]] to [[Muhammad]] alone, who is believed by Muslims to be the [[Prophet of Islam|final prophet of Islam]], and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]], meaning the last of the prophets ever sent by Allah ("seal of the prophets").
Based on the Muslim figure of the [[Mahdī]], the ultimate savior of humankind and the final Imām of the Twelve Imams, [[Báb|Ali Muhammad Shirazi]], later known as Bab, created the Bábí movement out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imām. This signaled a break with Islam and started a new religious system, [[Bábism]]. However, in the 1860s a split occurred after which the vast majority of Bábís who considered Mirza Husayn `Ali or [[Bahá'u'lláh]] to be Báb's spiritual successor founded the Bahá'í Movement, while the minority who followed Subh-i-Azal came to be called Azalis.&lt;ref&gt;"But the upshot of the whole matter is, that out of every hundred Bábís probably not more than three or four are Ezelís &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, all the rest accepting Behá'u'lláh &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as the final and most perfect manifestation of the Truth." (Browne (1889) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm p. 351])&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í division eventually became a full-fledged religion of its own, the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In comparison to the other Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the number of adherents for Bahai faith and other minor Abrahamic religions are not very significant.

Out of the three major Abrahamic faiths, [[Christianity and Judaism]] are the two religions that diverge the most in theology and practice.

The historical interaction of [[Islam and Judaism]] started in the 7th century CE with the origin and spread of Islam. There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism, and as Islam [[History of Islam|developed]], it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism. As opposed to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman empire|Roman]], and [[Hebrew]] cultures, Judaism is very similar to Islam in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rabbi David Rosen]], [http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations,%20Past%20&amp;%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc Jewish-Muslim Relations, Past and Present] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616163849/http://rabbidavidrosen.net/doc/Muslim-Jewish%20Relations/Jewish-Muslim%20Relations%2C%20Past%20%26%20Present%20Nov%2003.doc |date=16 June 2007 }}, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the [[Hebrew Bible]] or from post-biblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the ''[[Isra'iliyat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Justin Jaron Lewis, [http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html  Islam and Judaism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405102236/http://post.queensu.ca/~jjl/islam.html |date=5 April 2007 }}, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical interaction between [[Christianity and Islam]] connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in Islam. Islam accepts many aspects of Christianity as part of its faith{{snd}}with some differences in interpretation{{snd}}and rejects other aspects. Islam believes the [[Qur'an]] is the final revelation from [[God]] and a completion of all previous revelations, including the [[Bible]].

==== Iranian religions ====
{{Main|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Iranian religions}}

Several important religions and religious movements originated in [[Greater Iran]], that is, among [[Iranian peoples|speakers of various Iranian languages]]. They include [[Mithraism]], [[Ætsæg Din]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Yarsanism|Ahl-e Haqq]], [[Zurvanism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Manichaeism]], and [[Mazdakism]].

[[Gautama Buddha]] is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of Hinduism. Most Hindus believe the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] accepted and incorporated many tenets of Hinduism in his doctrine, however, Buddhists disagree and state there was no such thing as Hinduism at the time of Buddha and in fact, "Indeed, it absorbed so many Buddhist traits that it is virtually impossible to distinguish the latter in medieval and later Hinduism."&lt;ref&gt;MLA style:

=== East Asian or Taoic religions ===
[[File:Tao.svg|thumb|150px|The [[Chinese character]] depicting ''[[Tao]]'', the central concept in Taoism]]

{{Main|East Asian religions|East Asian Buddhism}}
{{See also|Tao|De (Chinese)}}

A Taoic religion is a religion, or religious philosophy, that focuses on the [[East Asian]] concept of ''[[Tao]]'' ("The Way"). This forms a large group of religions including [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Jeung San Do]], [[Shinto]], [[I-Kuan Tao]], [[Cheondoism|Chondogyo]], [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]] and [[Cao Dai]]. In large parts of East Asia, [[Buddhism]] has taken on some taoic features.

''Tao'' can be roughly stated to be the flow of the universe, or the force behind the natural order. It is believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered and is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the ''Tao''. The flow of ''[[Ch'i]]'', as the essential energy of action and existence, is compared to the universal order of ''Tao''. Following the ''Tao'' is also associated with a "proper" attitude, morality and lifestyle. This is intimately tied to the complex concept of ''[[De (Chinese)|De]]'', or literally "virtue" or "power." ''De'' is the active expression of ''Tao''.

Taoism and [[Chinese Chán|Ch'an Buddhism]] for centuries had a mutual influence on each other in China, Korea and Vietnam. These influences were inherited by [[Zen Buddhism]] when Ch'an Buddhism arrived in Japan and adapted as Zen Buddhism.

'''''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater''''' ([[1821 in literature|1821]]) is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account written by [[Thomas De Quincey]], about his [[laudanum]]  [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and its effect on his life. The ''Confessions'' was "the first major work De Quincey&lt;!--"De Quincey" is always capitalized--&gt; published and the one which won him fame almost overnight..."&lt;ref&gt;Judson S. Lyon, ''Thomas de Quincey'', New York, Twayne, 1969; p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published anonymously in September and October 1821 in the ''[[London Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''London Magazine'', Vol. IV, No. xxi, pp. 293–312, and No. xxii, pp. 353–79.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Confessions'' was released in book form in 1822, and again in 1856, in an edition revised by &lt;!--De is always capitalized in his case--&gt;De Quincey.

==Synopsis==
As originally published,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater'', edited by Alethea Hayter, New York, Penguin Books, 1971, provides the original magazine text.&lt;/ref&gt; De Quincey's account was organized into two parts:&lt;ref&gt;About the structure of the novel based on paradigms, see (in French)  [[:fr:Yann Tholoniat|Yann Tholoniat]], « Thomas de Quincey et le paradigme perdu ». In ''Lectures d'une œuvre'': Confessions of an English Opium-Eater – Thomas de Quincey. Paris, Éditions du Temps, 2003 : 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I begins with a notice "To the Reader", to establish the narrative frame: "I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life...." It is followed by the substance of Part I,
** ''Preliminary Confessions'', devoted to the author's childhood and youth, and concentrated upon the emotional and psychological factors that underlay the later opium experiences — especially the period in his late teens that De Quincey spent as a homeless runaway in Oxford Street in London in 1802 and 1803.
* Part II is split into several sections:
** A relatively brief introduction and connecting passage, followed by
** ''The Pleasures of Opium'', which discusses the early and largely positive phase of the author's experience with the drug, from 1804 until 1812;
** ''Introduction to the Pains of Opium'', which delivers a second installment of autobiography, taking De Quincey from youth to maturity; and
** ''The Pains of Opium'', which recounts the extreme of the author's opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares, frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms.
* Another "Notice to the Reader" attempts to clarify the chronology of the whole.

[[File:Cover of Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an Opium Eater.JPG|thumb|The cover of Thomas De Quincey's book ''Confessions of an Opium-Eater''. This version was published by the Mershon Company in 1898.]]

Though De Quincey was later criticized for giving too much attention to the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of addiction, ''The Pains of Opium'' is in fact significantly longer than ''The Pleasures''. However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the opium experience:

::"The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &amp;c. were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive. Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100 years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience."&lt;ref&gt;See Alethea Hayter's Penguin edition, pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
From its first appearance, the literary style of the ''Confessions'' attracted attention and comment. De Quincey was well-read in the English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and assimilated influences and models from Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and other writers. Arguably the most famous and often-quoted passage in the ''Confessions'' is the [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] to opium in the final paragraph of ''The Pleasures'':

::"Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for 'the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,' bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed pure of blood...."

De Quincey modelled this passage on the apostrophe "O eloquent, just and mightie Death!" in Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''History of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, pp. 83, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in ''The Pleasures of Opium'', De Quincey describes the long walks he took through the London streets under the drug's influence:

::"Some of these rambles led me to great distances; for an opium-eater is too happy to observe the motions of time. And sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating all the capes and headlands I had doubled in my outward voyage, I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such enigmatical entries, and such sphinx's riddles of streets without thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of porters, and confound the intellects of hackney-coachmen."&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Confessions'' represents De Quincey's initial effort to write what he called "impassioned prose", an effort that he would later resume in ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845) and ''[[The English Mail-Coach]]'' (1849).

==The 1856 revision==
In the early 1850s, De Quincey prepared the first collected edition of his works for publisher James Hogg. For that edition, he undertook a large-scale revision of the ''Confessions'', more than doubling the work's length. Most notably, he expanded the opening section on his personal background, until it consumed more than two-thirds of the whole. Yet he gave the book "a much weaker beginning" and detracted from the impact of the original with digressions and inconsistencies; "the verdict of most critics is that the earlier version is artistically superior".&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

"De Quincey undoubtedly spoiled his masterpiece by revising it... anyone who compares the two will prefer the unflagging vigour and tension of the original version to the tired prosiness of much of the revised one".&lt;ref&gt;Alethea Hayter's Introduction to the Penguin edition, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Confessions'' maintained a place of primacy in De Quincey's literary output, and his literary reputation, from its first publication; "it went through countless editions, with only occasional intervals of a few years, and was often translated. Since there was little systematic study of narcotics until long after his death, De Quincey's account assumed an authoritative status and actually dominated the scientific and public views of the effects of opium for several generations."&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, ''Advice to Opium Eaters'', was published "to warn others from copying De Quincey."&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Berridge and [[Griffith Edwards]], ''Opium and the People: Opiate Use in Nineteenth-Century England'', New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987; p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — [[Francis Thompson]], [[James Thomson (B.V.)|James Thomson]], William Blair, and perhaps [[Branwell Brontë]] — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge and Edwards, p. 53; Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 1860 translation and adaptation, ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, ''[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]'' (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the ''Confessions''. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, pp. 93–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' influenced [[psychology]] and [[abnormal psychology]], and attitudes towards dreams and imaginative literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alethea Hayter]], ''Opium and the Romantic Imagination: Addiction and Creativity in de Quincey, Coleridge, Baudelaire and Others'', revised edition, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, Crucible, 1988; pp. 101–31 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'' also served as inspiration to one of [[Hector Berlioz]]'s most famous pieces, ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The play ''The Opium Eater'' by [[Andrew Dallmeyer]] was also based on ''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'',&lt;ref name=Caper&gt;{{cite web|title=Opium Eater by Andrew Dallmeyer|url=http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|website=Capercaillie Books|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150223180854/http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been published by [[Capercaillie Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsD/dallmeyer-andrew.html|title=ANDREW DALLMEYER|publisher=Doollee The Playwrights Database |date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vagabondproductions.weebly.com/miss-julie-reviews.html|title=Miss Julie Fringe Sell Out show 2012|publisher=Vagabond Productions|date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Vincent Price]] starred in the full-length film ''[[Confessions of an Opium Eater]]'' which was a reimagining of De Quincey's ''Confessions'' by Hollywood producer [[Albert Zugsmith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">The '''Conscientious Objector Support Group''' (COSG), a support group to [[conscientious objectors]] (COs) in [[South Africa]], was formed in 1978. The organisation grew in the context of [[South African resistance to war]], at the time of [[Apartheid]].
COs at the time included those who openly refused to report to the Military, once conscripted, those who were sometimes referred to as [[draft dodger]]s, and in due course those who were doing statutory community service.

== Community service under the 1983 amendment to the Defence Act ==
A 1993 amendment to the South African [[South African Defence Act|Defence Act]] provided for substitute service outside the armed forces for COs complying with certain requirements.
The amendment was drafted at a time when the State was under increasing pressure to address the situation of COs. One of these pressures was the increased number of COs in prison or military barracks. For example, in 1982 there were 263 COs serving sentences in military detention barracks. 
The 1983 amendment provided for the first time for a form of alternative service, although for a punitively long period of three times the military service.

Conscripted military service at that time consisted of two years full-time service, followed by 'camps'. The latter were annual  call-ups for short-term periods of about a month, though not everyone was called every year. For those who had not done any military service, the Act provided for a six-year period of community service. For those who had done the initial military service and objected only to the camp component, the requirement was three years duty.

This amendment recognised COs only if they were religious pacifists, even if they did not belong to the so-called '[[peace churches]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Aletta J. Norval, Deconstructing Apartheid Discourse, p 262.&lt;/ref&gt; COs had to appear before a [[Board for Conscientious Objection]] sitting in [[Bloemfontein]], which ruled on whether they complied with the requirements of the Act. 
Those who were accepted by the Board as COs were placed in community service under the administration by the then [[Department of Manpower]]. Typical places for service were hospitals and the civil service generally. The decision was made by the authorities, though the CO was permitted to express his preferences. (Military service only applied to white males.)

In [[semantics]], '''contrast''' is a relationship between two discourse segments.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==On contrast==

Contrast is often overtly marked by markers such as ''but'' or ''however'', such as in the following examples:

# It's raining, ''but'' I am not taking an umbrella.
# We will be giving a party for our new students. We won't, ''however'', be serving drinks.
# The student knew about the test on Friday, ''but'' still he did not study.

In the first clause, ''It's raining'' implies that the speaker knows the weather situation and so will prepare for it, while the second clause ''I am not taking an umbrella'' implies that the speaker will still get wet. ''Both clauses'' (or [[discourse]] segments) refer to related situations, or themes, yet imply a contradiction. It is this relationship of comparing something similar, yet different, that is believed to be typical of contrastive relations. The same type of relationship is shown in (2), where the first sentence can be interpreted as implying that by giving a party for the new students, the hosts will serve drinks. This is, of course, a defeasible inference based on world knowledge, that is then contradicted in the following sentence.

The majority of the studies done on contrast and contrastive relations in [[semantics]] has concentrated on characterizing exactly which semantic relationships could give rise to contrast.  Earliest studies in semantics also concentrated on identifying what distinguished clauses joined by ''and'' from clauses joined by ''but''.

In discourse theory, and computational discourse, contrast is a major [[discourse relation]], on par with relationship like ''explanation'' or ''narration'', and work has concentrated on trying to identify contrast in naturally produced texts, especially in cases where the contrast is not explicitly marked.

{{anchor|phonology}}
In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], 'contrast' is identified, when two linguistic elements occur in the same environment(s), and replacing one with the other creates a difference in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kroeger|first=Paul|title=Analyzing Grammar: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-01653-7|pages=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSglHbBaNyAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two elements that contrast in identical environments make a [[minimal pair]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">'''Cosmoglottics''' is a science that investigates world languages (or, [[universal language]]s); more specifically about universal artificial languages, its study and construction.

Cosmoglottics derives its name from the first planned language of Volapṻk and Esperanto. ''Volapṻk'' means "world speech" and is reflected in the German term ''Kosmoglosse,'' where ''kosmo''  refers to "world" instead of "universe", giving rise to ''cosmoglottics''. 

Sergey N. Kuznetsov makes an opposition between cosmoglottics, the science about universal planned language, and [[interlinguistics]], the science about international languages and communication, founded by [[Otto Jespersen]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlinguistics: Aspects of the Science of Planned Languages|last=Schubert|first=Klaus|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=3110886111|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entertainment technology''' is the discipline of using manufactured or created components to enhance or make possible any sort of [[entertainment]] experience.  Because entertainment categories are so broad, and because entertainment models the world in many ways, the types of implemented technology are derived from a variety of sources.  Thus, in theatre, for example, entertainment technology practitioners must be able to design and construct [[scenery]], install electrical systems, build clothing, use motors if there is [[scenery automation]],{{clarify|date=January 2018}} provide plumbing (if functioning kitchen fixtures are required, or if "singing in the rain"), etc. In this way, the entertainment technology field intersects with most other types of technology.

Traditionally, entertainment technology is derived from theatrical [[stagecraft]], and stagecraft is an important subset of the discipline. However, the rise of new types and venues for entertainment, as well as rapidly advancing technological development, has increased the range and scope of its practice.

Entertainment technology includes:

*[[Scenery]] [[Manufacturing|fabrication]]
*[[Theatrical property|Properties]]
*[[Costume]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Sound]]
*[[Video]]
*[[Show control]]
*[[Automation]]
*[[Animatronics]]
*Interactive environments
*[[Computer simulation]]

In animation and game design, the phrase "entertainment technology" refers to a very real world of [[entertainment]] experiences made possible by the advent of primarily computer-mediated digital technologies.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

== History ==
Entertainment Technology can be traced back to the “Pre-digital Age.” The invention of the first phonograph machine, which is used to record and playback sound, dates back to 1877 by inventor Thomas Edison. There has been a significant progression from that antiquated modality of entertainment. From silent films (which also gave way to the art of creative storytelling using moving pictures) to the digital age, in which we now see growth on a global scale and, relative to earlier inventions, an extremely fast pace. By comparison, from the invention of the phonograph machine in 1877 to the invention of the first motion picture camera by Louis Lumiere in 1895 shows a gap of 18 years between significant entertainment technology inventions. Whereas compact discs were introduced in the 1980’s and within the next 10 years, satellite television was introduced. More recent developments in entertainment technology are sometimes considered to be a “race” in terms of which company will develop and distribute their product first. Knowing what we have available to us and where it all began can be used as a footnote in our ever-increasing development of entertainment and other technological advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182692|title=IEEE Xplore Full-Text PDF:|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on Society ==
Society has completely been changed and advanced in many different ways by all the advancements in entertainment technology. Ranging from how companies get their product name out and get customers to buy into that product, to how people come into contact with one another and how we converse. Media and entertainment have become such a huge part of everyone’s life. We are all invested in some kind of media whether it is a tv show or a vlog and the producer of those are all very aware of the consumption of their product and will try to advertise it in as many ways as possible. They will reach out and promote their form of entertainment by having it on multiple platforms. Media companies will share their product on many different popular websites and forms of social media and ask its consumers to share it as well, generating more views and continuously advancing their products notoriety. Millions of dollars have been spent on Artificial Intelligence. Companies use AI because it is so detailed and precise with all of its obtained knowledge, they will use it to help market their brand because AI knows exactly what people like and what they want to see and will put together the final product that will succeed the most. Entertainment websites and websites that sell goods maintain and expand their viewers and customers by advertising something new you haven’t seen before when you are done with what you originally visited the website for. A big reason why a company became so successful and became so popular is that they bundled everything people want into a smaller collection, instead of having a much larger bundle that only included a couple items a consumer wants. Virtual reality is giving us a new way to experience the world. You can travel to see your favorite live event anywhere in the world without even having to leave your house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/04/25/top-six-digital-transformation-trends-in-media-and-entertainment/#311c80936729|title=Top Six Digital Transformation Trends In Media And Entertainment|last=Newman|first=Daniel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-bringing-tv-life-digital-video-transformation-strategies|title=Digital Transformation in Media and Entertainment - Accenture|website=www.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples  ==

===== Virtual Reality =====
A three dimensional, computer generated simulation of a real seeming environment brought on by the use of special electronic equipment. This technology is used to replace the user’s entire real world environment with a computer generated (or simulated) one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.Overview.html|title=VIRTUAL REALITY - Overview|website=archive.ncsa.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Augmented Reality   =====
An interactive technology that intertwines computer generated images with real world objects. These artificial images can align with or block the real world environment. This technology is used to alter the user’s perception of the real world which should not to be confused with virtual reality in which the user’s whole perception is changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/augmented-reality.html|title=Augmented Reality - definition of Augmented Reality, Meaning of Augmented Reality, BuzzWord from Macmillan Dictionary.|website=www.macmillandictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== High Dynamic Range =====
A rich visual and audio experience that provides a greater contrast than standard dynamic range. This technology is most associated with display devices, sound recording, 3D rendering, and photography. Technology like this provides a more lifelike image in the visual aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/dynamic-range.htm|title=Understanding Dynamic Range in Digital Photography|website=www.cambridgeincolour.com|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Light Field Devices   =====
A device (usually a camera) that captures information about the light field that is emerging from a real life scene which is; the direction of the light rays in space and the intensity of the light in the actual environment/scene. This technology will someday surpass Virtual Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117075834/http://www.time4.com/time4/microsites/popsci/howitworks/lightfield_camera.html|title=PopSci's How It Works - 100 Megapixel Camera|date=2008-01-17|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Developments ==
Video streaming is becoming a huge part of society in this day and age and it’s only beginning to expand. Video streaming brought in a revenue of $30.29 billion in 2016 and based on projections conducted by Research and Markets, will reach an astonishing $70.05 billion in the year 2021. This projected drastic increase has caused there to be more competition in streaming, which has led to rapid growth, development, and a large increase in the amount of users. Technology is a data based driven field, and with this rapid growth the future is bright for this field. Technology has been enhancing discoveries for as long as it’s been invented. It holds the digital power to entertain, inform, and persuade. Technology will continue to provide all of these sentiments and will continue to do so for as long as developments keep forthcoming. Rapid growth and development does not only affect the consumers, but the producers. Large technology companies will have improve content quality of all while extracting maximum value of the product. Challenges for development in the media industry are how to maximize content, brands, and advertising. While also created tailoring consumers needs to enhance their experience. Consumers drive this field, companies are constantly running data about consumers preferences, relationships, habits, and locations. Technology is a growing field and with companies beginning to care more about the consumers, and with rapid growing development in this field, expect technology to take bigger steps forward in years to come.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/media-and-entertainment-industry-outlook-trends.html|title=2018 Media and Entertainment Industry Trends {{!}} Deloitte US|website=Deloitte United States|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-mission/technology-to-shape-the-future-of-media-entertainment-a1e3acd3b3ac|title=Technology to Shape the Future of Media &amp; Entertainment.|last=DataArt|date=2018-01-09|website=Medium|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Schools that offer programs or degrees in entertainment technology include:

* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Entertainment Technology Center]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/ Entertainment Technology Center].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[New York City College of Technology]], Department of Entertainment Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entertainmenttechnology.org/ Entertainment Technology], [[New York City College of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Southern California]], Entertainment Technology Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ Entertainment Technology Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526035103/https://cinema.usc.edu/programs/entertainment-technology-center/ |date=2009-05-26 }}, [[University of Southern California]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tshwane University of Technology]], Pretoria, South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tut.ac.za/ Tshwane University of Technology], South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entertainment Technology Training, New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toiwhakaari.ac.nz/study-at-toi-whakaari/entertainment-technology Entertainment Technology Training], New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the only university offering a degree specifically in Entertainment Engineering and Design (EED) is the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).{{fact|date=January 2018}} Because UNLV's program is in its infancy, current entertainment technologists come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds, the most prevalent of which are theater and mechanical technology. Several other institutions of higher education offer similar programs for entertainment-related ventures.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

A bachelor's degree in these areas will typically have a difference of only a few specialized classes.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Traditionally, people interested in careers in this field either presented themselves as apprentices within craft unions, or attended college programs in theatre technology. Although both are appropriate in limited ways, the growing world of entertainment technology encompasses many different types of performance and display environments than the theatre. To this end, newer opportunities have arisen that provide a wider educational base than these more traditional environments. An article "Rethinking Entertainment Technology Education" by John Huntington describes new teaching philosophies that resonate with the need for a richer and more flexible educational environment:&lt;ref name="huntington02"&gt;{{cite journal

{{quote|"We need to bridge the worlds of ivory-tower theatre education with the commercial world of live entertainment production. I believe this bridge would be beneficial not just to the technical students, but to the whole art of performance. When high-tech systems such as video, moving lights, computerized sound, mechanized scenery and show control are mastered by even average entertainment technicians, they can advance the state of their craft, which will allow artists to advance the state of their art."&lt;ref name="huntington02" /&gt;}}

'''''Everybody's Magazine''''' was an American magazine published from 1899 to 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Everybody's Magazine|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/USAeverybodys.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=William Hard|title=Unemployment as a Coming Issue|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/alablegr2&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|work=Hein Online|accessdate=19 February 2016|date=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded by [[Philadelphia]] merchant [[John Wanamaker]] in 1899, though he had little role in its actual operations.&lt;ref name="mott1"&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott|Mott, Frank Luther]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ERGJfgsppfgC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sketches of 21 Magazines: 1905-1930], p. 72-87 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Initially, the magazine published a combination of non-fiction articles and new fiction stories.  By 1926, the magazine had become a [[pulp fiction magazine]] and in 1929 it merged with ''[[Romance (magazine)|Romance magazine]].

In 1903, it had a circulation of 150,000, and Wanamaker sold the magazine for $75,000 to a group headed by [[Erman Jesse Ridgway]].  A series of muckraking articles called "Frenzied Finance" in 1904 boosted circulation to well over 500,000, and it stayed above the half million mark for many years.  During America's involvement in World War I, circulation declined below 300,000.  By the late 1920s, it had declined to about 50,000.&lt;ref name="mott1"/&gt;

Beginning in 1915, the magazine began referring to itself simply as ''Everybody's''.

Writers who appeared in ''Everybody's Magazine'' included [[Jack London]], [[Talbot Mundy]], [[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Victor Rousseau]], [[O. Henry]], [[A. A. Milne]] (Milne's novel ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' was serialised in the magazine from August to December 1921 as ''The Red House Murder'')&lt;ref&gt;Ed Hulse, ''The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Collecting Pulps''. Murania Press, 2009. {{ISBN|0-9795955-0-9}}  (pp. 168-169)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Pendexter]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Raoul Whitfield]] and [[Dornford Yates]].

The last issue of ''Everybody's Magazine'' was published in March 1929.&lt;ref name="spar"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3413">'''GeoTIFF''' is a [[public domain]] [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] standard which allows [[Georeference|georeferencing]] information to be embedded within a [[TIFF]] file. The potential additional information includes [[map projection]], [[coordinate system]]s, [[ellipsoid]]s, [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]s, and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file.  The GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with TIFF 6.0, so software incapable of reading and interpreting the specialized metadata will still be able to open a GeoTIFF format file.&lt;ref&gt;Sk.

Retrieved on 2017-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to the "inlined" TIFF geospatial metadata is the [[World file|*.tfw World File]] [[sidecar file]] format which may sit in the same folder as the regular TIFF file to provide a subset of the functionality of the standard GeoTIFF described here.

The GeoTIFF format was originally created by Dr. Niles Ritter while he was working at the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruth, Mike (February 2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4586">'''Geolinguistics''' has been identified by some as being a branch of [[linguistics]] and by others as being an offshoot of [[language geography]] which is further defined in terms of being a branch of [[human geography]]. When seen as a branch of linguistics, geolinguistics may be viewed from more than one linguistic perspective, something with research implications.

==Conservative geolinguistic perspectives==
One academic tradition with regard to geolinguistics as a branch of linguististics gives open recognition to the role map-making can play in linguistic research by seeing the terms dialect geography,&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colfa.utsa.edu/nwav39/workshops/geolx.pdf|format=PDF|title=Workshop Proposal: Geolinguistics |website=Colfa.utsa.edu|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[language geography]]&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; and linguistic geography&lt;ref name="utsa.edu"/&gt; as being synonymous with geolinguistics. This identification of geolinguistics with linguistic map-making appears across a range of languages, including Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aconf.org/conf_44779.The_Third_International_Conference_on_Chinese_Geolinguistics.html|title=The Third International Conference on Chinese Geolinguistics |website=Aconf.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French, Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.doshisha.ac.jp/~cjtl210/data1/34_oonishi.pdf|format=PDF|language={{jp icon}}|title=国立国語研究所 時空間変異研究系|website=Doshisha.ac.jp|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genhis.philol.msu.ru/article_197.shtml|title=Геолингвистика |trans-title=Geolinguistics |author=S.N. Kuznetsov |website=Genhis.philol.msu.ru|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish. In German, in addition to an identification of geolinguistics with the terms Sprachgeographie (language geography) and Dialektgeographie (dialect geography), the term Areallinguistik (area linguistics) appears as also being synonymous.

==Academic societies exhibiting conservative use of the term geolinguistics==
Two important [[geolinguistic organizations]] exist whose naming and/or translation practices imply a certain recognition of the traditional importance that dialectologists have attached to the role of language map-making as a tool for linguistic analysis. They are the ''Asian Geolinguistic Society of Japan'' and, in Europe, ''The International Society for Dialectology and Geolinguistics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geo-linguistics.org|title=SIDG|website=Geo-linguistics.org|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An expansive geolinguistic perspective==
A second linguistic tradition is that of [[The American Society of Geolinguistics]] which interprets geolinguistics to be "An academic discipline involving the analysis and implications of the geographical location, distribution and structure of language varieties within a temporal framework, either in isolation or in contact and/or conflict with one another, being originally conceived of by Mario Pei as being a branch of linguistics which would be used to do objective-oriented research on real life language issues and where interdisciplinary approaches would be acceptable."&lt;ref name="ASG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/geolinguistics-information/mission-statement|title=Geolinguistics Information - Mission Statement|website=American Society of Geolinguistics|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Society's mission statement mentions the gathering and disseminating of "up-to-date knowledge concerning the world`s present-day languages, dialects, and other language varieties in the context of their distribution and use, their relative practical importance, their perceived usefulness and actual availability from economic, political and cultural standpoints, their genetic, historical and geographical affiliations and relationships, and their identification and use in spoken and written form".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt; It also states the Society's interest in "linguistic geography, languages in contact and conflict, language planning and policy, language education and the broader aspects of sociolinguistics".&lt;ref name="ASG"/&gt;

'''Henry Winder''' (15 May 1693 – 9 August 1752) was an [[English people|English]] [[nonconformist]] minister and [[chronologist]].

==Life==

The son of Henry [[Winder (surname)|Winder]] (d. 1733), farmer, by a daughter of Adam Bird of [[Penruddock]], he was born at Hutton John, parish of [[Greystoke, Cumbria|Greystoke]], Cumberland, on 15 May 1693. His grandfather, Henry Winder, farmer, who lived to be over a hundred (he was living in 1714), was falsely charged with murdering his first-born son.&lt;ref&gt;The accusation was supported by two of his wife's sisters, and the case attained some celebrity (see Winder, ''Spirit of Quakerism'', 1698, and ''Penitent Old Disciple'', 1699, 16mo; Audland, ''Spirit of Quakerism Cloven-footed'', 1707, drawn up by Henry Winder secundus, and prefaced by [[Thomas Dixon (nonconformist)|Thomas Dixon]]; on the other side, Coole, ''Quakers Cleared'', 1696; Camm, ''Old Apostate'', 1698, ''Truth prevailing with Reason'', 1706, and ''Lying-Tongue Reproved'', 1708).&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Winder, the grandson, after passing through the Penruddock grammar school under John Atkinson, entered (1708) the Whitehaven Academy under [[Thomas Dixon (nonconformist)|Thomas Dixon]], where [[Caleb Rotheram]] and [[John Taylor (dissenting preacher)|John Taylor]] were among his fellow students. For two years (1712–14) he studied at [[Dublin]] under [[Joseph Boyse]] In Dublin he was licensed to preach.

In 1714 he succeeded [[Edward Rothwell]] as minister of the independent congregation at [[Tunley, Lancashire|Tunley]], [[Lancashire]], and was ordained at [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helen's]] on 11 September 1716, [[Christopher Bassnett]] preaching on the occasion. In 1718 (his first sacrament was 16 November) he was appointed minister of [[Castle Hey]] congregation, Liverpool. The first entry in the extant minutes of the [[Warrington]] classis (22 April 1719) records his admission to that body, ‘upon his making an acknowledgment of his breaking in upon the rules of it, in the way &amp; manner of his coming to Liverpoole.’ A strong advocate of non-subscription in the controversy then active both in England and in Ireland, he brought round his congregation to that view. His ministry was successful; a new chapel was built for him in Benn's Garden, Red Cross Street, and opened in July 1727. From 1732 he corresponded with the London dissenters, with a view to the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts.

He married the widow of William Shawe of Liverpool, and educated her son William Shawe, afterwards of Preston. On taking him in 1740 to study at [[Glasgow]], he received the diploma of D.D.

In September 1746 he had a stroke of paralysis, and never again entered the pulpit, though he preached twice from the reading-desk in January 1747, and occasionally assisted at the sacrament in that year. John Henderson (d. 4 July 1779), who took Anglican orders in 1763, and was the first incumbent of St. Paul's, Liverpool, became his assistant and successor. Winder's faculties failed, and he died on Sunday 9 August 1752. He was buried on the south side of the churchyard of St. Peter's, Liverpool (now the cathedral); the memorial stone was earthed over when the churchyard was laid out as a garden. Henderson preached his funeral sermon. He outlived his wife, and left no issue.

His library (a remarkable one, with a valuable collection of tracts) and manuscripts were bequeathed to his congregation. The library was transferred to [[Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel]], to which the congregation moved in 1811. An important letter (now lost) giving an account (6 August 1723) of the non-subscription debates in the [[Belfast]] sub-synod, which Winder had attended as a visitor, was printed in the ''[[Christian Moderator]]'', October 1827 (p.&amp;nbsp;274), from a copy by [[John Scott Porter]], then minister at Toxteth Park chapel, Liverpool.

==Works==
For young Shawe's use he had drawn up (about 1733), but did not publish, ‘a short general system of chronology’ on ‘the Newtonian plan.’ This was the germ of his bulky work, the result of twelve years' labour, ‘A Critical and Chronological History of the Rise, Progress, Declension, and Revival of Knowledge, chiefly Religious. In two Periods. I. … Tradition, from Adam to Moses. II. … Letters, from Moses to Christ,’ 1745, 2 vols. (dedication to William Shawe). He prefers [[Moses]] to all secular historians, as earlier and more authentic. In vol. ii. chap. xxi. § 3, is a eulogy of British liberties, with evident reference to the events of 1745, during which Winder had helped to raise a regiment for the defence of Liverpool. The work did not sell, and was reissued as a second edition in 1756, with new title-page, and ‘Memoirs’ of the author by [[George Benson (theologian)|George Benson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8325">In [[linguistics]], '''heterography''' is a property of a written language, such that it lacks a [[Bijection|1-to-1 correspondence]] between the written symbols and the sounds of the spoken language.&lt;ref name=Trask1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology|article=heterography|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|pages=170|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9780415112611|authorlink=Larry Trask}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2010}} Its opposite is '''homography''', which is the property of a language such that written symbols of its written form and the sounds of its spoken form have a 1-to-1 correspondence.&lt;ref name=Trask2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology|article=homography|author=Robert Lawrence Trask|pages=172|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=9780415112611|authorlink=Larry Trask}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=March 2010}}

The [[English orthography|orthography of the English language]] is, according to [[Larry Trask]], a "spectacular example" of heterography.  But most European languages exhibit it to some extent. [[Finnish language|Finnish]] is "very close" to being a systematically homographic language.&lt;ref name=Trask1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Trask2 /&gt;  A phonemic transcription (such as a transcription of [[phoneme]]s that uses the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], for example) is, by its nature, homographic, also.&lt;ref name=Trask2 /&gt;

The degree of heterography of a language is a factor in how difficult it is for person to learn to read that language, with highly heterographic orthographies being more difficult to learn than more homographic ones.  Many people have espoused the point of view that the extreme heterographic nature of English is a disadvantage in several respects.  These include, for example, Dr. Kiyoshi Makita writing in the July 1968 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]'', who attributes the rarity of [[dyslexia]] amongst Japanese children to the fact that [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is highly homographic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concept and Methods of Special Education|author=Vijay Pratap Singh|chapter=The Poor Speller and Reader|pages=261|publisher=Sarup &amp;amp; Sons|isbn=81-7625-450-9|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion between heterographic [[homophone|homophonic]] words ('''homophonic heterographs''' or '''heterographic homophones''') such as "[[wikt:piece#English|piece]]" and "[[wikt:peace#English|peace]]" is one of the symptoms of [[surface dyslexia]], a form of dyslexia causing error when a word's spelling is not perceived to be in accord with pronunciation rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication Disorders in Spanish Speakers|editor1=José G. Centeno |editor2=Raquel Teresa Anderson |editor3=Loraine K. Obler |pages=235|chapter=Description and Detection of Acquired Dyslexia and Disgraphia in Spanish|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2007|isbn=9781853599712|author=J. Carolina Iribarren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other homophonic heterographs in English include:

* "[[wikt:I#English|I]]", "[[wikt:aye#English|aye]]", and "[[wikt:eye#English|eye]]";
* "[[wikt:right#English|right]]", "[[wikt:rite#English|rite]]", "[[wikt:wright#English|wright]]", and "[[wikt:write#English|write]]";
* "[[wikt:read#English|read]]" and "[[wikt:reed#English|reed]]"; and
* "[[wikt:there#English|there]]", "[[wikt:their#English|their]]", and "[[wikt:they#English|they're]]".&lt;ref name=StainthorpHughes /&gt;

In French, examples include "[[wikt:sain#French|sain]]" and "[[wikt:saint#French|saint]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Orthography and Literacy|editor1=R. Malatesha Joshi |editor2=P. G. Aaron |chapter=Orthography and literacy in French|pages=85|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9780805854671|author=Jean-Pierre Jaffr&amp;eacute; and Michel Fayol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterographs are especially problematic for written communication, in that spelling errors (e.g., in a word-processed or emailed document) due to the typist choosing the wrong member of a heterograph set will persist into the final document, even after spell-checking. This is because heterographs cannot be caught by a simple [[spell checker]], which only inspects the word itself (i.e., which is correct in some contexts) and not the context it is in (which may indicate the need for a different spelling).

'''Heterophonic homographs''' (also known as '''homographic heterophones''') are, in contrast, words whose spoken sounds differ but whose written forms are the same.  English has a few hundred heterophonic homographs,&lt;ref name=Higgins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/wordscape/wordlist/graph.html |title=Homographs |author=John Higgins |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples of these latter include "[[wikt:lead#English|lead]]" ("lead by example" vs "[[lead poisoning]]") and "[[wikt:read#English|read]]" ("will read" vs "has read").&lt;ref name=StainthorpHughes&gt;{{cite book|title=Learning from Children who Read at an Early Age|author1=Rhona Stainthorp  |author2=Diana Hughes |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=9|publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis|year=1999|isbn=9780415174954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Higgins/&gt;

The two aforementioned classes of words, along with a third class ('''homophonic homographs'''&amp;mdash;words with different meanings whose written and spoken forms are both the same, such as "[[wikt:bank#English|bank]]" in English and "[[wikt:杜鹃|杜鹃]]" in Chinese) are the three classes of lexical ambiguities in all languages (marked in green in the key on the right).&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite book|title=The handbook of East Asian psycholinguistics|author=Ping Li|pages=273|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780521833332}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Heterophonic heterographs" (marked in brown) are words spelled differently and pronounced differently, consisting of all words outside of the other three classes.

==In other languages==
===Chinese===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] has many words that are both homophonic and homotonic.  Distinctions are made between such words using heterography.&lt;ref name=Yip&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chinese Lexicon|author=Po-ching Yip|pages=16|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=9780415151740}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Homophonic heterographs are very frequent in Chinese, whereas heterophonic homographs are not.&lt;ref name=Li /&gt;  In contrast, homographic heterophony is one of the most salient characteristics of English orthography, with the "-ough" in "[[wikt:though#English|though]]", "[[wikt:tough#English|tough]]", "[[wikt:through#English|through]]", "[[wikt:thought#English|thought]]", "bough", "cough", and "dough"  being homographic but greatly heterophonic.&lt;ref name=ChangeuxChavaillon&gt;{{cite book|title=Origins of the Human Brain|author1=Jean-Pierre Changeux  |author2=Jean Chavaillon |lastauthoramp=yes |page=225|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198523901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French===
Although the French language has homographic heterophony (as in the ''-ars'' ending of ''[[wikt:Mars#French|Mars]]'', ''[[wikt:jars#French|jars]]'', and ''[[wikt:gars#French|gars]]''), perhaps its most prominent irregularity is its heterographic homophony. Speakers of some regional dialects{{which|date=June 2017}} pronounce the following word endings identically: ''-eng'' (as in ''[[wikt:hareng#French|hareng]]''), ''-empt'', ''-amp'', and ''-ans'', ''[[wikt:champ#French|champ]]'', ''[[wikt:exempt#French|exempt]]'', ''[[wikt:dans#French|dans]]''.&lt;ref name=ChangeuxChavaillon /&gt;

'''Human ecosystems''' are [[complex system|complex cybernetic systems]] that are increasingly being used by [[ecological]] [[anthropologists]] and other scholars to examine the ecological aspects of human communities in a way that integrates multiple factors as economics, socio-political organization, psychological factors, and physical factors related to the environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16359">The '''international trade of fine art''' is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique, non-reproducible works by an artist.  The art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good.  It is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece.  Despite existing as a finite physical piece, unique art is still considered intellectual property. This sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons, or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market.

==Decorative art as a trade commodity==

The trade commodities included in the definition of "[[visual art]]" include the following: [[painting]], drawing, [[sculpture]] in various materials, [[printmaking]], [[photography]], maps, [[performance art]], [[installation art]], [[mail art]], [[assemblage art]], [[textile arts]], [[fashion design]], [[video art]], [[digital art]], and product design.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; These works are non-functional, emotional, social, political, traditional, and cultural statements, and in comparison to other goods, are not greatly affected by commercial-sector constraints.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Though visual art is a physical, hand-made good, it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal.  Therefore, art is considered [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The 4-digit [[Standard International Trade Classification]] (SITC) classifies "Works of Art, Collectors Pieces and Antiques" under category 8960, which includes paintings, drawings, pastels, original sculptures, original prints, stamps, and antiques over 100 years old. This is the only SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as "fine" art.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; The 4-digit [[Harmonized System|harmonized commodity]] description and coding system, otherwise known as the harmonized system (HS) code for "fine" art is 9701, which is classified as "Paintings, Drawings and Pastels, Executed Entirely By Hand".&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

==History of international art trade==

The earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to 1464, when [[Pope Pius II]] prohibited the exportation of works of art from the Papal States.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; It wasn’t until the mid-1500s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets.  Previously, local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork, but it couldn’t keep up as the number of artists increased.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;  Consequently, artists exported their works to foreign markets.  Between 1540 and 1670, an average of 144 paintings per year were transported between the [[Netherlands]] and [[New Spain]].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Throughout much of the [[early modern period]], if an artist could not domestically sell his art, he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad.  Starting in the 17th Century, however, most art was traded at the massive auction houses of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] of London, which both still survive today.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Like any other traded good, art has been historically subjected to import duties.  For example, in the more enlightened years of the 19th Century, art escaped high tariffs in America because the government viewed art as an important cultural good.   At other times, though, tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], neutral [[Switzerland]] became the primary trafficker of art on the European continent.  Most "degenerate" works of art that the [[Nazi]] government purged from German museums were sold there, where they largely entered [[black markets]].  Since the war ended, there has been a massive, ongoing effort to recover all of these works.  For fifteen years following the war, 45,000 pieces were returned to France, mostly to Jewish owners.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Today, almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;  Currently, most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as [[eBay]] and [http://Lauritz.com/ Lauritz.com].&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

==Economic theory of art trade==

Fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze, mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers – the "secondary market" – rather than the "primary market" trade between the producer (artist) and the consumer.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;  For example, when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector, the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture.  It is more complicated for economists, then, to capture these transactions in their data.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

[[Comparative advantage]] is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods.   There is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art,&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property.  Additionally, relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the [[marginal cost]] of producing a unit of art, since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences.  But this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism:&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt; a country that is relatively less endowed with art-producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

===Determination of prices===

Traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous, non-differentiated good, which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness.  Since each piece of art is different, and because each piece does not appear on the market very often, the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Economists use the [[hedonic regression]] (HR) estimation method to calculate prices in art.  This is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions, the artist, and the subject matter attended to.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

==Protectionism vs. Liberalization==
 
[[Protectionism]] is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;  Countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad.  America is the largest exporter of artwork in the world, and English speaking countries are especially vulnerable to American imports.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Protectionists view this as a modern form of American [[imperialism]], which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

Protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity.  Australian economist [[David Throsby]] argues that investment in "cultural capital" may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture.&lt;ref name="twelve" /&gt; [[Paul M. Bator]], who helped negotiate and draft the [[UNESCO]] convention on the International Trade of Art, argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones.  He explains in ''The International Trade in Art'' that "art-rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home".&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;


Proponents of [[Economic liberalization|liberalization]] in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt; Reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;   Many special characteristics of cultural products – the lack of rivalry in content, [[economies of scale]], and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration economies]] – enhance the case for opening markets.  Protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices, which detracts from consumer welfare.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The "[[commodification]] objection" is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity, and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;  Those who advocate openness believe that free-market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market.  This argument diametrically opposes Bator’s: free-trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade.&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;

The issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate.  In terms of value transferred, the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics.&lt;ref name="thirteeen" /&gt; More problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport, which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable. By maintaining an open market, liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated.&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;

==Largest countries by total trade in art==

The following tables list the top world import/export values, according to data from the UN Comtrade database using SITC code 8960.  The sums here are greater than those included in HS 9701 (works done exclusively by hand) because the SITC classification includes works such as antiques, stamps, and sculpture that aren’t captured in the HS definition.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

'''Judicial activism''' refers to [[judiciary|judicial]] rulings that are suspected of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of [[judicial restraint]].&lt;ref name="cwolfe"&gt;{{cite book|first = Christopher |last = Wolfe|title = Judicial activism|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn = 0-8476-8531-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OtQu8dnH9coC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=0-8476-8531-4&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KePXbURFud&amp;sig=rMU-TMUfzmUXC6L3MWGKOkIqECk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD3Z_2vZXcAhUPbKwKHXjZD_QQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8476-8531-4&amp;f=false|date = 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of judicial activism and the specific decisions that are activist are controversial political issues. The question of judicial activism is closely related to [[judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]], [[statutory construction]], and [[separation of powers]].

==Etymology==
[[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1947 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kmiec|first=Keenan D.|title=The Origin and Current Meanings of 'Judicial Activism'|journal=Cal. L. Rev.|year=2004|volume=92|pages=1441, 1447|quote=Schlesinger's article profiled all nine Supreme Court justices on the Court at that time and explained the alliances and divisions among them. The article characterized Justices [[Hugo Black|Black]], [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], [[Frank Murphy|Murphy]], and [[Wiley Blount Rutledge|Rutledge]] as the 'Judicial Activists' and Justices [[Felix Frankfurter|Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], and [[Harold Hitz Burton|Burton]] as the 'Champions of Self Restraint.' Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Reed]] and Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] comprised a middle group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has been controversial since its beginning. An article by Craig Green, "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism," is critical of Schlesinger's use of the term; "Schlesinger's original introduction of judicial activism was doubly blurred: not only did he fail to explain what counts as activism, he also declined to say whether activism is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=roger_craig_green "An Intellectual History of Judicial Activism"] Craig Green, August 2008, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before this phrase was first used, the general concept already existed. For example, [[Thomas Jefferson]] referred to the "despotic behaviour" of [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] federal judges, in particular Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWlMgSqhRv4C&amp;pg=PA254 Haines &amp; Sherwood, ''The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government and Politics: 1789–1835'', 1944, p.209]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' defines judicial activism as a "philosophy of judicial decision-making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in "Takings Clause Jurisprudence: Muddled, Perhaps; Judicial Activism, No" DF O'Scannlain, ''Geo. JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Political science professor Bradley Canon has posited six dimensions along which judge courts may be perceived as activist:&lt;ref&gt;Bradley C. Canon – "Defining the Dimensions of Judicial Activism," ''Judicature'', 66.6, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; majoritarianism, interpretive stability, interpretive fidelity, substance/democratic process, specificity of policy, and availability of an alternate policymaker. David A. Strauss has argued that judicial activism can be narrowly defined as one or more of three possible actions: overturning laws as unconstitutional, overturning [[case law|judicial precedent]], and ruling against a preferred interpretation of the constitution.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2015}}

Others have been less confident of the term's meaning, finding it instead to be little more than a rhetorical shorthand. [[Kermit Roosevelt III]] has argued that "in practice 'activist' turns out to be little more than a rhetorically charged shorthand for decisions the speaker disagrees with";&lt;ref name=roosevelt&gt;Kermit Roosevelt, III, ''The Myth of Judicial Activism: Making Sense of Supreme Court Decisions'', Yale University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-300-12691-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-12691-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] under [[George W. Bush]], [[Theodore Olson]], said in an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'', in regards to [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger|a case for same-sex marriage he had successfully litigated]], that "most people use the term 'judicial activism' to explain decisions that they don't like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/transcript/ted-olson-debate-over-judicial-activism-and-same-sex-marriage|title=Ted Olson on Debate Over Judicial Activism and Same-Sex Marriage|work=Fox News Sunday|first=Chris|last=Wallace|first2=Theodore|last2=Olson|date=August 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] has said that, "An activist court is a court that makes a decision you don't like."&lt;ref name="flewis"&gt;Frederick P. Lewis, ''The context of judicial activism: the endurance of the Warren Court legacy in a conservative age'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 1999, {{ISBN|0-8476-8992-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Sedensky, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605163057/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iWhwP-GmuptNw-uw8t8Z_lb1YV2QD9FMQKRG0 Justice questions way court nominees are grilled]," Associated Press, May 14, 2010, accessed May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
{{Globalize/US|date=May 2017}}

Detractors of judicial activism charge that it usurps the power of the elected branches of government or appointed agencies, damaging the rule of law and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]''; [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1039.ZD.html Romer, ''Governor of Colorado, et al. v. Evans et al.'' (94-1039), 517 U.S. 620 (1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of judicial activism say that in many cases it is a legitimate form of [[judicial review]], and that the interpretation of the law must change with changing times.

A third view is that so-called "objective" interpretation of the law does not exist. According to law professor Brian Z. Tamanaha, "Throughout the so-called formalist age, it turns out, many prominent judges and jurists acknowledged that there were gaps and uncertainties in the law and that judges must sometimes make choices."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Z. Tamanaha, ''Beyond the Formalist-Realist Divide: The Role of Politics in Judging'', Princeton University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, any judge's use of [[judicial discretion]] will necessarily be shaped by that judge's personal and professional experience and his or her views on a wide range of matters, from legal and juridical philosophy to morals and ethics. This implies a tension between granting flexibility (to enable the dispensing of justice) and placing bounds on that flexibility (to hold judges to ruling from legal grounds rather than extralegal ones).

Some proponents of a stronger judiciary argue that the judiciary helps provide checks and balances and should grant itself an expanded role to counterbalance the effects of transient [[majoritarianism]], i.e., there should be an increase in the powers of a branch of government which is not directly subject to the electorate, so that the majority cannot dominate or oppress any particular minority through its elective powers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hart Ely, ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, chapters 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars have proposed that judicial activism is most appropriate when it restrains the tendency of democratic majorities to act out of passion and prejudice rather than after reasoned deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Zoldan, "Targeted Judicial Activism," 16 Green Bag 2d 465-66 (2014) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2310915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, they argue that the judiciary strikes down both elected and unelected official action, in some instances acts of legislative bodies reflecting the view the transient majority may have had at the moment of passage and not necessarily the view the same legislative body may have at the time the legislation is struck down. Also, the judges that are appointed are usually appointed by previously elected executive officials so that their philosophy should reflect that of those who nominated them, that an independent judiciary is a great asset to civil society since special interests are unable to dictate their version of constitutional interpretation with threat of stopping political donations.

The '''Karl Jaspers Prize''' or '''Karl-Jaspers-Preis''' is a German [[philosophy award]] named after [[Karl Jaspers]] and awarded by the city of [[Heidelberg]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. It was first awarded in 1983 "for a scientific work of international significance supported by philosophical spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl-Jaspers-Preis|url=http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1149145/index.html|publisher=www.heidelberg.de|accessdate=2 March 2013|quote=Translated from the German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karl Jaspers Prize is endowed with 5,000 euros.

'''Konya''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈkon.ja}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἰκόνιον|Ikónion}}, {{lang-la|Iconium}}) is a major city in south-western edge of the [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolian Plateau]] and is the [[List of cities in Turkey|seventh-most-populous]] city in [[Turkey]] with a metropolitan population of over 2.1 million. &lt;ref name="Turkey: Major cities and provinces"/&gt; Konya is an economically and industrially developed city&lt;ref name=FTTigers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/db1d9cee-7650-11db-8284-0000779e2340.html|title=Financial Times: Reports — Anatolian tigers: Regions prove plentiful|website=Ft.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InvestopediaTigers&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anatolian-tigers.asp|title=Anatolian Tigers|author=root|work=Investopedia|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ZamanTigers&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://us.zaman.com.tr/us-tr/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=3660 |title=Zaman: Anatolian tigers conquering the world |access-date=2013-08-21 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130821181544/http://us.zaman.com.tr/us-tr/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=3660 |archive-date=2013-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the capital of [[Konya Province]].

After its conquest by Turkish tribes, Konya became the capital of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultanate of Rum (Anatolia)]] (1077–1308) and the [[Karamanids]] (13th century–1487).

==Name==
Konya, was known in [[classical antiquity]] and during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] as {{lang|grc|Ἰκόνιον}} (''Ikónion'') in [[List of traditional Greek place names|Greek]] (with regular [[Medieval Greek]] [[Apheresis (linguistics)|apheresis]] ''Kónio(n)'') and as {{lang|la|Iconium}} in [[Latin]]. This name is commonly explained as a derivation from {{lang|grc|εἰκών}} (''[[icon]]''), as an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Greek mythology|legend]] ascribed its name to the "''eikon''" (image), or the "''[[gorgon]]'s ([[Medusa]]'s) head''", with which [[Perseus]] vanquished the native population before founding the city.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321948/Konya|title=Konya|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Note the very real possibility that this is a [[false etymology]], in light of the difference between the initial vowel Ἰ- and the diphthong εἰ-, which were still pronounced decidedly differently in Ancient Greek, and which the explanation does not account for. According to Wikipedia, ''Ikónion'' is merely the Hellenization of an older Luwian name.--&gt; In some historic English texts, the city's name appears as ''Konia'' or ''Koniah''.

==History==
===Ancient history===
[[File:Roman Sarcophagus (6526103787).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hercules]] [[Sarcophagus]] (ca. 250–260 AD) at the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]]]]

Excavations have shown that the region was inhabited during the Late [[Copper Age]], around 3000 BC.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The city came under the influence of the [[Hittites]] around 1500 BC. Later it was overtaken by the [[Sea Peoples]] in around 1200 BC.

The [[Phrygia]]ns established their kingdom in central [[Anatolia]] in the 8th century BC. [[Xenophon]] describes Iconium, as the city was called, as the last city of Phrygia. The region was overwhelmed by [[Cimmerians|Cimmerian]] invaders c. 690 BC. It was later part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], until [[Darius III]] was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333 BC. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death and the town came under the rule of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. During the [[Hellenistic period]] the town was ruled by the kings of [[Pergamon]]. As [[Attalus III]], the last king of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir, he bequeathed his kingdom to the [[Roman Republic]]. Once incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]], under the rule of emperor [[Claudius]], the city's name was changed to Claudioconium, and during the rule of emperor [[Hadrian]]us to Colonia Aelia Hadriana.

According to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the apostles [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] and [[Barnabas]] preached in Iconium during their first [[Missionary journeys of Paul|Missionary Journey]] in about 47–48 AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|13:51|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|14:1–5|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|14:21|NIV}})&lt;/ref&gt; having been persecuted in [[Antioch of Pisidia|Antioch]], and Paul and [[Silas]] probably visited it again during Paul's Second Missionary Journey in about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|16:2|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JryEbmKool0C&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=cities+of+asia+minor+ramsay&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;output=html see William Ramsay, ''Cities of St. Paul'', 315–384]; F. F. Bruce, ''Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free'' Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1977. p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Their visit to the [[synagogue]] of the Jews in Iconium divided the Jewish and [[Gentile|non-Jewish]] communities between those who believed Paul and Barnabas' message and those who did not believe, provoking a disturbance during which attempts were made to [[stoning|stone]] the apostles. They fled to [[Lystra]] and [[Derbe]], cities of [[Lycaonia]]. This experience is also mentioned in the [[Second Letter to Timothy| Second Letter]] to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||2 Timothy|3:10-13|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 19th century American theologian [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that Timothy had been present with Paul in Iconium, Antioch and Lystra.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, A., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm Barnes' Notes on the Bible], accessed 6 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The city became the seat of a bishop, which in ca. 370 was raised to the status of a [[Metropolis of Iconium|metropolitan see]] for [[Lycaonia]], with [[Saint Amphilochius]] as the first metropolitan bishop.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Ikonion |last = Foss |first = Clive |authorlink =  |page =985 |editor-first = Alexander |editor-last = Kazhdan |editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |encyclopedia = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] |location = London and New York |publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1991 |isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian legend, based on the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]], Iconium was also the birthplace of [[Thecla|Saint Thecla]], who saved the city from attack by the [[Isaurians]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

Under the [[Byzantine Empire]], the city was part of the [[Anatolic Theme]]. During the 8th to 10th centuries, the town and the nearby (Caballa) [[Kaballah Fortress]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Gevale Kalesi'') were a frequent target of [[Arabs|Arab]] attacks as part of the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

===Seljuk era===
{{Main article|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate}}
[[File:Ince Minareli Medrese 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ince Minaret Medrese]] (1279) in Konya]]

The [[Seljuk Turks]] first raided the area [[Battle of Iconium (1069)|in 1069]], but a period of chaos overwhelmed Anatolia after the Seljuk victory in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, and the [[Normans|Norman]] mercenary leader [[Roussel de Bailleul]] rose in revolt at Iconium. The city was finally conquered by the Seljuks in 1084.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; From 1097 to 1243 it was the capital of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=498oDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76&amp;lpg=PT76&amp;dq=Konya+1134&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eetN61lCXZ&amp;sig=gte3buxIZIbQEdZAW-eSsb8ww3Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijwriQ9tvdAhUqIMAKHd1tAqk4ChDoAQhDMAs#v=onepage&amp;q=Konya%201134&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly occupied by the [[Crusade]]rs [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (August 1097), and [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (May 18, 1190) after the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)]]. The area was retaken by the Turks.

The name of the town was changed to Konya (in {{lang-fa|قونیه}} ''quniya'') by [[Mesud I]] in 1134.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Mevlana Konya.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Established in 1273, the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mevlevi Order]] and its [[Sufi whirling|Whirling Dervishes]] are among the renowned symbols of Konya and Turkey.]]

Konya reached the height of its wealth and influence in the second half of the 12th century when the Seljuk sultans of Rum also subdued the [[Anatolian beyliks]] to their east, especially that of the [[Danishmends]], thus establishing their rule over virtually all of eastern [[Anatolia]], as well as acquiring several port towns along the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] (including [[Alanya]]) and the [[Black Sea]] (including [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]]) and even gaining a momentary foothold in [[Sudak]], [[Crimea]]. This golden age lasted until the first decades of the 13th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Many [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Persianized Turks]] from [[Persia]] and [[Central Asia]] migrated to Anatolian cities either to flee the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invading Mongols]] or to benefit from the opportunities for educated Muslims in a newly established kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Mango|Mango, Andrew]], ''Discovering Turkey'', Hastings House, 1972, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1220s, the city of Konya was filled with refugees from the [[Khwarezmid Empire]]. Sultan [[Kayqubad I]] fortified the town and built a palace on top of the citadel. In 1228 he invited Bahaeddin Veled and his son [[Rumi]], the founder of the [[Mevlevi order]], to settle in Konya.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1243, following the Seljuk defeat in the [[Battle of Köse Dag|Battle of Köse Dağ]], Konya was captured by the Mongols as well. The city remained the capital of the Seljuk sultans, vassalized to the [[Ilkhanate]] until the end of the century.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

 Mosque and citadel]]&lt;/center&gt;}}

===Karamanid era===
{{Main article|Karamanids}}

Following the fall of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] in 1307, Konya was made the capital of a [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish beylik]] ([[emirate]]); which lasted until 1322 when the city was captured by the neighbouring [[Karamanids|Beylik of Karamanoğlu]]. In 1420, the Beylik of Karamanoğlu fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and, in 1453, Konya was made the provincial capital of [[Karaman Eyalet]].

===Ottoman era===

[[File:Konya carpet.jpg|thumb|upright|16th-century Konya carpet, in the collections of the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[LACMA]]).]]

During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Konya was administered by the [[Şehzade|Sultan's sons (''Şehzade'')]], starting with Şehzade Mustafa and [[Sultan Cem|Şehzade Cem]] (the sons of Sultan [[Mehmed II]]), and later the future Sultan [[Selim II]]. Between 1483 and 1864, Konya was the administrative capital of [[Karaman Eyalet]]. During the [[Tanzimat]] period, as part of the [[vilayet]] system introduced in 1864, Konya became the seat of the larger [[Vilayet of Konya]] which replaced Karaman Eyalet.

===Turkish War of Independence===

Konya had a major [[Turkish Air Force#Initial stages|air base]] during the Turkish War of Independence. In 1922, the Air Force was renamed as the Inspectorate of Air Forces&lt;ref&gt;Turkic:Kuva-yı Havaiye Müfettişliği&lt;/ref&gt; and was headquartered in Konya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=21|title=Bir Hata Oluştu|website=Hvkk.tsk.tr|accessdate=25 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505145921/http://www.hvkk.tsk.tr/EN/IcerikDetay.aspx?ID=21|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utkan Kocatürk, ''Atatürk ve Türkiye Cumhuriyeti tarihi kronolojisi, 1918-1938'', Türk Tarîh Kurumu Basımevi, 1983, p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; The Third Air Wing&lt;ref&gt;Ana Jet Üssü or AJÜ&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1st Air Force Command&lt;ref&gt;Hava Kuvvet Komutanlığı&lt;/ref&gt; is based at the [[Konya Airport|Konya Air Base]].

The western slopes of [[Aravalli range]] in Rajasthan and southern Haryana forms the basin of this river. The drainage pattern is [[Drainage system (geomorphology)#Dendritic drainage pattern|dendritic]].

== Tributaries ==
These west to north-west flowing rivers originate from the western slopes of [[Aravalli range]] in Rajasthan, flow through semi-arid historical [[Shekhawati]] region, drain into southern Haryana.

==Indus Valley Civilisation archaeological findings==
{{See also|Indus Valley Civilisation}}
[[File:Harrapan period earthen ware from village, Hansaka, Rewari District, Haryana, on the bed of Sahibi River.JPG|thumb|300px|Right|Harrapan period earthenware (Pottery) found on the Sahibi riverbed by INTACH-Rewari, at Hansaka village, Rewari District, 2012]]
Archaeological findings on the Sahibi River have confirmed habitations on its banks before the [[Harappa]]n and pre-[[Mahabharata]] periods. Both handmade and wheel-made earthenware dated from 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE has been found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura. [[INTACH]]-Rewari found pottery on the Sahibi riverbed at [[Hansaka]] in the Rewari district. A red stone statue of [[Vamana]] Dev was found in the Sahibi riverbed near Bawal in 2002; the statue is now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, [[Kurukshetra]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Other artifacts discovered in the Sahibi River include arrowheads, fishhooks, appearheads, awls, and chisels.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India from the stone age to the 12th century, Pearson 2009, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification with Vedic rivers ==
{{See also|Drishadvati river}} 
Several modern scholars identify the old [[Ghaggar-Hakra River]] (of which Tangri river is a tributary) as the [[Sarasvati river]] and the [[Sahibi River]] with the [[Drishadvati river]] of [[Vedic period]], on the banks of which [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus-Sarasvati civilisation]] developed. such scholars include Bhargava&lt;ref&gt;"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati River is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati River", Sudhir Bhargava, International Conference, 20–22 Nov. 2009, "Saraswati-a perspective" pages 114–117, [[Kurukshetra University]], Kurukshetra, Organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drishadwati]] River formed one border of the [[Vedic]] state of [[Brahmavarta]] and was mentioned in the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the ''[[Manusmriti]]'', and the ''Brahmin Granths'' texts.

On October 1, 2017, it was announced that Glendon would be the 2018 recipient of the [[Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture]]'s [[Evangelium Vitae Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;https://news.nd.edu/news/mary-ann-glendon-to-receive-2018-evangelium-vitae-medal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
During the 1960 presidential election, the first in which Glendon could vote, she cast her ballot for [[John F. Kennedy]]. For most of her early life she was a Democrat.&lt;ref name="Globe12111996" /&gt;

Glendon supported [[Mitt Romney]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Mary Ann Glendon defends Romney"&gt;{{Cite news | last =Bauman| first =Michelle| title =Mary Ann Glendon defends Romney on religious freedom | publisher =[[Catholic News Agency]] | date =February 10, 2012| url =http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/mary-ann-glendon-defends-romney-on-religious-freedom/ | accessdate =April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also supported Romney's campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

Glendon was a mentor of [[Mike Pompeo]], the incumbent [[United States Secretary of State]], when Pompeo was at Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name="Pompeo Vows to Embrace Diplomacy, but Pledges Tougher Line on Russia

==Notre Dame controversy==
Glendon was selected by the [[University of Notre Dame]] as the 2009 recipient of the school's [[Laetare Medal]] but declined the award due to the university's controversial&lt;ref name="controversy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles_of_faith/2009/03/notre_dame_crit.html|title=Notre Dame criticized over Obama invite|last=Paulson|first=Michael|date=March 21, 2009|work=[[The Boston Globe]] |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision to host [[Barack Obama]] as its commencement speaker and bestow upon him an honorary degree.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/27/ex-vatican-ambassador-declines-medal-notre-dame-commencement-citing-obama/|title=Ex-Vatican Ambassador Declines Medal at Notre Dame Commencement, Citing Obama|date=April 27, 2009|work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of Obama's [[pro-choice]] policies, Glendon considered Notre Dame's decision to be in violation of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]' 2004 pronouncement that Catholic institutions should not give "awards, honors, or platforms" to "those who act in defiance of [Catholic] fundamental moral principles."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2009/04/27/declining-notre-dame-a-letter-from-mary-ann-glendon/|title=Declining Notre Dame: A Letter from Mary Ann Glendon|last=Glendon|first=Mary Ann|date=April 27, 2009|work=[[First Things]]|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glendon also felt that the university was implicitly trying to use her acceptance speech to give the appearance of balance to the event and expressed concern about the "ripple effect" Notre Dame's disregard of the USCCB pronouncement is having on the nation's other Catholic schools.&lt;ref name="letter" /&gt;

She received an award from the [[National Right to Life Committee]] at its Pro-Life Awards Dinner in October.&lt;ref name=LifeNews05052009&gt;{{Cite news| last =Ertelt| first =Steven | title =Pro-Life Harvard Prof Who Rejected Notre Dame Honor Will Get National Award | newspaper =Life News | date =May 5, 2009 | url =http://www.lifenews.com/2009/05/05/nat-5022/ | accessdate =April 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1964 Glendon contracted a civil marriage with an attorney and settled in Chicago. They divorced in 1966. In 1970 she married Edward R. Lev, a labor lawyer.&lt;ref name="Globe12111996" /&gt; They remained together until Lev's death in 2013.&lt;ref name="Globe10062013"&gt;{{cite news

'''''Murray's Family Library''''' was a series of non-fiction works published from 1829 to 1834, by [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]], in 51 volumes. The series editor was [[John Gibson Lockhart]], who also wrote the first book, a biography of [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="JGL"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lockhart, John Gibson|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were priced at five [[shilling]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A.

{{Punctuation marks|※|caption=reference mark}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.
* As an alternative to parenthetical references; it is a simpler way to acknowledge information gained from another source.
* To escape the limitations imposed on the [[word count]] of various academic and legal texts which do not take into account notes. Aggressive use of this strategy can lead to a text affected by "foot and note disease" (a derogation coined by [[John Betjeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Timothy|title=Rupert Brooke: Man and Monument|journal=English|year=1968|volume=17|issue=99|pages=79–84|url=http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/99/79.full.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|doi=10.1093/english/17.99.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Independent'', Thursday 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

The '''Office for Women''' is a department of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] "to deliver policies and programmes to advance gender equality and improve the lives of Australian women"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dpmc.gov.au/office-women Office for Women]. Retrieved on 23 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2013, a number of federal government departments were restructured, including the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] which took responsibility for the Office of the Status of Women.&lt;ref name="acbb"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-criticised-by-both-sides-over-lack-of-senior-women-in-government-20130919-2u182.html |title=Abbott criticised by both sides over lack of senior women in government |author=Judith Ireland |accessdate=21 August 2016 |date=19 September 2013 |newspaper=They Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==
In December 2017, the Office for Women released the report, "Gender Balance on Australian Government Boards Report 2016-17" to show "the Government’s performance against its gender diversity target on Australian Government boards."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/office-women/gender-balance-australian-government-boards-report-2016-17 Gender Balance on Australian Government Boards Report 2016-17]. Retrieved on 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report found that, "On 1 July 2016, the Government set a target of women holding 50% of Australian Government board positions overall, and at least 40% representation of women and 40% representation of men on individual boards. As at 30 June 2017, women held 42.7% of Australian Government board positions. This is the highest outcome since public reporting on the gender balance of Government boards began in 2011. Statistics on new appointments made in 2016-17 show how individual portfolios have progressed towards meeting the target. Of the 729 new appointments made in 2016-17, 46.2% of appointees were women. For seven of the 18 government portfolios, women comprised over 50% of new board appointments during 2016-17." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmc.gov.au/news-centre/office-women/women-fill-more-government-board-positions-ever Women fill more Government board positions than ever before].

{{Wiktionary|philandry}}

'''Philandry''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[men]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Philandry |edition=2nd revised |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philandry |title=Philandry |work=[[WordNet]] |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misandry]]''. Philandry is not to be confused with [[androphilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to men or [[masculinity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[androphobia]]'').

== Etymology ==
''Philandry'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''andro'' (man). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to women (females) are [[philogyny]] for "fondness towards women" and [[misogyny]] for "hatred of women". Parallel terms for humanity in general are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

'''Punta de Chimino''' is a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site in the [[Petexbatún]] region of the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Petén Department|Petén]] in [[Guatemala]]. Occupation at the site dates to the Preclassic and Classic periods of [[Mesoamerican chronology]].&lt;ref name="Demarest 2006, p.124"&gt;Demarest 2006, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt; Punta de Chimino experienced a population surge in the Late Preclassic, followed by a reduction in occupation levels in the Early Classic and another increase in the Terminal Classic when the city became one of the few population centres to survive the political disintegration of the Petexbatún region after the collapse of the kingdom based at [[Dos Pilas]]. The neighbouring city of [[Seibal]] on the [[Pasión River]] appears to have intervened at Punta de Chimino at this time and to have politically dominated the smaller site.

==Location==
The site is located on a peninsula on the western side of Lake Petexbatún.&lt;ref name="SharTrax386"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.386.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Classic a series of defensive ditches were excavated across the base of this peninsula in order to fortify the site.&lt;ref name="SharTrax386"/&gt; The peninsula possessed deep fertile soils overlying [[limestone]] bedrock and gave easy access to the rich aquatic resources of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.101. Demarest 2005, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Punta de Chimino is one of the better investigated sites along the [[Pasión River]] and its tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2005, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located south of the modern town of [[Sayaxché]].&lt;ref name="Velásquez 1994, p.349"&gt;Velásquez 1994, p.349.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Punta de Chimino was first settled in the Middle Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Velásquez 1994, p.359.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Early Preclassic the city had a sizeable population.&lt;ref&gt;Webster 2002, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early Classic population levels at Punta de Chimino decreased from their earlier Preclassic levels, this may represent a shift in population towards nucleated settlements at the nearby Petexbatún cities of [[Tamarindito]] and [[Arroyo de Piedra]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminal Classic economic activity at Punta de Chimino appears to be a reduced continuation of the earlier Classic Period economic activity and shows no sign of any foreign influence that might have caused the [[Classic Maya collapse]]. The site is one of very few locations in the Pasión drainage to have erected major [[Maya architecture|architecture]] during the Terminal Classic, including a [[corbel arch|corbel]]-vaulted temple, large palace platforms and a very large [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2005, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants maintained areas of intensive agriculture protected by the defensive moats and the site became the last centre of elite activity to survive in the Petexbatún, at a time when other cities in the region had been reduced to tiny hamlets among the Classic period ruins.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.115"&gt;Demarest 2005, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; The clay used in two styles of Terminal Classic [[Maya ceramics|ceramics]] from Punta de Chimino was from the same source as that used for [[Seibal]] ceramics, and had very similar styles of decoration.&lt;ref name="Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395"&gt;Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395.&lt;/ref&gt; The stylistic similarities between the two sites indicate that Seibal may well have taken advantage of the political fragmentation of the Petexbatún region in order to take control of Punta de Chimino and exact tribute payment.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Punta de Chimino was probably the last of the Petexbatun capitals to fall when the region fragmented after the defeat of [[Dos Pilas]] by its former vassal Tamarindito.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.409, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence was found by archaeologists that the site had been attacked sometime after AD 760, with the innermost and deepest ditch having a large burnt area scattered with flint spearheads, with more spearheads recovered from the wall lining the top of the ditch.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.412.&lt;/ref&gt; The site declined and was finally abandoned in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest et al 2005, p.552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Postclassic period the site underwent a limited reoccupation by people from the central Petén, whose ceramics showed no continuity with the earlier Petexbatún ceramic styles.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.117"&gt;Demarest 2005, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Punta de Chimino was badly looted in the second half of the 20th century, extensive damage was caused, including the removal of all exposed sculpture at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.394.&lt;/ref&gt; T. Inomata of the Petexbatún Regional Archaeological Project mapped the site in 1989.&lt;ref name="Velásquez 1994, p.349"/&gt; The Project carried out further investigations at Punta de Chimino from 1990 to 1991 and in 1994 under the direction of Claudia Wolley and from 1996 to 1997 under the direction of [[Arthur Demarest]].&lt;ref name="Demarest 2006, p.124"/&gt;

==Site description==
{{Maya civilization}}
The neck of the peninsula was fortified with three moats, one of which was {{convert|12|m|ft}} deep, each moat was topped by a [[palisade]]d wall.&lt;ref name="O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.95"&gt;O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the moats involved the excavation of {{convert|38250|m3|cuft}} of the limestone bedrock, which was then used to build up the ramparts.&lt;ref name="MarGru67"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt; The innermost and deepest moat was flooded to create an artificial island.&lt;ref name="MarGru67"/&gt; The area between these moats was used for intensive agriculture and included box gardens divided by crude stone walls.&lt;ref&gt;O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.95 Demarest 2005, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the excavated box gardens was dated to the Terminal Classic and measured {{convert|6.9|by|3.7|m|ft}} and was {{convert|0.6|m|ft}} deep.&lt;ref name="Quez399"&gt;Quezada et al 1997, p.399.&lt;/ref&gt; The box gardens were probably fertilised with organic material dredged from the swampy area immediately south of the peninsula, with the addition of [[night soil]]s from the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.111"&gt;Demarest 2005, p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of moats and walls that protected the peninsula made Punta de Chimino the best defended site in the entire Maya lowlands.&lt;ref name="O'Mansky &amp; Dunning 2005, p.95"/&gt;

The artificial island created by the excavation of the moats was densely occupied during the Terminal Classic but only one residence was excavated in the area between the moats.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.111"/&gt; The Terminal Classic palaces at the site consisted of wide platforms measuring approximately {{convert|10|by|20|m|ft}} and thickly coated in plaster.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.115"/&gt;

The site is divided into three main groups; the North, East and West Groups, with a Main Plaza and an [[Acropolis]].&lt;ref name="Velásquez 1994, p.349"/&gt;

'''Structure 2''' is a small altar platform to the south of the ballcourt and west of Structure 7. The area around it was used for the placing of altars and [[stele|stelae]]. The structure measures {{convert|6|by|4.5|m|ft}} and is {{convert|1|m|ft}} tall. Structure 2 was virtually destroyed by a looters' trench sunk into the upper section and measuring {{convert|3.2|by|1.8|m|ft}} and deeper than the structure itself. Rescue excavations discovered a variety of small [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] artifacts in the spoil including an [[earspool]], two beads and a necklace with a roughly carved face. Three human bones were also recovered although their original context is unknown. Structure 2 had two phases of construction, both tentatively dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Escobedo 1997, pp.402-403.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 7''' is a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=on}} high [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] on the south side of the Main Plaza. The south and west sides of the pyramid have been damaged by looters. Two burials (Burials&amp;nbsp;4 and&amp;nbsp;8) were found under the pyramid. Structure&amp;nbsp;7 overlies an earlier substructure known as Structure&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;Sub&amp;nbsp;1, the floor of which lies {{convert|2.3|m|ft}} under the summit of the later phase of construction.&lt;ref name="Escobedo 1997, pp.404-405"&gt;Escobedo 1997, pp.404-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 59''' is one of the main structures in the West Group.&lt;ref name="Velas351"&gt;Velásquez 1994, p.351.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 70''' is one of the principal buildings in the West Group.&lt;ref name="Velas351"/&gt; It is a residential structure located to the northwest of the Main Plaza and stands {{convert|4|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="Quez399"/&gt; It was built upon a natural hill that was levelled to form a supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Quez399"/&gt; A Late Classic ceramic incense burner was excavated from the summit of the structure, it was modelled to form the [[Maya sun god|Maya sun deity]] G3.&lt;ref name="Velas351"/&gt; Five low status burials were discovered, four of them interred directly under the floor and one in a crude [[cist]], none of them were accompanied by offerings and all are dated to the Late Classic.&lt;ref name="Quez399"/&gt;

'''Structure 72''' is a large platform located immediately to the east of Structure 70. It measures {{convert|5|by|9.5|m|ft}} and has a base of finely worked stone. The structure was a mid-status residential building dating to the Late Classic and included a kitchen measuring {{convert|4|by|1.8|m|ft}} where more than 600 ceramic fragments were excavated together with animal bones.&lt;ref name="Quez399"/&gt;

'''Structure 76''' is a high platform situated in an open area {{convert|90|m|ft}} west of Structure 7. It has been badly damaged by looters. Rescue excavations by archaeologists uncovered Burial&amp;nbsp;10 at a depth of {{convert|3.3|m|ft}} under the building.&lt;ref name="Escobedo 1997, p.403"&gt;Escobedo 1997, p.403.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure 79''' is a large elite platform grouped with Structures 80 and 81 in the North Group.&lt;ref name="Demarest 1997, p.395"&gt;Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395. Quezada et al 1997, p.400.&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with Seibal-style artifacts and has been dated to the Terminal Classic.&lt;ref name="Demarest 1997, p.395"/&gt;

'''Structure 80''' is in the North Group.&lt;ref name="Quez400"&gt;Quezada et al 1997, p.400.&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the north side of the group comprising Structures 79, 80 and 81. It was a large elite platform associated with Seibal-style artifacts.&lt;ref name="Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395"/&gt; It dates to the Terminal Classic and was completely coated in [[stucco]].&lt;ref name="Quez400"/&gt;

'''Structure 81''' is grouped with Structures 79 and 80 in the North Group.&lt;ref name="Quez400"/&gt; It is also a large elite platform dating to the Terminal Classic associated with Seibal-style artifacts. It was a vaulted building built completely from worked stone, although it has now collapsed.&lt;ref name="Demarest 1997, p.395"/&gt; Excavations under the floor of the building revealed three ceramic vessels associated with animal remains that included [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar]] teeth. A well-preserved decorated vessel was under these and on top of some fragments of human remains, also including teeth.&lt;ref name="Quez400"/&gt;

The '''Ballcourt''' at Punta de Chimino dates to the Terminal Classic. It is the largest yet found in the Petexbatún region and is similar in both size and style to the Terminal Classic ballcourt C-9 at the city of Seibal, on the bank of the Pasión River.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2005, pp.114-115. Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballcourt has open end zones and is unusually large for such a small site, perhaps owing its construction to the political intervention of Seibal.&lt;ref&gt;Velásquez 1994, p.349. Demarest &amp; Escobedo 1997, p.395.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's '''Hieroglyphic Stairway''' was buried under a [[midden]] dating to the Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2005, p.117"/&gt;

===Burials===
'''Burial 4''' was interred in a small [[cist]] measuring {{convert|0.65|by|0.85|m|ft}}, located under Structure&amp;nbsp;7. By the time the cist was excavated it had been practically destroyed by tree roots, scattering the bones. A rough greenstone pendant was associated with the remains, together with a greenstone bead, a tripod plate, a polychrome ceramic bowl and perforated seashells. The burial has been dated to the beginning of the Late Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Escobedo 1997, p.404.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burial 8''' was deposited {{convert|0.54|m|ft}} under the summit of Structure&amp;nbsp;7. It was not placed within a tomb but rather scattered within the infill of the pyramid. Some of the bones showed evidence of burning. The burial was accompanied by an offering of four ceramic vessels, a broken fragment of obsidian knife and a piece of greenstone. One of these was painted with a hieroglyphic text that indicated that it was the ''[[atole]]''-drinking vessel of a lord from the nearby Petexbatún city of Tamarindito. Based on the offerings, Burial&amp;nbsp;8 has been identified as a Late Classic elite status burial.&lt;ref name="Escobedo 1997, pp.404-405"/&gt;

'''Burial 10''' consists of a collapsed vaulted tomb found under Structure&amp;nbsp;76. Various [[chert]] and [[obsidian]] chippings were associated with the tomb, a feature common to many elite burials across the Petén region. The chamber of the tomb measured {{convert|1.2|by|3.6|m|ft}} by {{convert|1|m|ft}} high. The bones of the deceased were well preserved in spite of being fragmented by the collapse of the ceiling. The remains were probably that of an adult male and the body was laid out on its back with the head towards the east. The burial was accompanied by only two offerings consisting of a ceramic bowl and a plate, the style of which date it to the Late Classic sometime between  AD&amp;nbsp;600 and 830.&lt;ref name="Escobedo 1997, p.403"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5459">In [[linguistics]] and  grammar, a '''quantifier''' is a type of [[Determiner (class)|determiner]], such as ''all'', ''some'', ''many'', ''few'', ''a lot'', and ''no'', (but not [[numeral (linguistics)#Identifying numerals|numerals]]){{clarify|reason=Numerals appear not to be determiners, but I'm not sure. Please cross-check by a linguistics expert.|date=August 2014}} that indicates quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthews|first1=P.H.|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of linguistics|date=2014|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=9780199675128|edition=3rd edition.|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199675128.001.0001/acref-9780199675128-e-2771|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantification is also used in logic, where it is a formula constructor that produces new formulas from old ones. 
[[Natural language]]s' determiners have been argued{{cn|reason=By whom?|date=August 2014}} to correspond to [[Quantifier (logic)|logical quantifiers]] at the semantic level.

==Introduction==
All known human languages make use of quantification (Wiese 2004).  For example, in English:
* ''Every'' glass in my recent order was chipped.
* ''Some of'' the people standing across the river have white armbands.
* ''Most of'' the people I talked to didn't have a clue who  the candidates were.
* ''A lot of'' people are smart.

The words in italics are quantifiers. 
There exists no simple way of reformulating any one of these expressions as a conjunction or disjunction of sentences, each a simple predicate of an individual such as ''That wine glass was chipped''.  These examples also suggest that the construction of quantified expressions in natural language can be syntactically very complicated.  For mathematical assertions, the quantification process is syntactically more straightforward.

The study of quantification in natural languages is much more difficult than the corresponding problem for formal languages. This comes in part from the fact that the grammatical structure of natural language sentences may conceal the logical structure. Moreover, mathematical conventions strictly specify the range of validity for formal language quantifiers; for natural language, specifying the range of validity requires dealing with non-trivial semantic problems. For example the sentence "''Someone gets mugged in New York every 10 minutes''" does not identify whether it is the same person getting mugged every 10 minutes, see also [[#Nesting|below]].

[[Montague grammar]] gives a novel formal semantics of natural languages. Its proponents argue that it provides a much more natural formal rendering of natural language than the traditional treatments of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].{{cn|date=August 2014}}

==Nesting==
The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning. While mathematical formal notation requires writing quantifiers in front, thus avoiding ambiguity, problems arise in natural (or mixed) language when quantifiers are also appended:
* "∃''A'': ∀''B'': ''C''" – unambiguous
* "there is an ''A'' such that ∀''B'': ''C''" – unambiguous
* "there is an ''A'' such that for all ''B'', ''C''" – unambiguous, provided that the separation between ''B'' and ''C'' is clear
* "there is an ''A'' such that ''C'' for all ''B''" – it is often clear that what is meant is
:: "there is an ''A'' such that (''C'' for all ''B'')", formally: "∃''A'': ∀''B'': ''C''"
:but it could be interpreted as
:: "(there is an ''A'' such that ''C'') for all ''B''",  formally: "∀''B'': ∃''A'': ''C''"
* "there is an ''A'' such that ''C'' ∀''B''" &amp;mdash; suggests more strongly that the first is meant; this may be reinforced by the layout, for example by putting "''C'' ∀''B''" on a new line.

==History==
[[Term logic]], also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. Term logic treated ''All'', ''Some''  and ''No'' in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the [[alethic modalities]].
Starting with [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s 1885 work, and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 ''[[Principles of Mathematics]]'', quantifiers were introduced into mathematical logic formalism. See [[Quantifier (logic)#History]] for details.

'''Quiripi''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|r|ᵻ|p|iː}},&lt;ref&gt;Salwen (1978:175)&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Quiripi-Unquachog''', '''Quiripi-Naugatuck''', and '''Wampano''') was an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] formerly spoken by the indigenous people of [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|southwestern Connecticut]] and central [[Long Island]],&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;Rudes (1997:1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g72"&gt;Goddard (1978:72)&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Quinnipiac]], [[Metoac|Unquachog]], [[Wangunk|Mattabesic]], [[Podunk people|Podunk]], [[Tunxis]], and [[Paugussett]] (subgroups Naugatuck, [[Potatuck]], [[Weantinock]]). It has been effectively [[Language death|extinct]] since the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;Goddard (1978:71)&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Frank T. Siebert, Jr.]], was able to record a few Unquachog words from an elderly woman in 1932.&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;Rudes (1997:5)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Affiliation and dialects==
Quiripi is considered to have been a member of the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] branch of the Algonquian language family.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mithun (1999:327)&lt;/ref&gt; It shared a number of linguistic features with the other Algonquian languages of southern New England, such as [[Massachusett language|Massachusett]] and [[Mohegan-Pequot language|Mohegan-Pequot]], including the shifting of Proto-Eastern Algonquian *{{IPA|/aː/}} and *{{IPA|/eː/}} to {{IPA|/ãː/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, respectively, and the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of earlier *{{IPA|/k/}} before certain [[front vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard (1978:75)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r27"&gt;Rudes (1997:27)&lt;/ref&gt; There appear to have been two major dialects of Quiripi: an "insular" dialect spoken on Long Island by the Unquachog and a "mainland" dialect spoken by the other groups in Connecticut, principally the Quinnipiac.&lt;ref&gt;Rudes (1997:6-7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costa (2007:116, 119)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestation==
Quiripi is very poorly attested,&lt;ref&gt;Costa (2007:116, 118)&lt;/ref&gt; though some sources do exist. One of the earliest Quiripi vocabularies was a 67-page bilingual [[catechism]] compiled in 1658 by [[Abraham Pierson, the elder]], during his ministry at [[Branford, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mithun (1999:331)&lt;/ref&gt; which remains the chief source of modern conclusions about Quiripi.&lt;ref name="g72" /&gt; Unfortunately, the catechism was "poorly translated" by Pierson,&lt;ref name="g72" /&gt; containing an "unidiomatic, non-Algonquian sentence structure."&lt;ref&gt;Costa (2007:118)&lt;/ref&gt; It also displays signs of dialect mixture.&lt;ref&gt;Costa (2007:116)&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of information on the language include a vocabulary collected by Rev. [[Ezra Stiles]] in the late 1700s&lt;ref&gt;Rudes (1997:4)&lt;/ref&gt; and a 202-word Unquachog vocabulary recorded by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1791,&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt; though the Jefferson vocabulary also shows clear signs of dialect mixture and "external influences."&lt;ref&gt;Costa (2007:120)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, three early hymns written circa 1740 at the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Shekomeko mission near [[Kent, Connecticut]], have been translated by Carl Masthay.&lt;ref&gt;Rudes (1997:2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Linguist [[Blair Rudes]] attempted to reconstitute the phonology of Quiripi, using the extant documentation, comparison with related Algonquian languages, as "reconstructing forward" from [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudes (1997:6)&lt;/ref&gt; In Rudes' analysis, Quiripi contained the following consonant [[phoneme]]s:&lt;ref name="r18"&gt;Rudes (2007:18)&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiripi's vowel system as reconstituted by Rudes was similar to that of the other Southern New England Algonquian languages. It consisted of two short vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}, and four long vowels {{IPA|/aː/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}, and {{IPA|/ʌ̃/}}.&lt;ref name="r18" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5089">'''Robert Jesse Stoller''' (December 15, 1924 – September 6, 1991), was an American [[Professor]] of [[Psychiatry]] at UCLA Medical School and a researcher at the UCLA [[Gender Identity]] Clinic. He was born in [[Crestwood, Yonkers, New York|Crestwood, New York]], and died in [[Los Angeles, California]]. He had [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] training at the [[New Center for Psychoanalysis|Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute]] from 1953 to 1961 with analysis by [[Hanna Fenichel]].

He was the author of nine books, the co-author of three others, and the publisher of over 115 articles.&lt;ref name="green1992"&gt;Robert Jesse Stoller 1924-1991. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'', Aug. 1992; 21(4):337–46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoller is known for his theories concerning the development of [[gender identity]] and the dynamics of sexual excitement. In ''Sex and Gender'' (1968), Stoller articulates a challenge to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] belief in biological [[bisexuality]]. Drawing on his extensive research with [[Transsexualism|transsexuals]] and new advances in the science of sex, Stoller advances his belief in "Primary Femininity," the initial orientation of both biological tissue and psychological identification toward feminine development. This early, non-conflictual phase contributes to a feminine core gender identity in both boys and girls unless a masculine force is present to interrupt the symbiotic relationship with the mother.

Stoller identifies three components in the formation of core gender identity, an innate and immutable sense of maleness or femaleness usually consolidated by the second year of life: 
#Biological and hormonal influences;
#Sex assignment at birth and 
#Environmental and psychological influences with effects similar to imprinting.

Stoller asserts that threats to core gender identity are like threats to sense of self and result in the defenses known as the perversions. 

In his most notable contribution, ''Perversion'' (1975), Stoller attempts to illuminate the dynamics of sexual [[perversion]] which he fights valiantly to [[Normalization (sociology)|normalize]]. Stoller suggests that perversion inevitably entails an expression of unconscious aggression in the form of revenge against a person who, in early years, made some form of threat to the child's core gender identity, either in the form of overt trauma or through the frustrations of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal conflict]].

In ''Sexual Excitement'' (1979), Stoller finds the same perverse dynamics at work in all sexual excitement on a continuum from overt aggression to subtle fantasy. In focusing on the unconscious fantasy, and not the behavior, Stoller provides a way of analyzing the mental dynamics of sexuality, what he terms "erotics," while simultaneously de-emphasizing the pathology of any particular form of behavior. Stoller does not consider [[homosexuality]] as a monolithic behavior but rather as a range of sexual styles as diverse as [[heterosexuality]].

Less well known is Stoller's contribution toward making psychoanalysis a legitimate research tool through the publication of the analyst's data - verbatim notes and transcripts of interviews. Stoller melds the work of the [[ethnography|ethnographer]] and the analyst as a means of producing scientifically valid psychological data. Many of Stoller's books, like ''Splitting'' (1973), are devoted to the documentation of the interviews on which he based his research.

Stoller died in a traffic accident near his home.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;Goleman, Daniel (September 10, 1991).

'''Sam Bass''' (July 21, 1851 ‒ July 21, 1878) was a 19th-century American [[American frontier|Old West]] [[Train robbery|train robber]] and [[outlaw]]. He was part of a gang that robbed a train of $60,000. After forming his own gang, however, he never had similar success. He died as a result of wounds received in a gun battle with [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]].

==Early life==
Samuel Bass was born in [[Mitchell, Indiana|Mitchell]], [[Indiana]], on July 21, 1851. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Life of crime==
{{main|Union Pacific Big Springs robbery}}

After failing at a series of legitimate enterprises, Bass turned to crime. He joined a gang that robbed the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] gold train from [[San Francisco]] on September 18, 1877. The gang intercepted the train at [[Big Springs, Nebraska]]. The robbery netted the gang $60,000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Shortly afterward, Bass formed his own gang (in Texas), which staged a string of robberies.  In 1878, the gang held up two [[stagecoach]]es and four trains within 25 miles of [[Dallas]].  They became the object of a manhunt by [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] agents and a special company of the Texas Rangers headed by Captain Junius Peak.

==A trap is set==
[[Image:Sam bass tombstone.jpg|thumb|Tombstone marking the grave of Sam Bass, Round Rock Cemetery, [[Round Rock, Texas]] ]]
Bass was able to elude the Texas Rangers until a member of his gang, Jim Murphy, turned informant. Mr. Murphy's father, who was very ill at the time, had been taken into custody and held for questioning. He was not allowed to be seen by a doctor and was prevented from receiving medical treatment, which caused his condition to rapidly worsen. Lawmen sent a message to Murphy informing him that they had his father in custody, and that if Murphy did not agree to meet with them, they would continue to withhold medical treatment from the father. Knowing how sick his father was, Murphy agreed to the meeting. There, he reluctantly agreed to turn informant. [[John B. Jones]] was subsequently notified of Bass's movements and set up an ambush at [[Round Rock, Texas]], where Bass and the gang planned to rob the Williamson County Bank.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Shootout and death==
On July 19, 1878, Bass and his gang were scouting the area before the robbery. When they bought some tobacco at a store, they were noticed by [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]] Deputy Sheriff A. W. Grimes. When Grimes approached the men to request that they surrender their sidearms, he was shot and killed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} As Bass attempted to flee, he was shot by Texas Rangers George Herold and Sergeant Richard Ware. [[Soapy Smith]] and his cousin, Edwin, witnessed Ware's shot. Soapy exclaimed, "I think you got him!"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeff (2009). ''Alias Soapy Smith: The Life and Death of a Scoundrel'', Klondike Research. pp. 30-32. {{ISBN|0-9819743-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting note to all of this is the fact that no one in Round Rock, nor any of the visiting Texas Rangers, except Jim Murphy, knew what any of the Bass gang looked like. In fact, after Seaborne Barnes was killed and lay in the street, Ware had to have Murphy identify the body, as no one else knew who the man was.  Ware himself stated that he had seen the same three men earlier in town crossing the street to enter the dry goods store, but in fact did not recognize them as the Bass gang.  

Bass was later found lying in a pasture west of Round Rock by Williamson County Deputy James Milton Tucker. More specifically, Bass had to call out to the posse as they were in fact about to ride by him, shouting, "Hey I'm over here.  I'm Sam Bass, the one you are looking for."  He was taken into custody and died the next day on July 21, 1878, his 27th birthday.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Bass was buried in Round Rock in what is now known as Round Rock Cemetery.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} His grave is now marked with a replacement headstone—as the original suffered at the hands of souvenir collectors over the years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} What remains of the original stone is on display at the [[Round Rock Public Library]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Legacy==
There is a Sam Bass Road in [[Round Rock, Texas]].

During Round Rock's ''Frontier Days'' celebration each year, performers re-enact the famous shootout in the old downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Backroads of Texas: The Sites, Scenes, History, People, and Places Your Map Doesn't Tell You About | author=Syers, Ed; Hodge, Larry | publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing | year=2000 | edition=4th | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o10MdSR7H1cC | isbn=978-0891230533 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stuart Charles''' "'''The Sausage King'''" '''Alexander''' (March 22, 1961{{spaced ndash}}December 27, 2005) was an American businessman and heir of the Santos Linguisa Sausage Factory, which was founded by a late great aunt, Pia Santos, and her husband, Antonio, in San Leandro, California in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-02-10/food/17678348_1_portuguese-factory-santos |title=Sausage Maker Thrives on Link to Portugal / An old home recipe grew into a factory in San Leandro, February 10, 1999, by Tilde Herrera for SFgate.com, accessed 2010-10-27 |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=1999-02-10 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was convicted in 2004 of the murder of three state and [[USDA]] meat compliance officials in 2000.

==Personal background==

===Early life and family===
Born the middle child of three sons of Shirley Mae Parriott (born January 18, 1934) and the late Herman "Tweedy" Alexander (b. January 1, 1934 - d. May 31, 1993). Alexander, whose paternal family roots could be traced back to [[Portugal]], was a lifelong resident of [[San Leandro, California]]. He would inherit the family business, The Santos Linguica Factory and then would proclaim himself the "Sausage King," after the death of his father, who had successfully run the once thriving business for many years, (apparently without complaints from state and federal inspectors) in 1993. Alexander's father, Tweedy, had been well known in the local and national business circles as an astute businessman, and had been recognized and renowned for making arguably the finest [[linguica sausage]] in the Bay Area, if not nationwide. He had been grooming the young Stuart for years, particularly after the death of his eldest son, Stefen (August 8, 1958 – May 25, 1977), who died at the age of eighteen in a motorcycle accident. Stefen was set to inherit the reins of the company, but after his passing, all that changed. Tweedy had no choice but to pass the reins to the next eldest son, Stuart. However, Tweedy had little faith that Stuart could run the company. Stuart's father was verbally abusive to his son, often telling him that he would "never amount to anything".

===Relations with others===
By many accounts of acquaintances of the family, the relationship between the father Tweedy and the young Stuart was very rocky, at best. By the account of his mother Shirley, who divorced Tweedy when Stuart was ten, Tweedy could at times be very demanding with the son, and "yelled at him all the time", especially when, at times with him at the factory during the summers and weekends, young Stuart made a mistake. Coupled with this and the breakup of his parents marriage in 1971, this apparently had helped to cultivate a deep-seated anger and resentment that often manifested violently in relations with other people from a young age.

Alexander, who was described by some who knew him closely to have a "short fuse", and to be at times "combative", was charged with beating Clifford Berg, 75, an elderly neighbor, after an argument in 1996. One person who owned a printing shop near the linguisa factory, Richard Miller, 38, said during the murder trial before the grand jury, that Alexander "didn't like the idea of people telling him what to do", with his business, and that he was "very anti-authority", at least from what he knew about the sausage maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2000-10-12/news/17662569_1_grand-jury-meat-inspectors-stuart-alexander |title=Owner made threats, records say/Owner often made death threats, by Henry K.Lee, SFGate.com 10/12/2000 |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2000-10-12 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumstances leading to murders==
It was alleged by those that were close to him that Alexander would often keep e-mails and letters from the meat compliance officers mockingly "harassing" him and show them to his secretary, and his mother. In spite of this, the business did continue to thrive, at least for a time, and this helped to earn the ever hard-working and ambitious Alexander recognition within the local civic and political circles, not much unlike his father. Perhaps partially inspired by the perceived harassment of the state and USDA inspection practices, Alexander made a failed electoral campaign for San Leandro Mayoral Office in 1998.

Still, with the business still in the black, Alexander did find time to start a romantic relationship with Eve Elder, a 33-year-old insurance claims agent, around 1995. As the relationship wore on, however, Elder would later see some odd signs of the potentially deadly violent streak in Alexander, especially when commenting about the inspectors. In what had started out as a joke, the couple concocted a series of short stories; one, titled "Sausage Sniffers Found Sauced", painted a description of the inspectors drowning in vats of 'secret sauce'. Soon, the tone of Alexander's words would take on a much darker tone.  As another former girlfriend, Charlotte Knapp, 38, who had been seeing Alexander off and on up until the time of the murders, would later testify during the murder trial, Alexander frequently used profanities to describe the inspectors and would at times have some choice words ready for them, or for anyone else whom he deemed as "trespassers" that came upon his factory.  On occasion wielding a gun, one of the several firearms that he kept in his office desk drawer.

As time went by, Alexander also began to cultivate an increasingly antagonistic and contentious relationship with the four inspectors who were regularly assigned to routinely oversee his business operations in terms of "cooking temperature, cleanliness, and other health concerns". He felt that these inspectors were harassing him unnecessarily, and "interfering with the way his sausage was best made, and had always been made by his family" by demanding that his linguisa be smoked at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which was a state and USDA requirement; Alexander, who usually smoked the linguisa at 144 degrees, would point that the decreased cooking temperature would shrink the sausage size, thereby reducing the cost at which he could sell them. There were also requirements about the type of smoker that could be used; his had been deemed antiquated and outdated, and at least two times the inspectors had the factory shut down, only for him to reopen against the state law. This would also wreak havoc upon his finances; Alexander, who had already been chided by his then girlfriend Eve and mother about his spending habits, was plunging himself deeper and deeper into debt by putting out bank loans in re-opening the factory when the state would shut it down. This caused the once-thriving, now-illegally operated factory to lose more and more money.

Perhaps coupled with that and his workaholic-like ambitions, this would wear heavily on the romance between Elder and Alexander; by the time of the murder trial proceedings began, Elder, as did Knapp sometime beforehand, had broken off their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mindfully.org |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/sausage-king.htm |title=The Sausage King, written by Bud Hazeltkorn, for ''San Francisco Magazine'', October 2001 |publisher=Mindfully.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-05-17/news/17424183_1_sausage-plant-stuart-alexander-sausage-king |title=Girlfriend says 'Sausage King' wanted to grind up inspectors, ''Bay City News'' article, on sfgate.com website, 5-17-2004 |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2004-05-17 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santos Linguisa Factory murders==
At the time leading up to the murders, Alexander posted a sign at the front of the factory stating, ''"To all of our great customers, the USDA is coming into our plant harassing my employees and me, making it impossible to make our great product. Gee, if all meat plants could be in business for 79 years without one complaint, the meat inspectors would not have jobs. Therefore we are taking legal action against them."''

On June 21, 2000, the inspectors, who had expected there to be some difficulty in dealing with Alexander after several past clashes with him, had attempted to contact the San Leandro Police for possible backup after being met by Alexander at the entrance of the factory; the dispatch call had been treated as a routine police call. Still claiming that he was being harassed by the inspectors, Alexander, at the same time attempted to contact the police to report that the inspectors were trespassing.  Like the call the inspectors made, it was also treated as low-priority. At the same time, he attempted to catch the inspectors overstepping their bounds by videotaping the visit on the survelliance video camera that he had installed in every room in the factory.

When the inspectors finally entered the premises for their daily inspection, an angered but calm-appearing Alexander would then proceed to retrieve one of his guns from his office drawer, re-enter the lobby room, then shot and killed the two USDA inspectors and a state inspector. U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors Jean Hillery, 56, and Thomas Quadros, 52, and state Department of Food and Agriculture Inspector William Shaline, 57, were killed. One California State Inspector, Earl Willis, 51, managed to escape into a nearby bank located there on Washington Street as a now fuming Alexander chased after him down the block, which was recorded on camcorder by the proprietor of one of the nearby businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/06/21/remembering-their-sacrifice-food-safety-employees-killed-in-the-line-of-duty/ |title=Remembering Their Sacrifices; Food Safety Employees Killed In The Line Of Duty, USDA blog, 6/21/2000, accessed 11/18/2010 |publisher=Blogs.usda.gov |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Alexander's failed attempt to shoot Willis, he immediately went back to his linguisa factory lobby and emptied three more shots into the heads of the victims, making sure that they were dead. The police would soon finally arrive upon the scene within a few minutes only after someone in the bank notified the police department; they would arrive to see a waiting Alexander standing in front of his factory, admitting to the murders and ready to be taken into custody.

==Legal proceedings==

===Murder trial===
Court proceedings for the trial of Alexander in the slayings of the compliance officers began on Monday, May 2, 2004. The prosecution team introduced forensic evidence as well as the video surveillance tape; it recorded the events from the time the meat inspectors were waiting in the office lobby for the police, who never came, to arrive, until the shooting of the officers at point-blank range. Alexander had unwittingly sealed his fate; he had the video system installed in all the rooms of the factory. The prosecutors also introduced the videotaped footage of the chase of Inspector Willis by Alexander down Washington Street. The prosecutors had aimed to show signs of premeditation in committing the murders; they also introduced the humorous joke "secret sauce" letter Alexander and his ex-girlfriend Eve Elder had written together several years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis |first=Kim |url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20040427-0013-ca-sausagefactoryshooting.html |title=survelliance tapes show San Leandro shootings |publisher=Legacy.signonsandiego.com |date=2004-04-27 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense attorneys began preparing Alexander for at least an insanity plea, if not a second-degree murder defense, in order to stave off a possible death sentence if he were convicted; they introduced excerpts of the "harassing" e-mails and official letters made by the inspectors in hopes to show that his act of murder was out of "blind rage". Alexander, who had been held without bail since the time of the shootings, had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges. His public defender, Michael Ogul, said Alexander lost his temper and killed the inspectors after months of harassment. "Stuart Alexander committed terrible crimes. There's no question of that", Ogul said. "There's no question he did a terrible thing that can't be excused, that can't be forgiven."  Ogul said the inspectors "taunted, "pushed, and "provoked" Alexander until he was "blind with rage". Said Ogul: "They knew he was volatile. They (the inspectors) knew he was upset, they knew he was on the edge", Ogul continued. "Stuart Alexander killed them. He hated them, plain and simple."

===Conviction===
On October 19, 2004, Alexander was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder, making him eligible to receive the death penalty. On December 14, 2004, a jury condemned Alexander to death by lethal injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-10-19/news/17446353_1_stuart-alexander-sausage-king-fourth-inspector |title='Sausage King' guilty of killing 3 meat inspectors, could get death penalty SFGate.com article, October 19, 2004 |publisher=Articles.sfgate.com |date=2004-10-19 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of the murders and [[sentenced to death]] on February 15, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanleandrobytes.com/attractions/santos_linguisa.html |title=Santos Linguisa Factory - Scene of Triple Homicide HTML at San Leandro Bytes website |publisher=Sanleandrobytes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvu.com/news/3237560/detail.html KTVU-TV news story with video posted 4/26/2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexander's death and aftermath of trial===
While awaiting execution on California's death row at [[San Quentin State Prison]], Alexander, who had gained some eighty pounds during the four years in custody until his stay of execution, began to experience health problems; he would die of a pulmonary embolism on December 27, 2005. The only vestiges of the ordeal with the inspectors that exist is the old factory building on 1745 Washington Avenue, which was sold and then converted into a nightclub by the new owners,&lt;ref&gt;Alameda Times-Star article, 12/30/05.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the families of the murder victims, who were all grandparents and close to approaching retirement age from their respective jobs. The story would gain national headlines, being shown on the A&amp;E Channel's ''[[City Confidential]]'' documentary series program in a 2005 episode "The Sausage King, Episode #133".;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=493274 |title=City Confidential: San Leandro, CA-"The Sausage King" (Episode #133) at A&amp;E's Bio Channel website |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the case was also spotlighted (focusing specifically on the interactions between Alexander and Jean Hillery) in a similarly titled 2011 episode of the [[Investigation Discovery]] program ''Fatal Encounters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title=The Sausage King | series =Fatal Encounters |serieslink=Fatal Encounters | network = [[Investigation Discovery]] | airdate=2012-01-18 | season=1 | episode=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial ceremonies for inspectors===
In June 2010, a memorial service event was held at the U.S. Federal Food Safety and Inspection Service building located in Alameda, California commemorating the service of the four inspectors, the memory of the three who were slain in the gun attack, and Earl Willis, who had died in 2008 of cancer .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/06/21/remembering-their-sacrifice-food-safety-employees-killed-in-the-line-of-duty/ |title=Remembering their sacrifice: Food safety employees killed in the line of duty USDA website blog, posted June 21, 2010 |publisher=Blogs.usda.gov |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSIS also held several related special ceremonies commemorating the lives and service of all of the inspectors in Washington D.C., which was a two-day event held on the corner of NW 14th and Jefferson Streets, where decorations with memorial service ribbons were given to the families of the inspectors; the FSIS also held ceremonies in [[Beltsville, Maryland]], and Alameda. The agency also maintains a memorial page to remind employees and the public of the sacrifice made by the inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marler |first=Bill |url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/06/ceremonies-to-honor-meat-inspectors-killed-in-2000/ |title=Ceremonies to honor meat inspectors killed in 2000, ''Food Safety News'' website, June 21, 2010, accessed 2011-1-3 |publisher=Foodsafetynews.com |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tales from the Secret Annex''''' is a collection of miscellaneous prose fiction and non-fiction  written by [[Anne Frank]] while she was in hiding during the [[The Netherlands in World War II|Nazi occupation of The Netherlands]]. It was first published in The Netherlands in 1949, then in an expanded edition in 1960. A complete edition appeared in 1982, and was later included in the 2003 publication of ''The Revised Critical Edition of The Diary of Anne Frank''.

A revised British edition was published in 2010 by Halban Publishers. 

Along with her posthumously published [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]], written in hiding between 1942 and 1944, Anne Frank wrote short stories, essays, personal recollections, and the first five chapters of a novel. The latter was written in the back half of one of her diary notebooks, while the short pieces were compiled into a journal begun on September 2, 1943. Entitled ''Verhaaltjes, en gebeurtenissen uit het Achterhuis beschreven door Anne Frank'' (''Stories and Sketches from the Backhouse described by Anne Frank''), it was recovered with her other manuscripts from her [[Anne Frank House|hiding place]] by [[Miep Gies]] and [[Bep Voskuijl]] following Anne Frank's arrest by the [[Gestapo]] on August 19, 1944.

'''Teotenango''' was in important pre-Hispanic fortified city located in the southern part of the [[Toluca Valley|Valley of Toluca]]. It was initially founded during the last stages of the [[Teotihuacan]] civilization by a group generally referred to as the “Teotenancas.” Later, the [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]]s conquered the city and expanded it.&lt;ref name="edomexico"&gt;{{cite web |title=Teotenango (Tenango del Valle) |url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/imc/teotenango.html |publisher=Estado de México |location=Mexico State |language=Spanish |accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="milenio"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tania |last=Hernandez A. |title=Irregularidades en la protección de la zona arqueológica de Teotenango |url=http://impreso.milenio.com/node/7002705 2008-11-16 |publisher=Milenio |location=Mexico City |accessdate=2 August 2009 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724144933/http://impreso.milenio.com/node/7002705 |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city existed for about 1,000 years, being abandoned only after the [[Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;
[[File:RuinsEntranceTeotenango.JPG|thumb|left|Main entrance to the ancient city]]
The name Teotenango is derived from three [[Nahuatl]] words: “teotl” (god, sacred, divine, authentic or original), “tenamitl” (wall, fence or fortification) and “co” (place or in) which lends itself to different translations such as “in the place of the divine wall,” or “in the place of the original fortification” or “in the place of the all of the gods.” However, “teotl” began to be used to distinguish this pre-Hispanic site from the town that was constructed in the valley below by the Spanish after the Conquest.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt; This is confirmed by the Teutenanco Chronicles, written in 1582, but the Original Chronicles of Chalco-Amaquemecan state that the site was also known as “Cozcuauhtenanco” (walled place of the buzzards) due to the Teotenaca-Matlatzinca military order that protected the city.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guia"&gt;{{cite book  |title= Teotenango:La Antigua Ciudad Amurallada, Guia de la Zona Arqueologica |trans-title=Teotenango:The Walled City |publisher= Instituto Mexiqunse de Cultura |location=Toluca |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SETeotenangoEdoMx.JPG|thumb|Northwest portion of the excavated site]]
At its height, the city was densely population with a main road about 1,400 meters long, pyramidal platforms, palaces, a ballgame court, formidable defenses, drainage and water delivery systems. All around the site there are naturally protruding rocks containing [[petroglyph]]s with various signs and symbols. However, only a fraction of the site, mostly the northeast section which contained the ceremonial center, has been excavated and  preserved.&lt;ref name="sicgob"&gt;{{cite web |title= Teotenango |url=http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=zona_arqueologica&amp;table_id=153&amp;estado_id=15&amp;municipio_id=90 |publisher=Sistema de Información Cultural |language=Spanish |accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is located on top of a large hill known as Tetépetl, which is located just west of the modern town of [[Tenango del Valle|Tenango de Arista]] at a height of 2,700 meters above sea level.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt; It is 25&amp;nbsp;km south of the [[Mexico State]] capital of [[Toluca]], in a sub-valley of the Valley of Toluca named the “Valley of the Matlatzinco” by the Spanish, due to the dominance of this ethnic group here.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sicgob"/&gt;

==Tetepetl Hill==
[[File:PathupTeotenango.JPG|left|thumb|less than half of the path leading to the site from the valley below]]
Tetepetl Hill is a sharp rise from the Valley of the Matlatzinco running along the west side of the modern town of [[Tenango de Arista]] in the [[State of Mexico]]. It forms an elongated [[mesa]], with steep slopes on the north and east sides, varying in height from 70 to 250 meters that serve as natural defenses. While the surface of this mesa is 16.5km2, only about 2km2 in the extreme northeast of the mesa was inhabited.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt; With the exception of this corner of the mesa, the entire hill is covered by a layer of dark gray solidified lava, the result of a volcanic eruption that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This makes most of the mesa difficult to cross and impossible to farm. To make the city possible, the northeast corner needed to be significantly modified by terracing and filling in low areas. The mesa contains no rivers, but there are a number of fresh-water springs which served as the ancient city’s water supply.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;

==History of Teotenango==

The high plains in the center of modern Mexico, called the “[[Mexican plateau|altiplano]]”, is one of the most important areas of [[Mesoamerica]]. The altiplano extends over what is now the [[Mexico City|Distrito Federal]], most of the states of [[Puebla]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Mexico State]] as well as parts of the states of [[Morelos]] and [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. Sophisticated cultures were developed by peoples such as the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], the [[Tlahuica]]s and the Matlatzincas.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

The Valley of Toluca is in the altiplano, to the west of the Distrito Federal in Mexico State. From early pre-Hispanic times, this valley was an important settlement area for a number of ethnic groups, whose economic and cultural development was strongly influenced by the natural resources that existed here. The Valley of Toluca was also an important gateway to the tropical lowlands to the south and west. Trade routes through the valley brought valued commodities such as salt, tropical fruits, semiprecious stones and ocean products such as shells. Later, after the conquest of the valley by the [[Aztec Empire]], it became an important point of control for tribute goods coming to the capital of [[Tenochtitlan]]. It was also important as a staging area for the regular wars between the Aztecs and the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] (in what is now [[Michoacán]]) as possession of much of the western valley was in dispute.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

Teotenango is located in the far southern part of the Valley of Toluca. This area was initially settled  and developed during the end years of the Teotihuacan civilization.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;  The site experienced five periods of occupation and development, extending over 1,000 years and ending when the Spanish forced the resettlement of the population to the valley floor below.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;

Occupation of this area did not begin on Tetepetl Hill but rather at a location on the valley floor on the north side of the hill. This settlement has been named Ojo de Agua by archeologists. It was founded by [[Otomi people|Otomí]] people who were joined and strongly influenced by emigrants from the falling Teotihuacan civilization. These people are now referred to as the Teotenancas. Objects from this part of the site show very strong similarities with objects from Teotihuacan and date from 650 to 750 C. E. This is considered to be the first stage of the development of Teotenango.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="piña"&gt;{{cite news |title=En el Museo “Román Piña Chan” conoce las piezas prehispánicas de Teotenango |url=http://www.ultra.com.mx/ultra2/index.php/Mexico/Edo-Mex-Cultura/en-el-museo-roman-pina-chan-conoce-las-piezas-prehispanicas-de-teotenango.html |publisher=Ultra Noticias |location=Mexico City |date=2009-05-14 |accessdate=2 August 2009 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722224514/http://www.ultra.com.mx/ultra2/index.php/Mexico/Edo-Mex-Cultura/en-el-museo-roman-pina-chan-conoce-las-piezas-prehispanicas-de-teotenango.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage is dated from 750-900 C.E. show simultaneous occupation of both the Ojo de Agua site and the northern edge of Tetepetl Hill, by the same ethnic group. The first constructions of the Teotenango site date from this period, including the [[temazcal]], structures 2C and 3C and some structures that lie under structures in Conjuntos A and C. The reason the settlement moved from the valley floor to the mesa was due to natural defenses that the mesa provided. Constructions here still are mostly of dwellings of [[adobe]] and still show strong Teotihuacan influence indicated by two inclined walls supporting a vertical one.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;
[[File:BIConjBTeotenango.JPG|thumb|Pyramid of Conjunto B]]
During the third stage (900 – 1162 CE),  most of the currently visible structures of the ceremonial center, such as the pyramidal bases for temples, were built. Of these constructions, the ball court and the Serpent Base stand out. Some residences were also built.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

The beginning of the fourth stage (1162-1476) is characterized by the conquest and takeover of the city by the Matlatzincas. They added some small constructions to the ceremonial center, and amplified some other structures, but are mostly credited with the construction of the city’s massive defenses, such as the wall on the west side.  During the time the city’s population grew significantly, with residential areas spreading toward the south.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt; The Matlatzincas extended the domain of this city to include the entire Valley of Toluca, which major outposts in Toluca, [[Calixtlahuaca]], [[Tenancingo, Mexico State|Tenancingo]].&lt;ref name="piña"/&gt;

The fifth and final stage (1474-1550 C.E.) is characterized by the conquest of Teotenango by the emperor [[Axayacatl]] and subsequent Aztec occupation of the city and the valley. Some Aztec architectural influence is felt with the best examples being Building 1C, and the narrow staircase built into the western defense wall. It also includes the initial stages of resettlement of the population of Teotenango to new Spanish colonial village of Tenango de Valle (also known as “Village of Teotenango”) on the valley floor below. This resettlement was completed by 1550, after which the site above was completely abandoned.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

==Excavation of the site==

The abandoned site remained mostly exposed and vaguely known about locally since colonial times. But it was not until 1969 when archeologist Wanda Tomasi presented a plan to excavate the site. She contacted the [[Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] (INAH) center for the region, at the time directed by Román Piña Chan, who decided to convert Tomasi’s idea into a state project to gain finance and support from then-governor [[Carlos Hank Gonzalez]].&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;
In the 1970s, Piña Chan succeeded in getting five million pesos for investigation, exploration, land purchases and the construction of a site museum, with aims of making the site accessible to the public. Since the State of Mexico invested the money in the project, INAH ceded management rights to the state, with the condition that research and security of the site would continue.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;
The project was able to excavate less than half of the two km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; site, limited to the ceremonial center concentrated on the northeast of the mesa. Little is known of the residential areas that extend to the south and east.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;

Another area that was left unexcavated was the initial Teotenanca settlement, Ojo de Agua, on the valley floor on the north side of Tetepetl Hill. Using sonar in the 1970s, a small platform was detected about two meters underground and a few objects were uncovered and put on display at the site museum. However, lack of funding prevented any serious work here, but did allow for measures to protect the area from damage, although it still remains private property.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;

==Excavated structures at the site==

The site consists of five major groupings of buildings called “conjuntos” labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Conjunto D is more commonly referred to as the Plaza del Serpiente (Plaza of the Serpent). Conjunto E is more commonly referred to as the ball court area. Buildings within each of the conjuntos are denoted with numbers, such as 1A, 1B, etc.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt; The archeological site has more than forty excavated and at least partially restored monuments.&lt;ref name="museo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Museo Arqueologico de Teotenango |url=http://www.turimexico.com/edomex/mteotenango.php |language=Spanish |accessdate=2 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JagReliefTeotenango.JPG|thumb|Jaguar relief at main entrance to city]]
The main entrance to the city is through the Plaza of the Jaguar, which lies on the hill on the north side just below the level of the rest of the city. From this plaza a series of stone steps takes one up to the city level.&lt;ref name="oem"&gt;{{cite news |first= Emilio |last= Gandarilla Avilés |title= Teotenango, "Lugar de la muralla sagrada"  |url= http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetoluca/notas/n555406.htm |publisher=El Sol de Toluca |location=Toluca, Mexico |date=2008-01-12 |accessdate=2 August 2009 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaguar Relief shows as seated jaguar, wearing a medallion around its neck and it is in the process of eating a kind of flower or heart. To the left of this image is the representation of the date marker Two Rabbit and to the right is the date marker Nine House.  One of the interpretations of this set of reliefs is that it represents the occurrence of an eclipse. The Jaguar represents some kind of earth monster eating the sun, represented by the flower or heart figure. An eclipse did indeed occur on the date Two Rabbit Nine House on the [[Aztec calendar]].&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

Conjuntos A and B each consist of a plaza with a temple pyramid or pyramid base with one or more smaller buildings associated with it. Both are located at the extreme east of the excavated zone, near where the hill’s steep slopes to the valley floor begin. Conjunto B contains a nearly complete pyramid with a small altar in front and various platforms for dwellings. Some of the structures here show Otomi architectural influence. Buildings here were roofed with thick layers of mud reinforced with poles and had stucco floors which contain evidence of cooking/heating fires.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;

Conjunto C is a small group of buildings just behind to west of the Jaguar relief and the main stairs entering the city. This area contains some of the oldest exposed structures at the site.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

[[File:PlatformSerpienteTeotenago.JPG|thumb|On the Serpent Base looking east over the Plaza]]
The Plaza de la Serpiente (Conjunto D) is located in the western part of the excavated area. The largest structure here is the Serpent Base which measures 120 m long by 40 m wide. The name of the plaza and the building come from a sculpted stone found at the northeast corner of the Serpent Base, formed in the shape of a snake’s head. A smaller structure, denoted 1D, is a base 90&amp;nbsp;cm high divided into various rooms with interior patios. These patios are square and contain drainage system for wastewater. The structure also contains an entrance hallway and pits for fires in the interior.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

The Calle de la Rana (Frog Street) is located in the far northwest of the excavated site. It is a cleared area which lies at a lower level than the structures surrounding it. Through it, access was gained to the Plaza del Serpiente. Its name comes from a sculpture of a frog done in a rock from the hill which juts out. The Matlatzincas built their western defensive wall along this street.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

The defensive walls of the city were mostly constructed by the Matlatzincas, who conquered the city in 1200 C.E. The largest and most intact are located on the west side of the city which reach heights of 10 meters and are up to 1.5 meters wide.  These were constructed without mortar and took advantage of the contours of the land. This wall was about two meters long and stretch from north to south on the west side.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;
[[File:MesoBallcourtTeotenango.JPG|thumb|Looking over the ball court to the east]]
The [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ball court]] area (Conjunto E) lies to the south of the Plaza de la Serpiente and Conjunto C. The court is sunken and I-shaped, with the top and bottom of the “I” facing east and west.  The actual play space is the body of the “I” which is bordered by walls that first head up vertical from the floor, then steeply incline away from the play area. On the lower, vertical parts of the wall, the stone rings were placed for scoring. Construction denoted as 2E is a grouping of residential structures that are some of the oldest in the city.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

The temazcal, or ritual/purification steam bath is located on the east side of the ballgame complex. There is a shallow hole in the center of the area where rocks would be heated then sprinkled with water to produce steam. From the center of the sauna, there is a drainage ditch to take away excess and dirty water. Only the sunken foundation remains. The part above the surface was most likely constructed of adobe, with a kind of a thatched roof. The temazcal was built long before the ball court and was partially destroyed with the court was built.&lt;ref name="guia"/&gt;

==Museum==
[[File:2HallTeotenMX.JPG|thumb|Overview of part of one of the permanent collection rooms]]
With the excavation of Teotenango, the Roman Piña Chan Archeological Museum was created to put the artifacts found on display. This museum offers a general overview of the cultural development of the highlands of Mexico, from the first human settlements to the highly stratified societies which characterized the post-classic period, with special emphasis on Teotenango. The museum is operated by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura (Mexico State Institute of Culture) and is located in Tenango del Valle at the entrance to the archeological site.&lt;ref name="piña"/&gt;&lt;ref name="museo"/&gt;
The museum has three exhibition rooms for its permanent collection, which numbers more than 1,000 pieces.&lt;ref name="museo"/&gt; The museum's largest collection is of pieces from the era after the Matlatzinca conquest, including copper utensils, stone tools and sculptures. There are a number of pieces of Aztec origin, including sculptures of Xipe Totec and Chicomecoatl, goddesses of fertility. There are also a few pieces from the era of initial contact with the Spaniards. Lastly, it contains some pieces from other sites, such as stone tools, clay figures and animal-shaped jars from [[Tlatilco]], a small, very early settlement in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The exhibits here show a more complex social organization with more external infludences at Teotenango than is evident at Teotihuacan.&lt;ref name="piña"/&gt;
One of the famous finds during excavation of the site was the “panhuehuetl” or musical drum of Teotenango, made of wood and decorated with  a buzzard fighting an eagle, representing the struggle between the Teotenancas-Matlatzincas and the Aztecs for dominance in the area.&lt;ref name="edomexico"/&gt;

==Protection of the site==
Since formal excavation work was carried out in the 1970s, the site and its museum have been managed by the [[Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura]]. There are two reasons for this. First, the excavation and restoration work was done by the Instituto Mexiquense de Cultura and not by federal Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia as was customary. Second, a series of constitutional reforms since that time has sought to encourage more direct participation of state and local authorities in the preservation and management of archeological sites and other monuments to Mexico’s culture and history. However, as the reforms passed, INAH issued warnings about the Teotenango site’s vulnerability to encroachment due to the urban development taking place in Tenango del Valle. Of the 600 hectares set aside by the initial project, only two-thirds  is still considered to be adequately protected. Urban development in the Tenango del Valle area has accelerated since the year 2000 and many constructions now border the protected area, which is not fenced. Encroachment generally takes the form of these constructions threatening the stability of site structures above and below the surface as well as the unauthorized taking of objects at the site. Almost all of this is occurring at the site’s south and west sides, where almost no formal excavation work has been done and about which little is known.&lt;ref name="milenio"/&gt;

'''''The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia''''' is a book-length anthropological and historical study of the [[Zomia (geography)|Zomia]] highlands of Southeast Asia written by [[James C. Scott]] and published in 2009.&lt;ref name="truth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Refugees' Descendants in Southeast Asia Prove Stateless Society Is Possible|url=http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/1950:refugees-descendants-in-southeast-asia-prove-stateless-society-is-possible|publisher=[[Truthout]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in [[Zomia (geography)|Zomia]] (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the [[nation state]] societies that surround them—[[slavery]], [[conscription]], taxes, [[corvée]], epidemics, and warfare.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The mystery of Zomia|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/12/06/the_mystery_of_zomia/|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, essentially an “[[anarchism|anarchist]] history,” is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on [[nation-building]] whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain [[statelessness|stateless]].

Scott's main argument is that these people are "barbaric by design": their social organization, geographical location, subsistence practices and culture have been carved to discourage states to annex them to their territories.  Likewise, states want to integrate Zomia to increase the amount of land, resources and people subject to taxation. In other words, to raise their revenue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The art of not being governed: An anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia.|last=Scott|first=James|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780300156522|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zomia's ethnic groups were formed mostly by people running away from states, seeking for refuge, each of them with their own ethnicity. Adding the isolation of the terrain, these characteristics encouraged a specialization of languages, dialects and cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Moreover, to remain stateless they have used this specialization along with agricultural practices that enhance mobility; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

Scott admits to making "bold claims" in his book&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Battle Over Zomia|url=https://chronicle.com/article/The-Battle-Over-Zomia/128845/|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but credits many other scholars, including the French anthropologist [[Pierre Clastres]] and the American historian [[Owen Lattimore]], as influences.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

'''''The Reading''''' is an oil painting by French painter [[Édouard Manet]], [[circa]] 1865 - 1873.&lt;ref name="Feist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Feist |first=Peter H. |year=2006 |chapter=Salida a escena de una nueva generación |publisher=Taschen |edition=Walther, Ingo H. |title=El impresionismo |language=Spanish |place=Colonia |pages=48,77 |isbn=978-3-8228-5052-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was first exhibited in 1880 in one of the regular solo exhibitions mounted by Manet in his workshop. The picture was also part of the great posthumous exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his death.

The work first belonged to the private collection of [[Winnaretta Singer]], Princess Edmond de Polignac, where it remained until 1944, after the death of the Princess. It was offered as a gift to the French State and deposited in the [[Musée du Louvre]]. In 1947, it was transferred to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], a showroom located in the [[Jardin des Tuileries]] and which  belongs to the Louvre. It remained there until 1986, when, with the creation of the Musée d'Orsay, it was brought to this museum, like the rest of the collection of Impressionist paintings in the Louvre. It can currently be seen in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], in room 31 of level 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notice de l'œuvre |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/es/colecciones/catalogo-de-obras/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000706&amp;cHash=1356382807 |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=French |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The painting depicts the artist's wife, Suzanne Manet (born Suzanne Leenhoff), seated, and their son, Leon, standing and reading a book. Leon was a recurrent model for Manet who portrayed him in several pictures, such as ''The Lunch'', ''The [[Boy Carrying a Sword]]'' and ''The Bubbles of Soap''.

In this work the white woman's dress dominates, and the sofa and curtains are treated with broad strokes of high brightness, in counterpoint to the dark tone of the belt and collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= VV.AA. |title=Historia del arte: El realismo. El impresionismo |year= 2005 |publisher= Salvat / El País |isbn= 84-471-0336-6 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter H. Feist, in this painting "Manet reacts more sensitive than usual, and looks especially to shades of white that are offered to his eyes".&lt;ref name="Feist"/&gt;

Starting in 1999, it has been awarded annually to people who through their work "cross the traditional framework of scientific knowledge, contribute to the understanding of science as an integral part of general culture, and in an unconventional way deal with the fundamental questions of knowledge, being and human existence." The prize is awarded in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], and the laureates receive the "[[crosier]] of [[St. Adalbert of Prague]]."
