'''1823 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 20 May — [[Tom Spring]] is finally able to defend his English Championship title when he receives a challenge from Bill Neat.  The two meet on Hinckley Downs and the fight ends in the eighth round when Neat is forced to retire, having sustained a broken arm in the sixth round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/spring-t.htm Cyber Boxing Zone – Tom Spring]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The size of the [[wicket]] is increased to 27 x 8 inches.
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the first quarter of the 19th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[William Ward (cricketer, born 1787)|William Ward]] 328 (HS 120)
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[William Ashby (cricketer)|William Ashby]] 23 (BB 6–?)

==[[Football]]==
'''Events'''
* The traditional date of the [[William Webb Ellis]] legend.  He is the [[Rugby School]] pupil who, it is said, "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, took the ball in his hands and ran with it".  Even if the tale is true, the game will have been a version of folk football with rules that had been verbally agreed by the Rugby School pupils.  Such rules are always open to challenge and it may be that an incident like this did occur with the result that a "dribbling" game became primarily a handling game.

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[1,000 Guineas Stakes]] – [[Zinc (horse)|Zinc]] 
* [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]] – Nicolo 
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Emilius]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – [[Zinc (horse)|Zinc]] 
* [[St. Leger Stakes]] – [[Barefoot (horse)|Barefoot]]

The '''1998 Indian Federation Cup qualification''' tournament was a [[Association football|football]] competition that was played among 37 teams to determine eight teams that entered the [[1998 Indian Federation Cup|final round]]. These teams joined eight other teams that automatically qualified by virtue of entering the quarter-finals in the [[1997 Indian Federation Cup|last edition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghosh|first1=Arnab|title=Mohun Bagan retails title|url=http://www.indianfootball.de/article/article006.html|publisher=indianfootball.de|work=[[Sportstar]]|accessdate=6 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020612231945/http://www.indianfootball.de/article/article006.html|archivedate=12 June 2002|date=9 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification matches were played separately in five zones and the winner of each zone qualified automatically; with two from the South Zone. The runners-up of other four Zones competed in [[playoffs]] to earn the remaining two spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ Federation Cup begins today|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98aug02/sports.htm#7|work=The Tribune|accessdate=6 February 2017|date=1 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first qualification match, played on 18 July 1998, was an East Zone match and Jorba Durga from the zone became the first team to qualify. The competition ended 23 August with playoffs when Punjab State Electricity Board eliminated Air India and became the final qualifier.

The '''Abbasiyyin Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|ملعب العباسيين}}) is a multi-use all-seater stadium in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches and serves as the home venue of the [[Syria national football team|Syrian national team]]. It is also home to [[Syrian Premier League]] clubs [[Al-Wahda SC Damascus|Al-Wahda]], [[Al-Jaish SC Damascus|Al-Jaish]] and [[Al-Majd Damascus|Al-Majd]]. The stadium which was built in 1976 is able to hold up to 30,000 spectators, being the 4th largest stadium in Syria.

==History==
The stadium was originally opened in 1957 with a capacity of 10,000 spectators, to host football matches and local [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events.

On the occasion of the 5th [[Pan Arab Games]] in [[1976 Pan Arab Games|1976]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esyria.sy/edamascus/index.php?p=stories&amp;category=places&amp;filename=201002051035011 eDamascus: Abbasiyyin Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium was entirely renovated and the capacity was expanded up to 40,000 spectators.

However, after the most recent renovation in March 2011, Abbasiyyin Stadium was turned into an all-seater stadium and the capacity was reduced to 30,000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albaath.news.sy/user/?id%3D1083%26a%3D95953 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315185238/http://www.albaath.news.sy/user/?id=1083&amp;a=95953 |archivedate=2011-03-15 |df= }} Al-Baath newspaper 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbasiyyin Stadium hosted the 5th and 7th [[Pan Arab Games]] in 1976 and [[1992 Pan Arab Games|1992]] respectively as a main venue.

On 6 May 2001, a holy mass was conducted by [[Pope John Paul II]] in the Abbasiyyin Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albayan.ae/one-world/2001-05-07-1.1159710 Pope John Paul II, holy mass in Damascus Abbasiyyin Stadium]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a syndrome characterized by chronic [[Inguinodynia|groin pain]] in athletes and a dilated [[Superficial inguinal ring|superficial ring]] of the [[inguinal canal]]. [[Football]] and [[ice hockey]] players are affected most frequently, and both recreational and professional athletes may be affected.

==Presentation==
Symptoms include pain during sports movements, particularly hip extension, and twisting and turning. This pain usually radiates to the [[Adductor muscles of the hip|adductor]] muscle region and even the testicles, although it is often difficult for the patient to pin-point the exact location.

Following sporting activity the person with athletic pubalgia will be stiff and sore. The day after a match, getting out of bed or a car will be difficult. Any exertion that increases intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or sporting activity can cause pain. In the early stages, the person may be able to continue playing their sport, but the problem usually gets progressively worse.

As pain in the groin and pelvis can be referred from a number of problems, including injuries to the lumbar spine, the hip joint, the sacro-iliac joint, the abdomen, and the genito-urinary system,  diagnosis of athletic pubalgia requires skillful differentiation and pubic examination in certain cases where there is intense groin pain.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is based on the patient's history, clinical signs, and, increasingly, an [[MRI]] exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthopedics.about.com/od/sportsinjuries/a/hernia.htm |title=Sports Hernia |publisher=Orthopedics.about.com |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can often be reproduced by maneuvers such as performing sit-ups or crunches.  Pain can also be elicited with the patient in a "frog position," in which the patient is [[Supine position|supine]] with knees bent and heels together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Blanc|first=E|author2=LeBlanc KA|title=Groin pain in athletes|journal=Hernia|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=68–71|pmid=12820026|doi=10.1007/s10029-002-0105-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact lesion may differ, but common [[pathology|pathologic]] findings at operation are:
* torn [[Aponeurosis of the Obliquus externus abdominis|external oblique aponeurosis]]
* tear in the [[conjoint tendon]]
* conjoint tendon torn from [[pubic tubercle]]
* dehiscence between conjoined tendon and [[inguinal ligament]]
* tear in the fascia transversalis&lt;ref name=joesting&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joesting DR | year = 2002 | title = Diagnosis and treatment of sportsman's hernia | url = | journal = Curr Sports Med Rep | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 121–4 | pmid = 12831721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* abnormal insertion of the [[rectus abdominis muscle]]
* tear of the [[abdominal internal oblique muscle]] from the pubic tubercle
* entrapment of the [[ilioinguinal nerve]] or [[genitofemoral nerve]]&lt;ref name="eMedicine"&gt;{{eMedicine|sports|162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several of these lesions may occur simultaneously. Also, many athletes have concomitant weakness or tearing of the adductor muscles or labral tears of the hip.
When the adductor muscles are tight post injury, that can be enough to trigger symptoms.

==Treatment==
Conservative therapies (gentle [[stretching]] and a short period of rest&lt;ref name=GPnotebook&gt;{{Cite GPnotebook|1161101375|athletic pubalgia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) may temporarily alleviate the pain, but definitive treatment consists of surgical repair followed by a structured rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="eMedicine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harley"&gt;"[http://www.108harleystreet.co.uk/Pages/gilmore-groin-hernia-clinic.htm The Gilmore Groin &amp; Hernia Clinic]". Retrieved November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first conservative treatment option should be to restore normal motion after the adductor has begun to heal (usually 6–8 weeks post injury). Sleeping in a prone position with the hip on the affected side flexed and externally rotated can be a cure in some individuals.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2015}}
==Incidence==
The exact [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of these entities is unknown: some believe it is the most common cause of chronic groin pain in athletes, while others argue that it is only rare.&lt;ref name=fiction&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredberg U, Kissmeyer-Nielsen P | year = 1996 | title = The sportsman's hernia—fact or fiction? | url = | journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 201–4 | pmid = 8896091 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.1996.tb00091.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBVA Compass Field''' is a [[soccer-specific stadium]] located in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], United States on the campus of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB) that has served as the home field for both the [[UAB Blazers]] [[UAB Blazers men's soccer|men's]] and women's soccer teams since its opening in October 2015 as the replacement for [[West Campus Field]].&lt;ref name="BBVA1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakken|first1=Jim|title=Birmingham’s newest sports venue, BBVA Compass Field at UAB, officially debuts|url=https://www.uab.edu/news/campus/item/6810-birmingham-s-newest-sports-venue-bbva-compass-field-at-uab-officially-debuts|website=UAB News|publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham|accessdate=April 1, 2018|ref=UAB1|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the stadium was facilitated after [[BBVA Compass]] made a $1.5 million donation to the university for its construction in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$1.5 million BBVA Compass gift supports on-campus soccer facility at UAB|url=http://newsroom.bbvacompass.com/2014-11-07-BBVA-Compass-gift-supports-on-campus-soccer-facility-at-UAB|publisher=BBVA Compass|accessdate=April 1, 2018|date=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boar spear''' is a [[spear]] used for [[boar hunting]].  It is relatively short and heavy and has two "[[Lug (knob)|lug]]s" or "wings" on the spearsocket behind the blade, which act as a barrier to prevent an injured and furious [[boar]] from working its way up the shaft of the spear to attack the hunter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strutt|first1=Joseph|title=The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England: From the Earliest Period, Including the Rural and Domestic Recreations, May Games, Mummeries, Pageants, Processions and Pompous Spectacles|date=1801|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|page=14|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eJwSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Boar+spear&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiu8eVh57ZAhWCB8AKHVLOCTsQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Boar%20spear&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Centro Desportivo Universitário do Porto''' or '''CDUP''' (Sports Center of [[University of Porto]]) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] amateur sports club for students at the [[University of Porto]], in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]].

==History==

=== The dispute resolution with the [[University of Porto]] (2012 – Present) ===
On November 2012, CDUP and the [[University of Porto]] reached an agreement to settle the dispute they have been having since 2003, due to the refuse of the University to support and fund the federated sports side of the club.&lt;ref&gt;https://desporto.sapo.pt/mais_modalidades/artigo/2012/11/21/cdup-e-universidade-do-porto-chegam-a-acordo-ao-fim-de-nove-anos&lt;/ref&gt;

Resulting from this agreement, the [[University of Porto]] published, in January 2013, the articles of association of a new autonomous service of the University called "CDUP-UP - Centro de Desporto da Universidade do Porto" with the responsibility of promoting and organizing university sports.

CDUP remained juridical autonomous from the [[University of Porto]], although without the responsibility of university sports. Because of that, it was proposed to change its name to "CDUP-AD - Centro Desportivo Universitário do Porto, associação desportiva autónoma" and it became responsible only for federated non university sports, with the condition that, at least 50% of the total registered athletes, must be part of the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;https://dre.pt/application/file/3584803&lt;/ref&gt;

Until today, the club name hasn’t changed and it is still called "CDUP - Centro Desportivo Universitário do Porto".

==Sports==

CDUP enables students to practise a large number of sports and has sections dedicated to several sports at the competitive level, including [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[badminton]], [[basketball]], [[Contract bridge|bridge]], [[canoeing]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[water polo]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], [[chess]], and the sport for which they are best known in [[Portugal]] — [[Rugby union|rugby]].

The CDUP team is one of the best Portuguese rugby union teams and three of its players were included in the Portuguese squad for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].   In Portugal, rugby is considered a traditional university sport.

==Facilities==

CDUP facilities are located in two places in the city — the University Stadium and the Rua da Boa Hora. The CDUP headquarters are located in the Rua da Boa Hora n.º 20 (20, Boa Hora street) where there is also a swimming pool, rooms for martial arts, [[gymnastics]], chess and table tennis.  At the University Stadium, by the [[Arrábida Bridge]], there are a multisports arena with two indoor sports fields, two tennis courts, an outdoor [[futsal]] field, and in stadium one athletics tartan track and one [[association football|football]]/[[Rugby union|rugby]] grass pitch.

==Honors==

*'''[[Taça de Portugal de Rugby]]''': 
**'''Winner (3)''': 2002-03, 2006–07
*Athletics Portuguese Championship 1994: 3rd Place

[[Samuel de Champlain]], the founder of Québec and the lake's namesake, is often claimed to be the first European to have sighted Champ, in 1609. However, this legend dates back to a fake quote published in the Summer 1970 issue of Vermont Life. In the Vermont Life article, Champlain is alleged to have documented a "20-foot serpent thick as a barrel, and a head like a horse." This quote has often been repeated, but is in fact apocryphal. Champlain did document large fish:
{{quote|There is also a great abundance of fish, of many varieties: among others, one called by the savages of the country ''Chaoufarou'', which varies in length, the largest being, as the people told me, eight or ten feet long. I saw some five feet long, which were as large as my thigh; the head being as big as my two fists, with a snout two feet and half long, and a double row of very sharp and dangerous teeth. Its body is, in shape, very much like that of a pike; but it is armed with scales so strong and a poniard could not piece them. Its color is silver-gray.}}
The 1878 translation of his journals clarifies that ''Chaoufaou'' refers to [[Gar|gar (or gar pike)]], specifically ''[[Longnose gar|Lepisosteus osseus]]'' (the longnose gar).&lt;ref name="Champlain1878"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Champlain|first=Samuel |author-link=Samuel de Champlain |translator-last1=Otis |translator-first1=Charles Pomeroy |translator-link=Charles Pomeroy Otis |title=Voyages of Samuel de Champlain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_kWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA216 |year=1878 |publisher=Prince Society |location=Boston, Massachusetts |volume=2: 1604-1610 |pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1819 report in the Plattsburgh Republican, entitled "Cape Ann Serpent on Lake Champlain", reports a "Capt. Crum" sighting an enormous serpentine monster.&lt;ref name='CRUM'&gt;{{cite news |last=Mackerel |first=Horse |title=Cape Ann Serpent on Lake Champlain |date=24 July 1819 |url=http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn83031979/1819-07-24/ed-1/seq-2/ |newspaper=Plattsburgh Republican |publisher= |location=Plattsburgh, New York  |volume=9 |issue=17 |page=2 |via=NYS Historic Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='LCEPVB'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lakeplacidmedia.com/uploads/PDF/Champ.pdf |title=The Search for Champ |accessdate=2010-04-03 |publisher=Lake Placid/Essex County Visitor's Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crum estimated the monster to have been about 187-feet long and approximately two hundred yards away from him. Despite the great distance, he claimed to have witnessed it being followed by "two large Sturgeon and a Bill-fish" and was able to see that it had three teeth and eyes the color of peeled onions. He also described the monster as having "a belt of red" around its neck and a white star on its forehead.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Joe|first1=Nickell|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Legend of the Lake Champlain Monster|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/legend_of_the_lake_champlain_monster/|website=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, Sheriff Nathan H. Mooney claimed that he had seen a water serpent about "20 rods" from where he was on the shore. He claimed that he was so close that he could see "round white spots inside its mouth" and that "the creature appeared to be about 25 to 30 feet in length". Mooney's sighting led to many more alleged eyewitnesses coming forward with their own accounts of Champ.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Dennis Jay |title=Champ Quest 1999: The Ultimate Search |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OkdqCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA59 |date=June 1999 |publisher=Essence of Vermont |isbn=978-1-928837-00-8 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of Champ captured the interest of [[P. T. Barnum]], and in 1873&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |editor-last=Wheelock |editor-first=J. W. |title=Vermont News |date=27 August 1873 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/365924268/ |newspaper=The Green Mountain Freeman |publisher= |location=Monpelier, Vermont |volume=30 |issue=35 |page=3 |quote=I hereby offer $50,000 for the hide of the great Champlain Serpent to add to my Mammoth World's Fair Show. |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1887&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |title=After a Sea Serpent |date=5 August 1887 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/86365643/ |newspaper=The Daily Post |publisher= |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |volume=45 |issue= |page=4 |quote=P.T. Barnum believes that a huge sea serpent exists, and has renewed his offer of $20,000 for the reptile. |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the famous showman offered rewards for anyone who could bring him the monster.&lt;ref name="csicop.org"/&gt;

[[File:Benjamin Radford and Joe Nickell with Champ eyewitness &amp; photographer Sandra Mansi.jpg|left|upright=1.5|thumb|Sandra Mansi with investigators [[Joe Nickell]] and [[Benjamin Radford]]]]

== Mansi photograph ==
In 1977, Sandra Mansi took a photograph while on vacation with her family that appears to show something sticking out of the lake.&lt;ref name="Fortean Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Radford|date=April 2004|title=Lake Champlain Monster|publisher=Fortean Times|accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire bay of the lake where the photograph reportedly was taken is no deeper than {{convert|14|ft|m}}. According to [[Joe Nickell]], it is unlikely that a giant creature could swim, let alone hide, in such shallow water.&lt;ref name="CSI"/&gt; It has been suggested that the object in the photograph could possibly be a rising tree trunk or log.&lt;ref name="Legend of the Lake Champlain Monster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/legend_of_the_lake_champlain_monster/|title=Legend of the Lake Champlain Monster|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|accessdate=31 October 2010|publisher=The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent reports ==
Champ reportedly can be seen in a video taken by fishermen Dick Affolter and his stepson Pete Bodette in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Adam|url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2006-03-21-voa14.html|title=Is Lake Champlain Home to a Sea Serpent?|date=21 March 2006|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=25 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close examination of the images may be interpreted either as a head and neck of a plesiosaur-like animal and even an open mouth in one frame and a closed mouth in another; or as a fish or eel. Although two retired [[FBI]] forensic image analysts, who reviewed the tape, said it appears authentic and unmanipulated, one of them added that "there's no place in there that I can actually see an animal or any other object on the surface".&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1648547&amp;page=1|title=Is There a Monster in Lake Champlain?|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=25 October 2009|publisher=[[ABC News]]|work=[[Good Morning America|GMA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One piece of evidence, though not a "sighting" per se, is the recording of sounds from within the lake by the Fauna Communications Research Institute in 2003, working as part of a [[Discovery Channel]] program. The group described the sounds as being similar to those produced by Beluga whales or dolphins—neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain.&lt;ref name="Fauna Communications"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Lake's First 'Champ-Hearing' Recorded|date=July 2003|accessdate=13 March 2014|publisher=Burlington Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article describing the recordings has been published to scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Echolocation in a fresh water lake|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/127/3/10.1121/1.3384449|website=Acoustical Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon appearance and "mysterious alligatorlike tracks" found near Lake Champlain, cryptozoologists Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall suggested in 2016 that "Champ" could be a member of the family Crocodylidae (crocodiles). Researcher Scott Mardis explains that the tracks were likely the tracks of a large snapping turtle and also mentions the Longnose Gar or the Lake Sturgeon as more probable candidates for "Champ."&lt;ref name="Croc"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mardis|first1=Scott|editor1-last=Radford|editor1-first=Benjamin|title=A Champlain 'Croc' of Mythic Proportions|journal=Skeptical Briefs|date=Fall 2016|volume=26|issue=3|page=4|publisher=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural importance to New York and Vermont ==
[[File:Champmascot.JPG|right|thumb|Vermont Lake Monsters mascot]]
The Champ legend has become a revenue-generating attraction.&lt;ref name='CSI'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/legend_of_the_lake_champlain_monster/ |title=Legend of the Lake Champlain Monster |accessdate=2010-04-03 |last=Joe |first=Nickell|authorlink=Joe Nickell |date=July–August 2003 |work=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSI]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the village of [[Port Henry, New York|Port Henry]], New York, has erected a giant model of Champ and holds "Champ Day" on the first Saturday of every August. As the mascot of Vermont's lone Minor League Baseball affiliate, the [[Vermont Lake Monsters]], Champ became more prominent after the team was renamed from the Vermont Expos to the Vermont Lake Monsters following the 2005 season. Champ has been the primary attraction of the [[New York–Penn League]] affiliate since their inception. Several nearby establishments, including a car wash, use images of Champ as a logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarwash.com/AboutUs.aspx|title=Champ Touchless Car Wash|website=Champ Touchless Car Wash|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estadio Municipal Bicentenario Germán Becker Baechler''' is a stadium located in [[Temuco]], [[Chile]] and owned by the Temuco municipality. It is the home ground of [[Deportes Temuco]] and also, the former ground of the defunct [[Unión Temuco]] football clubs. It was designed by Enrique Esteve and inaugurated on August 13, 1965. Its dimensions are: 105 x 68 m. It has a capacity of 18,413. It was originally built for the inmates at the Temuco prison. The highest ever recorded attendance was in December 3, 1972 when 32,551 spectators saw the [[Chilean Primera División|Primera Division]] match between [[Deportes Temuco|Green Cross Temuco]] and [[Colo-Colo]].

In 2007 the stadium was selected as a venue for the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], and to comply with [[FIFA]] standards, its facilities were improved, its capacity was decreased from 20,930 to 18,936; and all seats were covered by a roof (from about 80% previously). The athletics track was removed to enhance spectators' enjoyment of the on-the-pitch action. The stadium was re-inaugurated on November 5, 2008.

In 2013 the stadium was the main venue for the [[2013 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy|IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy]].

In April 27, 2013 it hosted a [[2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying]] match between hosts nation [[Chile national rugby union team|Chile]] and [[Brazil national rugby union team|Brazil]]. Chile won 38 - 22 with 10,000 in attendance.

In 2015, three [[Copa América]] matches were played at the stadium.

'''''Fever Pitch''''' (released as '''''The Perfect Catch''''' outside the United States and Canada) is a 2005 [[romantic comedy]] film. It is directed by the [[Farrelly brothers]], and stars [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]]. It is a [[remake]] of the [[Fever Pitch (1997 film)|1997 film]]. [[Nick Hornby]], who had written the original [[Fever Pitch|book]] and the 1997 screenplay adaptation, acted as an executive producer for the American remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=IMDb|title=Fever Pitch: Produced By|date=2005|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332047/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both the book and the original 1997 film are about [[association football]], the 2005 adaptation, aimed at the U.S. market, is about [[baseball]]. Both ''Fever Pitch'' films feature real-life dramatic or unexpected sporting victories, the original focusing on [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] last minute [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|League title win]] in 1989, and the remake on the [[Boston Red Sox]]'s [[2004 World Series]] Championship.

==Plot==
Ben Wrightman, a 7-year-old boy, is going to a [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] game with his Uncle Carl. His uncle, who had no children of his own, treated Ben like a son. A narration explains that on that day, Ben became a [[Red Sox Nation|die-hard Red Sox fan]]. Just about everything he owns bears the Red Sox name, emblem, or image of a Red Sox player (with the exception of his toilet paper, which bears the [[New York Yankees]] insignia). Ben inherited his uncle's season tickets when Carl died from cancer. The story picks up 23 years later with Ben ([[Jimmy Fallon]]) as a school teacher who is immature for his age. He meets Lindsey Meeks ([[Drew Barrymore]]), a professionally successful workaholic executive. When Ben first asks her out, Lindsey rejects him, but she later changes her mind and agrees to go out with him.

On their [[First date (meeting)|first date]], Ben finds Lindsey very sick and vomiting. She has [[food poisoning]] from a new restaurant where she had dined earlier that day. Ben decides to spend the night and take care of her, as well as clean up her bathroom (whimsically telling her it was the "Vomit Elves" that did the work). The next morning, Lindsey, feeling better, finds Ben sleeping on her couch. Ben awakens, and he and Lindsey end up developing a romantic relationship.

Overcoming her initial hesitance, Lindsey becomes attracted to Ben because of his ability to show passionate commitment to something. That spring, he later pretends he is proposing to her but instead asks her to the Red Sox [[Opening Day]], where [[Stephen King]] (a longtime Sox fan) throws the first pitch. Lindsey attends, but not being a baseball or Red Sox fan, she knows nothing about the [[Curse of the Bambino]] or even how to pronounce the name [[Carl Yastrzemski|Yastrzemski]]. The two continue attending the games together until one summer night when Lindsey attempts to catch up on work by taking her laptop to the game.  Not paying attention to the game, she is knocked out by a [[line drive]] [[foul ball]] by then [[Baltimore Orioles]] [[shortstop]] [[Miguel Tejada]] off [[Mike Myers (baseball)|Mike Myers]] (which ends up making the late night sports highlight reel).  She eventually recovers but stops going to the games.

Things take a turn for the worse when Lindsey invites Ben to accompany her to Paris, and he declines the offer because the Red Sox are in the heat of the playoff race. Before leaving for Paris, she tells Ben she is "late" and may be pregnant with his child, though they later learns she is not.  Lindsey starts to become fed up with Ben's [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]] with the Red Sox. Ben agrees to miss a game [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|against the Yankees]] in order to escort Lindsey to her friend's birthday party.  Ben and Lindsey have a wonderful time together, and after making love, he tells her it was one of the best nights of his life.  Moments later, Ben receives a call from his ecstatic friend Troy, who informs him that the Red Sox overcame a seven run deficit in the bottom of the ninth inning to pull off one of the greatest comebacks in team history.  Ben becomes irate that he missed such an historic Red Sox moment, greatly hurting Lindsey's feelings.  After Lindsey miserably declares he has broken her heart, he and Lindsey separate for a while.

Ben soon misses Lindsey and visits her in a futile attempt to reconcile.  He eventually feels her loss so deeply that he plans to sell his season tickets to Chris, the husband of Lindsey's friend Robin (for $125,000 – the price for which Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold [[Babe Ruth]] to the Yankees in 1920), in order to prove that Lindsey means more to him than the Red Sox do.  Lindsey finds out about his plan during the celebration for her much-anticipated promotion.  Immediately leaving the celebration, she rushes to the ballpark to try to stop Ben. She gets in during the 8th inning of the Red Sox—Yankees playoff game when the Sox are just three outs away from being swept.  Ben is actually in the process of signing a contract with Chris as they sit in the stands.  Because she is unable to reach Ben from her section in [[Fenway Park]] in time to stop Ben from signing the contract, Lindsey illegally runs across the field, deftly avoiding security personnel by running behind outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] (and throwing his glove at them) until she finally reaches Ben. She tears Chris' contract in pieces and explains that if Ben loves her enough to sell his seats, then she loves him enough not to allow him to do so.  The two reunite and kiss in front of the entire crowd.

The narrator (Al Waterman) explains how the Red Sox won that game and then beat the Yankees three more times to win the [[American League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], later sweeping the [[National League]] champion [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in four games for their first [[World Series]] title in 86 years, with Lindsay and Ben traveling to [[Busch Stadium (II)|Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis for the decisive Game 4. The two of them also get married, and she gets pregnant. Al explains that the baby will be named after one of the players: [[Ted Williams]] Wrightman if it's a boy, Carla Yastrzemski Wrightman (for [[Carl Yastrzemski]]) if it's a girl, with the narration jokingly hoping for a boy.

==Production==
The original plot had assumed the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] would lose in the playoffs. However, the Sox stunned the baseball world when they won four straight games to win the [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004 ALCS]] against the rival [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] (becoming the first [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] team to win a seven-game series after losing the first three games) and subsequent [[2004 World Series|World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] to break the "[[Curse of the Bambino]]." Thus, the ending had to be rewritten. On the day of Game 4, with the Red Sox on the verge of a sweep, The Farrellys decided to bring Barrymore, Fallon, and a film crew to St. Louis hours before the first pitch – and Barrymore and Fallon attended the game at [[Busch Stadium II|Busch Stadium]] in character. When the Red Sox made the final out to secure a 4-0 win over the Cardinals that broke the Curse, FOX cameras on the live broadcast caught Barrymore and Fallon, as Lindsey and Ben, running onto the field and kissing to celebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sox Change |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,767456,00.html |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first=Whitney |last=Pastorek |date=November 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, with its updated ending, was also screened at Fenway Park the following August as a screen was set up in center field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2015/07/31/you-can-watch-fever-pitch-at-fenway-in-august You can watch ''Fever Pitch'' at Fenway in August] ''[[Boston Globe]]'' via Boston.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Shawn Levy]], who was a huge fan of [[Nick Hornby]]'s works for years, was attached to direct, with [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] playing Lindsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1405285/Can-Hornby-remake-bring-fever-pitch-to-baseball.html|title=Can Hornby Remake Bring Fever Pitch to Baseball?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Paltrow found the script mediocre and turned down the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.notstarring.com/actors/paltrow-gwyneth|work=NotStarring.com|title=Gwyneth Paltrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Robbins]] replaced Levy, but he quit the project as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Variety|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/news/robbins-catches-pitch-from-fox-2000-1117886165/|date=2003|title=Robbins Catches Pitch from FOX}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Drew Barrymore]] replaced Paltrow and [[Jimmy Fallon]] joined the cast, [[Jay Russell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.memphis.edu/magazinearchive/v20i3/feat3.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531200523/http://www.memphis.edu/magazinearchive/v20i3/feat3.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-31|title=Memphis Magazine; Feature}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.J.

===Fan response===
"Sports Guy" [[Bill Simmons]] of [[ESPN]] disliked the film because he regarded it as a "chick flick" disguising itself as a sports movie and said that no Red Sox fan would give up season tickets for love,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} but [[Red Sox Nation]] voted to award Fallon honorary membership for playing Ben so convincingly despite Fallon being a Yankees fan.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Gliding as a sport began in the 1920s. Initially the objective was to increase the duration of flights but soon pilots attempted cross-country flights away from the place of launch. Improvements in aerodynamics and in the understanding of weather phenomena have allowed greater distances at higher average speeds. Long distances are now flown using any of the main sources of rising air: [[Ridge Lift|ridge lift]], [[thermal]]s and [[lee waves]]. When conditions are favourable, experienced pilots can now fly hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields; occasionally flights of more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|0}} are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These [[gliding competitions]] test pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries, and there are biennial [[World Gliding Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;

Techniques to maximize a glider's speed around the day's task in a competition have been developed, including the optimum [[speed to fly]], navigation using [[global positioning system|GPS]] and the carrying of water [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. If the weather deteriorates pilots are sometimes unable to complete a cross-country flight. Consequently, they may need to land elsewhere, perhaps in a field, but [[motorglider]] pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.

Powered-aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other launch methods require assistance and facilities such as airfields, tugs, and winches. These are usually provided by gliding clubs who also train new pilots and maintain high safety standards. Although in most countries the standards of safety of the pilots and the aircraft are the responsibility of governmental bodies, the clubs and sometimes [[national gliding associations]] often have delegated authority.

==History==
The development of heavier-than-air flight in the half century between [[Sir George Cayley's coachman]] in 1853 and the [[Wright brothers]] in 1903 mainly involved gliders (see [[Aviation history]]&lt;!--Insert the focused historical section, please?--&gt;). However, the sport of gliding only emerged after the First World War, as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]],&lt;ref name="ssa history"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in [[Weimar Republic|Germany's Weimar Republic]]. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.&lt;ref&gt;

In the 1930s, gliding spread to many other countries. In the [[Gliding at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin gliding was a [[demonstration sport]], and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the [[1940 Summer Olympics|1940 Games]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{rp|148}} A glider, the [[DFS Olympia Meise|Olympia]], was developed in Germany for the event, but World War II intervened.

Gliding did not return to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a shortage of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.)&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{rp|172}} The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.&lt;ref&gt;

In many countries during the 1950s a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying. Many were also [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical engineers]] who could design, build and maintain gliders. They started both clubs and [[List of gliders|manufacturers]], many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders, for example the membership of the [[Soaring Society of America]] increased from 1,000 to 16,000 by 1980.&lt;ref&gt;

New materials such as [[glass fiber]] and [[carbon fiber]], advances in [[wing]] shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, the [[Global Positioning System]] and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary.

Although there is no Olympic competition, there are the [[World Gliding Championships]]. The first event was held at the Samedan in 1948.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{rp|161}} Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six [[Glider Competition Classes|classes]] open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes.

== Soaring ==
{{main article|Lift (soaring)}}
Glider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining [[potential energy]].&lt;ref name="Soaring"&gt;
{{cite web
 | title = Lift sources 
 | publisher = Soaring Society of America
 | url = http://www.ssa.org/sport/whatissoaring3.asp
 | accessdate = 2010-05-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most commonly used sources of rising air are
*[[thermal]]s (updrafts of warm air);
*[[Ridge Lift|ridge lift]] (found where the wind blows against the face of a hill and is forced to rise); and
*[[Lee waves|wave lift]] ([[standing wave]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], analogous to the ripples on the surface of a stream).

Ridge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about {{convert|600|m|ft}} above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} in flat country and much higher above mountains;&lt;ref name="Soaring" /&gt; wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of {{convert|23202|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Perlan Project |url = http://www.perlanproject.org/press |accessdate = 4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a few countries such as the UK, gliders may continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace,&lt;ref&gt;

but in many European countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching the cloud base (see [[Visual Flight Rules]]).&lt;ref&gt;

===Thermals===
[[File:Thermik.webm|thumb|Circling in thermal lift during a competition]]
[[Image:Gliding comp and cumulus.JPG|thumb|200px|upright|Good gliding weather: Competitors studying  ''[[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] humilis'', which suggest active thermals and light winds.]]
Thermals begin as bubbles of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight.&lt;ref name="Soaring" /&gt; If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}
When the air has little moisture or when an [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or [[dust devil]]s to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a [[variometer]] that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals can be found in the exhaust gases from [[power station]]s or from fires.&lt;ref name="Reichmann"&gt;{{cite book

Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles to keep the glider within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying towards the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as "thermalling". Alternatively, glider pilots on [[Cross-country flying|cross-country flights]] may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances without spending time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]]. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating [[cloud street]]s. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt;{{rp|61}}
[[Image:RidgeSrn.gif|thumb|left|A Scimitar glider ridge soaring in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania USA]]

As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is most effective in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer. During winter the sun's heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.&lt;ref name="met" /&gt;{{rp|108}}

=== Ridge lift ===
[[File:Hangflug.webm|thumb|Using mountain ridges to gain altitude]]
A [[Ridge lift|ridge soaring]] pilot uses upward air movements caused when the wind blows on to the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun.&lt;ref name="ssa history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckey" /&gt;{{rp|135}} In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of [[Fatigue (physical)|exhaustion]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Wave lift ===
[[Image:Lenticular4.jpg.jpeg|thumb|right|A lenticular cloud produced by a mountain wave]]
The powerfully rising and sinking air in [[Lee Wave|mountain waves]] was discovered by glider pilot, [[Wolf Hirth]], in 1933.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{rp|100}} Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary [[oxygen]] to avoid [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name="Eckey" /&gt;{{rp|149}}

This lift is often marked by long, stationary [[lenticular cloud|lenticular]] (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind.&lt;ref name="ssa history" /&gt; Wave lift was used to set the current altitude record (to be ratified) of {{convert|23202|m|ft}} on 2 September 2018 over [[El Calafate]], [[Argentina]].

[[Image:SeaBreeze.svg|thumb|left|Schematic cross section through a sea breeze front. If the air inland is moist, cumulus often marks the front.]]

=== Other sources of lift ===
The boundaries where two air masses meet are known as [[convergence zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100}}
These can occur in [[sea breeze]]s or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary between two masses of air like a shallow [[cold front]]. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.&lt;ref name="Eckey"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Glider pilots have occasionally been able to use a technique called "[[dynamic soaring]]"&lt;ref name="Reichmann"/&gt;{{rp|35}} allowing a glider to gain [[kinetic energy]] by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity. However, such zones of high "[[wind gradient]]" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders.&lt;ref name="Reichmann"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

==Launch methods==
Most gliders do not have engines or at least engines that would allow a take-off under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice for the type of launch being used. [[Glider pilot license|Licensing]] rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.&lt;ref name="CAR401.24"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/Regserv/Affairs/cars/Part4/401.htm#401_24|title = Canadian Aviation Regulations 401.24 Gliders—Privileges|accessdate = 2009-03-06|last = [[Transport Canada]]|date = May 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090120015619/http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/Regserv/Affairs/cars/Part4/401.htm#401_24#401_24|archive-date = 2009-01-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In an aerotow a powered aircraft is attached to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or [[Motor glider#Touring motor gliders|motor gliders]] are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope.&lt;ref name="Piggott"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the [[airframe]] of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails.&lt;ref&gt;

During the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider behind the tow-plane in either the "low tow" position, just below the [[Wake turbulence|wake]] from the tow-plane, or the "high tow" position just above the wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Winch launching===

[[File:Windenstart OBC.webm|200px|left|Winch launch]]
[[Image:Segelflugzeug 01.jpg|200px|left|A DG1000 being winch-launched]]
Gliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based [[winch]] mounted on a heavy vehicle.&lt;ref name="Piggott"/&gt; This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to an aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]], petrol or [[diesel engine|diesel]], though [[hydraulic fluid]] engines and [[electrical motor]]s are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500&amp;nbsp;ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a [[synthetic fiber]], attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride.&lt;ref name="Piggott"/&gt;{{rp|78}} A strong headwind will result in higher launches.
[[Image:Schleppwinde-anspach-taunus001.jpg|thumb|right|A typical winch]]
Winch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A ''weak link'' is a specially calibrated element, connecting two parts of the winch cable, designed to break if the tension on the winch cable exceeds safe values.&lt;/ref&gt; during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.&lt;ref name="Piggott"/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Auto-tow===
Another method of launching, the "autotow", is rarer nowadays.&lt;ref name="Piggott"/&gt; The direct autotow requires a hard surface and a powerful vehicle that is attached to the glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver [[acceleration|accelerates]] hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400&amp;nbsp;metres (1,300&amp;nbsp;ft), especially if there is a good [[headwind]] and a [[runway]] of {{convert|1.5|km|mi}} or more. This method has also been used on desert [[dry lake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

A variation on the direct autotow is known as the "reverse pulley" method. In this method, the truck drives towards the glider being launched. The cable passes around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, resulting in an effect similar to that of a winch launch.&lt;ref name="Piggott"/&gt;

===Bungee launch===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Human-powered transport]] --&gt;
[[Image:Glider bungee launch.JPG|thumb|left|A bungee launch at the [[Long Mynd]] by the Midland Gliding Club]]
Bungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or "[[bungee cord|bungee]]".&lt;ref name="Bungee"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.&lt;ref name = "Bungee" /&gt;

===Gravity launch===
A glider can simply be pushed down a slope until gravity can create enough speed for it to take off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Cross-country==
[[Image:Glider at Mont Blanc.jpg|thumb|right|Glider on a cross-country flight in the Alps]]
One of the measures of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its [[Gliding flight#Glide ratio|glide ratio]]. Glide ratio is dependent on an aircraft's class, and can typically range from 44:1 (for modern designs in the Standard Class) up to 70:1 (for the largest aircraft). A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds.&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather is a major factor in determining cross-country speeds. The record average speed for {{convert|1000|km|mi}} is {{convert|203.1|km/h|mph}}&lt;ref name="records" /&gt; and required unusually good conditions, but even in places with less favorable conditions (such as [[Northern Europe]]) a skilled pilot can expect to complete flights over {{convert|500|km|mi}} every year.&lt;ref name="On Line Contest"&gt;

As the performance of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a ''task'') via [[waypoint|turn-points]], returning to the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Initially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification.

[[File:Gliding competition grid.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Competition [[Gliding competitions#A competition day|grid]] at [[Lasham Airfield]] in 2009]]
National competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the [[Grand Prix gliding|Grand Prix]], has been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;

There is a decentralized Internet-based competition called the [[Online Contest]], in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703&amp;nbsp;pilots registered for this contest in 2010.&lt;ref name="On Line Contest"/&gt;

===Maximizing average speed===
Soaring pioneer [[Paul MacCready]] is usually credited with developing mathematical principles for optimizing the speed at which to fly when cross-country soaring,&lt;ref name = "FAA Handbook"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11-10}} although it was first described by [[Wolfgang Späte]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[speed to fly]] theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a "McCready ring", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt;{{rp|56}}

On cross-country flights on days when strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the [[center of gravity]], which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar.&lt;ref name="FAA Handbook" /&gt;{{rp|5–13}} Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time.&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt;{{rp|63}} If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt;{{rp|64}}

On days with particularly strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down in areas of lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.

The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930.&lt;ref name="origins of badges" /&gt; Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}}, made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least {{convert|50|km|mi|0}}: these three attainments are usually, but not invariably, achieved in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown {{convert|300|km|mi|0}} to a pre-defined goal, has flown {{convert|500|km|mi|0}} in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained {{convert|5000|m|ft}} in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of {{convert|1000|km|mi|0}} and further diplomas for increments of {{convert|250|km|mi|0}}.&lt;ref name="Badges" /&gt;

===Landing out===
[[Image:Glider retrieve.JPG|thumb|left|Glider and its trailer after an outlanding]]
If lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a location to "land out".&lt;ref name="Reichmann" /&gt; Although inconvenient and often mistaken for "[[emergency landing]]s", landing out (or "outlanding") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a location where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging the plane, the pilot, or property such as crops or livestock.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glider and the pilot(s) can then be retrieved by road from the outlanding location using a purpose-built trailer. In some instances, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft.

===Use of engines or motors===
[[Image:Ash-25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schleicher ASH 25|ASH25M]]—a self-launching two-seater glider]]Although adding to the weight and expense, some gliders are fitted with small power units and are known as [[motor glider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids the inconvenience of landing out. The power units can be [[internal combustion]] engines, electrical motors, or retractable [[jet engine]]s. Retractable propellers are fitted to high performance sailplanes, though in another category, called [[Motor glider#Fixed or feathering propeller|touring motor gliders]], non-retractable propellers are used. Some powered gliders are "self launching", which makes the glider independent of a tow plane. However some gliders have "sustainer" engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. All power units have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing out to be made, if there were a failure to start.&lt;ref name="Eckey" /&gt;{{rp|130}}&lt;ref&gt;

In a competition, using the engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for starting the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot.&lt;ref&gt;

To avoid other gliders and [[general aviation]] traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. They also usually wear [[parachute]]s. In several European countries and Australia, the [[FLARM]] warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders.&lt;ref&gt;

==Training and regulation==
[[File:Schleicher ASK13 glider.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Schleicher ASK 13]], a typical training glider]]
In addition to national laws controlling aviation, the sport in many countries is regulated through national gliding associations and then through local gliding clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.

Many clubs provide training for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the [[airmanship]] necessary to fly solo.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flight simulator|Simulators]] are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first solo flights glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the regulation of pilots, gliders are inspected annually and after exceeding predetermined flight times. Maximum and minimum [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]]s are also defined for each glider. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for a pilot, after allowing for a parachute, is usually {{convert|103|kg|lb}}. There is also a limit, 193 centimetres (6&amp;nbsp;ft 4&amp;nbsp;in), on the tallest pilots who can safely fit into a typical glider's cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;

==Challenges for the gliding movement==
According to the FAI President, gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;

*Time pressures on participants: gliding typically takes whole days that many people today find harder to devote. As a result, the average age of glider pilots is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/059%20British%20Gliding%20Association.pdf Letter by British Gliding Association to Government Equalities Office 29 Sep 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite journal

*In some countries, the need for more land for housing is threatening small airfields. These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate.&lt;ref&gt;

*Competition from other activities: there is now a greater variety of similar sports such as [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]] that may attract potential glider pilots.&lt;ref name="Membership"/&gt;
*Lack of publicity: without coverage by television or popular publications, many people are unaware that gliding is even a sport. Without this knowledge the public may have a poor understanding of how flying without an engine is possible and safe.&lt;ref&gt;

==Related air sports==
The two air sports that are most closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are significant differences which are listed in detail in [[Template:Comparison of sailplanes hang gliders and paragliders|a comparison of sailplanes hang gliders and paragliders]]. The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |title       = Hang Gliding
 |publisher   = Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Aeronautique
 |url         = http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/hang_gliding

 |archivedate = 2010-04-27
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air.&lt;ref&gt;

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. [[Radio-controlled glider|Radio-controlled gliding]] uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.&lt;ref&gt;

'''James Fuggles''' was an English [[cricket]]er in the 18th century.  He was a [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] batsman who played in all three recorded matches in 1772 and made his final known appearance in 1773.  In his four recorded appearances, he played 8 innings and scored 51 runs with a top score of 21.  

He was a regular player before the sport's ''statistical record'' began in 1772 but little is known of him.  There are scattered references to him playing in major matches during the 1760s.

The '''kung fu shoe''', also known as a "[[Tai Chi]] shoe" or as a "[[martial arts]] slipper", is a type and style of cloth slip-on shoe that is traditionally made in China, and was originally worn while practicing [[kung fu]] and other martial arts, and also while performing [[Tai Chi]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtaichiday.org/tai_chi_qigong_terms_tips_tcm/tai_chi_qigong_wardrobe_for_class.html|title=What to Wear to Your Tai Chi or Qigong (chi kung) Classes, Wardrobe Considerations|work=worldtaichiday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variants of this shoe are now mass-produced for general-purpose wear, and there are several slightly different styles. These shoes are inexpensive and are available worldwide.

One common kind is cheaply produced and is typically black, with minimal lining; it has a low-sided cloth upper, and a pale brown hard plastic sole. One variant is made as a lace-up shoe rather than a slip-on shoe. A version of the shoe for girls and women has a buckle strap and resembles the [[Mary Jane (shoe)|Mary Jane]] shoe. Some varieties of the kung fu shoe have reinforced cotton soles instead of plastic ones, and some have rubber soles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9638">A '''lacrosse stick''' or '''crosse''' is used to play the sport of [[lacrosse]].  Players use the lacrosse stick to handle the [[lacrosse ball|ball]] and to strike or "check" opposing players' sticks, causing them to drop the ball. The head of a lacrosse stick is roughly triangular in shape and is strung with loose netting that allows the ball to be caught, carried (known as "cradling"), passed, or shot.

==Traditional stick==
[[File:Wooden sticks.jpg|left|thumbnail|A pair of wood lacrosse sticks.]]
A wood lacrosse stick is usually crafted from [[hickory]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/03/11/a-lacrosse-game-with-the-1867-touches.html "A lacrosse game with the 1867 touches"]. ''Toronto Star'',  Mary Ormsby, March 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The lacrosse stick is given its shape through [[steam bending]].  Holes are drilled in the top portion of the head and the sidewall (''i.e.'', the side of the stick head), permitting weaving of  string, which is then hardened by dipping the in [[resin]].  [[Leather]] "runners" are strung from the top of the "head" to the "throat" of the stick.  Then nylon string is woven in to create the pocket.&lt;ref name="stickmaker"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stick Maker|url=http://redhawkslax.com/history/the-stick-maker/|publisher=Onondaga Redhawks}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stick Diagram.png|right|thumbnail|Diagram of Mitchell Brothers wooden lacrosse goalie stick.]]
The wooden lacrosse stick dates back to the creation of the sport and is still made by craftsmen around the world. Though modern lacrosse sticks made of plastic have become the overwhelming choice for contemporary lacrosse players, traditional wooden lacrosse sticks are still commonly used by [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|box lacrosse goaltenders]], senior and masters players, and by women's [[field lacrosse]] players. Wooden sticks are still legal under [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]] and NCAA rules but are subject to the same size regulations as modern lacrosse sticks. The only exception to this is the [[Western Lacrosse Association]], which prohibited the use of wooden sticks by non-goaltenders some years ago. The last WLA player to use one was A.J. Smith of the [[Coquitlam Adanacs]], c. 2003–04, who had been [[grandfathered]].

==Men's modern stick==
===Head===
[[Image:lacrosse head diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Diagram of a Men's Lacrosse Stick Head]]
In 1970, the first patent (US Patent #3,507,495) for a synthetic lacrosse stick was issued to [[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= US Pat #3,507,495 'Lacrosse Stick' Tucker et al|url=http://www.prior-ip.com/patent/2614716/lacrosse-stick?q=BURNETT%20&amp;%20CO%20WM%20T}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern lacrosse stick consists of a plastic molded head attached to a metal shaft. The head is strung with nylon or leather strings to form a pocket. The dimensions of the stick (length, width, sidewall height, and depth of the pocket) are governed by league rules, such as [[NCAA]] rules for collegiate players or [[Federation of International Lacrosse|FIL]] rules for international players.

[[File:Lacrosse stick 8028.jpg|thumb|Field goalie's stick.]]
In men's lacrosse, the head of the stick must be {{convert|6|to|10|in|cm}} wide at its widest point under [[NCAA]] rules. Most stick are the minimum 6 inches wide. The head of the [[Goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]'s stick is much larger and must be between 10 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches wide under NCAA rules or up to 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide under FIL rules.&lt;ref name="ncaa17rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Men's Lacrosse 2017 and 2018 Rules|url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/LC18.pdf|publisher=NCAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=14}}&lt;ref name="fil17rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=2017-2018 Rules of Men’s Field Lacrosse|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/men/Rules/FIL_MF_Rulebook_2017-2018-A4v1-1.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=7}} The sidewalls of the head may not be more than two inches tall.

===Pocket===
The pocket of the head is where the ball is carried and caught. It consists of interwoven string attached to the head. Traditional stringing with leather strings interwoven with nylon has declined in popularity in favor of synthetic mesh stringing. Mesh is typically made of nylon and comes in a variety of diamond configurations, which can affect the pocket's throwing and retention characteristics. 

The typical mesh pocket uses four main nylon strings to affix the mesh piece to the head: a topstring, two sidewalls, and a bottom string. The topstring is often made of a slightly thicker string, in order to resist the abrasive forces that come from scooping the ball up. The sidewalls are used to affix individual mesh diamonds to the sidewall holes on the sidewall of the head. The sidewalls have the most effect on the pocket's performance, as they dictate the placement of the pocket in the head, the tightness of the channel of the pocket, and even the pocket depth. The bottom string is used to fine-tune the pocket depth, and serves to keep the ball from slipping through the bottom of the pocket.

[[File:Lacrosse head.jpg|thumb|right|A legal men's pocket where the top of the ball is above the bottom of the stick's sidewall.]]

In addition to the four strings used to affix the mesh piece, shooting strings are woven through the diamonds of the mesh in order to help fine-tune the pocket's characteristics.  They can either be made of typical nylon string, or a hockey style lace. Shooting strings are often used in straight, U, or V shapes.  They serve to increase the pocket's hold on the ball, as well as fine-tune the way the stick throws. They can act to change the tension of various portions of the pocket, helping to create a "ramp" for the ball to roll along as it exits the pocket.

As of the 2013 season, the NCAA has passed a rule stating that shooting strings are limited to an area within a 4-inch arc drawn from the top of the plastic of the scoop.This essentially eliminates U- or V-shaped shooting strings, as they almost always cross below the 4-inch line. The pocket depth is governed by rule as well. When the ball is placed in the deepest point, the top of the ball must not be below the bottom of the sidewall.&lt;ref name=ncaa17rules /&gt;{{rp|page=15}}

===Shaft===
Modern handles, more commonly referred to as "shafts," are made of hollow metal. They are usually octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are still made from other materials, including wood, plastic, or [[fiberglass]]. The open end of the hollow shaft must be covered with tape or a plug (commonly referred to as the "butt" or "butt end" of the stick), usually made of rubber.  The head of the stick is usually attached to the shaft with a screw to keep it in place.

Stick length is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks (including the head) be from 40 to 42&amp;nbsp;inches long for offensive players, 52 to 72&amp;nbsp;inches long for defensemen, and 40 to 72&amp;nbsp;inches long for goalies.&lt;ref name=equipment&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment |title=Player Equipment |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the minimum length (40&amp;nbsp;inches) in order to give them the advantage of having a shorter stick to protect from defensive checks.  Conversely, defensive players usually prefer their sticks to be the maximum length (72&amp;nbsp;inches) to permit them the greatest range in covering their offensive player.

In 2016, a rules clarification was made by the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Rules Committee. Questions have arisen regarding the alteration of the shaft circumference. The circumference of the shaft cannot exceed 3 1/2". To be clear, added tape to the shaft must not make the shaft exceed this circumference measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/2016DIMLA_MEMO_2.2.16_Interpretations_and_Clarifications_020516.pdf|title = 2016 Rules Updates and Clarifications|date = February 4, 2016|access-date = |website = NCAA|publisher = NCAA|last = Scalise|first = Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:warrior diamonds.jpg|center|frame|Three offensive-player length shafts for men's lacrosse]]

==Women's modern stick==
In women's lacrosse, the stick dimensions are similar except the pocket depth is much shallower. NCAA rules dictate that the head of a woman's stick may be from seven to nine inches wide, and must be strung traditionally, with a pocket formed by a grid of leather strings.  Nylon mesh stringing, permitted in men's sticks, is not permitted in women's sticks; however, the goalkeeper's stick head may be up to 12&amp;nbsp;inches wide and is allowed to be strung with nylon mesh. The legal depth of a women's stick pocket is determined by the following test: the top of the lacrosse ball, when placed in the pocket, must remain above the top edge of the sidewall. Women's sticks can be 35.5 to 43.25&amp;nbsp;inches long.&lt;ref name=womenequipment&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women |title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse |publisher=US Lacrosse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long slow distance training is a form of [[continuous training]] performed at a constant pace of low to moderate intensity over an extended distance or duration.&lt;ref name="Gamble"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamble |first1=Paul |authorlink1= |title=Strength and Conditioning for Team Sports: Sport-Specific Physical Preparation for High Performance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNBikBqCtU0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge / Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-49626-1 |pages=67–68 |chapter=Metabolic conditioning for team sports |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNBikBqCtU0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moderate training intensity of LSD is effective in improving endurance and [[VO2 max|maximum oxygen uptake]] in individuals who are undertrained or moderately trained.&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt; Long slow distance training is thought not to be effective when used in isolation by well-trained athletes, who in order to achieve further improvements in metabolic conditioning require higher training intensities that are not sustainable at the work durations associated with LSD.&lt;ref name="Gamble"/&gt;

==History==
[[Tim Noakes]], a professor of exercise and sports science at the [[University of Cape Town]], suggests that it was [[Arthur F. H. Newton|Arthur Newton]] who initially proposed that running longer distances at slower paces was the most effective training method for beginning runners.&lt;ref name="Noakes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noakes |first1=Tim |authorlink1=Tim Noakes |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=The Lore of Running |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAa9qq9kbncC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition=4th |series= |volume= |year=2003 |origyear= |publisher=Human Kinetics |location= |language= |isbn= 978-0-87322-959-3 |oclc= |doi= |page= |pages=278, 286–289 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Developing a Training Foundation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAa9qq9kbncC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noakes asserts that after this method was rediscovered in the 1960s, [[Joe Henderson (runner)|Joe Henderson]] coined the term "long slow distance".&lt;ref name="Noakes"/&gt;

==Joe Henderson==
Long slow distance running was promoted as a training method by [[Joe Henderson (runner)|Joe Henderson]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson|first= Joe|authorlink= Joe Henderson (runner)|title= Long, Slow Distance|year= 1969|publisher= Tafnews Press |location= Mountain View CA 94040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henderson saw his approach as providing an alternative to the dominant school of training for distance running which he called “PTA school of running&amp;nbsp;– the pain, torture, and agony” approach.  He documented the success of six competitive runners who followed in one form or another an LSD training regime, sometimes combining a few more strenuous workouts with the regular long slow distance running with weekly mileages ranging from 50-60 to 120–150 miles per week, with marathon personal bests between 2:14 and 2:50 hours.&lt;ref name="Henderson" /&gt; In addition, there are ultra-marathoners who use a similar method for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Slow Train to Fitness|journal=Outside Magazine|date=April 1996|first=Mark|last=Jannot|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://outside.away.com/outside/magazine/0496/9604bsft.html|accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical 5k runner might consider 8 to 10 miles of LSD, while a marathoner might run 20 or more miles. LSD runs are typically done at an easy pace, 1–3 minutes per mile slower than a runner's 10k pace. The objectives of these runs are to build blood volume and to increase muscle strength, endurance, and aerobic fitness.

Henderson’s book was not only directed at competitive runners, but also at runners who wanted to have fun running.  He writes, “LSD isn't just a training method. It's a whole way of looking at the sport. Those who employ it are saying running is fun&amp;nbsp;– all running, not just the competitive part which yields rewards.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henderson|title= Long, Slow Distance|year=1969}} [http://www.joehenderson.com/lsdbook/ Original Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson would later write that he stopped using LSD as "misleading term" shortly after the publication of ''Long Slow Distance''. (see: Henderson, Joe. ''Marathon Training'' (2003), 2nd edition, Human Kinetics, {{ISBN|978-0736051910}}, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to running==
During the [[running boom of the 1970s]], many recreational runners used LSD as a basis for training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Glover|author2=Shepherd|title= The Runner’s Handbook|year= 1978}}p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One of the "fathers" of the [[Honolulu Marathon]], cardiologist [[Jack Scaff]] used a long slow distance approach to train runners in his marathon clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osman |first=Mark Hazard|authorlink= |title= The Honolulu Marathon|year=2006|publisher=Lulu.com |location=|isbn=0-9673079-2-9 }}[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZkG5BMoEWcC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Honolulu Marathon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honolulumarathon.org/?s=halloffame&lt;/ref&gt; Scaff advised his runners to follow the "talk test", an idea that had originated from Lydiard in which runners should be going slow enough to be able to hold a conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The rules of the road|journal=Sports Illustrated|date= 27 February 1978|first=Kenny|last=Moore|volume=|issue=|url=|format=|pages=62}}[http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Jack+Scaff+Honolulu+Duncan+MacDonald+Willy+Williamson+Hawaii+Waikiki+Jeff+Wells+-+SI+Vault&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=27497636&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1093368%2Findex.htm&amp;partnerID=289881]&lt;/ref&gt; According to sportswriter John Brant in his 2006 book ''[[Duel in the Sun (book)|Duel in the Sun]]'', almost every serious distance runner in the early 1980s used Lydiard's system of building an endurance base with many miles at an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic pace]] before running shorter distances at an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic pace]].&lt;ref name="Brant 2006 62"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brant|first=John|title=Duel In The Sun: Alberto Salazar, Dick Beardsley, and America's greatest marathon|publisher=Rodale|year=2006|pages=62|isbn=1-59486-262-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCxj_PUyvycC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Duel+in+the+Sun&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting out with an hour run, three times a week, and building up to weekly averages of 40 to 60 miles a week for the last three months, thousands of graduates of the program have found that they could complete the full [[Honolulu Marathon]] which is held every year in beginning of December. The clinic’s approach can be seen from its original Rules of the Road, now referred to as the "basic set of rules that lay the foundation for your training."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scaff Jr |first=Jack |authorlink= |title= Your First Marathon: The Last Word in Long-Distance Running|year=2011|publisher=Belknap Publishing &amp; Design, LLC |location=Honolulu, Hawaii |isbn=978-0-9816403-1-0 }}p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
:The rules:
:*No fewer than three runs per week
:*No more than five runs per week
:*No less than one hour per run
:*No farther than 15 miles on any run
:*One run per week lasting two hours or more (after month 5)&lt;ref&gt;The Honolulu Marathon Clinic offers a shorter form of the rules:
:*Train for at least an hour, three times a week.
:*Train no more than four times a week.
:*Pass the "talk" test while training.
:*Drink water every 20 minutes [http://honolulumarathonclinic.org/rules-of-the-road/ HMC]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the LSD approach is to combine running slowly with walking breaks. 
:"It has been found that average runners will have more success if they take regular walk breaks.
:"The strategy is unusual in that it doesn't involve simply walking when you are tired. Walk-break runners force themselves to stop even at the beginning of a run when they are fresh."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://waddleon.com/HTML/media_WALLSTREET.shtml Parker-Pope, Tara; ''This Jogging Method Turns Out-of-Shape Into Runners''  Wall Street Journal, 25 May 2007. Access date: 2007-05-25]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such an approach is provided by the running clinics organized by [[Jeff Galloway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/walk_breaks.html |title=Running Injury Free with Jeff Galloway |accessdate=2007-05-25 |last=Galloway |first=Jeff |date=2001-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521025439/http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/walk_breaks.html |archivedate=2007-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In running circles, [[John Bingham (runner)|John Bingham]] aka the Penguin, is a well-known practitioner of LSD combined with walking breaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnbingham.com/ John Bingham], retrieved 2007-05-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Arthur Lydiard wrote that LSD system of training does not reach the levels of effort most effective for building aerobic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lydiard  |first1=Arthur |authorlink1=Arthur Lydiard |last2=Gilmour |first2=Garth |authorlink2= |title=Running With Lydiard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBdgRAn_w_0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |type= |edition=2nd |series= |volume= |year=2007 |origyear=2000 |publisher=Meyer &amp; Meyer Sport |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84126-026-6 |page=15 |chapter=The Physiology of Exercise |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBdgRAn_w_0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pete Pfitzinger]] has written that the long slow distance method of training is acceptable for novice runners hoping to complete a marathon, but that more experienced runners benefit from long runs that, depending on the workout, incorporate a variety of paces including speeds approaching race pace.&lt;ref name="Pfitzinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pfitzinger |first=Pete |authorlink=Pete Pfitzinger |date=January–February 2007 |title=The Pfitzinger Lab Report |journal=Running Times |volume= |series= |issue=343 |page=14 |publisher=Rodale, Inc. |issn=0147-2968 |accessdate=April 24, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pfitzinger, varying paces are necessary because different physiological adaptations, including increased glycogen storage and fat utilization, occur at specific training paces.&lt;ref name="Pfitzinger"/&gt;

Galloway points out that if a runner wishes to increase their speed, [[interval training]] or [[high-intensity interval training|speed training]] is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galloway |first1=Jeff |authorlink1=Jeff Galloway |title=Galloway's Book on Running |year=1984 |publisher=Shelter Publications |isbn=978-0-936070-03-2 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson uses races as speedwork and is a proponent of speedwork in limited quantities.

The scientific literature indicates that high-intensity training can provide greater benefit towards anaerobic capacity than moderate-intensity endurance training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8897392 | volume=28 | title=Effects of moderate-intensity endurance and high-intensity intermittent training on anaerobic capacity and VO2max | date=October 1996 | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | pages=1327–30 | last1 = Tabata | first1 = I | last2 = Nishimura | first2 = K | last3 = Kouzaki | first3 = M | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | doi=10.1097/00005768-199610000-00018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Army is reducing the use of long runs in its physical training programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/02/26/1986-military-playing-down-long-runs-adopting-more-diverse-fitness-programs/ Military Playing Down Long Runs, Adopting More Diverse Fitness Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mass games''' or '''mass gymnastics''' are a form of [[performing arts]] or [[gymnastics]] in which large numbers of performers take part in a highly regimented performance that emphasizes group dynamics rather than individual prowess.

==North Korea==
Mass games are now performed only in the [[Rungrado May Day Stadium]] (the [[List of stadiums by capacity|highest capacity stadium in the world]]) but in the '90s there were mass games held at the [[Kim Il-sung Stadium]]. Mass Games can basically be described as a synchronized [[socialist realism|socialist-realist]] spectacular, featuring over 100,000 participants in a 90-minute display of gymnastics, dance, acrobatics, and dramatic performance, accompanied by music and other effects, all wrapped in a highly politicized package. Students practiced every day from January onwards. The 90 minute performance is held every evening at 7pm and features the 'largest picture in the world' a giant mosaic of individual students each holding a book whose pages links with their neighbours’ to make up one gigantic scene. When the students turn the pages the scene or individual elements of the scene change, up to 170 pages make up one book.

According to [[Kim Jong-il]], the philosophy behind the events was that:

{{quote|Developing mass gymnastics is important in training schoolchildren to be fully developed communist people. To be a fully developed communist man, one must acquire a revolutionary ideology, the knowledge of many fields, rich cultural attainments and a healthy and strong physique. These are the basic qualities required of a man of the communist type. Mass gymnastics play an important role in training schoolchildren to acquire these communist qualities. Mass gymnastics foster particularly healthy and strong physiques, a high degree of organization, discipline and collectivism in schoolchildren. The schoolchildren, conscious that a single slip in their action may spoil their mass gymnastic performance, make every effort to subordinate all their thoughts and actions to the collective.|Kim Jong-il, ''On Further Developing Mass Gymnastics: Talk to mass Gymnastics Producers.  April 11th 1987''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Jong-il|title=On Further Developing Mass Gymnastics: Talk to Mass Gymnastics Producers April 11, 1987|url=https://www.korea-dpr.com/lib/Kim%20Jong%20Il%20-%205/ON%20FURTHER%20DEVELOPING%20MASS%20GYMNASTICS.pdf|year=1987|publisher=Foreign Languages Publishing House|location=Pyongyang|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Outside North Korea==
===Guyana===
Guyana under the leader [[Forbes Burnham]] held mass games. They were first held in February 1980 to commemorate the founding of the [[Co-operative Republic of Guyana]] &lt;ref&gt;https://apjjf.org/2015/13/4/Moe-Taylor/4258.html&lt;/ref&gt;
===Europe===
In Germany, [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] developed an efficient gymnastics method called Massenturnen. For propagating Massenturnen, Germany started Massenturnen show ([[:de:Deutsches Turnfest]]).

Mass games developed alongside 19th century [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements, particularly the Czech [[Sokol]] movement.

In [[Romania]], the [[Communist Romania|communist government]] organized compulsory mass games after [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] and [[Elena Ceaușescu|his wife]] had visited the [[People's Republic of China]] and saw such games there. These were the hardest working days of the year since every individual was required to participate along with his fellow workers. Being late on this day or not shouting the party leader's name loudly enough would lead to being reported by fellow workers to prosecutors.

In [[Bulgaria]], mass games were occasionally held during the ''Zname na mira'' ("Flag of Peace") international youth festivals. However, Bulgaria did not have a tradition of mass games, and performances were rare.

===Other===
In [[Japan]], schools adopted German gymnastics and mass games were started. Since 1925, mass games were played in Meiji Jingū Kyōgi Taikai (Meiji Shrine Sports Competition).

==Current performances==

Today, mass games are regularly performed only in [[North Korea]], where they take place to celebrate national holidays such as the birthdays of former rulers [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. In recent years, they have been the main attraction of the [[Arirang Festival]] in Pyongyang. The 2004 documentary film by VeryMuchSo Productions and Koryo Tours ''[[A State of Mind]]'' details the training of two young girls from Pyongyang who perform in the mass games. 

Arirang mass games were first performed in 2002 in Pyongyang's May Day Stadium and have been held every year since &amp;ndash; between August and October and on one occasion in Spring. The show was on 4 times a week. Tourists from all over the World were welcomed to the DPRK during Mass Games.

[[Sokol]] organization for [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and other.  [[Eastern Europe]]an youth athletic organize exposition, competition, and nationalist identity building event organized called '''Slet'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sokolusachicago.com/History.html |title=History |accessdate=22 December 2008 |publisher=SOKOL USA CHICAGO GYMNASTICS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''slet'' means 'a gathering of falcons'.  The first Sokol slet was held in 1882 in [[Prague]] to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Sokol organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bednar, Charles and Sivak, Paul: ''The Sokols and Their Endeavor''. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994 it is held every six years.

It is also possible to consider the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games as instances of mass games.

'''Old Bailey Stadium''' was a 3,000-seat [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Clinton, South Carolina]]. It was the former home of [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian College football]] and, at the time of its demolition, the home for Presbyterian men's and women's lacrosse teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gobluehose.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=18100&amp;ATCLID=3668557&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium opened before the opening game of the [[1928 college football season|1928 season]], and its first game saw the Blue Hose fall to [[Mercer Bears football|Mercer]], 6–7. It served as the home for PC football until the first two games of the [[2002 NCAA Division II football season|2002 season]]. Its last football game was the 2002 home opener, against [[Charleston Southern Buccaneers football|Charleston Southern]], which PC won 26–6.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gobluehose.com/fls/18100/SPORTS/football/2016/2016PresbyterianFootballMediaDayNotes-Final.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=18100&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6927">In the sport of [[golf]], a '''penalty''' or '''penalty stroke''' is an additional stroke or strokes added to a player's score for an infraction of the [[rules of golf|rules]]. In [[match play]], rather than adding strokes, the usual penalty is loss of the hole except for penalties assessed for relief from a hazard or a lost ball.

Situations in which a penalty may be assessed include, but are not limited to:

* Declaring your ball unplayable in its current lie. This technically violates one of the primary rules - "Play the ball as it lies", but the rules provide for relief when a ball is in a position where the player does not wish to attempt to play it. Examples include when the ball lies among tree roots or rocks ("between a rock and a hard place"), underneath shrubbery, etc. and attempting to play it would result in damage to the club or the course. A substitute ball is dropped or placed at a penalty of one stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule28.html Rules of Golf: Rule 28]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hitting the ball into a situation where it cannot be played as it lies even if the player wishes it, such as into a [[water hazard]] (players are allowed to play the ball out of a water hazard without penalty, but it is rarely practical unless the hazard is only a few inches deep), out-of-bounds, or into an area where it becomes lost. A substitute ball is then played at a one-stroke penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule27.html#27 Rules of Golf: Rule 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule26.html#26-2 Rules of Golf: Rule 26-2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hitting the wrong ball, which is any ball other than the ball hit from the tee by that player, or dropped or placed as a substitute or provisional ball. Examples of a wrong ball are another player's ball or an abandoned ball. This is a two-stroke penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule15.html#15-3 Rules of Golf: Rule 15-3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Picking up your ball, except under certain circumstances such as for identification, to determine if it is cut, split or otherwise unfit for play, to clear the path of another player's ball on the [[putting green]], or to clear loose debris such as leaves or twigs from under or around it. &lt;ref name="Rules of Golf: Rule 18-2"&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule18.html#18-2 Rules of Golf: Rule 18-2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Picking up anyone else's ball, except for identification when the location of the ball in question or another in play is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule18.html#18-3 Rules of Golf: Rule 18-3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interfering with a moving ball; the ball must come to rest completely before it can be addressed again by the player, and players may not deflect or stop a ball in motion by any means. Players who deliberately interfere with any moving ball receive a two-stroke penalty. Incidental, unavoidable contact is generally not penalized, and additional rules determine how the ball must be played (generally as it lies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule19.html#19-2 Rules of Golf: Rule 19-2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule01.html#1-2 Rules of Golf: Rule 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Playing a ball out-of-turn or while someone else's ball is in motion. After teeing off, players must play their balls in the order of their distance from the hole. Playing out-of-turn is a one-stroke penalty. The only exception is while on the putting green, when a fellow player's ball obstructs the current player's and the current player wishes the other player to play it rather than lift and mark it. &lt;ref name="Rules of Golf: Rule 18-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule22.html#22-2 Rules of Golf: Rule 22-2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cleaning a ball while it is in play, except when the ball is on the green, for identification, or to determine if the ball is unfit for play (a ball is not unfit simply because it is dirty; however a cut or split may be hidden by dirt).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule21.html Rules of Golf: Rule 21]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Equipment violations such as too many clubs (more than 14) in a player's bag or using a ball or club of illegal design. Illegal balls include balls of improper size or weight (less than 1.68" or more than 1.62oz), floating balls, balls with dimples of the wrong size or depth, and "novelty" balls such as exploding or disintegrating balls.  In the case of an illegal ball, the player adds two strokes for every hole on which that ball was put in play.  Illegal clubs include clubs with a clubhead greater than 460cc, clubs with a concave face, shaft lengths over 48", grips with waisting, bulges or dis-symmetry, etc.  In the case of a violation regarding clubs, the player adds two strokes for every hole of the current round played before the violation was discovered. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule04.html#4-4 Rules of Golf: Rule 4-4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/books/rules/rule05.html#5-1 Rules of Golf; Rule 5-1]&lt;/ref&gt;
When a penalty is incurred because the ball has been lost or hit into an unplayable area, the player plays a new ball or moves the current one according to the rules governing the situation in which the substitution or placement occurs. This may be from the spot at which they hit the ball into that position (a '''stroke and distance penalty'''), a playable point directly in line with the hole and behind its current position, or in some circumstances at a point two clublengths or less and no closer to the hole from which the ball crossed the boundary of the unplayable condition. If the player elects to move an unplayable ball in a [[bunker (golf)|sand trap]], the ball must remain in the hazard.

The penalty stroke assessed is not the stroke made on the new ball; it is counted in addition to any and all swings made at the ball. For instance, hitting a ball into a water hazard, dropping a new ball at the position from which you hit the last one, then hitting the new ball counts as three strokes, not two.

However, under certain circumstances during informal games, especially involving novice players, the penalty stroke is not counted; the player simply drops a ball at the spot of the last hit and plays again. This is an unmitigated violation of several rules of the game which would normally call for disqualification from sanctioned play, but can help make the game more enjoyable in a friendly setting as well as increasing the pace, as it reduces searching for a ball and playing from extremely disadvantageous lies. When an errant shot is re-played from the same spot, it is called a [[mulligan (games)|mulligan]] and neither the first shot nor the penalty stroke is counted.

'''Spot-fixing''' refers to illegal activity in a sport in which a specific aspect of a game, unrelated to the final result but upon which a betting market exists, is fixed in an attempt to ensure a certain result in a [[proposition bet]]; examples include something as minor as timing a no ball or wide delivery in [[cricket]], or timing the first throw-in or corner in association football.

Spot-fixing attempts to defraud bookmakers by a player taking a pre-arranged action to fix the result of that specific event.&lt;ref name="mehaffey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE63S1LK20100829 |title=Q+A-Cricket-Spot fixing latest threat to game's integrity &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2010 | first=John | last=Mehaffey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spot-fixing differs from [[match fixing]], in which the final result of a match is fixed; or [[point shaving]], in which corrupt players (or officials) attempt to limit the margin of victory of the favoured team. Spot-fixing is more difficult to detect than match fixing or point shaving, and by its nature can be perpetrated by a lone fraudulent player without needing any other players or officials to co-operate. The growth of [[Internet gambling]] and increased variety of betting options (''e.g.'' [[spread betting]], first-scorer betting) resulted in the emergence of spot-fixing, particularly through the first decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Twenty20"&gt;{{cite news|last=Selvey |first=Mike |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/15/spot-fixing-cricket-mike-selvey |title=Spotting spot-fixing is harder than ever in Twenty20 era &amp;#124; Mike Selvey &amp;#124; Sport |publisher=The Guardian |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Association football===
Following his retirement, [[Matt Le Tissier]] admitted that he had bet on the timing of the first throw-in in a match he played for Southampton against Wimbledon in 1995. The plan failed when a teammate who was unaware of the scam managed to keep his underhit pass on the pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson |first=Steve |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/southampton/6130280/Matthew-Le-Tissier-admits-being-part-of-attempted-betting-scam-at-Southampton.html |title=Matthew Le Tissier admits being part of attempted betting scam at Southampton |publisher=Telegraph |date=3 September 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Le Tissier was forced to quickly kick the ball from play to prevent losing money on the bet and managed to "push" after kicking the ball out after 70 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/8250042.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Hampshire &amp;#124; Le Tissier in police bet inquiry |publisher=BBC News |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he felt so silly about the incident that he never attempted it again.

===Cricket===
Spot fixing in cricket first came to international prominence in the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|2010 Pakistan tour of England]], when it was determined that Pakistani players [[Mohammad Asif]] and [[Mohammad Amir]] intentionally bowled no-balls on specific deliveries as part of a conspiracy involving captain [[Salman Butt]] to defraud bookmakers. As a result, Salman Butt was banned for ten years, Asif for seven years and Amir for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/pakistan/7970316/Pakistan-match-fixing-claim-what-is-spot-fixing.html |title=Pakistan match-fixing claim: what is spot-fixing? |publisher=Telegraph |date= 29 August 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter became a criminal investigation that resulted in custodial sentences for four people involved; in November 2011, Butt was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, with Asif being imprisoned for one year and Amir jailed for six months.

In India, [[2012 Indian Premier League spot-fixing case|five players]] in [[2012_Indian_Premier_League|IPL Season 5 (2012)]] were suspended for spot-fixing. The five players were [[Mohnish Mishra]], [[Shalabh Srivastava]], [[TP Sudhindra]], Harmeet Singh and Abhinav Bali. The suspensions were not for any specific event during the season, but a [[sting operation]] revealed all five either discussing earlier cases of spot-fixing they had been involved in, or seeking future spot-fixing opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BCCI suspends five players accused in spot-fixing|url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/IPL-2012-BCCI-suspends-five-players-accused-in-spot-fixing/14619|publisher=Cricketcountry.com|accessdate=15 May 2012|author=CricketCountry Staff|date=15 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519050951/http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/IPL-2012-BCCI-suspends-five-players-accused-in-spot-fixing/14619|archivedate=19 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, [[2013 Indian Premier League spot-fixing and betting case|three Indian players]] in [[2013_Indian_Premier_League|IPL Season 6 (2013)]] were arrested for spot-fixing: [[Sreesanth]], [[Ankeet Chavan]] and [[Ajit Chandila]]. Along with them, eleven bookmakers were arrested. The Delhi Police arrested the three players in a post-midnight operation in Mumbai on 16 May 2013 for accepting payments of up to Rs. 6&amp;nbsp;million, for giving away a pre-determined number of runs in an over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DNA Webdesk|title=Sreesanth, 2 other Rajasthan Royals players arrested for spot-fixing, suspended from IPL|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1835347/report-s-sreesanth-2-other-rajasthan-royals-players-arrested-for-spot-fixing|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=DNA|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 13 September, [[Sreesanth]] was given a lifetime ban from the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24076409|title=Sreesanth: Former India bowler banned for life for spot-fixing|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, allegations of spot-fixing were made against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] bowler [[Mervyn Westfield]], after he bowled poorly in a [[Pro40]] match against Durham in September 2009. Westfield later pleaded guilty to accepting money for spot-fixing in the match, specifically that he attempted to concede twelve runs from his first over (although he conceded only ten);&lt;ref name="convict"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-16527008 | work=BBC News | title=Ex-Essex cricketer Mervyn Westfield admits spot betting charge | date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was banned for five years and his Essex team-mate and former Pakistan Test bowler [[Danish Kaneria]] received a life ban after he was found to have orchestrated the fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Telegraph|publication-place=UK|author=James Rowland|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/9009383/Mervyn-Westfield-spot-fixing-scandal-a-timeline.html|title=Mervyn Westfield spot-fixing scandal: a timeline|date=26 September 2013|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Twenty20|Twenty20 cricket]] is said to have made spot-fixing more difficult to detect in cricket, because the faster and more variable nature of the game makes anomalies related to spot-fixing less visible.&lt;ref name="Twenty20" /&gt;

===Rugby league===
Australian [[rugby league]] player [[Ryan Tandy]] was found guilty of spot-fixing during a 2010 [[National Rugby League]] season match between [[North Queensland Cowboys]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]]. Tandy, playing for Canterbury-Bankstown, was involved in spot-fixing the first score of the match to be a North Queensland penalty goal. Observers noted that there had been an unusually high proportion of bets taken on the penalty goal option for the game. Then, in the opening minutes of the game, Tandy was found to have deliberately conceded a [[List of rugby league terms#knock-on|knock-on]] from the match's kick-off and then a penalty for slowing down the play-the-ball in the Cowboys' first attacking set in front of the goalposts, giving North Queensland a chance to kick an easy penalty goal. As it happened, the spot-fixing attempt was unsuccessful, as North Queensland passed up its penalty goal opportunity and scored a try instead. In 2011, Tandy was found guilty of attempting to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage on 6 October 2011, and he received a six-month correction order from the courts and a life ban from rugby league.&lt;ref name=abc-banned&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-28/ryan-tandy-dies/5416398?pfm=ms |title=Former NRL player Ryan Tandy found dead from reported drug overdose |work=ABC News (Australia) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=28 April 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St Mirren Park''', also known as ''' The Simple Digital Arena''' for sponsorship reasons,&lt;ref name = "simple digital"/&gt; is a football stadium in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], Scotland. It is the home of [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]].

==History==
[[File:St Mirren's new stadium - geograph.org.uk - 811248.jpg|thumb|left|225px|View of the stadium during construction]]
Talks over a new stadium began on 15 January 2003, when the club met representatives from [[Aldi]] and [[Lidl]]. The club were looking to sell their ground at [[Love Street (stadium)|Love Street]] for retail development. Selling Love Street would secure the necessary funding to build the new stadium. Planning applications for a retail development at Love Street were passed on 24 May 2005 and the club subsequently sold the ground to [[Tesco]] on 25 April 2007 for £15 million. The new stadium site broke ground on 7 January 2008 and was officially opened on 31 January 2009 at a cost of £8 million.&lt;ref name="saintmirren.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/scotland/st_mirren.htm |title=Scottish Football Ground Guide: New St Mirren Park, St Mirren Football Club |publisher=Footballgroundguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the first game at the new stadium there was a parade from Love Street to Greenhill Road to celebrate the opening of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/73851-st-mirren-fans-final-march-from-love-street/ |title=St Mirren fans’ final march from Love Street &amp;#124; Football |publisher=STV |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club chairman [[Stewart Gilmour]] and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] were also present at the first match at the new ground. Alex Salmond unveiled a plaque before the game to commemorate the opening.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The game between St Mirren and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] finished in a 1&amp;ndash;1 draw, with the first goal at the new stadium being scored by Kilmarnock striker [[Kevin Kyle]].&lt;ref name = "first match"&gt;{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Campbell |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=31 January 2009 |accessdate=22 October 2012 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/7858986.stm |title=St Mirren 1-1 Kilmarnock}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Wyness]] scored St Mirren's first goal at the new ground, in the same match.&lt;ref name = "first match"/&gt; The opening match set the record attendance of 7,542, a record which still stands.&lt;ref name="first match"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "sfgg"/&gt; St Mirren Park has also become the regular home of the [[Scotland national under-21 football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14457191.stm|title=St Mirren Park becomes home to Scotland's Under-21 side|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_fa_news.cfm?page=2986&amp;newsID=11384&amp;newsCategoryID=1 |title=Scottish Football Association |publisher=Scottishfa.co.uk |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, St Mirren agreed a two-year sponsorship deal with [[Renfrewshire Council]] to rename the stadium as the '''Paisley 2021 Stadium'''.&lt;ref name = "sponsor"/&gt; This was to promote Paisley's bid to become a [[UK City of Culture]] in 2021.&lt;ref name = "sponsor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34831026 |title=St Mirren Park in line for temporary name change in culture city bid |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=16 November 2015 |accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the stadium was renamed as '''The Simple Digital Arena''' as part of a four-year deal with [[Glasgow]]-based IT firm Simple Digital Solutions.&lt;ref name = "simple digital"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://stv.tv/sport/football/1418644-st-mirren-rename-stadium-ahead-of-premiership-return/ |title=St Mirren rename stadium ahead of Premiership return |publisher=STV Sport |work= |date=2018-06-13 |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
St Mirren Park is built on a 12.5 acre site on Greenhill Road in the [[Ferguslie Park]] area of the town. The previously unused site is less than a mile from the clubs former ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/stmirrenpark/ |title=St Mirren Park |publisher=The Stadium Guide |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romauk.net/newspages/stmirrenfootball.html |title=ROMA Publications Ltd, UK - Publishing, Advertising, Graphic Design |publisher=Romauk.net |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barr Construction]] were responsible for the design and construction of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/scotland/st_mirren.htm |title=Scottish Football Ground Guide: New St Mirren Park, St Mirren Football Club |publisher=Footballgroundguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their design consisted of four grandstands with a total capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|mirren}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/st-mirren/ |title=St Mirren Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumdb.com/stadiums/sco/st_mirren_park |title=St Mirren Park – |publisher=Stadiumdb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Stand is the Main Stand. The North Stand is used by away fans. Larger away supports can also be seated in a section of the West Stand. The West Stand has the largest capacity of all the stands. Whilst the South Stand is the Family Stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.saintmirren.net/pages/?p=30285 |title=St Mirren Football Club &amp;#124; Match Day Info – St Mirren v Partick Thistle |publisher=Saintmirren.net |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumdb.com/stadiums/sco/st_mirren_park |title=St Mirren Park – |publisher=Stadiumdb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*East Stand (Greenhill Road) - capacity 2,220. (Main Stand)
*West Stand (Craigielea Drive) - capacity 2,516. (2 sections for Away Stand Overspill or small away support)
*North Stand (Ferguslie Park Avenue) - capacity 1,633. (Away Stand)
*South Stand (Drums Avenue) - capacity 1,654. (Family Stand)

==Facilities==
On the outside of the stadium, promotional plaques have been constructed on the wall including fans names and loved ones. In the undercroft areas under each of the home support sections, large plaques dedicated to the members of the club's 'Hall of fame' have been erected by members of the supporters association and the website team, detailing player profiles and stats. Also, a 7-a-side pitch behind the North Stand is covered by the Airdome and can be hired by the public.

==Transport==

'''Suffolk county cricket teams''' were the teams that represented the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Suffolk]] before the first official formation of [[Suffolk County Cricket Club]] in 1864.

==18th century==
Cricket had probably reached Suffolk by the end of the 17th century. The earliest known reference to cricket in Suffolk was in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, p.263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/342/Other_Matches.html|title=Other Matches played by Suffolk|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of a Suffolk representative team is in 1764, with Suffolk playing against [[Norfolk county cricket teams|Norfolk]] at Bury St Edmunds racecourse (today the location of [[RAF Bury St Edmunds|Rougham Airfield]]) on 23 August. Norfolk won this match, which was reported in the ''[[Daily Gazetteer|Gazetteer &amp; London Daily Advertiser]]'' on Tuesday 28 August.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Suffolk played two further matches against Norfolk on 10 and 12 September at [[Scole|Scole, Norfolk]].&lt;ref name="MIS"/&gt;

==19th century==
A team representative of Suffolk is next recorded as playing in 1827 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].&lt;ref name="MIS"/&gt; It was during this time that the Bury St Edmunds club became prominent, its reputation enhanced when [[Fuller Pilch]] joined in 1824. It was the Bury Club, as it was often called,&lt;ref&gt;ACS, ''Important Matches, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; playing under the name of Suffolk, that played two [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1830, one at [[Lord's]] and the other at [[Cemetry Road|Field Lane, Bury St Edmunds]].&lt;ref name="FCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/0/342/First-Class_Matches.html|title=First-Class Matches played by Suffolk|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams won one match each. The team was sometimes called Bury St Edmunds and sometimes Suffolk. In 1847, Suffolk played two more important matches against MCC, again played at Lord's and Field Lane.&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt; This time, MCC won both matches by large margins. Teams representative of Suffolk continued to play minor matches until at least 1859, when an [[Non-international England cricket teams|All-England Eleven]] played the county.&lt;ref name="MIS"/&gt; The original [[Suffolk County Cricket Club]] was formed on 27 July 1864, becoming representative of Suffolk as a traditional county. It was reconstituted in 1932. It has always fielded a [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|minor counties team]].

The following is a list of matches played by Bury St Edmunds or Suffolk from 1821 to 1859; those marked with {{dagger}} are definitely minor fixtures while the majority are potentially important matches depending on their treatments by different sources:{{fact|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="934">'''Vice-captain''', '''alternate captain''' ([[ice hockey]]) or '''vice-skip''' ([[curling]]) may refer to a role in a number of sports immediately below the role of [[Captain (sports)|captain]]. The vice-captain may have a number of different roles, including substituting as captain when the regular captain is injured or unavailable, or becoming the new captain if the original captain can't actually ''be'' the captain anymore. A vice-captain is a different from a co-captain, in which there are at least two people who equally share the responsibilities of being the captain.

'''Weight cutting''' is the practice of fast [[weight loss]] prior to a sporting competition. It most frequently happens in order to qualify for a lower [[weight class]] (usually in [[combat sports]], where weight is a significant advantage) or in sports where it is advantageous to weigh as little as possible (most notably [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports). There are two types of weight cutting: one method is to lose weight in the form of fat and muscle in the weeks prior to an event; the other is to lose weight in the form of water in the final days before competition.

Nutritional experts rarely give advice on how to cut weight safely or effectively, and recommend against cutting weight.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} However, many athletes choose to do it because they wish to gain an advantage in their sport.

== Dieting ==

In addition to improving performance through [[healthy eating]], some athletes will seek to lose weight through [[dieting]] and [[aerobic exercise]].  By losing fat they hope to achieve a higher "strength-to-mass ratio" or "lean weight."  This means more muscle and less fat, and should theoretically give them an advantage against other athletes of the same weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5573">The '''World Series of Golf''' is an annual [[golf]] competition. The competition differs from traditional golf tournaments in that the winner is decided not by the lowest stroke-play score or by winning a bracket-style elimination in match play, but by winning wagers bet on each hole in a betting scheme similar to [[poker]].

The first event was held May 13–16, 2007, and was televised by [[NBC]] June 23–24, 2007. The second event was played May 12–15, 2008, and was televised by [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] on June 28–29.

The event takes its name from the [[World Series of Poker]], and has no relationship to the original [[World Series of Golf]] tournament played at the [[Firestone Country Club]] in [[Akron, Ohio]] from 1962 to 1998.

==Format==
Each hole is conducted in a manner similar to a hand of [[Texas Hold 'Em]]. Each player begins the round with a stake, and a playing group consists of three to six players. In the inaugural tournament, the buy-in for each player was $10,000, just like the WSOP main event.

Before teeing off for each hole, each player bets an [[Ante (poker)|ante]]. The ante starts out at 1% of the opening stake for the round, i.e., $100 on the first hole of the opening round, and doubles every three holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgolf.com/blogs/william.wolfrum/2007/04/12/poker_betting_it_can_swallow_golf_hole|date=April 12, 2007|publisher=Worldgolf.com|title=Poker betting it can swallow golf hole}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tee shots, players then check, raise or call bets, or fold and do not play the rest of that hole. Betting follows a prescribed order that rotates on each hole, just like "the button" in Hold 'Em, and playing of shots follows the same order, unlike traditional golf where the player whose ball is furthest from the hole shoots first on each shot. The pot is won by the player with the lowest score on each hole, or by the remaining player if all others have folded. A tie score on a hole ("halved" in match-play parlance) results in a split pot, much like a tie hand in poker.

If a player does not have enough money remaining in his or her stake to cover the ante for the next hole, he or she is eliminated and the remaining stake goes into the pot for the next hole.

The round ends when one player has won all the money from the others in his group, which may take more than 18 holes.

Aside from rule variations involving betting and the order in which players take their shots, the event is played under standard [[United States Golf Association]] rules.

The inaugural event was open to amateur golfers only. Players were paired with those of similar ability for the first round, which was played without handicaps. Handicap scoring was used for second and third rounds.

==2007 World Series of Golf==
The inaugural event was held at the [[Primm Valley Golf Club]] near [[Primm, Nevada]]. A field of 60 participants played three rounds.

===Results===
'''Winner:''' Mark Ewing, [[day trade]]r, [[Newport Beach, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2007-05-16-954849723_x.htm|publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' (via [[Associated Press]])|title=Day trader wins World Series of Golf in Las Vegas|first=Ryan|last=Nakashima|date=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 World Series of Golf==
The 2008 event was played May 12–15, 2008, at the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Paiute Golf Resort. The event drew 80 contestants.

Others in final group: [[Allen Cunningham]], [[Erick Lindgren]] and [[Dee Tiller]], all professional poker players, and Bill Spencer, a semi-retired builder. All but Johnson are from Las Vegas.

Johnson defeated Lindgren on the first playoff hole. Johnson won $250,000, and Lindgren won $60,000.
