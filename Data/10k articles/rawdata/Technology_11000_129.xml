'''1:1 pixel mapping''' is a video display technique applicable to devices with native fixed [[pixels]], such as [[LCD monitor]]s and [[plasma display]]s. A monitor that has been set to 1:1 pixel mapping will display an input source without scaling it, such that each [[pixel]] received is mapped to a single native pixel on the monitor. This technique avoids loss of sharpness due to scaling artifacts and normally{{Efn|Except the uncommon case where display and input differ in [[pixel aspect ratio]] such as when one doesn't use [[square pixels]]}} avoids incorrect [[aspect ratio]] due to stretching. If the input [[Display resolution|resolution]] is less than the monitor's [[native resolution]], this will result in black borders around the image (e.g. [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] or [[windowboxing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sayer|first1=Rob|title=Guide to Pixel Mapping|url=http://www.onstagelighting.co.uk/lighting-equipment/stage-lighting-control/guide-to-pixel-mapping/|website=onstagelighting.co.uk|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drawbaugh|first1=Ben|title=Does your HDTV support 1:1 pixel mapping?|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/20/does-your-hdtv-support-1-1-pixel-mapping/|website=Engadget|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''All the World in a Design School''''' ({{lang-sv|Hela världen i en designskola}}) is a 2015 Swedish [[documentary film]] made for [[television]] about a group of international students at one of the world's top ranked [[industrial design]] schools, [[Umeå Institute of Design]] in [[Umeå]], [[Västerbotten]], [[Sweden]].

[[Umeå Institute of Design]] is well respected by the [[industrial design]] world for its unique study and [[design methods]] in addition to a [[multicultural]] environment that has shaped generations of industrial designers.

This [[documentary]], from inside [[Umeå Institute of Design]], was shot during the school's 25th anniversary and follow a group of students from all corners of the world in close-up portraits during a time when the school struggles to maintain its attractiveness. New regulations by the [[Riksdag]] of Sweden mean non-European students are charged steep tuition fees.

The film is produced by Freedom From Choice, Filmpool Nord and [[Sveriges Television]], and directed by award-winning [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[filmmaker]] [[Tomas Mattias Löw|Mattias Löw]].

The [[documentary]] won the Best Television Program Award at the Northern Character Film &amp; TV Festival in [[Murmansk]], [[Russia]], the Best Documentary Feature Film Award at the Atlas &amp; Aeris Awards in [[Boston]], United States, a Remi Gold Award at the WorldFest - [[Houston]] International Film Festival in [[Texas]], United States and has received international attention with nominations and official selections at several recognized film festivals including [[Camerimage]] in [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Poland]].

'''Alphagov''' was the project name of the experimental prototype website built by the [[Government Digital Service]] and launched on 11 May 2011 by the UK [[Cabinet Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Government launches single government website prototype |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/government-launches-single-government-website-prototype |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Work begins on Alphagov single government website |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8416250/Work-begins-on-Alphagov-single-government-website.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Matt |last=Warman |date=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was open for public comment for two months in order to judge the feasibility of a single domain for [[British Government]] web services.

==Purpose==
Launched in response to the report by [[Martha Lane Fox]] ''Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directgov 2010 and Beyond: Revolution Not Evolution |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution |publisher=[[Cabinet Office]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in November 2010. Alphagov sought to act as a proof of concept for the way citizens could interact with Government through a series of useful online tools, where they were more useful than published content alone.

As well as improving the 'citizen experience' of using government web services online the project also identified the potential for £64 million in yearly savings on central government's annual £128 million current web publishing bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New government web domain to save £64m, but at what cost? |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London |first=Kevin |last=Rawlinson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716234722/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/05/11/new-government-web-domain-to-save-64-but-at-what-cost/ |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
This initial consultation period was completed in June 2011. A [[Beta_version#Beta|beta version]] was then created, which led to the launch of [[GOV.UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alpha.gov.uk to become beta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/jun/27/alpha-gov-uk-central-government-website-becomes-beta-version |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 July 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American National Standards Institute''' ('''ANSI''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|s|i}} {{respell|AN|see}}) is a private [[non-profit organization]] that oversees the development of [[Standardization|voluntary consensus standards]] for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|4949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other [[standards organization]]s, [[government agency|government agencies]], [[consumer organization|consumer groups]], companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 2009 Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]] ANSI's operations office is located in [[New York City]]. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

== History ==
ANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the '''American Engineering Standards Committee''' ('''AESC''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/history.aspx|title=ANSI: Historical Overview|website=ansi.org|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the AESC became the '''American Standards Association''' ('''ASA'''). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became '''United States of America Standards Institute''' ('''USASI'''). The present name was adopted in 1969.

Prior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:
*[[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE, now [[IEEE]])
*[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME)
*[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE)
*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]])
*American Society for Testing and Materials (now [[ASTM International]])
had been members of the United Engineering Society (UES). At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] or DOD) and Commerce&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/history.aspx?menuid=1 ANSI history]- Retrieved 2011-09-27&lt;/ref&gt; to join in founding a national standards organization.

According to Adam Stanton, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else. Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME. An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.

In 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ Welcome to IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
ANSI's members are government agencies, organizations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 270,000 companies and organizations and 30 million professionals worldwide.&lt;ref name="membership"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ansi.org/membership/overview/overview?menuid=2www.ansi.org/membership |title=ANSI Membership – A Value Proposition |publisher=ANSI |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Although ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

ANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Brochures/Value%20of%20the%20ANS.pdf ''Value of the ANS Designation'' brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.

The American National Standards process involves:
*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties
*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards
*consideration of and response to comments
*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard
*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.

==International activities==
In addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the United States, ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.

The Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), as a founding member,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/introduction.aspx ISO founding member]- Retrieved 2011-09-27&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.

Adoption of ISO and IEC standards as American standards increased from 0.2% in 1986 to 15.5% in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8007 |title=A Review of U.S.A. Participation in ISO and IEC |last1=Choi |first1=Dong Geun |last2=Puskar |first2=Erik |year=2014 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |page=29 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards panels===
The Institute administers nine standards panels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/standards_boards_panels/overview.aspx?menuid=3 Overview]. Ansi.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

*ANSI Homeland Defense and Security Standardization Collaborative (HDSSC)
*[[American National Standards Institute Nanotechnology Panel|ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel (ANSI-NSP)]]
*ID Theft Prevention and ID Management Standards Panel (IDSP)
*ANSI Energy Efficiency Standardization Coordination Collaborative (EESCC)
*Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC)
*Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP)
*ANSI-NAM Network on Chemical Regulation
*ANSI Biofuels Standards Coordination Panel
*Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP)

Each of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas.

In 2009, ANSI and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry.

===American national standards===
*The [[ASA film speed|ASA]] (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the [[DIN film speed|DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934)]], became the basis for the [[ISO film speed|ISO]] system (since 1974), currently used worldwide ([[ISO 6]], [[ISO 2240]], [[ISO 5800]], [[ISO 12232]]).
*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers. The ANSI code standard extended the previously created [[ASCII]] seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] or EBCDIC). In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase "ANSI" refers to the [[Windows code page|Windows ANSI code page]]s (even though they are not ANSI standards).&lt;ref name="ms glossary"&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/glossary.mspx Microsoft Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for [[ideographic language]]s are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the [[ISO-8859]] series, some of Microsoft's symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.
*The first computer [[programming language]] standard was "American Standard [[Fortran]]" (informally known as "FORTRAN 66"), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.
*The programming language [[COBOL]] had ANSI standards in 1968, 1974, and 1985. The COBOL 2002 standard was issued by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].
*The original standard implementation of the [[C (computer language)|C]] programming language was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known [[ANSI C]].
*The [[X3J13|X3J13 committee]] was created in 1986 to formalize the ongoing consolidation of [[Common Lisp]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhplace.com/kent/CL/x3j13-sd-05.html&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in 1994 with the publication of ANSI's first object-oriented programming standard.&lt;ref&gt;http://dmoztools.net/Computers/Programming/Languages/Lisp/&lt;/ref&gt;
*A popular [[Unified Thread Standard]] for nuts and bolts is ANSI/ASME B1.1 which was defined in 1935, 1949, 1989, and 2003.
*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.
*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool &amp; Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.
*The ANSI/HI ([[Hydraulic Institute]]) standards used for pumps.
*The ANSI for [[eye protection]] is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear. This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.
*The [[Paper size#ANSI paper sizes|ANSI paper sizes]] (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).

===Other initiatives===
*In 2008, ANSI, in partnership with [[Citation Technologies]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202011754/http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi |date=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created the first dynamic, online web library for [[ISO 14000]] standards.&lt;ref name=iPackages&gt;[http://ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=1892 ANSI ISO 14000 Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On June 23, 2009, ANSI announced a product and services agreement with [[Citation Technologies]] to deliver all ISO Standards on a web-based platform. Through the ANSI-Citation partnership, 17,765 International Standards developed by more than 3,000 ISO technical bodies will be made available on the citation platform, arming subscribers with powerful search tools and collaboration, notification, and change-management functionality.&lt;ref name="ANSI Press Release 07.23.09"&gt;[http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&amp;articleid=2261 ANSI Press Release 07.23.09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*ANSI, in partnership with [[Citation Technologies]], [[Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation|AAMI]], [[ASTM]], and [[DIN]], created a single, centralized database for medical device standards on September 9, 2009.&lt;ref name="Medical Device Standards Press Release 09/09/09"&gt;[http://astmnewsroom.org/default.aspx?pageid=1881 Medical Device Standards Database Press Release 09/09/09]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In early 2009, ANSI launched a new Certificate Accreditation Program (ANSI-CAP) to provide neutral, third-party attestation that a given certificate program meets the American National Standard ASTM E2659-09.
*In 2009, ANSI began accepting applications for certification bodies seeking accreditation according to requirements defined under the Toy Safety Certification Program (TSCP) as the official third-party accreditor of TSCP's product certification bodies.
*In 2006, ANSI launched [http://www.standardsportal.org/ www.StandardsPortal.org], an online resource for facilitating more open and efficient trade between international markets in the areas of standards, conformity assessment, and technical regulations. The site currently features content for China, India, and Korea, with additional countries and regions planned for future content.
*ANSI design standards have also been incorporated into building codes encompassing several specific building sub-sets, such as the ANSI/SPRI ES-1, which pertains to "Wind Design Standard for Edge Systems Used With Low Slope Roofing Systems", for example.&lt;ref name="The ANSI/SPRI ES-1 Standard Explained"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.area-24.com/ANSI_SPRI_ES-1.html |title=The ANSI/SPRI ES-1 Standard Explained |access-date=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512124402/http://www.area-24.com/ANSI_SPRI_ES-1.html |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">An '''antenna tracking system''' tracks a primary antenna to follow a moving signal source, such as a [[communication satellite]].  A secondary antenna has a greater [[beam width]] than the primary antenna and receives the same tracking signal from the satellite.  The primary antenna is tracked according to a predetermined search pattern which causes a variation in the signal [[amplitude]] depending upon the relative location of the satellite and the antenna position. The signal strength signals from the two antennas are input to a summation function which takes the [[Comparator|difference]] of the two signals. The noise and signal variation component of the two signals is substantially the same and is therefore eliminated from the resulting difference signal. An antenna control unit utilizes the resulting difference signal to select the optimum [[signal strength]] for the particular step of the search pattern. This system is particularly applicable to [[extremely high frequency]] communication channels (86&amp;nbsp;GHz and above) which are subject to [[atmospheric distortion]] and [[Atmospheric noise|noise]].

Antenna Tracking Systems can apply to Broadband and Microwave Radio Systems as well for Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint communications.

[[File:Sipahh - girl.jpg|thumb|Child using a drinking straw]]
'''Assistive eating devices''' include devices ranging from low-tech utensils to high-tech powered robotic eating equipment. Low tech eating devices include utensils, plates and bowls with lips that make scooping food easier. Cups and mugs, and even a standard disposable straw can be considered assistive drinking devices. They are used by people when they have difficulty eating or drinking independently. These devices are typically used for people with [[Disability|disabilities]], but can also be used for children or people that have poor [[Fine motor skill|dexterity]]. They can promote independence during meal times, but in many cases also can reduce the caregiver workload during meals. "Assistive eating devices can increase self-care, increase self-esteem associated with increased independence, increase safety during meals, and make meal-time better for caregiver staff…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4 Assistive Products for Mealtimes|url=http://www.caregiverproducts.com/top-4-assistive-products-mealtimes.html|website=www.caregiverproducts.com|publisher=The Wright Stuff Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This topic is discussed in more detail in an article entitled the Benefits of Independent Eating [https://feedingthedisabled.com/the-benefits-of-independent-eating-2/]).

More sophisticated technology, typically described as high-tech equipment, is also available to accommodate the needs of individuals who have significant restrictions in their ability to eat and drink without assistance from another person. For people who have quadriplegia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), cerebral palsy, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and many other conditions, a powered device like the [http://www.mealtimepartners.com/dining/mealtime-partner-dining-device.htm assistive dining device] can facilitate hands free eating. For those who have tremors, or weak muscles, that make eating in the traditional manner difficult, or impossible, a manual feeding device may be of value.

==  Adaptive dinnerware ==
This category includes [[Plate (dishware)|plates]] and bowls that will not allow food to fall off or out of the container and will not slide around. Some of these devices are as simple as a clip on guard that attaches to any normal plate or bowl  There are many plates that also have a lip on the edge that prevents food from being pushed off the plate when it is being scooped. Other [[Tableware|dinnerware]] are modified or specially made so they do not slide around on the table. Two common ways to keep the plates and bowls on the table are mats and grip bottoms. However, if the individual in question has [[tremor]]s, then suction bases may be utilized. There are special bowls and plates that have a [[Suction cup|suction base]] that will attach to the table. This base will prevent the dinnerware from getting knocked around when the container or table is bumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive Devices for Mealtimes|url=http://www.cdss.ca.gov/agedblinddisabled/res/VPTC2/9%20Food%20Nutrition%20and%20Preparation/Assistive_Devices_for_Mealtimes.pdf|website=cdss.ca.gov/|publisher=Department of Social Services|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assistive utensils ==
[[Fork]]s, [[Knife|knives]] and [[spoon]]s may need to be adapted in order for people to use them  Individuals may struggle with tremors or the movement of opening and closing the hand or lifting the arm for independent feeding. Adapted utensils may be the answer for these individuals. Much like the weighted mugs to help with tremors, weighted utensils can minimize the tremors. These types of utensils may be specially bought, but attachments can also be bought to adapt the current utensils into an assistive device. These attachments can include something to slip over the handle that is weighted or that may be large or made out of [[Polymeric foam|foam]] to enhance grip and prevent the utensil from falling out of the hand. Clips and straps may also be utilized if the individual is unable to hold the handle at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eating. Technology for Long-Term Care:  Products|url=http://www.techforltc.org/CI-Eating.aspx/|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manual Feeding Devices ==
Manual feeding devices are designed to allow an individual who has a tremor, or who lacks the hand and arm coordination to control a utensil to scoop food and lift it to their mouth, to feed themselves. Some devices simply stabilize the user’s arm, while others provide a weighted arm that dampens extraneous movement. Manual feeding devices like the [https://www.dme.co.nz/neater-eater-2/ Neater Eater] require the user to manipulate the device to have the spoon pick up food and then move the spoon to their mouth, so they require some degree of arm motion capability by the user (i.e., they are powered by the user’s own muscles).

== Powered Feeding Devices ==
Powered feeding devices allow individuals who are unable to self-feed using any other type of assistive eating technology, to eat independently. Typically, these devices operate using power from a rechargeable battery (for portability). The user controls the device by the use of adaptive switches to activate the various functions that the specific device offers. Worldwide, there are only a few powered feeding devices commercially available. The designs and manner in which they operate vary considerably. Some offer a simple plate or bowl on which the food is served, while others provide divided dishes or multiple bowls that keep the different types of foods separated, to avoid mixing of food. Many of the early powered feeding device designs were simply mechanical. All of those that are still available in 2017 are more [[robotic]] in nature and are controlled by computer processors.

== Assistive cups and mugs ==
[[Cup]]s and [[mug]]s may be adapted or bought to help with daily living. The most common assistive drinking utensil is the [[Drinking straw|straw]]. This is inexpensive and allows for the user to not need to pick up the cup at all. The same principles for assistive dinnerware may also be utilized for mugs or cups. Non-slip bases are common so they do not slip on the table, while [[cup holder]]s are used to prevent the cup from being knocked over. In case the cup gets knocked over, no spill [[Lid (container)|lids]] may be used. Some cups are sold with lids, but there are also lids that can be used for several different types of cups and mugs. Weighted mugs are also common for the individual that suffers with tremors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 4 Assistive Products for Mealtimes|url=http://www.thewright-stuff.com/assistive-mealtime-products|website=thewright-stuff.com/|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals who have disabilities that limit the use of arms and/or hands, hands free drinking products are also available.

'''Auspex Systems''' was a [[computer data storage]] company founded in 1987 by Larry Boucher, who was previously CEO of [[Adaptec]].  It was headquartered in [[Santa Clara, California]].

Auspex introduced the first [[network-attached storage]] (NAS) devices.  
After an [[initial public offering]] in 1993, shares were traded on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange under symbol ASPX.&lt;ref name="K1997" /&gt;
One of the unique features of their systems was the ease with which volumes could be transparently mirrored and migrated between physical disks. Auspex systems used Functional Multiprocessing, essentially [[Asymmetric multiprocessing]], that allowed the systems to scale functions independently -- such as networking, file processing, or storage processing.  There was a Host Processor running Unix that controlled the whole system.  This 'system within a system' could even be rebooted without interrupting file servicing! They became a leading provider of [[data center]] storage in the mid-1990s but fell behind [[NetApp]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= After losing market share to NTAP and EMC, Auspex is back with a new management team and new NAS products |date= August 15, 2001 |work= Network Computing |url= http://www.networkcomputing.com/storage/auspex/1812823803 |accessdate= September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early cabinet rack models held sets of 3-4gb disks the size of small shoeboxes.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Bruce N. Moore joined in 1995 as president and chief executive officer.&lt;ref name="K1997"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Form 10-K: Annual Report for the Period Ending June 30, 1997 |publisher= United States Securities and Exchange Commission |date= September 26, 1997 |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/860749/0000891618-97-003915.txt |accessdate= September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Boucher left the company in 1997 to found [[Alacritech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Larry Boucher |publisher= Computer History Museum |url= http://www.computerhistory.org/events/bio/Larry,Boucher |accessdate= September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 4Front or NS2000 model, initially offered in 1999 as a stackable system, held drawers of disks and was plagued by Mylex RAID controller issues which contributed to their bankruptcy in June 2003. Their last product, the NSc3000, was the first multi-vendor SAN-NAS gateway and essentially kept the same NAS front-end but could connect via [[Fibre Channel]] to any SAN disk array.{{citation needed |date=September 2016}}
After the burst of the [[dot-com bubble]], in February, 2000, the company worked with Regent Pacific to select Gary J. Sbona as interim chief executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Auspex Systems Announces New Chairman of the Board and Interim Chief Executive Officer |date= February 15, 2000 |work= Press release |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/auspex-systems-announces-new-chairman-of-the-board-and-interim-chief-executive-officer-72608562.html |accessdate= September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>In first sentence, it was incorrectly stating that Alfred Nobel developed the subject substance in the late 18th Century, implying the late 1700's.  This is grossly incorrect, as Alfred Nobel's success did not happen until the late 1800's, the 19th Century.  Edited the first sentence to correct this.</comment>

'''Ballistite''' is a [[smokeless powder|smokeless propellant]] made from two [[high explosive]]s, [[nitrocellulose]] and [[nitroglycerin]]e. It was developed and patented by [[Alfred Nobel]] in the late 19th century.

==Military adoption==
[[Alfred Nobel]] patented Ballistite in 1887 while he was living in Paris.  His formulation was composed of 10% [[camphor]] and equal parts [[nitroglycerin]]e and [[collodion]].&lt;ref name=ss-136&gt;{{Harvnb|Schűck|Sohlman|1929|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camphor reacted with any acidic products of the chemical breakdown of the two explosives. This both stabilized the explosive against further decomposition and prevented spontaneous explosions. However, camphor tends to evaporate over time, leaving a potentially unstable mixture.&lt;ref name=ss-140-141&gt;{{Harvnb|Schűck|Sohlman|1929|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel's patent specified that the nitrocellulose should be "of the well-known soluble kind". He offered to sell the rights of the new explosive to the French government, but they declined, largely because they had just adopted [[Poudre B]] for military use. He subsequently licensed the rights to the Italian government, who entered into a contract, on 1 August, 1889, to obtain 300,000 kilograms of Ballistite; and Nobel opened a factory at [[Avigliana]], Turin.&lt;ref name=ss-138-139&gt;{{Harvnb|Schűck|Sohlman|1929|pp=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Army swiftly replaced their M1870 and M1870/87 rifles, which used [[black powder]] cartridges, to a new model, the M1890 Vetterli, which used a cartridge loaded with ballistite.

As Italy was a competing [[great power]] to France, this was not received well by the French press and the public. The newspapers accused Nobel of industrial espionage, by spying on Vieille, and "high treason against France". Following a police investigation he was refused permission to conduct any more research, or to manufacture explosives in France. He therefore moved to [[Sanremo|San Remo]] in Italy, in 1891, where he spent the last five years of his life.&lt;ref name=ss-139-140&gt;{{Harvnb|Schűck|Sohlman|1929|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballistite is still manufactured as a solid fuel rocket propellant, although the less volatile but chemically similar [[diphenylamine]] is used instead of camphor.

== Development of cordite and unsuccessful claim by Nobel of patent infringement ==
Meanwhile, a government committee in Great Britain, called the "Explosives Committee" and chaired by Sir [[Frederick Augustus Abel|Frederick Abel]], monitored foreign developments in explosives. Abel and Sir [[James Dewar]], who was also on the committee, jointly patented a modified form of ballistite in 1889. This consisted of 58% nitroglycerin by weight, 37% [[guncotton]] and 5% [[petroleum jelly]]. Using [[acetone]] as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called "cord powder" or "the committee's modification of ballistite", but this was soon abbreviated to [[cordite]].

After unsuccessful negotiations, in 1893, Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over [[patent infringement]] and lost the case.&lt;ref name=Schuck&amp;Sohlman-142&gt;Schück &amp; Sohlman, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; It then went to the [[Court of Appeal]] and the [[House of Lords]] in 1895 where he also lost the two appeals and the Nobel's Explosives Company had to pay the costs.&lt;ref name=Schuck&amp;Sohlman-142/&gt; The claim was lost because the words "of the well-known soluble kind" in his patent were taken to mean soluble [[collodion]], and to specifically exclude the water-insoluble guncotton.&lt;ref name=Schuck&amp;Sohlman-142/&gt;

[[File:Stained glass windows in Lincoln Cathedral 07 East Window.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.5|One of the most prestigious stained glass commissions of the 19th century, the re-glazing of the 13th-century east window of Lincoln Cathedral, Ward and Hughes, 1855.]]

A revival of the art and craft of [[stained-glass]] [[window]] manufacture took place in [[Early modern Britain|early 19th-century Britain]], beginning with an armorial window created by [[Thomas Willement]] in 1811–12.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The revival led to stained glass windows becoming such a common and popular form of coloured pictorial representation that many thousands of people, most of whom would never [[Commission (art)|commission]] or purchase a painting, contributed to the commission and purchase of stained-glass windows for their parish church.

Within 50 years of the beginnings of commercial manufacture in the 1830s, British stained glass grew into an enormous and specialised industry, with important centres in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Birmingham]], [[Whitechapel]] in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Norwich]] and [[Dublin]]. The industry also flourished in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. By 1900 British windows had been installed in [[Copenhagen]], [[Venice]], [[Athens]], [[Bangalore]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Manila]] and [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. St Alban's Copenhagen; Basilica of Ss Giovanni and Paolo, Venice; St Paul's Church, Athens; All Saints' Church, Bangalore; the original Nagasaki Cathedral; Manila Cathedral; St John's Presbyterian Church, Wellington.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War I|Great War]] from 1914 to 1918, stained glass design was to change radically.

==Background==
{{Main|Medieval stained glass}}
[[File:Lincoln Cathedral Bishops Eye.jpg|thumb|The ''Bishop's Eye'', (1320) at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], is filled with salvaged fragments.]]
Following the [[Norman conquest]] of [[England]] in 1066, many churches, abbeys and cathedrals were built, initially in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] or [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style, then in the increasingly elaborate and decorative [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In these churches the windows were generally either large or in multiples so that the light within the building was maximised. The windows were glazed, frequently with [[came glasswork|coloured glass held in place by strips of lead]]. Because flat glass could only be manufactured in small pieces, the method of glazing lent itself to patterning. The pictorial representation of biblical characters and narratives was a feature of Christian churches, often taking the form of murals. By the 12th century stained glass was well adapted to serve this purpose.  For 500 years the art flourished and adapted to changing architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of English glass was smashed by [[Puritans]] under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Churches which retain a substantial amount of early glass are rare. Very few of England's large windows are intact. Those that contain a large amount of Medieval glass are usually reconstructed from salvaged fragments. The east, west and south transept windows of [[York Minster]] and the west and [[transept|north Transept]] windows of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] give an idea of the splendours that have been mostly lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scotland, which never manufactured its own stained glass but bought from the south, they lost much of their glass not because it was smashed but because the monasteries were disbanded. These monasteries had monks with skills in repairing. When they went, windows gradually fell apart.

==Influences on the revival of stained glass==
[[File:York York minster windows 020.JPG|thumb|left|The 14th-century glass of west window of [[York Minster]] has figures set beneath brightly coloured canopies, adopted by 19th-century designers such as [[Clayton and Bell]]]]

===Historic===
Medieval windows and drawings of them provided the source and inspiration for nearly all the earlier 19th-century designers.

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] retains more ancient glass than any other English cathedral except York. Much of it is appears to be imported from France and some is very early, dating from the 11th century. Much of the glass is in the style of [[Chartres Cathedral]] with deep blue featuring as the background colour in most windows. There are wide borders of stylised floral motifs and small pictorial panels of round, square or diaper shape. Other windows contain rows of apostles, saints and prophets. These windows, including the large west window have a predominance of red, pink, brown and green in the colours, with smaller areas of blue. Most of the glass in this remarkable window is older than the 15th-century stone tracery that contains it, the figure of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] being part of a series of [[Jesse Tree|Ancestors of Christ]] that are among the oldest surviving panels in England.
[[File:Canterbury Cathedral 032 Miraculous draft.JPG|thumb|13th-century glass at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is full of lively narratives set in roundels surrounded by foliate scrolls, adopted by many 19th-century designers including [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck|Clutterbuck]], [[William Wailes]] and [[Ward and Hughes]]]]
[[York Minster]] also contains much of its original glass including important narrative windows of the Norman period, the famous "Five Sister" windows, the 14th-century west window and 15th-century east window. The "Five Sisters", although repaired countless times so that they now contain a spider's web of lead, still reveal their delicate pattern of simple geometric shapes enhanced by [[grisaille]] painting. They were the style of window which was most easily imitated by early 19th-century plumber-glaziers. The east and west windows of York are outstanding examples because in each case they are huge, intact, at their original location and by a known craftsman. The west window, designed in about 1340 by Master Robert, contains tiers of saints and stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary, each surmounted by a delicate Gothic canopy in white and yellow-stain, against a red background. The highly ornate tracery lights are filled with floral motifs. White glass ''stone borders'' surround each panel, making it appear to float in its frame. The east window of 1405 was glazed by [[John Thornton (glass painter)|John Thornton]] and is the largest intact medieval window in the world. It presents a narrative in sequential panels of the ''[[Genesis creation myth|Creation]]'', the ''[[Fall of Man]]'', ''the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]]'', ''the [[Apocalypse]]'', ''the [[Last Judgment]]'' and ''the Glory of God''.
York also has windows with small diaper-shaped ''quarries'' painted with little birds and other motifs which were much reproduced in the 19th century.

Between them, the windows of York and Canterbury cathedrals provided the examples for different styles of windows- geometric patterns, floral motifs and borders, narratives set in small panels, rows of figures, major thematic schemes.

Scattered all over England, sometimes in remote churches, is similar evidence of the designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, [[St Neot, Cornwall|St Neot's]] in Cornwall and [[Fairford]] in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. The theme is that of the east window of York, ''[[Salvation|the Salvation of Mankind]]'', but in this case the theme is spread across all the windows of the church, large and small. The west window, of seven lights, shows a single narrative incident, the ''[[Last Judgment]]''. This scheme and these particular windows provided a rare source for the designers of narrative windows for parish churches.&lt;ref&gt;Painton Cowen, Sarah Brown; Lee, Seddon and Stephens {{full|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophic===

====Romanticism====
In the 18th century there was a growing trend for philosophers, writers and painters to [[Romanticism|commune with nature]]. Nature was seen as all the more attractive if it contained signs of the grand aspirations, ideals and follies of humankind. Few things were considered more romantic than a medieval ruin which conjured up images of the traditional "romances" or idealistic sagas of the [[Middle Ages]].
England contained a great number of large Medieval ruins. These were chiefly castles destroyed by the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in the 17th century and, even more significantly, vast abbey churches ruined at the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century. These ruined abbey churches suffered three long-term fates. Some were used as quarries for their building materials. The more remote abbeys were simply left to slowly decay.  Those that were conveniently placed were awarded, with their associated lands, to favourites of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and his heirs. Thus it was that many of England's nobility grew up in homes that included within their structure part the Gothic remains of an ancient church or its associated monastic buildings. Some of these houses, such as the poet [[Lord Byron|Byron's]] home, [[Newstead Abbey]], contain reference to their origin within their name.

In the 18th century the owning of such a pile became fashionable. Those of noble lineage who did not have a ruin or a battlemented tower or an interior with pointed arcades promptly built one. Among the earliest of these creations was the novelist [[Horace Walpole|Horace Walpole's]] refurbishing of his London villa, which gave its name to the pretty and somewhat superficial style of architectural decoration known as [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill Gothick]]. The movement gained impetus- Sir [[Walter Scott]] built himself a Scottish Baronial mansion, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]]; the castles of [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]], [[Arundel Castle|Arundel]] and [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] were refurbished by their owners. The movement was just as strong in Germany where "Mad" King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] indulged his medievalism by building the [[Disneyland]] icon of [[Neuschwanstein]]. All over Europe, those who could afford to do so began the restoration and refurbishment of Medieval buildings. The last great Romantic flourish was the building of [[Castle Drogo]] by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] between 1910 and 1930.
[[File:Cambridge University, St. John's Chapel tonal balance.jpg|thumb|St John's College Chapel, Cambridge, by [[George Gilbert Scott]], photograph 1870]]

====The Oxford Movement====
Begun in [[Oxford]] in 1833 by the theologian [[John Keble]] and supported by John Henry Newman, the [[Oxford Movement]] stressed the universality or "catholic" nature of the Christian Church and urged priests of the [[Church of England]] to reconsider their [[English Reformation|pre-Reformation]] traditions in both [[Doctrine]] and [[Liturgy]]. While reinforcing the concept of direct descent from the Apostles through the Church of Rome, the movement did not advocate a return to Roman Catholicism. In practice, however, several hundred Anglican priests, including Newman, became Roman Catholic. The long-term effects of the Oxford Movement were the rapid expansion of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Catholic liturgical styles in many Anglican churches. The emphasis on liturgical rites brought about an artistic revolution in church building and decoration.

====The Cambridge Camden Society====
Formed in 1839 as a society of [[Cambridge]] undergraduates with an interest in Medieval architecture, [[Cambridge Camden Society|this group]] developed into a powerful movement for the recording, study preservation of England's ancient churches, the analysis and definition of architectural style and the dissemination of such information through its publications, chiefly a monthly journal ''The Ecclesiologist'' (1841–1869).
The [[Cambridge Camden Society]] did much to bring about a revival of medieval styles in the design and appointments of 19th-century churches, as well as in the [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of older ones. Their notions were often highly prescriptive, inflexible and intolerant of diversity within the church. They were insistent upon revival rather than originality.

====John Ruskin====
[[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), an art critic, wrote two books that were highly influential in Art Philosophy. In ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (1849) and ''The Stones of Venice'' (1851–1853), he discussed the moral, social and religious implications of buildings, emphasising the desirability of an ethical approach to the practice of the arts. His thinking influenced the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], whose artistic style Ruskin defended against criticism.

====The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 1849–1853====
This group of artists, of whom [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[William Holman Hunt]] were the central figures, rejected the indulgent [[classicism]], the [[materialism]] and the lack of [[social responsibility]] that they perceived in the artistic trends of mid-19th-century painting. They sought to recreate in their works the simple forms, bright colours, religious devotion and artistic anonymity of the period of art that preceded the rise of the great and famous individuals of the [[Renaissance]] period. They initially exhibited their works signed only with the initials PRB, [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].

[[File:George Frederic Watts portrait of William Morris 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], designer, craftsman and teacher, portrait by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1870]]

====The Arts and Crafts Movement====
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) was for a time a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and was influenced by their ideals and those of John Ruskin. As a precociously diverse designer, he saw the creation of arts in terms of social responsibility. He rejected, as Ruskin did, the mass-production of ornate and decorative wares of all sorts, such as those products of industry that were displayed in the 1851 [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]]. Morris advocated a return to cottage crafts and the revival and promulgation of old skills. To this end he formed a business partnership with Marshall and Faulkner, employing [[Ford Madox Brown]], another highly creative and dynamic artist and thus began what is termed "[[Arts and Crafts Movement|the Arts and Crafts Movement]]".
Stained glass was just one of many products of their studio. Morris and Brown saw themselves as original artists working in the spirit of their antecedents. They did not reproduce earlier forms exactly, and because of disagreements with the philosophy of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], rarely created stained glass windows for ancient churches.
William Morris's success as an entrepreneur was such that he was able to keep Rossetti, Burne-Jones and others in regular employment as designers. Through their teaching at the [[Working Men's College]] in London the group had enormous influence on many designers of all sorts.

====The Aesthetic Movement====
The [[Aesthetic Movement]] was a reaction against both the works of industry and the influential Socialist and Christian idealism of Morris and Ruskin who both saw art as directly linked to morality. Followers of the Aesthetic Movement, who included Burne-Jones and other stained glass designers such as Henry Holiday, propounded a philosophy of "Art for Art's sake". The style that evolved was sensuous and luxurious, linked with the rise of [[Art Nouveau]].

[[File:AWNPugin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]], architect and designer.]]

===Architectural===

====Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin====
[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812–1852) was the son of the Neo-Gothic architect [[Augustus Charles Pugin]] and was a convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1835. He built his first church in 1837. He was an enormously productive and meticulous church architect and designer of interiors.  With the growth of Roman Catholicism in England, and the development of large industrial centres there was much scope for his talents. He worked with and employed other designers and was instrumental in encouraging the firm of [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham to turn their attention to the production of glass.
Pugin's most renowned designs are the interiors, particularly the [[House of Lords]], that he designed for the architect [[Sir Charles Barry]], (1795–1860) at the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. After the destruction by fire of the Houses of Parliament in 1834, Barry had won the commission for their rebuilding, the stipulation being that they should be in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], as the most significant part of the Medieval complex, the Great Hall of [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]], remained standing. The rebuilding, which took up the rest of Barry's life, included a vast array of arts and crafts of all kinds, not the least of which was stained glass windows, both pictorial and armorial.  The knowledge, elegance and sophistication of Pugin's designs imbue and unite the interiors. As an ecclesiastical designer, his influence upon every medium is hard to overstate.

[[File:George Gilbert Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[George Gilbert Scott|George G. Scott]], architect and restorer of cathedrals.]]

====Sir George Gilbert Scott====
As an architect [[George Gilbert Scott|Scott]], (1811–1878), was persuaded by Pugin to turn his creativity towards Gothic Revival.  Scott was an Anglican, his first significant commission being the design of the [[Martyrs' Memorial]] in [[Oxford]], a powerful and highly visible architectural statement against the [[Oxford Movement]]. To Sir Gilbert fell the task of [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of many of England's finest Medieval structures including [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]], [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] and [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] Cathedrals. In the restorations, he was to employ and influence a great number of designers, including major stained glass firms.

====John Loughborough Pearson====
[[John Loughborough Pearson|Pearson]] (1817–1897) was, like Scott, chiefly a restorer of churches.  His major work was the creation of the new cathedral at [[Truro Cathedral|Truro]] in [[Cornwall]].

====Greek Thomson====
[[Alexander Thomson]], nicknamed "Greek", (1817–1875), was one of the best known Scottish architects of his day and had a profound effect on later architects, particularly [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. His building designs are curious and eclectic combinations of elements from the [[Greek architecture|Classical]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], the [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and the [[Exoticism|Exotic]]. He designed a number of churches with richly decorated interiors and employed several stained glass firms to furnish them with glass in the appropriate style.

[[File:Thinke and Thanke Willement.jpg|thumb|left|Armorial window with Willement's motto, from his home, Davington Priory]]

===Manufacturing===

====Industrial Revolution====

With the [[Industrial Revolution|growth of industry]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular the growth of those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, [[metallurgy]] and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. [[Thomas Willement]], a plumber and glazier, produced his first armourial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th-century stained glass industry. Because of the prevalence of [[leadlight]] windows, many glaziers had the required skills for making windows in geometric patterns using coloured glass for chapels and churches.  Between 1820 and 1840 some 40 different glass painters appear in the London trades directories.
At the time of the showcase of [[Victorian age|Victorian]] enterprise, the [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]] of 1851, stained glass manufacture had reached a point where 25 firms were able to display their works, including [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman]] of [[Birmingham]], [[William Wailes]] of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Ballantine and Allen]] of [[Edinburgh]], [[Betton and Evans]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[William Holland (stained glass maker)|William Holland]] of [[Warwick]].

====Charles Winston====
Charles Winston was a 19th-century lawyer whose hobby was the study of Medieval glass. In 1847 he published an influential book on its styles and production, including a translation from Theophilus' ''On Diverse Arts'', the foremost Medieval treatise on painting, stained glass and metalwork, written in the early 12th century.

Winston's interest in the technicalities of coloured glass production led him to take shards of medieval glass to [[James Powell and Sons]] of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance was because it was too flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended a return to the manufacture of hand-made [[Architectural glass|crown]] and [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinder glass]] with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows.

==Stylistic developments in 19th-century stained-glass windows==
&lt;!---NOTE ON SIZING OF PICS if you remove the forced sizing, the pics won't fit. They are each illustrating the text next to them, so that the reader can see what is being described, so none ought to be removed.---&gt;
The stylistic trends below did not necessarily follow each other consecutively. Rather, they overlapped and co-existed. Some stained glass studios were essentially a one-man show in which a single craftsmen designed and made windows of a particular style. Other firms were managed with considerable entrepreneurial skills, employing a number of designers. Some designers freelanced- their work can be seen in windows by a number of firms. Some firms changed with changing tastes and survived well into the 20th century. John Hardman &amp; Co. is still in business.

[[File:Stained glass Quarries.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Window with hand-painted quarries.]]

===Armorial windows===

These contain precisely painted shields and [[Heraldry|heraldic]] decoration utilising painterly skills that had remained in use during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Thomas Willement]] was an armorial painter of windows.

===Geometric patterns===

These windows are simple and decorative, frequently utilising the skills of the provincial [[Plumbing|plumber]]/[[Architectural glass|glazier]]. Many of these windows are among the earliest use of coloured glass but comparatively few have survived because later [[Victorian era|Victorians]] have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s.

===Quarries===

These windows are usually patterned with [[fleur de lys]] and other floral motifs that were suited to the shape of the ''diamond panes''. They added a pleasant glowing ambience to an interior and in many churches in the early 19th century made up the entire glazing. They could be painted or stencilled with designs and are sometimes mould-cast or have impressed motifs. They were systematically replaced one by one when more elaborate windows were donated. These windows generally date from 1830 to 1860. [[James Powell and Sons|Powell]] was a major supplier of impressed and stencilled quarries.

[[File:Stained glass Foliage.JPG|thumb|95px|left|Medieval foliage and Classical Figures.]]

===Medieval foliate windows===

From studying [[Stained glass|Medieval windows]], particularly those at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], many stained glass artists became adept at designing foliage and decorative borders that reproduce [[Archaeology|archaeological]] originals. There are windows of this type in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing [[The Bible|scriptural]] texts.

In those windows that are set with figurative ''rondels'', the style within them is often [[Classicism|Classical]] (see below) but sometimes [[Gothic art|Medievalising]] and sometimes seeks to reproduce the original style so accurately that to they casual eye they have the appearance of ancient windows. Ancient windows in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] were removed in the 19th century and replaced with copies. There is a very fine [[Jesse Tree]] (the Ancestors of Christ) window of this nature at the eastern end. Two panels of the original have since been returned.

===Classical figures===

Although often striving for an [[Exoticism|exotic]] appearance, the figures in many early 19th-century windows are [[Classicism|classicising]] in style. Set against a background of ''geometry'', ''quarries'' or ''foliage'', the small painted incidents within ''rondels'' and ''quatrefoils'' are nearly always conservatively [[Academic art|academic]] in their appearance, with figures based on those in [[Steel engraving|engravings]] of works by admired painters, [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Perugino]]. Often in the case of windows with ornate foliage, the archaeologically correct surrounds are at variance with the style of the rondels which make no attempt to reproduce the medieval. [[William Wailes]] and [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck]] were among the important firms.

[[File:Stained glass Gothic Revival.JPG|thumb|right|95px|Gothic forms and pure colour.]]

===Gothic Revival===

Inspired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]] and the [[Gothic Revival]], some artists sought to reproduce the style of figures that they saw in ancient glass, [[illuminated manuscripts]] and the few remaining English wall paintings of the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] period. A major source was provided by the [[Biblia Pauperum]]  or so-called "Poor Man's Bible". The resulting figures are elongated, curvilinear and stylised rather than naturalistic. The drapery folds and scrolls are exaggerated and the gestures are expansive. The painted details are highly linear, crisply defined and elegant. The style lent itself to narrative, to pure colour and to highly decorative effects. While the figures may seem quaint or even naïve, the quality of design of many of these windows is often highly sophisticated and the detailing exquisite.  The masters of Gothic revival were [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham and [[Clayton and Bell]].

[[File:Stained glass Arts &amp; crafts.JPG|thumb|95px|left|asymmetric design with bold colours]]

===Arts and Crafts Movement===

The group that surrounded and were influenced by [[William Morris]] passed through a series of trends, initially [[Pre-Raphaelites|Pre-Raphaelite]], which, although espousing the Medieval, was not [[Gothic Revival]] in the archaeological sense, being an esoteric mix of [[Medieval art|Medieval]], [[Early Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] and deeply personal influences. The [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style lent itself to the depiction of solidly working-class [[apostles]] and [[virtues]] set against backgrounds of quarries that resemble glazed earthenware tiles. The botanically accurate and semi-realistic grapevines, sunflowers and other growing things were more prominent than Gothic canopies.  Narratives that emphasised hard labour, human decency and charitable love were the themes that lent themselves to enthusiastic treatment by Morris and [[Ford Madox Brown]]. [[Burne-Jones]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] were to become philosophic traitors to the Arts and Crafts Movement by their association with the [[Aesthetic Movement]].

[[File:Stained glass Naturalism.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Human interest and tertiary colours.]]

===Naturalism===

The 1870s was a time of rich ornamentation and [[eclecticism]] in the arts. The treatment of Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to an appearance of having been carved from fine white [[limestone]]. [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] architectural details made an appearance and were often used without reference to the nature of the real [[architecture]] that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after [[World War I]].

The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style of figure painting began to give way to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such [[steel engraving|engravings]]. The works of [[Albrecht Dürer]] were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of [[Mayer of Munich]] which influenced English designers towards this style.

In the late 19th century there is often a great richness in the colouration of the windows, marked by a use of tertiary colours including rich purple, salmon pink, olive green, claret red, saffron and brown. ''Flashed glass'' was skillfully employed to enhance deep folds in robes. With this interest in colour, many windows depict atmospheric effects. Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures.

In line with the naturalistic drafting of the figures, there is a pictorial emphasis on depicting human interaction and response, often with detailed facial expressions and rather flamboyant gestures. Large scenes with large figures were popular. Among the major exponents were [[Lavers, Barraud and Westlake]]; and [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]].  These trends continued, taking two basic directions until [[World War I]].

The notable exceptions to the general trend were a large number of the windows made by Clayton and Bell who produced a diverse range of styles and continued to supply cheerfully coloured Gothic-style windows with a proliferation of bright red and yellow to catch the morning sun in church chancels.

[[File:Stained glass Refinement.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Elegant figures in subdued colours.]]

===Refinement===

A somewhat more reserved style emerged in which the vibrant colouration is toned down in favour of backgrounds that are basically white, discreetly enhanced with ''yellow-stain''. The clothing of the figures is often of the darker shades, royal blue, wine red and dark green and is lined or bordered with intricately decorated yellow-stained glass. The painting of canopies and draperies was taken to a new height. The [[grisaille|monochrome]] painting of faces is intensely detailed. The style lent itself to the depiction of [[saint]]s and [[prophet]]s, [[bishop]]s and [[admiral]]s, and [[Christ]] (or [[Queen Victoria]]) enthroned. The most influential firm in this style was [[Burlison and Grylls]]. There are many windows by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] of this type.

[[File:Stained glass Aesthetic.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Individual. Much use of opalescent glass.]]
'''Aestheticism'''

The [[Aesthetic Movement]] included [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Burne-Jones]], the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. They propounded "Art for Art's sake", claiming that Beauty was an end in itself and that the creation of art should not be bound to any social or moral ideals. The Aesthetic artists were primarily concerned with the creation of that which was beautiful. Because of this, windows created by these artists are often stylistically diverse from each other and from other styles, yet are highly recognisable as the work of a particular designer, rather than of a particular workshop.

These windows rarely pay homage to [[Medieval art|Medieval]] origins. They are closely associated with [[Art Nouveau]]. The designs are often sinuous, luscious and richly textured, making highly creative use of ''flashed glass'' and repetitive forms. Drifting clouds, sweeping draperies and angel's wings lent themselves to the art of the Aesthetes. The idiosyncrasies of Burne-Jones’ style make his windows particularly easy to recognise.  While [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] made many windows that were traditional and "safe", he designed others that are clearly aesthetic. [[Christopher Whall]] and, in America, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] were Aesthetic designers.

[[File:Stained glass Opulent.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Luxurious drapery, pearl borders.]]

===Opulence===

In the last days of the [[British Empire|Empire]], the technical proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of ground-glass paint and yellow-stain:- babies’ ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the [[Edwardian period]] are the most opulent creations of the stained glass industry. The youthful [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] of the [[Annunciation]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] the fisherman, [[John the Baptist|John]] the itinerant preacher and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls.

In the years immediately following [[World War I]], many of these windows were created by the more conservative studios as memorials to fallen soldiers. Hence there are countless two-light windows of [[St George]] and [[St Michael]] and even more lancets of the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]] gathering his lost sheep to the fold. These are the last product of the second [[Golden Age]] of stained glass window production.&lt;ref&gt;The example illustrated commemorates a 21-year-old soldier who died in the Great War. His brothers, who also died aged 17 and 19, are commemorated in the adjacent window of Christ with the Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common types of 19th-century windows based on content==
(For ''Glossary of terms''', see below. The terms in italics are explained.)

* Small rectangular or ''diaper quarries'' of clear glass set with an ''armorial'' shield, the colours being painted and fired onto the glass.
* Simple geometric decorative patterns in repeating shapes based on large, often overlapping, circles, squares and ''diapers'' set against a background of clear or decorated quarries, often within a plain brightly coloured border, surrounded by an additional clear border.
* Densely patterned diaper-shaped ''quarries'' with the design either hand painted in ''grisaille'' and ''yellow-stain'' or moulded and printed into the glass. See No.1 below
* ''Quarry'' windows set with one or more ''roundels'', ''quatrefoils'' or ''mandorlas'' containing a symbol, figure or biblical scene.
* Elaborate, intensely coloured foliage-based patterns, usually set with figurative roundels or quatrefoils and imitating ''Norman'' and ''Early Gothic'' windows. See No.2 below
* Rows of apostles, saints, prophets or virtues, each occupying one ''light'' and usually set in an architectural frame surmounted by an ornate ''canopy''. In the case of a large window with an irregular number of lights, the figure of Jesus or the Virgin with the Christ Child is usually at the centre. See No.3 below
* A series of related narrative scenes, each depicted in a single ''light'' within architectural surrounds. See No.4 below
* A series of small related narratives depicted in rows across several ''lights'', like a comic strip. See No.5 below
* A single significant incident or theme occupying a window of several ''lights'' so that the pictorial content spans the divisions in the window. See Nos.6&amp;7 below
* A complex arrangement in a large window where a central incident spread across several lights is surrounded by related themes in the outer lights, lower panels and ''tracery''. See No.8 for two related themes within a small window.

==Glossary of terms used above==

* '''Lancet''' – a single simply shaped window that is tall and narrow, and with a pointed arch at the top so that its shape is similar to a knife blade.
* '''Mullion''' – a vertical stone architectural member which divides and supports sections of a large window.
* '''Tracery''' – the pattern of stonework found at the tops of many windows.
* '''Light''' – one discreet section of a window of any shape, but most usually applied to the tall vertical sections when the window is divided up by stone mullions.
* '''Tracery lights''' – the irregularly shaped sections of glass that fill the tracery at the tops of windows.
* '''Panel''' – a part of a window that is constructed as a single piece. Most church windows with the exception of small lancets contain several panels.
* '''Diaper''' – a diamond or lozenge-shaped piece of glass. Many old windows, both ecclesiastical and domestic, are made from glass in a diaper pattern. Many figurative windows have a background of diapers.
* '''Quarry''' – a four-sided geometrically shaped piece of glass, coloured, painted, printed or impressed with a design and used to create a regular decorative pattern in a window.
* '''Grisaille''' – monochrome painting on glass using a mixture of ground glass, ground lead and other substances.
* '''Yellow-stain''' – a pigment of silver nitrate painted and fired on the surface of a window to give a bright yellow colour.
* '''Stone-border''' – a thin border of glass, generally white or transparent but sometimes red, encircling a window light and giving a radiant effect.
* '''Roundels, quatrefoils and mandorlas''' – these are shapes to be found within window designs, containing a picture or significant motif. A ''roundel'' is circular, a ''quatrefoil'' has four lobes like a simple flower, a ''mandorla'' is the shape enclosed by two arcs, meeting at points top and bottom and usually only used to contain a depiction of [[Christ]] or a symbol of him. It is sometimes also used for a depiction of the [[Virgin Mary]].
* '''Canopy''' – a motif found in many windows representing an elaborate architectural canopy, usually [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style but occasionally [[Classicism|Classical]].

'''Bulk material handling''' is an [[engineering]] field that is centered on the design of equipment used for the handling of dry materials. Bulk materials are those dry materials which are powdery, granular or lumpy in nature, and are stored in heaps&lt;ref&gt;http://practicalmaintenance.net/wp-content/uploads/Maintenance-of-Ash-Handling-Plants-and-Pneumatic-Conveying-Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of bulk materials are [[minerals]], [[ore]]s, [[coal]], [[cereal]]s, [[woodchips]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], [[cement]], [[ash]], [[salt]], [[chemicals]], [[grain]], [[sugar]], [[flour]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]] in loose bulk form. It can also relate to the handling of mixed [[waste]]s. Bulk material handling is an essential part of all industries that process bulk ingredients, including: food, beverage, confectionery, pet food, animal feed, tobacco, chemical, agricultural, polymer, plastic, rubber, ceramic, electronics, metals, minerals, paint, paper, textiles and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiroflow.com/bulk-material-handling/|title=What is Bulk Material Handling? - Spiroflow|date=2016-09-15|work=Spiroflow|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major characteristics of bulk materials, so far as their handling is concerned, are: lump size, [[Bulk density|bulk weight (density)]], [[Water content|moisture content]], flowability (particle mobility), [[angle of repose]], [[Abrasive wear|abrasiveness]] and [[Corrosion|corrosivity]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://practicalmaintenance.net/wp-content/uploads/Maintenance-of-Ash-Handling-Plants-and-Pneumatic-Conveying-Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulk material handling systems are typically composed of stationary machinery such as [[conveyor belt]]s, [[screw conveyor]]s, [[tubular drag conveyor]]s, [[moving floor]]s, toploaders, [[stacker]]s, [[reclaimer]]s, [[bucket elevator]]s, truck dumpers, [[Rotary car dumper|railcar dumpers or wagon tipplers]], [[shiploader]]s, [[Chute (gravity)|hoppers]] and diverters and various mobile equipment such as [[loader (equipment)|loaders]], [[mobile hopper loaders / unloader]]s, various shuttles, combined with storage facilities such as [[Feedlot|stockyards]], [[Silo|storage silo]]s or [[stockpile]]s. Advanced bulk material handling systems feature integrated bulk storage (silos), conveying (mechanical or pneumatic&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Pneumatic_transport.html&lt;/ref&gt;), and discharge.

The purpose of a bulk material handling facility may be to transport material from one of several locations (i.e. a source) to an ultimate destination or to process material such as ore in concentrating and [[smelting]] or handling materials for manufacturing such as logs, wood chips and sawdust at sawmills and paper mills. Other industries using bulk materials handling include flour mills and coal-fired utility boilers.

Providing storage and inventory control and possibly material blending is usually part of a bulk material handling system.

In ports handling large quantities of bulk materials [[Shiploader|continuous ship unloaders]] are replacing [[gantry crane]]s.

==Other materials handling classifications (non-bulk)==
Non-bulk materials handling classifications include [[palletization]] and [[containerization]].

[[File:Cheeseincheesecloth-sink.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cheese]] hung in cheesecloth to strain [[whey]] as part of cheesemaking]]
'''Cheesecloth''' is a loose-woven [[gauze]]-like [[carding|carded]] [[cotton]] [[cloth]] used primarily in cheese making and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cheese Cloth|volume=6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grades ==

Cheesecloth is available in at least seven different grades, from open to extra-fine weave. Grades are distinguished by the number of [[thread count|threads per inch]] in each direction.

==Uses==

===Food preparation===
The primary use of cheesecloth is in some styles of [[cheesemaking]], where it is used to remove whey from cheese [[curds]], and to help hold the curds together as the cheese is formed. Cheesecloth is also used in straining [[Stock (food)|stocks]] and [[custard]]s, bundling herbs, making [[tofu]] and [[ghee]], and thickening [[yogurt]]. [[Queso blanco|Queso blanco and queso fresco]] are Spanish and Mexican cheeses that are made from whole milk using cheesecloth. [[Quark (cheese)|Quark]] is a type of German unsalted cheese that is sometimes formed with cheesecloth. [[Paneer]] is a kind of Indian [[Types of cheese#Fresh.2C whey and stretched curd cheeses|fresh cheese]] that is commonly made with cheesecloth. Fruitcake is wrapped in rum-infused cheesecloth during the process of "feeding" the fruitcake as it ripens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missvickie.com/recipes/desserts/fruitcake-carefeed.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307023623/http://www.missvickie.com/recipes/desserts/fruitcake-carefeed.html |archivedate=2016-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Cheesecloth can also be used for several [[printmaking]] processes including [[lithography]] for wiping up [[gum arabic]]. In [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] a heavily starched cheesecloth called tarlatan is used for wiping away excess ink from the printing surface.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Romano, Ross. "The Complete Printmaker", page. 114, 118. TheFreepress, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheesecloth #60 is used in product safety and regulatory testing for potential fire hazards. Cheesecloth is wrapped tightly over the device under test, which is then subjected to simulated conditions such as lightning surges conducted through power or telecom cables, [[Fault (power engineering)|power faults]], etc. The device may be destroyed but must not ignite the cheesecloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Telcordia Technologies]] Generic Requirements [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1089&amp; GR-1089-CORE]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to ensure that the device can [[fail safe]]ly, and not start electrical fires in the vicinity.

Cheesecloth made to [[United States]] Federal Standard CCC-C-440 is used to test the durability of [[optical coatings]] per [[United States Military Standard]] MIL-C-48497. The optics are exposed to a 95%-100% humidity environment at {{convert|120|°F}} for 24 hours, and then a {{convert|1/4|in|mm}} thick by {{convert|3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide pad of cheesecloth is rubbed over the optical surface for at least 50 strokes under at least {{convert|1|lb-f|N}}. The optical surface is examined for streaks or scratches, and then its optical performance is measured to ensure that no deterioration occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS/MIL-SPECS-MIL-C/MIL-C-48497A_6070/ MIL-C-488497]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheesecloth is used in India and Pakistan for making summer shirts. Cheesecloth material shirts were popular for beachwear during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthe70s.com/clothes/cheeseclothshirts0.shtml |title=Clothes of the Seventies, Cheese Cloth Shirts |publisher=Inthe70s.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheesecloth has been used to create the illusion of "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]" during spirit channelling or other ghost-related phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/ectoplasm.html James Randi Educational Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscriminal.com/episode-79-secrets-and-seances-11-17-2017 Criminal Podcast: Secrets and Séances]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheesecloth is used in anatomical [[dissection]] laboratories to prevent desiccation. The cloth is soaked with a preservative solution such as [[formalin]] then wrapped around the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Herb|date=1998|title=How to reduce the level of formaldehyde in the zoology lab.|url=http://www.ableweb.org/volumes/vol-19/mini.12.rosenberg.pdf|journal=Tested studies for laboratory teaching|volume=19|pages=357-360|via=ableweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commensurate line circuits''' are electrical circuits composed of [[transmission line]]s that are all the same length; commonly one-eighth of a [[wavelength]].  [[Lumped element model|Lumped element]] circuits can be directly converted to [[distributed element circuit]]s of this form by the use of '''Richards' transformation'''.  This transformation has a particularly simple result; [[inductor]]s are replaced with transmission lines terminated in short-circuits and [[capacitor]]s are replaced with lines terminated in open-circuits.  Commensurate line theory is particularly useful for designing [[distributed element filter]]s for use at [[microwave]] frequencies.

It is usually necessary to carry out a further transformation of the circuit using '''Kuroda's identities'''.  There are several reasons for applying one of the Kuroda transformations; the principal reason is usually to eliminate series connected components.  In some technologies, including the widely used [[microstrip]], series connections are difficult or impossible to implement.

The frequency response of commensurate line circuits, like all distributed element circuits, will periodically repeat, limiting the frequency range over which they are effective.  Circuits designed by the methods of Richards and Kuroda are not the most compact.  Refinements to the methods of coupling elements together can produce more compact designs.  Nevertheless, the commensurate line theory remains the basis for many of these more advanced filter designs.

==Commensurate lines==
Commensurate lines are [[transmission line]]s that are all the same electrical length, but not necessarily the same [[characteristic impedance]] (''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  A commensurate line circuit is an electrical circuit composed only of commensurate lines terminated with [[resistor]]s or short- and open-circuits.  In 1948, [[Paul I. Richards]] published a theory of commensurate line circuits by which a passive [[lumped element model|lumped element]] circuit could be transformed into a [[distributed element model|distributed element]] circuit with precisely the same characteristics over a certain frequency range.&lt;ref name=landc1056&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1056&lt;/ref&gt;

Lengths of lines in [[distributed element circuit]]s, for generality, are usually expressed in terms of the circuit's nominal operational wavelength, λ.  Lines of the prescribed length in a commensurate line circuit are called ''unit elements'' (UEs).  A particularly simple relationship pertains if the UEs are λ/8.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kumar &amp; Grebennikov, p. 116|Wen, p. 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each element in the lumped circuit is transformed into a corresponding UE.  However, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the lines must be set according to the component value in the analogous lumped circuit and this may result in values of ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that are not practical to implement.  This is particularly a problem with printed technologies, such as [[microstrip]], when implementing high characteristic impedances.  High impedance requires narrow lines and there is a minimum size that can be printed.  Very wide lines, on the other hand, allow the possibility of undesirable [[transverse mode|transverse resonant modes]] to form.  A different length of UE, with a different ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, may be chosen to overcome these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner &amp; Wickert, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical length can also be expressed as the [[phase change (waves)|phase change]] between the start and the end of the line.  [[Phase (waves)|Phase]] is measured in [[Angle#Units|angle units]].  &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the mathematical symbol for an angle variable, is used as the symbol for electrical length when expressed as an angle.  In this convention λ represents 360°, or 2π [[radian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weik, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of using commensurate lines is that the commensurate line theory allows circuits to be [[network synthesis|synthesised]] from a prescribed frequency function.  While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be [[circuit analysis|analysed]] to determine its frequency function, that circuit cannot necessarily be easily synthesised starting from the frequency function.  The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable.  Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable.  A well developed theory exists for synthesising lumped element circuits from a given frequency function.  Any circuit so synthesised can be converted to a commensurate line circuit using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Richards' transformation==
'''Richards' transformation''' transforms the [[angular frequency]] variable, ω, according to,

:&lt;math&gt; \omega \to \tan (k \omega) &lt;/math&gt;

or, more usefully for further analysis, in terms of the [[complex frequency]] variable, ''s'',

:&lt;math&gt; s \to \tanh (k s) &lt;/math&gt;

:where ''k'' is an arbitrary constant related to the UE length, θ, and some designer chosen reference frequency, ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt; k \omega_c = \theta. &lt;/math&gt;

:''k'' has units of time and is, in fact, the [[phase delay]] inserted by a UE.

Comparing this transform with expressions for the [[driving point impedance]] of [[stub (electronics)|stubs]] terminated, respectively, with a short circuit and an open circuit,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_\mathrm{SC} &amp;= j Z_0 \tan(k \omega) \\
Z_\mathrm{OC} &amp;= -j Z_0 \cot (k \omega) \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

it can be seen that (for θ &lt; π/2) a short circuit stub has the impedance of a lumped [[inductance]] and an open circuit stub has the impedance of a lumped [[capacitance]].  Richards' transformation substitutes [[inductor]]s with short circuited UEs and [[capacitor]]s with open circuited UEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Richards, pp. 217–218|Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1056|Hunter, p. 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the length is λ/8 (or θ=π/4), this simplifies to,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_\mathrm{SC} &amp;= j Z_0 \\
Z_\mathrm{OC} &amp;= -j Z_0 \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is frequently written as,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_\mathrm{SC} &amp;= j L \\
Z_\mathrm{OC} &amp;= {1 \over j C} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

''L'' and ''C'' are conventionally the symbols for inductance and capacitance, but here they represent respectively the characteristic impedance of an inductive stub and the characteristic [[electrical admittance|admittance]] of a capacitive stub.  This convention is used by numerous authors, and later in this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|See for instance;|Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1058|Kumar &amp; Grebennikov, p. 118|Bhat &amp; Koul, p. 583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Omega-domain==
[[File:Richards transform of Chebyshev filter.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Frequency response of a fifth order [[Chebyshev filter]] (top), and the same filter after applying Richards' transformation]]
Richards' transformation can be viewed as transforming from a [[s-domain]] representation to a new domain called the Ω-domain where,

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega = \tan ( k \omega ) &lt;/math&gt;

If Ω is [[prototype filter#Frequency scaling|normalised]] so that Ω=1 when ω=ω&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, then it is required that,

:&lt;math&gt; k \omega_c = \theta = {\pi \over 4} &lt;/math&gt;

and the length in distance units becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; \ell = {\lambda \over 8} &lt;/math&gt;

Any circuit composed of discrete, linear, lumped components will have a [[transfer function]] ''H''(''s'') that is a [[rational function]] in ''s''.  A circuit composed of transmission line UEs derived from the lumped circuit by Richards' transformation will have a transfer function ''H''(''j''Ω) that is a rational function of precisely the same form as ''H''(''s'').  That is, the shape of the frequency response of the lumped circuit against the ''s'' frequency variable will be precisely the same as the shape of the frequency response of the transmission line circuit against the ''j''Ω frequency variable and the circuit will be functionally the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Besser &amp; Gilmore, p. 457|Hunter, p. 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, infinity in the Ω domain is transformed to ω=π/4''k'' in the ''s'' domain.  The entire frequency response is squeezed down to this finite interval.  Above this frequency, the same response is repeated in the same intervals, alternately in reverse.  This is a consequence of the periodic nature of the [[tangent function]].  This multiple passband result is a general feature of all distributed element circuits, not just those arrived at through Richards' transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cascade element==
A UE connected in cascade is a [[two-port network]] that has no exactly corresponding circuit in lumped elements.  It is functionally a fixed delay.  There are lumped-element circuits that can approximate a fixed delay such as the [[Bessel filter]], but they only work within a prescribed [[passband]], even with ideal components.  Alternatively, lumped-element [[all-pass filter]]s can be constructed that pass all frequencies (with ideal components), but they have constant delay only within a narrow band of frequencies.  Examples are the [[lattice phase equaliser]] and [[bridged T delay equaliser]].&lt;ref&gt;Helszajn, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

There is consequently no lumped circuit that Richard's transformation can transform into a cascade-connected line, and there is no reverse transformation for this element.  Commensurate line theory thus introduces a new element of ''delay'', or ''length''.&lt;ref name=landc1056/&gt;
Two or more UEs connected in cascade with the same ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalent to a single, longer, transmission line.  Thus, lines of length ''n''θ for integer ''n'' are allowable in commensurate circuits.  Some circuits can be implemented ''entirely'' as a cascade of UEs: [[impedance matching]] networks, for instance, can be done this way, as can most filters.&lt;ref name=landc1056/&gt;

==Kuroda's identities==
[[File:Kuroda's identities.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Kuroda's identities]]
'''Kuroda's identities''' are a set of four equivalent circuits that overcome certain difficulties with applying Richards' transformations directly.  The four basic transformations are shown in the figure.  Here the symbols for capacitors and inductors are used to represent open-circuit and short-circuit stubs.  Likewise, the symbols ''C'' and ''L'' here represent respectively the [[susceptance]] of an open circuit stub and the [[electrical reactance|reactance]] of a short circuit stub, which, for θ=λ/8, are respectively equal to the characteristic [[admittance]] and characteristic impedance of the stub line.  The boxes with thick lines represent cascade connected commensurate lengths of line with the marked characteristic impedance.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1058|Kumar &amp; Grebennikov, p. 118| Sisodia, p. 5.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first difficulty solved is that all the UEs are required to be connected together at the same point.  This arises because the lumped element model assumes that all the elements take up zero space (or no significant space) and that there is no delay in signals between the elements.  Applying Richards' transformation to convert the lumped circuit into a distributed circuit allows the element to now occupy a finite space (its length) but does not remove the requirement for zero distance between the interconnections.  By repeatedly applying the first two Kuroda identities, UE lengths of the lines feeding into the [[port (circuit theory)|ports]] of the circuit can be moved between the circuit components to physically separate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1057| Sisodia, p. 5.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second difficulty that Kuroda's identities can overcome is that series connected lines are not always practical.  While series connection of lines can easily be done in, for instance, [[coaxial cable|coaxial technology]], it is not possible in the widely used microstrip technology and other planar technologies.  [[Electronic filter|Filter circuits]] frequently use a [[ladder topology]] with alternating series and shunt elements.  Such circuits can be converted to all shunt components in the same step used to space the components with the first two identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Besser &amp; Gilmore, p. 469|Sisodia, p. 5.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and fourth identities allow characteristic impedances to be scaled down or up respectively.  These can be useful for transforming impedances that are impractical to implement.  However, they have the disadvantage of requiring the addition of an [[ideal transformer]] with a turns ratio equal to the scaling factor.&lt;ref&gt;Sisodia, p. 5.27&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

In the decade after Richards' publication, advances in the theory of distributed circuits took place mostly in Japan.  K. Kuroda published these identities in 1955 in his Ph.D thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Wen, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they did not appear in English until 1958 in a paper by Ozaki and Ishii on [[stripline]] filters.&lt;ref name=landc1057&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1057&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further refinements==

One of the major applications of commensurate line theory is to design [[distributed element filter]]s.  Such filters constructed directly by Richards' and Kuroda's method are not very compact.  This can be an important design consideration, especially in mobile devices.  The stubs stick out to the side of the main line and the space between them is not doing anything useful.  Ideally, the stubs should project on alternate sides&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 789&lt;/ref&gt; to prevent them coupling with each other, taking up further space, although this is not always done for space considerations.  More than that, the cascade connected elements that couple together the stubs contribute nothing to the frequency function, they are only there to transform the stubs into the required impedance.  Putting it another way, the [[degree of a polynomial|order]] of the frequency function is determined solely by the number of stubs, not by the total number of UEs (generally speaking, the higher the order, the better the filter).  More complex synthesis techniques can produce filters in which all elements are contributing.&lt;ref name=landc1057/&gt;

The cascade connected λ/8 sections of the Kuroda circuits are an example of impedance transformers, the archetypical example of such circuits is the [[quarter-wave impedance transformer|λ/4 impedance transformer]].  Although this is double the length of the λ/8 line it has the useful property that it can be transformed from a [[low-pass filter]] to a [[high-pass filter]] by replacing the open circuit stubs with short circuit stubs.  The two filters are exactly matched with the same cut-off frequency and mirror-symmetrical responses.  It is therefore ideal for use in [[diplexer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1059&lt;/ref&gt;  The λ/4 transformer has this property of being invariant under a low-pass to high-pass transformation because it is not just an impedance transformer, but a special case of transformer, an [[impedance inverter]].  That is, it transforms any impedance network at one port, to the inverse impedance, or [[dual impedance]], at the other port.  However, a single length of transmission line can only be precisely λ/4 long at its resonant frequency and there is consequently a limit to the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] over which it will work.  There are more complex kinds of inverter circuit that more accurately invert impedances.  There are two classes of inverter, the ''J''-inverter, which transforms a shunt admittance into a series impedance, and the ''K''-inverter which does the reverse transformation.  The coefficients ''J'' and ''K'' are respectively the scaling admittance and impedance of the converter.&lt;ref&gt;Du &amp; Swamy, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubs may be lengthened in order to change from an open circuit to a short circuit stub and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp. 605–614&lt;/ref&gt;  Low-pass filters usually consist of series inductors and shunt capacitors.  Applying Kuroda's identities will convert these to all shunt capacitors, which are open circuit stubs.  Open circuit stubs are preferred in printed technologies because they are easier to implement, and this is the technology likely to be found in consumer products.  However, this is not the case in other technologies such as coaxial line, or [[twin-lead]] where the short circuit may actually be helpful for mechanical support of the structure.  Short circuits also have a small advantage in that they are generally have a more precise position than open circuits.  If the circuit is to be further transformed into the [[waveguide filter|waveguide]] medium then open circuits are out of the question because there would be radiation out of the aperture so formed.  For a high-pass filter the inverse applies, applying Kuroda will naturally result in short circuit stubs and it may be desirable for a printed design to convert to open circuits.  As an example, a λ/8 open circuit stub can be replaced with a 3λ/8 short circuit stub of the same characteristic impedance without changing the circuit functionally.&lt;ref&gt;Poole &amp; Darwazeh, pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupling elements together with impedance transformer lines is not the most compact design.  Other methods of coupling have been developed, especially for [[band-pass filter]]s that are far more compact. These include [[parallel lines filter]]s, [[interdigital filter]]s, [[hairpin filter]]s, and the semi-lumped design [[combline filter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Levy &amp; Cohn, p. 1058|Maloratsky, pp. 219–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curt Herzstark''' (July 26, 1902 – October 27, 1988) was an Austrian engineer. During [[World War II]], he designed plans for a [[machine|mechanical]] [[pocket calculator]] (the ''[[Curta calculator|Curta]]'').

==Life and career==
Herzstark was born in [[Vienna]], the son of Marie and Samuel Jakob Herzstark. His father was Jewish and his mother, born a Catholic, converted to Lutheranism and raised Herzstark Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;http://wvegter.hivemind.net/abacus/CyberHeroes/Herzstark.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107358/1/oh140cheng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904054831/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/107358/1/oh140cheng.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1938, while he was technical manager of his father's company Rechenmaschinenwerk AUSTRIA Herzstark &amp; Co., Herzstark had already completed the design of the Curta, but could not manufacture it due to the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Anschluss|annexation]] of [[Austria]]. Instead, the company was ordered to make measuring devices for the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. In 1943, perhaps influenced by the fact that his father was a liberal [[Jew]], the Nazis arrested him for "helping Jews and subversive elements" and "indecent contacts with [[Aryan race|Aryan]] women" and sent him to the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. However, the reports of the army about the precision-production of the firm AUSTRIA and especially about the technical expertise of Herzstark led the Nazis to treat him as an "intelligence-slave".

His imprisonment at Buchenwald seriously threatened his health, but his condition improved when he was called to work in the factory linked to the camp, which was named after [[Wilhelm Gustloff]]. There he was ordered to make a drawing of the construction of his calculator, so that the Nazis could ultimately give the machine to the [[Führer]] as a gift after the successful end of the war. The preferential treatment this allowed ensured that he survived his stay at Buchenwald until the camp's liberation in 1945, by which time he had redrawn the complete construction from memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/concentration-camp-inmate-invented-world-s-first-pocket-calculator-a-909062.html|title= Early Calculator: The Sad Story of an Inventor at Buchenwald|accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzstark died in [[Nendeln]], [[Liechtenstein]].

The Curta is referenced in chapter four of [[William Gibson]]'s [[Pattern Recognition (novel)|''Pattern Recognition'']]. The chapter is entitled 'Math Grenades', referring to protagonist Cayce Pollard mistaking them for [[hand grenades]] at first glance.

[[File:Data warehouse architecture.jpg|thumb|360px|The basic architecture of a data warehouse]]

In [[computing]], a '''data warehouse''' ('''DW''' or '''DWH'''), also known as an '''enterprise data warehouse''' ('''EDW'''), is a system used for [[Business reporting|reporting]] and [[data analysis]], and is considered a core component of [[business intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Dedić|first1=Nedim|last2=Stanier|first2=Clare|year=2016|editor1-last=Hammoudi|editor1-first=Slimane|editor2-last=Maciaszek|editor2-first=Leszek|editor3-last=Missikoff|editor3-first=Michele M. Missikoff|editor4-last=Camp|editor4-first=Olivier|editor5-last=Cordeiro|editor5-first=José|title=An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development|url=http://eprints.staffs.ac.uk/2770/|journal=Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems (ICEIS 2016)|publisher=SciTePress|volume=1|pages=196–206|conference=International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, 25–28 April 2016, Rome, Italy|conferenceurl=https://eprints.staffs.ac.uk/2770/1/ICEIS_2016_Volume_1.pdf|doi=10.5220/0005858401960206|isbn=978-989-758-187-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/12/04/10-common-mistakes-when-building-a-data-warehouse/|publisher=blog.rjmetrics.com|title=9 Reasons Data Warehouse Projects Fail|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise.&lt;ref name="spotlessdata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726071809/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/exploring-data-warehouses-and-data-quality|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=Exploring Data Warehouses and Data Quality|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data stored in the warehouse is [[upload]]ed from the [[operational system]]s (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an [[operational data store]] and may require [[data cleansing]]&lt;ref name="rjmetrics"/&gt; for additional operations to ensure [[data quality]] before it is used in the DW for reporting.

The typical [[extract, transform, load]] (ETL)-based data warehouse&lt;ref name="spotlessdata2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217144032/https://spotlessdata.com/what-big-data|publisher=spotlessdata.com|title=What is Big Data?|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[Staging (data)|staging]], [[data integration]], and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an [[operational data store]] (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a [[star schema]]. The access layer helps users retrieve data.&lt;ref name=IJCA96Patil&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijcaonline.org/proceedings/icwet/number9/2131-db195 |author1=Patil, Preeti S. |author2=Srikantha Rao |author3=Suryakant B. Patil |title=Optimization of Data Warehousing System: Simplification in Reporting and Analysis |work=IJCA Proceedings on International Conference and workshop on Emerging Trends in Technology (ICWET) |year=2011 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=33–37 |publisher=Foundation of Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of the data is [[data cleansing|cleansed]], transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for [[data mining]], [[OLAP|online analytical processing]], [[market research]] and [[decision support]].&lt;ref&gt;Marakas &amp; O'Brien 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the [[data dictionary]] are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition for data warehousing includes [[business intelligence tools]], tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve [[metadata]].

==Benefits==
A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
* Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.
* Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running, analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
* Maintain [[Provenance#Data provenance|data history]], even if the source transaction systems do not.
* Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.
* Improve [[data quality]], by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
* Present the organization's information consistently.
* Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source.
* Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
* Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the [[operational system]]s.
* Add value to operational business applications, notably [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems.
*Make decision–support queries easier to write.
*Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idera.com/resourcecentral/whitepapers/modern-data-architecture|title=Modern Data Architecture {{!}} IDERA|last=|first=|date=|website=www.idera.com|publisher=|accessdate=2016-09-18|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic environment==
The environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:

* Source systems that provide data to the warehouse or mart;
* Data integration technology and processes that are needed to prepare the data for use;
* Different architectures for storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts;
*Different tools and applications for the variety of users;
*Metadata, data quality, and governance processes must be in place to ensure that the warehouse or mart meets its purposes.

In regards to source systems listed above, R. Kelly Rainer states, "A common source for the data in data warehouses is the company's operational databases, which can be relational databases".&lt;ref name=rainer2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainer|first=R. Kelly|first2=Casey G. |last2=Cegielski |title=Introduction to Information Systems: Enabling and Transforming Business, 4th Edition (Kindle Edition)|date=2012-05-01|publisher=Wiley|pages=127, 128, 130, 131, 133 |isbn=978-1118129401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding data integration, Rainer states, "It is necessary to extract data from source systems, transform them, and load them into a data mart or warehouse".&lt;ref name=rainer2012/&gt;

Rainer discusses storing data in an organization's data warehouse or data marts.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Metadata are data about data. "IT personnel need information about data sources; database, table, and column names; refresh schedules; and data usage measures".&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt;

Today, the most successful companies are those that can respond quickly and flexibly to market changes and opportunities. A key to this response is the effective and efficient use of data and information by analysts and managers.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; A "data warehouse" is a repository of historical data that are organized by subject to support decision makers in the organization.&lt;ref name=rainer2012 /&gt; Once data are stored in a data mart or warehouse, they can be accessed.

==Related systems (data mart, OLAP, OLTP, predictive analytics)==
A [[data mart]] is a simple form of a data warehouse that is focused on a single subject (or functional area), hence they draw data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department within an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.oracle.com/html/E10312_01/dm_concepts.htm |title=Data Mart Concepts |publisher=Oracle |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denormalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system. Given that data marts generally cover only a subset of the data contained in a data warehouse, they are often easier and faster to implement.

Types of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.{{clarify |date=March 2017 |reason= }}

[[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP) is characterized by a relatively low volume of transactions. Queries are often very complex and involve aggregations. For OLAP systems, response time is an effectiveness measure. OLAP applications are widely used by [[Data Mining]] techniques. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually [[star schema]]s). OLAP systems typically have data latency of a few hours, as opposed to data marts, where latency is expected to be closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are : Roll-up (Consolidation), Drill-down and Slicing &amp; Dicing.

[[Online transaction processing]] (OLTP) is characterized by a large number of short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize very fast query processing and maintaining [[data integrity]] in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually [[Third normal form|3NF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html |title=OLTP vs. OLAP |year=2009 |website=Datawarehouse4u.Info |quote=We can divide IT systems into transactional (OLTP) and analytical (OLAP). In general we can assume that OLTP systems provide source data to data warehouses, whereas OLAP systems help to analyze it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.

[[Predictive analytics]] is about [[pattern recognition|finding]] and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models that can be used to [[prediction|predict]] future outcomes. Predictive analysis is different from OLAP in that OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive in nature, while predictive analysis focuses on the future. These systems are also used for [[customer relationship management]] (CRM).

==History==
The concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0,10801,70102,00.html |title=The Story So Far |date=2002-04-15 |accessdate=2008-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708182105/http://www.computerworld.com/databasetopics/data/story/0%2C10801%2C70102%2C00.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the "business data warehouse". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to [[decision support system|decision support environments]]. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as [[legacy system]]s), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from "[[data mart]]s" that was tailored for ready access by users.

Key developments in early years of data warehousing were:

* 1960s – [[General Mills]] and [[Dartmouth College]], in a joint research project, develop the terms ''dimensions'' and ''facts''.&lt;ref name="kimball16"&gt;Kimball 2002, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1970s – [[ACNielsen]] and IRI provide dimensional data marts for retail sales.&lt;ref name="kimball16" /&gt;
* 1970s – [[Bill Inmon]] begins to define and discuss the term: Data Warehouse.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
* 1975 – [[Sperry Univac]] introduces [[MAPPER]] (MAintain, Prepare, and Produce Executive Reports) is a database management and reporting system that includes the world's first [[Fourth-generation programming language|4GL]]. First platform designed for building Information Centers (a forerunner of contemporary data warehouse technology)
* 1983 – [[Teradata]] introduced the [[DBC 1012|DBC/1012]] database computer specifically designed for decision support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Will Teradata revive a market? |author= Paul Gillin |pages= 43, 48 |work= Computer World |date= February 20, 1984 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5pw6ePUC8YYC&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate= 2017-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1984 – [[Metaphor Computer Systems]], founded by [[David Liddle]] and Don Massaro, released a hardware/software package and GUI for business users to create a database management and analytic system.
* 1985 - [[Sperry Corporation]] publish an article (Martyn Jones and Philip Newman) on information centres, where they introduce the term MAPPER data warehouse in the context of information centres.
* 1988 – Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy publish the article ''An architecture for a business and information system'' where they introduce the term "business data warehouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5387658|title=An architecture for a business and information system|journal=IBM Systems Journal | doi=10.1147/sj.271.0060|volume=27|pages=60–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990 – Red Brick Systems, founded by [[Ralph Kimball]], introduces Red Brick Warehouse, a database management system specifically for data warehousing.
* 1991 – Prism Solutions, founded by [[Bill Inmon]], introduces Prism Warehouse Manager, software for developing a data warehouse.
* 1992 – [[Bill Inmon]] publishes the book ''Building the Data Warehouse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Inmon|first=Bill|title=Building the Data Warehouse|year=1992|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-56960-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1995 – The Data Warehousing Institute, a for-profit organization that promotes data warehousing, is founded.
* 1996 – [[Ralph Kimball]] publishes the book ''The Data Warehouse Toolkit''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Data Warehouse Toolkit|last=Kimball|first=Ralph|publisher=Wiley|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-14977-5|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000 – [[Dan Linstedt]] release in the public domain the [[Data vault modeling]] conceived in 1990 as an alternative to Inmon and Kimball to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems, with emphasis on tracing, auditing and resiliance to change of the source data model.
* 2012 – [[Bill Inmon]] developed and made public technology known as "textual disambiguation". Textual disambiguation applies context to raw text and reformats the raw text and context into a standard data base format. Once raw text is passed through textual disambiguation, it can easily and efficiently be accessed and analyzed by standard business intelligence technology. Textual disambiguation is accomplished through the execution of textual ETL. Textual disambiguation is useful wherever raw text is found, such as in documents, Hadoop, email, and so forth.

==Information storage==

===Facts===
A fact is a value or measurement, which represents a fact about the managed entity or system.

Facts, as reported by the reporting entity, are said to be at raw level. E.g. in a mobile telephone system, if a BTS ([[base transceiver station]]) received 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, it allocates for 820, and rejects the remaining, it would report three '''facts''' or measurements to a management system:
* tch_req_total = 1000
* tch_req_success = 820
* tch_req_fail = 180

Facts at the raw level are further aggregated to higher levels in various [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]] to extract more service or business-relevant information from it. These are called aggregates or summaries or aggregated facts.

For instance, if there are three BTS in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated from the BTS to the city level in the network dimension. For example:

* tch_req_success_city = tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3
* avg_tch_req_success_city = (tch_req_success_bts1 + tch_req_success_bts2 + tch_req_success_bts3) / 3

===Dimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data===
There are three or more leading approaches to storing data in a data warehouse&amp;nbsp;— the most important approaches are the dimensional approach and the normalized approach.

====Dimensional approach====
The dimensional approach refers to [[Ralph Kimball]]'s approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using a Dimensional Model/[[star schema]]. The normalized approach, also called the [[Third normal form|3NF]] model (Third Normal Form) refers to Bill Inmon's approach in which it is stated that the data warehouse should be modeled using an E-R model/normalized model.

In a [[Star schema|dimensional approach]], [[transaction data]] are partitioned into "facts", which are generally numeric transaction data, and "[[dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]]", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.

A key advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the user to understand and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to operate very quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dimensional structures are easy to understand for business users, because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system whereas the dimensions surrounding them contain context about the measurement (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage offered by dimensional model is that it does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.

The model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as [http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/dcubes/dcubes.html data cube]. Where the dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, while the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.

The main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are the following:
# To maintain the integrity of facts and dimensions, loading the data warehouse with data from different operational systems is complicated.
# It is difficult to modify the data warehouse structure if the organization adopting the dimensional approach changes the way in which it does business.

====Normalized approach====
In the normalized approach, the data in the data warehouse are stored following, to a degree, [[database normalization]] rules. Tables are grouped together by ''subject areas'' that reflect general data categories (e.g., data on customers, products, finance, etc.). The normalized structure divides data into entities, which creates several tables in a relational database. When applied in large enterprises the result is dozens of tables that are linked together by a web of joins. Furthermore, each of the created entities is converted into separate physical tables when the database is implemented (Kimball, Ralph 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svrtechnologies.com/datastage-training/data-warehouse-online-training |title=Data Warehouse kimball |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Some disadvantages of this approach are that, because of the number of tables involved, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and to access the information without a precise understanding of the sources of data and of the [[data structure]] of the data warehouse.

Both normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity-relationship diagrams as both contain joined relational tables. The difference between the two models is the degree of normalization (also known as [[Database normalization#Normal forms|Normal Forms]]). These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).

In ''Information-Driven Business'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillard|first=Robert|title=Information-Driven Business|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-62577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Hillard proposes an approach to comparing the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. The technique shows that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but this extra information comes at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike2.openmethodology.org/wiki/Small_Worlds_Data_Transformation_Measure |title=Information Theory &amp; Business Intelligence Strategy - Small Worlds Data Transformation Measure - MIKE2.0, the open source methodology for Information Development |publisher=Mike2.openmethodology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design methods==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===Bottom-up design===
In the ''bottom-up'' approach, [[data mart]]s are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific [[business process]]es. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of "the bus", a collection of [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimension]]s and [[Facts (data warehouse)#Types|conformed fact]]s, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://decisionworks.com/2003/09/the-bottom-up-misnomer/|title=The Bottom-Up Misnomer - DecisionWorks Consulting|website=DecisionWorks Consulting|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Top-down design===
The ''top-down'' approach is designed using a normalized enterprise [[data model]]. [[Data element|"Atomic" data]], that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gartner, Of Data Warehouses, Operational Data Stores, Data Marts and Data Outhouses, Dec 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid design===
Data warehouses (DW) often resemble the [[hub and spokes architecture]]. [[Legacy system]]s feeding the warehouse often include [[customer relationship management]] and [[enterprise resource planning]], generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the [[extract transform load]] process, data warehouses often make use of an [[operational data store]], the information from which is parsed into the actual DW. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.

A hybrid DW database is kept on [[third normal form]] to eliminate [[data redundancy]]. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The DW provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a DW to be replaced with a [[master data management]] repository where operational, not static information could reside.

The [[data vault modeling]] components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and [[star schema]]. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema based release area for business purposes.

==Data warehouse characteristics==
There are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.

===Subject-Oriented===
Unlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around subjects of the enterprise ([[database normalization]]). Subject orientation can be really useful for decision making.
Gathering the required objects is called subject oriented.

===Integrated===
The data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.

===Time-variant===
While operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents data over a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting, If a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/662453070|title=Data warehousing fundamentals for IT professionals|last=Paulraj.|first=Ponniah,|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Ponniah, Paulraj.|isbn=9780470462072|edition= 2nd |location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=662453070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonvolatile===
The data in the data warehouse is read-only which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61762085|title=Building the data warehouse|last=H.|first=Inmon, William|date=2005|publisher=Wiley Pub|isbn=9780764599446|edition= 4th |location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=61762085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarized===
In the data warehouse, data is summarized at different levels.The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and moves down to lower levels of details.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Data warehouse architecture==
The different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine tuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=Satinder Bal|last2=Mittal|first2=Aditya|title=Introduction to Database Management System|year=2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Database_Management_Syst.html?id=fyQTae6c9l4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus operational system==
Operational systems are optimized for preservation of [[data integrity]] and speed of recording of business transactions through use of [[database normalization]] and an [[entity-relationship model]]. Operational system designers generally follow [[Codd's 12 rules]] of [[database normalization]] to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. [[Relational database]]s are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected each time a transaction is processed. To improve performance, older data are usually periodically purged from operational systems.

Data warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns. Analytic access patterns generally involve selecting specific fields and rarely if ever 'select *' as is more common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access patterns, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented DBMS whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a [[column-oriented DBMS]]. Unlike operational systems which maintain a snapshot of the business, data warehouses generally maintain an infinite history which is implemented through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems over to the data warehouse.

==Evolution in organization use==
These terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:

; Offline operational data warehouse: Data warehouses in this stage of evolution are updated on a regular time cycle (usually daily, weekly or monthly) from the operational systems and the data is stored in an integrated reporting-oriented data
; Offline data warehouse: Data warehouses at this stage are updated from data in the operational systems on a regular basis and the data warehouse data are stored in a data structure designed to facilitate reporting.
; On time data warehouse: Online Integrated Data Warehousing represent the real time Data warehouses stage data in the warehouse is updated for every transaction performed on the source data
; Integrated data warehouse: These data warehouses assemble data from different areas of business, so users can look up the information they need across other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tech-faq.com/data-warehouse.html |title=Data Warehouse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Established in 1973, The Depository Trust Company (DTC) was created to alleviate the rising volumes of [[Red tape|paperwork]] and the lack of security that developed after rapid growth in the volume of transactions in the U.S. securities industry in the late 1960s.

Before DTC and NSCC were formed, [[brokers]] physically exchanged certificates, employing hundreds of messengers to carry certificates and checks. The mechanisms brokers used to transfer securities and keep records relied heavily on pen and paper. The exchange of physical [[stock certificate]]s was difficult, inefficient, and increasingly expensive.

In the late 1960s, with an unprecedented surge in trading leading to volumes of nearly 15 million shares a day on the NYSE in April 1968 (as opposed to 5 million a day just three years earlier, which at the time had been considered overwhelming), the paperwork burden became enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3116692|title=Certificates and Computers: The Remaking of Wall Street, 1967 to 1971|journal=Business History Review|first=Wyatt|last=Wells|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|volume=74|issue=2|pages=193–235|doi=10.2307/3116692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CZSmnYCETqoC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=haack+ccs+certificate#PPA14,M1 |title=The Unseen Wall Street of 1969–1975: And Its Significance for Today |author = Alec Benn  |via=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31|isbn=978-1-56720-333-2 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stock certificates were left for weeks piled haphazardly on any level surface, including filing cabinets and tables. Stocks were mailed to wrong addresses, or not mailed at all. Overtime and night work became mandatory.  Turnover was 60% a year.&lt;ref name="libertyparkusafd1"&gt;[http://www.libertyparkusafd.org/lp/CD-ROMs%5CFree%20Market%20System%20-%2038%20-%20Fleecing%20the%20Lambs.html] {{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with this large volume, which was overwhelming brokerage firms, the stock exchanges were forced to close every week (they chose every Wednesday), and trading hours were shortened on other days of the week.

Two things solved the crisis:

The first was to hold all paper [[stock certificate]]s in one centralized location, and automate the process by keeping electronic records of all certificates and securities clearing and settlement (changes of ownership and other securities transactions). The method was first used in [[Austria]] by the [[Vienna]] [[Giro]] and Depository Association in 1872.&lt;ref name="uni-frankfurt2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/volltexte/2007/4885/pdf/ILF_WP_068.pdf| title=Institute of Law| website = Publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem was state laws requiring brokers to deliver certificates to investors. Eventually all the states were convinced that this notion was obsolete and changed their laws. For the most part, investors can still request their certificates, but this has several inconveniences, and most people do not, except for novelty value.

This led the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to establish the Central Certificate Service (CCS) in 1968&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844480,00.html "Wall Street: Attack on the Snarl"], ''Time magazine'', May 24, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; at 44 Broad Street in New York City.&lt;ref name="libertyparkusafd1" /&gt; Anthony P. Reres was appointed the head of CCS.  NYSE President Robert W. Haack promised: "We are going to automate the stock certificate out of business by substituting a punch card.  We just can't keep up with the flood of business unless we do".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |author=  |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,838048,00.html |title=Wall Street: Speeding It Up |publisher=TIME |date=1968-03-15 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CCS transferred securities electronically, eliminating their physical handling for settlement purposes, and kept track of the total number of shares held by NYSE members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nyse.com/about/history/timeline_technology.html |title= About Us &gt; History &gt; Timeline &gt; Timeline 1930 "Black Box" Ticker |publisher= New York Stock Exchange |date= March 15, 1968 |access-date= 2017-08-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150508074113/http://www1.nyse.com/about/history/timeline_technology.html |archive-date= 2015-05-08 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This relieved brokerage firms of the work of inspecting, counting, and storing certificates. Haack labeled it "top priority", $5 million was spent on it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Computer_Usage_Company/070910_download/computerusagecompany.computers_and_stock_1968/computerusagecompany.computers_and_stock_1968.pdf |title=Computer Usage – Fall Issue 1968 |website = computerhistroy.org |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its goal was to eliminate up to 75% of the physical handling of stock certificates traded between brokers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; One problem, however, was that it was voluntary, and brokers responsible for two-thirds of all trades refused to use it.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

By January 1969, it was transferring 10,000 shares per day, and plans were for it to be handling broker-to-broker transactions in 1,300 issues by March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sechistorical.org/collection/papers/1960/1969_0122_HaackInvestor.pdf |title =Remarks of Robert W.

BASIC and the SEC saw this indirect holding system as a "temporary measure", on the way to a "certificateless society".&lt;ref name="uni-frankfurt2007" /&gt;

The second method involves ''[[Netting|multilateral netting]]''; and led to the formation of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) in 1976.

In 2010, Robert Druskin was named Executive Chairman of the company, and in July 2012 Michael Bodson was named President and [[Chief Executive Officer]].

In 2008, The [[Clearing Corporation]] and The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation announced CCorp members will benefit from CCorp's netting and risk management processes, and will leverage the asset servicing capabilities of DTCC's [[Trade Information Warehouse]] for [[credit default swap]]s (CDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clearingcorp.com/press/pressreleases/20080528-dtcc-cds.html |title=CCorp and DTCC CDS Clearing |publisher=Clearingcorp.com |date=May 29, 2008 |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217043722/http://www.clearingcorp.com/press/pressreleases/20080528-dtcc-cds.html |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/suite/tradeinfo_warehouse.php |title=DTCC " Trade Information Warehouse |publisher=DTCC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015071528/http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/suite/tradeinfo_warehouse.php |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efinancialnews.com/tradingandtechnology/derivatives/content/2451991530 |title=CDS clearing house to launch this year |publisher=Efinancialnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hedgefundsreview.com/public/showPage.html?page=818032 |title= Moves to bring transparency to otc derivative and cds markets |publisher=Hedge Funds Review |date=October 2, 2008 | accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2010, it was announced that DTCC had acquired all of the shares of Avox Limited, based in Wrexham, North Wales. [[Deutsche Börse]] had previously held over 76% of the shares. On 20 March 2017, it was announced that [[Thomson Reuters]] acquired Avox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2017/march/thomson-reuters-completes-clarient-and-avox-acquisitions.html | title = Thomson Reuters Completes Clarient and Avox Acquisitions Creating Best-In-Class KYC and Legal Entity Data Due Diligence Standards |accessdate=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTCC entered into a joint venture with the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) known as New York Portfolio Clearing, that would allow "investors to combine cash and derivative positions in one clearinghouse to lower margin costs".&lt;ref name=Bloomberg20130104&gt;{{cite news |title= Intercontinental Exchange Picked as Top Stock at Sandler O’Neill |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-04/intercontinental-exchange-picked-as-top-stock-at-sandler-o-neill.html |date=January 4, 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The DTCC supported the [[Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress)]], arguing that it would "help ensure that regulators and the public continue to have access to a consolidated and accurate view of the global marketplace, including concentrations of risk and market exposure".&lt;ref name=DTCCnews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagliocca|first1=Theresa|title= Customer Protection and End-User Relief Act (H.R. 4413) Receives House Committee Approval|url=http://www.dtcc.com/news/2014/april/14/customer-protection-and-end-user-relief-act.aspx|publisher=DTCC|accessdate=18 June 2014|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy over naked short selling ==
Several companies have sued the DTCC, without success, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for [[naked short selling]]. Furthermore, the question of whether DTCC is culpable for naked short selling has been raised by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Foster Bennett|Robert Bennett]] and the NASAA, and discussed in articles in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[Euromoney]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB118359867562957720]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ_July2007&gt;{{cite news |accessdate= |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB118359867562957720-5Yb1Y_mpcl9a2nKbc0IaV0tDHyk_20070712.html |title=Blame the 'Stock Vault'? |author1=John R.

Critics blame DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where it happens, alleging that DTCC turns a blind eye to the problem, and complaining that the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) has not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.&lt;ref name="WSJ_July2007" /&gt; DTCC has responded that it has no authority over trading activities, cannot force buy-ins of shares not delivered,&lt;ref name="DTCC-Journal-reply"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3 |title=DTCC Responds to The Wall Street Journal article, "Blame the 'Stock Vault?'" |accessdate=2009-09-09 |date=2007-07-06 |publisher=Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&amp;lid=3 |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that naked shorting is simply not widespread enough to be a major concern.  "We're not saying there is no problem, but to suggest the sky is falling might be a bit overdone", said DTCC's chief spokesman. The SEC, however, viewed naked shorting as a sufficiently serious matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice.&lt;ref name="WSJ_July2007" /&gt;  DTCC has said that the SEC has supported its position in legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="DTCC-Journal-reply" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; DTCC General Counsel Larry Thompson calls the claims that DTCC is responsible for naked short selling "pure invention".&lt;ref name="FinancialWire" /&gt;

In July 2007, Senator [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]], Republican of Utah, suggested on the [[U.S. Senate]] floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling are "serious enough" to warrant a hearing.  The committee's Chairman, Senator [[Christopher Dodd]], indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing.&lt;ref name="bennett.senate.gov"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=279519 |title=Senator Bennett Discusses Naked Short Selling on the Senate Floor |publisher=Bennett.senate.gov |date=July 20, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227192527/http://bennett.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=279519 |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, no such hearing was ever held, and no further action on naked short selling is anticipated. Representing state stock regulators, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that "if the Investors’ claims are taken as true, as they must be on a [[motion to dismiss]], then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of fraud and manipulation at the hands of the very entities that should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market".&lt;ref name="Nasaa-amicus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaa.org/content/Files/Amicus_Whistler_Brief.pdf |title=Amicus brief |accessdate=2009-09-09 |date=2007-03-19 |format=PDF |work=Nasaa.org |publisher=North American Securities Administrators Assn. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326211753/http://www.nasaa.org/content/Files/Amicus_Whistler_Brief.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suit was later dismissed by the courts.

Critics also contend that DTCC and the SEC have been too secretive with information about where naked shorting is taking place.&lt;ref name="WSJ_July2007" /&gt; DTCC says it has supported releasing more information to the public.&lt;ref name="DTCC-Journal-reply" /&gt;

In recent years this controversy has died down, as the impact of changes to SEC rule 203 under Regulation SHO adopted in 2008 dramatically curtailed long-term short positions and complaints about "naked short" positions declined.

== Subsidiaries ==

DTCC has several subsidiaries:
* '''The Depository Trust Company''' (DTC) – The original securities depository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtcc.com/about/subs/dtc.php |title=DTCC " The Depository Trust Company (DTC) |publisher=Dtcc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029072640/http://dtcc.com/about/subs/dtc.php |archivedate=2012-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss20r3.pdf |title=CPSS Publications – The Depository Trust Company – Response to the disclosure framework for securities settlement Systems |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1973, it was created to reduce costs and provide efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making "book-entry" changes to show ownership of the securities.  DTC moves securities for NSCC's net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers between [[custodian bank]]s and broker-dealers), as well as [[money market]] instruments.  In 2007, DTC settled transactions worth $513 trillion, and processed 325 million book-entry deliveries.  In addition to settlement services, DTC retains custody of 3.5 million securities issues, worth about $40 trillion, including securities issued in the United States and more than 110 other countries.  DTC is a member of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]], and a registered clearing agency with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

Most large U.S. broker-dealers and banks are full DTC participants, meaning that they deposit and hold securities at DTC. DTC appears in an issuer’s stock records as the sole registered owner of securities deposited at DTC. DTC holds the deposited securities in “[[Fungibility|fungible]] bulk”, meaning that there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by DTC participants. Rather, each participant owns a pro rata interest in the aggregate number of shares of a particular issuer held at DTC. Correspondingly, each customer of a DTC participant, such as an individual investor, owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has an interest.

Because the securities held by DTC are for the benefit of its participants and their customers (i.e., investors holding their securities at a broker-dealer), frequently the issuer and its transfer agent must interact with DTC in order to facilitate the distribution of dividend payments to investors, to facilitate corporate actions (i.e., mergers, splits, etc.), to effect the transfer of securities, and to accurately record the number of shares actually owned by DTC at all times.
* '''DTC Operation'''

Stocks held by DTC are kept in the name of its [[partnership]] nominee, [[Cede and Company]].&lt;ref name="uni-frankfurt2007" /&gt;  Not all securities are eligible to be settled through DTC ("DTC eligible").

''What is DTC eligibility?'' This means that a company's stock is eligible for deposit with DTC aka "Cede and Company." A company's security holders will be able to deposit their particular shares with a brokerage firm. Clearing firms, as full participants with DTC, handle the DTC eligibility submissions to DTC. Transfer agents were responsible for eligibility coordination years ago. Now, in order to make a new issue of securities eligible for DTC’s delivery services, a completed and signed eligibility questionnaire must be submitted to DTC’s Underwriting Department, Eligibility. Parties that may submit the questionnaire include one of the following: Lead Manager/Underwriter, Issuer’s financial advisor or the DTC Participant clearing the transaction for its correspondent. The Lead Manager/ Underwriter must ensure that DTC’s Underwriting Department receives the issue’s offering document (e.g., [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectus]], offering memorandum, official statement) and the CUSIP numbers assigned to the issue within the time frames outlined in DTC’s Operational Arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dtcc.com/products/documentation/asset/Securities_DTCEligibility.pdf |title=Information for Securities to be made "DTC-Eligible" |publisher=Dtcc.com |accessdate=2012-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103150558/http://dtcc.com/products/documentation/asset/Securities_DTCEligibility.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What is FAST processing?'' FAST processing is functionality that can be turned on for issuers whom are fully DTC eligible. Participation in FAST (Fast Automated Securities Transfer) allows issuers, security holders and brokerage / clearing firms to move stock electronically between one another. Transfer agents, as limited participants, file for FAST participation. DTC approves each issuer on a merit review basis into this system.

''What are “chills” and “freezes” and why does DTC impose them?'' Occasionally a problem may arise with a company or its securities on deposit at DTC. In some of those cases DTC may impose a “chill” or a “freeze” on all the company’s securities. A “chill” is a restriction placed by DTC on one or more of DTC’s services, such as limiting a DTC participant’s ability to make a deposit or withdrawal of the security at DTC. A chill may remain imposed on a security for just a few days or for an extended period of time depending upon the reasons for the chill and whether the issuer or transfer agent corrects the problem. A “freeze” is a discontinuation of all services at DTC. Freezes may last a few days or an extended period of time, depending on the reason for the freeze. If the reasons for the freeze cannot be rectified, then the security will generally be removed from DTC, and securities transactions in that security will no longer be eligible to be cleared at any registered clearing agency. Chills and freezes are monitored by DTC's Office of Regulatory Compliance.

DTC imposes chills and freezes on securities for various reasons. For example, DTC may impose a chill on a security because the issuer no longer has a transfer agent to facilitate the transfer of the security or the transfer agent is not complying with DTC rules in its interactions with DTC in transferring the security. Often this type of situation is resolved within a short period of time.

Chills and freezes can be imposed on securities for more complicated reasons, such as when DTC determines that there may be a legal, regulatory, or operational problem with the issuance of the security, or the trading or clearing of transactions involving the security. For example, DTC may chill or freeze a security when DTC becomes aware or is informed by the issuer, transfer agent, federal or state regulators, or federal or state law enforcement officials that an issuance of some or all of the issuer’s securities or transfer in those securities is in violation of state or federal law. If DTC suspects that all or a portion of its holdings of a security may not be freely transferable as is required for DTC services, it may decide to chill one or more of its services or place a freeze on all services for the security. When there is a corporate action, DTC will temporarily chill the security for book-entry activities. In other instances, a corporate action can cause a more permanent chill. This may force the issuer to reapply for eligibility altogether.

When DTC chills or freezes a security, it will issue a “Participant Notice” to its participants. These notices are publicly available on DTC’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtcc.com/legal/imp_notices |title= Important Notices issued by DTCC subsidiaries |publisher= DTCC |date=  |accessdate= 2012-10-31 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142650/http://www.dtcc.com/legal/imp_notices/ |archivedate= 2012-11-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When securities are frozen, DTC also provides optional automated notifications to its participants. These processes provide participants the ability to update their systems to automatically block future trading of affected securities, in addition to alerting participant compliance departments. DTC has information regarding these processes on its website.
* '''National Securities Clearing Corporation''' (NSCC) – The original clearing corporation, it provides clearing and serves as the central counterparty for trades in the U.S. securities markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcc.com/about/subs/nscc.php |title=  National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) |publisher=DTCC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1976, it provides clearing, settlement, risk management, central counterparty services, and a [[guarantee]] of completion for certain transactions for virtually all broker-to-broker trades involving equities, corporate and municipal debt, [[American depositary receipt]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, and [[unit investment trust]]s. NSCC also nets trades and payments among its participants, reducing the value of securities and payments that need to be exchanged by an average of 98% each day. NSCC generally clears and settles trades on a "T+3" basis.  NSCC has roughly 4,000 participants, and is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
{{anchor|Fixed Income Clearing Corporation}}
* '''Fixed Income Clearing Corporation''' (FICC) – Provides clearing for [[fixed income securities]], including [[treasury security|treasury securities]] and [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage backed securities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dtcc.com/about/subs/ficc.php |title= Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) |publisher= DTCC |date=  |accessdate= 2012-10-31 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121029073807/http://dtcc.com/about/subs/ficc.php |archivedate= 2012-10-29 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ficc.com |title= Welcome to Fixed Income Clearance &amp; Settlement |publisher= FICC |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distillation''' is the process of [[separation process|separating]] the components or substances from a liquid [[mixture]] by using selective [[boiling]]&lt;!--please do not change this to evaporation: it is not the same thing--&gt; and [[condensation]]. Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture. In either case, the process exploits differences in the [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] of the mixture's components. In [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], distillation is a [[unit operation]] of practically universal importance, but it is a physical separation process, not a [[chemical reaction]].

Distillation has many applications. For example:
* Distillation of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] products produces [[distilled beverage]]s with a high [[Ethanol|alcohol]] content or separates out other fermentation products of commercial value.
* Distillation is an effective and traditional method of [[desalination]].
* In the [[fossil fuel]] industry, oil stabilization is a form of partial distillation that reduces vapor pressure of crude oil, thereby making it safe for storage and transport as well as reducing the atmospheric emissions of volatile hydrocarbons. In midstream operations at [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], distillation is a major class of [[unit operation|operation]] for transforming [[crude oil]] into [[fuel]]s and chemical [[raw material|feed stocks]].
* [[Cryogenic]] distillation leads to the [[Air separation|separation of air]] into its components – notably [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]] – for [[industrial gas|industrial use]].
* In the field of [[Chemical industry|industrial chemistry]], large amounts of crude liquid products of [[chemical synthesis]] are distilled to separate them, either from other products, from impurities, or from unreacted starting materials.

An installation used for distillation, especially of distilled beverages, is called a distillery. The distillation equipment at a distillery is a [[still]].

As [[alchemy]] evolved into the science of [[chemistry]], vessels called [[retort]]s became used for distillations. Both [[alembic]]s and retorts are forms of [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle to act as air-cooled [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] to [[Condensation|condense]] the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173651/http://www.copper-alembic.com/manufacturing/specs_sealing.php Sealing Technique], accessed 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water, for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called [[pot still]]s. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols, such as [[cognac (drink)|cognac]], [[Scotch whisky]], Irish whiskey, [[tequila]], and some [[vodka]]s. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by [[Rum-runner|bootleggers]] in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for use in the domestic production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html Traditional Alembic Pot Still] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121163501/https://www.essentialoil.com/alembic5.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, accessed 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; of flower water or [[essential oils]].

Early forms of distillation involved batch processes using one vaporization and one condensation. Purity was improved by further distillation of the condensate. Greater volumes were processed by simply repeating the distillation. Chemists reportedly carried out as many as 500 to 600 distillations in order to obtain a pure compound.&lt;ref name=Othmer&gt;Othmer, D. F. (1982) "Distillation – Some Steps in its Development", in W. F. Furter (ed) ''A Century of Chemical Engineering''. {{ISBN|0-306-40895-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the basics of modern techniques, including pre-heating and [[reflux]], were developed.&lt;ref name=Othmer/&gt; In 1822, Anthony Perrier developed one of the first continuous stills, and then, in 1826, Robert Stein improved that design to make his [[column still|patent still]]. In 1830, [[Aeneas Coffey]] got a patent for improving the design even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-first=A. |inventor-last=Coffey |inventor-link=Aeneas Coffey |title=Apparatus for Brewing and Distilling |country-code=GB |patent-number=5974 |publication-date=5 August 1830 |issue-date=5 February 1831}}; [http://www.kennetpans.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=231&amp;Itemid=405 image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204221819/http://kennetpans.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=231&amp;Itemid=405 |date=4 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffey's continuous still may be regarded as the [[archetype]] of modern petrochemical units. The French engineer Armand Savalle developed his steam regulator around 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|1970|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, [[Ernest Solvay]] was granted a U.S. Patent for a tray column for [[ammonia]] distillation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor-first=Ernest |inventor-last=Solvay |inventor-link=Ernest Solvay |country-code=US |patent-number=198699 |title=Improvement in the Ammonia-Soda Manufacture |publication-date=2 June 1876 |issue-date=25 December 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the same and subsequent years saw developments in this theme for oils and spirits.

With the emergence of [[chemical engineering]] as a discipline at the end of the 19th century, scientific rather than empirical methods could be applied. The developing [[petroleum]] industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods, such as the [[McCabe–Thiele method]] by [[Ernest Thiele]] and the [[Fenske equation]]. The availability of powerful computers also allowed direct [[computer simulation|computer simulations]] of distillation columns.

==Applications of distillation==
The application of distillation can roughly be divided into four groups: [[#Laboratory scale distillation|laboratory scale]], [[#Industrial distillation|industrial distillation]], distillation of herbs for perfumery and medicinals ([[herbal distillate]]), and [[#Distillation in food processing|food processing]]. The latter two are distinctively different from the former two in that distillation is not used as a true purification method but more to transfer all [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatiles]] from the source materials to the distillate in the processing of beverages and herbs.

The main difference between laboratory scale distillation and industrial distillation is that laboratory scale distillation is often performed on a batch basis, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In [[batch distillation]], the composition of the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds, and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions, which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms – remaining least or non-volatile fraction – removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.

In [[continuous distillation]], the source materials, vapors, and distillate are kept at a constant composition by carefully replenishing the source material and removing fractions from both vapor and liquid in the system. This results in a more detailed control of the separation process.

==Idealized distillation model==
The [[boiling point]] of a liquid is the temperature at which the [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid equals the pressure around the liquid, enabling bubbles to form without being crushed. A special case is the [[normal boiling point]], where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]].

It is a common misconception that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure, allowing the vapors of each component to collect separately and purely. However, this does not occur, even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]] and assume that [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|vapor–liquid equilibria]] are attained.

Raoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a solution is dependent on 1) the vapor pressure of each chemical component in the solution and 2) the fraction of solution each component makes up, a.k.a. the [[mole fraction]]. This law applies to [[ideal solution]]s, or solutions that have different components but whose molecular interactions are the same as or very similar to pure solutions.

Dalton's law states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each individual component in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, [[boiling]] occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. Note that a mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.

An implication of one boiling point is that lighter components never cleanly "boil first". At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and, thus, are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily vaporize also, albeit at a lower concentration in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch vaporizes, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point.

The idealized model is accurate in the case of chemically similar liquids, such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]]. In other cases, severe deviations from Raoult's law and Dalton's law are observed, most famously in the mixture of ethanol and water. These compounds, when heated together, form an [[azeotrope]], which is when the vapor phase and liquid phase contain the same composition. Although there are [[computational chemistry|computational methods]] that can be used to estimate the behavior of a mixture of arbitrary components, the only way to obtain accurate [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]] data is by measurement.

It is not possible to completely purify a mixture of components by distillation, as this would require each component in the mixture to have a zero [[partial pressure]]. If ultra-pure products are the goal, then further [[Separation of chemicals|chemical separation]] must be applied. When a binary mixture is vaporized and the other component, e.g., a salt, has zero partial pressure for practical purposes, the process is simpler.

===Batch or differential distillation===

[[File:BatchDistill.svg|thumb|left|A batch still showing the separation of A and B.]]
Heating an ideal mixture of two volatile substances, A and B, with A having the higher volatility, or lower boiling point, in a batch distillation setup (such as in an apparatus depicted in the opening figure) until the mixture is boiling results in a vapor above the liquid that contains a mixture of A and B. The ratio between A and B in the vapor will be different from the ratio in the liquid. The ratio in the liquid will be determined by how the original mixture was prepared, while the ratio in the vapor will be enriched in the more volatile compound, A (due to Raoult's Law, see above). The vapor goes through the condenser and is removed from the system. This, in turn, means that the ratio of compounds in the remaining liquid is now different from the initial ratio (i.e., more enriched in B than in the starting liquid).

The result is that the ratio in the liquid mixture is changing, becoming richer in component B. This causes the boiling point of the mixture to rise, which results in a rise in the temperature in the vapor, which results in a changing ratio of A : B in the gas phase (as distillation continues, there is an increasing proportion of B in the gas phase). This results in a slowly changing ratio of A : B in the distillate.

If the difference in vapor pressure between the two components A and B is large – generally expressed as the difference in boiling points – the mixture in the beginning of the distillation is highly enriched in component A, and when component A has distilled off, the boiling liquid is enriched in component B.

===Continuous distillation===

Continuous distillation is an ongoing distillation in which a liquid mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams occur over time during the operation. Continuous distillation produces a minimum of two output fractions, including at least one [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor and then condensed to a liquid. There is always a bottoms (or residue) fraction, which is the least volatile residue that has not been separately captured as a condensed vapor.

Continuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a [[steady state]] for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.

===General improvements===
Both batch and continuous distillations can be improved by making use of a [[fractionating column]] on top of the distillation flask. The column improves separation by providing a larger surface area for the vapor and condensate to come into contact. This helps it remain at equilibrium for as long as possible. The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor–liquid equilibrium.

There are differences between laboratory-scale and industrial-scale fractionating columns, but the principles are the same. Examples of laboratory-scale fractionating columns (in increasing efficiency) include
* [[Condenser (laboratory)#Air condenser|Air condenser]]
* [[Vigreux column]] (usually laboratory scale only)
* [[Packed bed|Packed column]] (packed with glass beads, metal pieces, or other chemically inert material)
* [[Spinning band distillation]] system.

==Laboratory scale distillation==
[[File:Double Distilled Water Unit.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Typical laboratory fractional distillation unit]]
Laboratory scale distillations are almost exclusively run as batch distillations. The device used in distillation, sometimes referred to as a ''[[still]]'', consists at a minimum of a '''reboiler''' or ''pot'' in which the source material is heated, a '''condenser''' in which the heated [[gas|vapour]] is cooled back to the liquid [[phase (matter)|state]], and a '''receiver''' in which the concentrated or purified liquid, called the '''distillate''', is collected. Several laboratory scale techniques for distillation exist (see also [[:Category:Distillation|distillation types]]).

===Simple distillation===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fractional distillation]] --&gt;
In '''simple distillation''', the vapor is immediately channeled into a condenser. Consequently, the distillate is not pure but rather its composition is identical to the composition of the vapors at the given temperature and pressure. That concentration follows [[Raoult's law]].

As a result, simple distillation is effective only when the liquid boiling points differ greatly (rule of thumb is 25&amp;nbsp;°C)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000656/http://www.iupac.org/didac/Didac%20Eng/Didac05/Content/ST07.htm ST07 Separation of liquid–liquid mixtures (solutions)], DIDAC by [[IUPAC]]&lt;/ref&gt; or when separating liquids from non-volatile solids or oils. For these cases, the vapor pressures of the components are usually different enough that the distillate may be sufficiently pure for its intended purpose.

===Fractional distillation===
{{Main article|Fractional distillation}}
For many cases, the boiling points of the components in the mixture will be sufficiently close that [[Raoult's law]] must be taken into consideration. Therefore, '''fractional distillation''' must be used in order to separate the components by repeated vaporization-condensation cycles within a packed fractionating column. This separation, by successive distillations, is also referred to as '''rectification'''.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

As the solution to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the [[fractionating column]]. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, the composition of the fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a ''[[theoretical plate]]'') will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070903202418/http://wulfenite.fandm.edu/labtech/fractdistill.htm Fractional Distillation]. fandm.edu&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; ''theoretical plate'' is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.

More theoretical plates lead to better separations. A [[spinning band distillation]] system uses a spinning band of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] or metal to force the rising vapors into close contact with the descending condensate, increasing the number of theoretical plates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html Spinning Band Distillation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825161209/http://www.brinstrument.com/fractional-distillation/spinning_band_distillation.html |date=25 August 2006 }}. B/R Instrument Corporation (accessed 8 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam distillation===
{{Main article|Steam distillation}}
Like [[vacuum distillation]], '''steam distillation''' is a method for distilling compounds which are heat-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|pp=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperature of the steam is easier to control than the surface of a heating element, and allows a high rate of heat transfer without heating at a very high temperature. This process involves bubbling steam through a heated mixture of the raw material. By Raoult's law, some of the target compound will vaporize (in accordance with its partial pressure). The vapor mixture is cooled and condensed, usually yielding a layer of oil and a layer of water.

Steam distillation of various [[aromatic]] herbs and flowers can result in two products; an [[essential oil]] as well as a watery [[herbal distillate]]. The [[essential oils]] are often used in perfumery and [[aromatherapy]] while the watery distillates have many applications in [[aromatherapy]], [[food processing]] and [[skin care]].

===Vacuum distillation===
{{Main article|Vacuum distillation}}
Some compounds have very high boiling points. To boil such compounds, it is often better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling and the rest of the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as '''vacuum distillation''' and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the [[rotary evaporator]].

This technique is also very useful for compounds which boil beyond their [[decomposition temperature]] at atmospheric pressure and which would therefore be decomposed by any attempt to boil them under atmospheric pressure.

[[Molecular distillation]] is vacuum distillation below the pressure of 0.01 [[torr]]. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above [[Hard vacuum|high vacuum]], where fluids are in the [[free molecular flow]] regime, i.e. the [[mean free path]] of molecules is comparable to the size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.

===Air-sensitive vacuum distillation===
Some compounds have high boiling points as well as being [[air sensitive]]. A simple vacuum distillation system as exemplified above can be used, whereby the vacuum is replaced with an inert gas after the distillation is complete. However, this is a less satisfactory system if one desires to collect fractions under a reduced pressure. To do this a "cow" or "pig" adaptor can be added to the end of the condenser, or for better results or for very air sensitive compounds a [[Perkin triangle]] apparatus can be used.

The Perkin triangle, has means via a series of glass or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] taps to allows fractions to be isolated from the rest of the [[still]], without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of [[reflux]]. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]) and can then be stoppered and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.

===Short path distillation===
[[File:short path distillation apparatus.svg|thumb|right|Short path vacuum distillation apparatus with vertical condenser (cold finger), to minimize the distillation path; '''1: '''Still pot with stirrer bar/anti-bumping granules '''2:''' Cold finger – bent to direct condensate '''3: '''Cooling water out '''4:''' cooling water in '''5: '''Vacuum/gas inlet '''6:''' Distillate flask/distillate.]]
[[Short path distillation]] is a distillation technique that involves the distillate travelling a short distance, often only a few centimeters, and is normally done at reduced pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harwood|Moody|1989|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; A classic example would be a distillation involving the distillate travelling from one glass bulb to another, without the need for a condenser separating the two chambers. This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus. The [[Kugelrohr]] is a kind of a short path distillation apparatus which often contain multiple chambers to collect distillate fractions.

===Zone distillation===
Zone distillation is a distillation process in long container with partial melting of refined matter in moving liquid zone and condensation of vapor in the solid phase at condensate pulling in cold area. The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with number of repetitions of the process.
Zone distillation is a distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization with various numbers of iteration of process – with replacement distribution efficient k of crystallization on separation factor α of distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kravchenko |first=A.

===Other types===
* The process of [[reactive distillation]] involves using the reaction vessel as the still. In this process, the product is usually significantly lower-boiling than its reactants. As the product is formed from the reactants, it is vaporized and removed from the reaction mixture. This technique is an example of a continuous vs. a batch process; advantages include less downtime to charge the reaction vessel with starting material, and less workup. Distillation "over a reactant" could be classified as a reactive distillation. It is typically used to remove volatile impurity from the distallation feed. For example, a little [[lime (material)|lime]] may be added to remove carbon dioxide from water followed by a second distillation with a little [[sulfuric acid]] added to remove traces of ammonia.
* [[Catalytic distillation]] is the process by which the reactants are catalyzed while being distilled to continuously separate the products from the reactants. This method is used to assist equilibrium reactions reach completion.
* [[Pervaporation]] is a method for the separation of mixtures of liquids by partial vaporization through a non-porous [[Artificial membrane|membrane]].
* [[Extractive distillation]] is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no [[azeotrope]] with the other components in the mixture.
* [[Flash evaporation]] (or partial evaporation) is the partial [[vaporization]] that occurs when a saturated liquid stream undergoes a reduction in pressure by passing through a throttling [[valve]] or other throttling device. This process is one of the simplest unit operations, being equivalent to a distillation with only one equilibrium stage.
* Codistillation is distillation which is performed on mixtures in which the two compounds are not miscible. In the laboratory, the [[Dean-Stark apparatus]] is used for this purpose to remove water from synthesis products. The [[Bleidner]] is another example with two refluximg solvents.
* Membrane distillation is a type of distillation in which vapors of a mixture to be separated are passed through a membrane, which selectively permeates one component of mixture. Vapor pressure difference is the driving force. It has potential applications in seawater desalination and in removal of organic and inorganic components.

The unit process of [[evaporation]] may also be called "distillation":
* In [[rotary evaporation]] a vacuum distillation apparatus is used to remove bulk [[solvent]]s from a sample. Typically the vacuum is generated by a [[aspirator (pump)|water aspirator]] or a [[membrane pump]].
* In a [[kugelrohr]] a short path distillation apparatus is typically used (generally in combination with a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (&gt; 300&amp;nbsp;°C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.

Other uses:
* [[Dry distillation]] or [[destructive distillation]], despite the name, is not truly distillation, but rather a [[chemical reaction]] known as [[pyrolysis]] in which solid substances are heated in an inert or [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere and any volatile fractions, containing high-boiling liquids and products of pyrolysis, are collected. The destructive distillation of [[wood]] to give [[methanol]] is the root of its common name – ''wood alcohol''.
* [[Freeze distillation]] is an analogous method of purification using [[freezing]] instead of evaporation. It is not truly distillation, but a [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] where the product is the [[mother liquor]], and does not produce products equivalent to distillation. This process is used in the production of [[American-style lager#Ice beer|ice beer]] and [[ice wine]] to increase ethanol and [[sugar]] content, respectively. It is also used to produce [[Applejack (beverage)|applejack]]. Unlike distillation, freeze distillation concentrates poisonous congeners rather than removing them; As a result, many countries prohibit such applejack as a health measure. However, reducing methanol with the absorption of 4A [[molecular sieve]] is a practical method for production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://124.205.222.100/Jwk_spkx/EN/abstract/abstract15544.shtml Study on Method of Decreasing Methanol in Apple Pomace Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517231120/http://124.205.222.100/Jwk_spkx/EN/abstract/abstract15544.shtml |date=17 May 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, distillation by evaporation can separate these since they have different boiling points.

==Azeotropic distillation==
{{Main article|Azeotropic distillation}}
Interactions between the components of the solution create properties unique to the solution, as most processes entail nonideal mixtures, where [[Raoult's law]] does not hold. Such interactions can result in a constant-boiling '''[[azeotrope]]''' which behaves as if it were a pure compound (i.e., boils at a single temperature instead of a range). At an azeotrope, the solution contains the given component in the same proportion as the vapor, so that evaporation does not change the purity, and distillation does not effect separation. For example, [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and [[Water (molecule)|water]] form an azeotrope of 95.6% at 78.1&amp;nbsp;°C.

If the azeotrope is not considered sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as '''azeotropic distillation'''. Some techniques achieve this by "jumping" over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component to create a new azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a drying agent (or [[desiccant]], such as [[potassium carbonate]]) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble [[water of crystallization]]. [[Molecular sieve]]s are often used for this purpose as well.

Immiscible liquids, such as water and [[toluene]], easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are referred to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid–liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.

High boiling azeotropes, such as a 20 weight percent mixture of hydrochloric acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope is greater than the boiling point of either pure component.

To break azeotropic distillations and cross distillation boundaries, such as in the DeRosier Problem, it is necessary to increase the composition of the light key in the distillate.

===Breaking an azeotrope with unidirectional pressure manipulation===
The boiling points of components in an azeotrope overlap to form a band. By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias the boiling point of one component away from the other by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.

This method can remove the need to add other chemicals to a distillation, but it has two potential drawbacks.

Under negative pressure, power for a vacuum source is needed and the reduced boiling points of the distillates requires that the condenser be run cooler to prevent distillate vapours being lost to the vacuum source. Increased cooling demands will often require additional energy and possibly new equipment or a change of coolant.

Alternatively, if positive pressures are required, standard glassware can not be used, energy must be used for pressurization and there is a higher chance of side reactions occurring in the distillation, such as decomposition, due to the higher temperatures required to effect boiling.

A unidirectional distillation will rely on a pressure change in one direction, either positive or negative.

===Pressure-swing distillation===
{{further information|Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation}}

Pressure-swing distillation is essentially the same as the unidirectional distillation used to break azeotropic mixtures, but here both [[Azeotrope#Pressure swing distillation|positive and negative pressures may be employed]].

This improves the selectivity of the distillation and allows a chemist to optimize distillation by avoiding extremes of pressure and temperature that waste energy. This is particularly important in commercial applications.

One example of the application of pressure-swing distillation is during the industrial purification of [[ethyl acetate]] after its catalytic synthesis from [[ethanol]].

==Industrial distillation==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|right|thumb|Typical industrial distillation towers]]
{{Main article|Continuous distillation}}
Large scale '''industrial distillation''' applications include both batch and continuous fractional, vacuum, azeotropic, extractive, and steam distillation. The most widely used industrial applications of continuous, steady-state fractional distillation are in [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s and [[natural gas processing]] plants.

To control and optimize such industrial distillation, a standardized laboratory method, ASTM D86, is established. This test method extends to the atmospheric distillation of petroleum products using a laboratory batch distillation unit to quantitatively determine the boiling range characteristics of petroleum products.

Industrial distillation&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kister&gt;{{cite book|author=Kister, Henry Z.|title=Distillation Design|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=978-0-07-034909-4|title-link=Distillation Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; is typically performed in large, vertical cylindrical columns known as '''distillation towers''' or '''distillation columns''' with diameters ranging from about 65&amp;nbsp;centimeters to 16&amp;nbsp;meters and heights ranging from about 6&amp;nbsp;meters to 90&amp;nbsp;meters or more. When the process feed has a diverse composition, as in distilling [[crude oil]], liquid outlets at intervals up the column allow for the withdrawal of different ''fractions'' or products having different [[boiling points]] or boiling ranges. The "lightest" products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit from the top of the columns and the "heaviest" products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the '''bottoms'''.

[[File:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation.PNG|left|thumb|Diagram of a typical industrial distillation tower]]
Industrial towers use [[reflux]] to achieve a more complete separation of products. Reflux refers to the portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation or fractionation tower that is returned to the upper part of the tower as shown in the schematic diagram of a typical, large-scale industrial distillation tower. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and condensation of the upflowing vapors thereby increasing the efficiency of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided for a given number of [[theoretical plate]]s, the better the tower's separation of lower boiling materials from higher boiling materials. Alternatively, the more reflux that is provided for a given desired separation, the fewer the number of theoretical plates required. [[Chemical engineer]]s must choose what combination of reflux rate and number of plates is both economically and physically feasible for the products purified in the distillation column.

Such industrial fractionating towers are also used in [[cryogenic]] [[air separation]], producing [[liquid oxygen]], [[liquid nitrogen]], and high purity [[argon]]. Distillation of [[chlorosilane]]s also enables the production of high-purity [[silicon]] for use as a [[semiconductor]].

[[File:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Section of an industrial distillation tower showing detail of trays with bubble caps]]
Design and operation of a distillation tower depends on the feed and desired products. Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the [[McCabe–Thiele method]]&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeaderHenley&gt;{{cite book|author1=Seader, J. D.  |author2=Henley, Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-58626-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Fenske equation]]&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; can be used. For a multi-component feed, [[simulation]] models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor–liquid contact devices (referred to as "plates" or "trays") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient [[equilibrium stage]]. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies.

In modern industrial uses, a packing material is used in the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor [[plate column]]s are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.
[[File:Vacuum Column.jpg|thumb|left|183px|Large-scale, industrial vacuum distillation column&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html Energy Institute website page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012072758/http://resources.schoolscience.co.uk/SPE/knowl/4/2index.htm?vacuum.html |date=12 October 2007 }}. Resources.schoolscience.co.uk. Retrieved on 2014-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This packing material can either be random dumped packing (1–3" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor–liquid equilibrium, the vapor–liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of "theoretical stages" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both of these factors affect packing performance.

Another factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of [[Theoretical plate|theoretical stages]] required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The [[Theoretical plate|height equivalent to a theoretical plate]] (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, F., Rukovena, F.

===Multi-effect distillation===
The goal of multi-effect distillation is to increase the energy efficiency of the process, for use in desalination, or in some cases one stage in the production of [[ultrapure water]]. The number of effects is inversely proportional to the kW·h/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water recovered figure, and refers to the volume of water recovered per unit of energy compared with single-effect distillation. One effect is roughly 636&amp;nbsp;kW·h/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* [[Multi-stage flash distillation]] can achieve more than 20 effects with thermal energy input, as mentioned in the article.
* [[Vapor compression evaporation]] – Commercial large-scale units can achieve around 72 effects with electrical energy input, according to manufacturers.

There are many other types of multi-effect distillation processes, including one referred to as simply multi-effect distillation (MED), in which multiple chambers, with intervening heat exchangers, are employed.

==Distillation in food processing==

===Distilled beverages===
{{Main article|Distilled beverage}}

[[Carbohydrate]]-containing plant materials are allowed to ferment, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol, including water, esters, and other alcohols, are collected in the condensate, which account for the flavor of the beverage. Some of these beverages are then stored in barrels or other containers to acquire more flavor compounds and characteristic flavors.

{{for|electronic percussion instruments|Electronic drum}}
An '''electronic kit''' is a package of [[electrical components]] used to build an [[electronics|electronic]] [[machine|device]].  Generally, kits are composed of electronic components, a circuit diagram (schematic), assembly instructions and often a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) or another type of prototyping board.

There are two types of kit. Some build a single device or system. Other types used for education demonstrate a range of circuits. Theses will include a solderless construction board of some type, such as:
* Components mounted in plastic blocks with side contacts, that are held together in a base, e.g. Denshi blocks
* Springs on a card board, the springs trap wire leads or component leads, such as Philips EE electronic experiment kits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ee.old.no/ phillips EE electronic experiment kits]&lt;/ref&gt; These are a cheap and flexible option
* Professional type prototyping boards, ([[breadboard]]s) into which component leads are inserted, following documentation of the "kit".

The first type of kits, those for the construction of a single device, normally use a PCB on which components are soldered. They normally come with extended documentation describing which component goes where into the PCB. 

For advanced hobby projects, sometimes the kit may only consist of a printed circuit board and assembly instructions, and the purchaser may have to source all the parts independently; or, the vendor may provide hard-to-get or pre-programmed parts while expecting the purchaser to obtain the rest of the components. 

People primarily purchase electronic kits to have fun and learn how things work. They were once popular as a means to reduce the cost of buying goods, but there is usually no cost saving in buying a kit today.

Some electronic kits were assembled to make complete complex devices such as color [[television]] sets, [[oscilloscope]]s, high-end [[audio amplifier]]s, [[amateur radio]] equipment, electric organs,&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Gilmore, ''Suddenly Everybody's Soldering: Big Boom in Electronic Kits", ''Popular Science'', February 1962 pp. 125ff &lt;/ref&gt;   and even computers such as the [[Heathkit]] [[Heathkit H-8|H-8]], and the [[LNW-80]].  Many of the early [[microprocessor]] computers were sold as either electronic kits or assembled and tested. Heathkit sold millions of electronic kits during its 45-year history.

Home assembly of common consumer electronics items no longer provides a cost advantage over commercially manufactured and distributed devices.  People still build kits for custom devices and special-purpose electronics for professional and educational use, and as a hobby.

Also emerging is a trend to simplify the complexity by providing preprogrammed or modular kits and this is provided by many suppliers online often. The fun and thrill of making your own electronics has shifted in many cases from easy to comprehend application and analog devices to more sophisticated and digital devices.

==Examples==
*The [[Altair 8800]], (the first [[home computer]]), was also sold as a kit, as were the [[Sinclair ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81]] and [[Acorn Atom]] computers.
*Many [[S100 bus]] [[Expansion card|system cards]] were sold only as kits.
*Building a [[Robot kit]], most often with a [[micro controller]] inside, is now in fashion.
*[[Lectron]] electronic kits (magnetic modules)
*[[Denshi blocks]] used by [[Gakken EX-System]]
[[File:Transistor Clock.jpg|thumb|right| A kit-built digital clock using only transistors and diodes to perform all logic. This would make no sense as a factory built product as an [[integrated circuit]] would perform all the logic at a fraction of the cost and space.]]

The '''energy industry''' is the totality of all of the [[industry|industries]] involved in the production and sale of [[energy]], including [[fuel]] extraction, manufacturing, [[oil refinery|refining]] and distribution. Modern society consumes large amounts of fuel, and the energy industry is a crucial part of the [[infrastructure]] and maintenance of society in almost all [[nation|countries]].

In particular, the energy industry comprises:
* the [[petroleum industry]], including [[oil companies]], petroleum refiners, fuel transport and end-user sales at [[gas station]]s
* the gas industry, including [[natural gas]] extraction, and [[coal gas]] manufacture, as well as distribution and sales
* the [[electrical power industry]], including [[electricity generation]], [[electric power distribution]] and sales
* the [[coal]] industry
* the [[nuclear power]] industry
* the [[renewable energy industry]], comprising [[alternative energy]] and [[sustainable energy]] companies, including those involved in [[hydroelectric power]], [[wind power]], and [[solar power]] generation, and the manufacture, distribution and sale of [[alternative fuel]]s
* traditional energy industry based on the collection and distribution of [[firewood]], the use of which, for cooking and heating, is particularly common in poorer countries

Darker tones indicate larger consumption, while dark grey areas are missing from the dataset. Red hue indicates increasing consumption, green hue indicates decreasing consumption, in the time between 1990 and 2001.]]

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The use of [[energy]] has been a key in the development of the [[society|human society]] by helping it to control and adapt to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Managing the use of energy is inevitable in any functional society. In the [[industrialization|industrialized world]] the development of energy resources has  become essential for [[agriculture]], [[transport]]ation, [[sewage|waste collection]], [[information technology]], [[Telecommunication|communications]] that have become prerequisites of a developed society. The increasing use of energy since the [[Industrial Revolution]] has also brought with it a number of serious problems, some of which, such as [[global warming]], present potentially grave risks to the world.

In some industries, the word ''energy'' is used as a synonym of [[Energy development|energy resources]], which refer to substances like [[fuels]], [[petroleum]] products and [[electricity]] in general, because a significant portion of the energy contained in these resources can easily be extracted to serve a useful purpose. After a useful process has taken place, the total energy is conserved, but the ressource itself is not conserved, since a process usually transforms the energy into unusable forms (such as unnecessary or excess heat).

Ever since humanity discovered various energy resources available in nature, it has been inventing devices, known as machines, that make life more comfortable by using energy resources. Thus, although the primitive man knew the utility of fire to cook food, the invention of devices like gas burners and [[microwave ovens]] has increased the usage of energy for this purpose alone manyfold. The trend is the same in any other field of social activity, be it [[construction]] of social infrastructure, manufacturing of fabrics for covering; porting; [[printing]];  decorating, for example [[textiles]], [[air conditioning]]; [[communication]] of information or for moving people and goods ([[automobiles]]).

==Economics==
{{Main article|Energy economics}}
[[Energy development|Production]] and [[World energy resources and consumption|consumption]] of energy resources is very important to the global economy.  All economic activity requires energy resources, whether to [[manufacturing|manufacture]] goods, provide [[transport]]ation, run [[computer]]s and other [[machine]]s.

Widespread demand for energy may encourage competing energy [[public utility|utilities]] and the formation of [[retailing|retail]] [[energy market]]s. Note the presence of the "Energy Marketing and Customer Service" (EMACS) sub-sector.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy sector accounts for 4.6% of outstanding leveraged loans, compared with 3.1% a decade ago, while energy bonds make up 15.7% of the $1.3{{nbsp}}[[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] junk bond market, up from 4.3% over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Alloway | first = Tracy | date = 26 November 2014 | title = Oil price fall starts to weigh on banks | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c9f4e9e8-757c-11e4-b1bf-00144feabdc0.html | website = ft.com | accessdate = 27 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
{{Main article|Energy demand management}}
Since the cost of energy has become a significant factor in the performance of economy of societies, management of energy resources has become very crucial. Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively that is with minimum incremental costs. Many times it is possible to save expenditure on energy without incorporating fresh [[technology]] by simple [[management]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mepol.org/site180.php Energy Management :: MEPoL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325140222/http://www.mepol.org/site180.php |date=25 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often energy management is the practice of using energy more efficiently by eliminating energy wastage or to balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness with [[energy conservation]].

==Classifications==

===Government===
The [[United Nations]] developed the [[International Standard Industrial Classification]], which is a list of economic and social classifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/family1.asp United Nations economic and social classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinct classification for an energy industry, because the classification system is based on ''activities'', ''products'', and ''expenditures according to purpose''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regct.asp?Lg=1 United Nations Available Classifications] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries in North America use the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). The NAICS sectors #21 and #22 (mining and utilities) might roughly define the energy industry in North America. This classification is used by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]].

===Financial market===

The [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] used by [[Morgan Stanley]] define the energy industry as comprising companies primarily working with oil, gas, coal and consumable fuels, excluding companies working with certain industrial gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mscibarra.com/products/gics/structure.jsp MSCI-Barra GICS Tables] Accessed 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Add also to expand this section:  [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbenchmark.com/docs/ICB_StructureSheet_120104.pdf Industry Classification Benchmark for Dow Jones Indexes (United States) and FTSE Indexes (United Kingdom)] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
{{main article|Environmental impact of the energy industry}}
Government encouragement in the form of [[subsidy|subsidies]] and [[tax]] [[incentive]]s for [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] efforts has increasingly fostered the view of conservation as a major function of the energy industry: saving an amount of energy provides economic benefits almost identical to generating that same amount of energy. This is compounded by the fact that the economics of delivering energy tend to be priced for capacity as opposed to average usage. One of the purposes of a [[smart grid]] infrastructure is to smooth out demand so that capacity and demand curves align more closely.
Some parts of the energy industry generate considerable [[pollution]], including toxic and [[greenhouse gas]]es from fuel combustion, [[nuclear waste]] from the generation of nuclear power, and [[oil spillage]]s as a result of  petroleum extraction. Government regulations to internalize these [[externality|externalities]] form an increasing part of doing [[business]], and the trading of [[carbon credit]]s and [[pollution credit]]s on the free market may also result in energy-saving and pollution-control measures becoming even more important to energy providers.

Consumption of energy resources, (e.g. turning on a light) requires resources and has an effect on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Many electric power plants burn coal, oil or natural gas in order to generate electricity for energy needs. While burning these fossil fuels produces a readily available and instantaneous supply of electricity, it also generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide and trioxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxides ([[NOx]]). Carbon dioxide is an important [[greenhouse gas]] which is thought to be responsible for some fraction of the rapid increase in [[climate change]] seen especially in the temperature records in the 20th century, as compared with tens of thousands of years worth of temperature records which can be read from ice cores taken in Arctic regions. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation also releases trace metals such as beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and silver into the environment, which also act as pollutants.

The large-scale use of [[renewable energy]] technologies would "greatly mitigate or eliminate a wide range of environmental and human health impacts of energy use".&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z. |author2=Delucchi, Mark A. |year=2010 |work=Energy policy }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuli Aye|title=Energie vergelijken switchen Energieleverancier top 10|url=https://www.hotswitch.nl/|website=Energie vergelijken|accessdate=28 October 2016|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy technologies include [[biofuels]], [[solar heating and cooling]], [[hydroelectric power]], [[solar power]], and [[wind power]].  [[Energy conservation]] and the [[Efficient energy use|efficient use of energy]] would also help.

In addition, it is argued that there is also the potential to develop a more [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] sector. This can be done by:&lt;ref&gt;[[European Movement for Efficient Energy]] 2011. Energy efficient solutions for the conservation of energy. Retrieved: 11 October 2011 18:52&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fuel switching in the power sector from [[coal]] to [[natural gas]];
* Power plant optimisation and other measures to improve the efficiency of existing [[combined cycle gas turbine|CCGT]] power plants;
* [[Combined heat and power]] (CHP), from micro-scale residential to large-scale industrial;
* [[Waste heat recovery]]
[[Best available technology]] (BAT) offers supply-side efficiency levels far higher than global averages. The relative benefits of gas compared to coal are influenced by the development of increasingly [[efficient energy use|efficient energy]] production methods. According to an impact assessment carried out for the [[European Commission]], the levels of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of coal-fired plants built have now increased to 46-49% efficiency rates, as compared to coals plants built before the 1990s (32-40%).&lt;ref name=EC1&gt;[[European Commission]] 2011. [http://eme2.eu/cust/documentrequest.aspx?DocID=152 Impact Assessment Accompanying the document Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy efficiency and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC]. p. 106 Retrieved 11 October 2011 19:01&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time gas can reach 58-59% efficiency levels with the best available technology.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt; Meanwhile, [[combined heat and power]] can offer efficiency rates of 80-90%.&lt;ref name=EC1/&gt;

==Politics==
Since now energy plays an essential role in [[industrial society|industrial societies]], the ownership and control of energy resources plays an increasing role in [[politics]]. At the national level, governments seek to influence the sharing (distribution) of energy resources among various sections of the society through pricing mechanisms; or even who owns resources within their borders. They may also seek to influence the use of energy by individuals and business in an attempt to tackle [[environmental issues]].

The most recent international political controversy regarding energy resources is in the context of the [[Iraq War]]s. Some political analysts maintain that the hidden reason for both 1991 and 2003 wars can be traced to [[strategy|strategic]] control of international energy resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419104405/http://www.thepeakist.com/oil-and-empire-the-backstory-to-the-invasion-of-iraq/ |archivedate=19 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}} Oil and Empire - the backstory to the invasion of Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter this analysis with the numbers related to its economics. According to the latter group of analysts, U.S. has spent about $336 billion in Iraq&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 The War in Iraq Costs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051012210605/http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=182 |date=12 October 2005 }}, A running total of the U.S. taxpayer cost to date of the Iraq War.

===Policy===
{{main|Energy policy}}
Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques.

===Security===
{{main|Energy security}}
Energy security is the intersection of [[national security]] and the availability of [[natural resource]]s for [[energy]] consumption. Access to cheap [[energy]] has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, the funding to foreign dictators, rising terrorism, and dominant countries reliance to the foreign oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |title=Power plays: Energy and Australia's security |publisher=Aspi.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072715/http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |archivedate=11 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited supplies, uneven distribution, and rising costs of [[fossil fuels]], such as oil and gas, create a need to change to more [[sustainable energy]] sources in the foreseeable future. With as much dependence that the U.S. currently has for oil and with the peaking limits of oil production; economies and societies will begin to feel the decline in the resource that we have become dependent upon. Energy security has become one of the leading issues in the world today as oil and other resources have become as vital to the world's people. However, with oil production rates decreasing and oil production peak nearing the world has come to protect what resources we have left in the world. With new advancements in renewable resources less pressure has been put on companies that produce the world's oil, these resources are, geothermal, solar power, wind power and hydro-electric. Although these are not all the current and possible future options for the world to turn to as the oil depletes the most important issue is protecting these vital resources from future threats. These new resources will become more useful as the price of exporting and importing oil will increase due to increase of demand.

==Development==
{{main article|Energy development}}
Producing energy to sustain human needs is an essential social activity, and a great deal of effort goes into the activity. While most of such effort is limited towards increasing the production of [[electric power generation|electricity]] and [[oil exploration|oil]], newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One such effort is to explore means of producing [[hydrogen fuel]] from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore [[enzymatic]] decomposition of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|title=Virginia Tech Deans' Task Force on Energy Security and Sustainability|publisher=|access-date=6 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408155812/http://www.research.vt.edu/energy/reshydro.html|archive-date=8 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of conventional energy resources are also being used in new ways. [[Coal|Coal gasification and liquefaction]] are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that [[oil reserves]], at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived. See [[alternative fuels]].

Energy is the subject of significant research activities globally. For example, the [[UK Energy Research Centre]] is the focal point for UK energy research while the European Union has many technology programmes as well as a platform for engaging social science and humanities within energy research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/global-sustainability-institute-gsi/research/consumption-and-change/shape-energy|title=H2020 SHAPE-Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
All societies require materials and food to be transported over ''distances'', generally against some ''force'' of friction. Since application of force over distance requires the presence of a source of usable energy, such sources are of great worth in society.

While energy resources are an essential ingredient for all modes of [[transportation]] in society, the transportation of energy resources is becoming equally important. Energy resources are frequently located far from the place where they are consumed. Therefore, their transportation is always in question. Some energy resources like liquid or gaseous fuels are transported using tankers or [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], while electricity transportation invariably requires a network of [[transmission grid|grid cables]]. The transportation of energy, whether by tanker, pipeline, or transmission line, poses challenges for scientists and engineers, policy makers, and economists to make it more risk-free and efficient.

==Crisis==
{{main article|Energy crisis}}
[[File:Oil Prices Since 1861.svg|right|thumb|Oil prices from 1861 to 2007]]
Economic and political instability can lead to an [[energy crisis]]. Notable oil crises are the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 oil crisis]]. The advent of [[peak oil]], the point in time when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, will likely precipitate another energy crisis.

== Mergers and Acquisitions ==
Between 1985 and 2018 there have been around 69,932 deals in the energy sector. This cumulates to an overall value of 9,578 bil USD. The most active year was 2010 with about 3.761 deals. In terms of value 2007 was the strongest year (684 bil. USD), which was followed by a steep decline until 2009 (-55,8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eve Systems''' (branded as simply '''Eve''') is a German smart home and [[home automation]] producer founded in June 27, 2018. The brand was originally a line of smart home products of manufacturer [[Elgato|Elgato Systems]], a company best known for a line of video-recording and gaming products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/05/29/homekit-compatible-elgato-eve-aqua-water-controller-eve-flare-smart-light-unveiled|title=Elgato launches HomeKit compatible Eve Aqua water controller, Eve Flare smart light|website=AppleInsider|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elgato brand and gaming division of the company was sold to [[Corsair Components]] in June 2018, while the Eve brand was spun off into a separate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techpowerup.com/245546/elgato-systems-renames-to-eve-systems-after-spinning-off-gaming-business|title=Elgato Systems Renames to Eve Systems After Spinning Off Gaming Business|work=TechPowerUp|access-date=2018-07-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Elgato}}
The brand can be traced back in 2014 when Elgato introduced a home monitoring system called Eve, which provides alerts to users regarding things like air pressure, temperature and water use. Elgato also developed light bulbs that can respond to programming on a mobile device and respond to commands over Bluetooth. In May 2018, Elgato introduced Eve Aqua, a smart water controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/29/eve-aqua-control-garden-hose-and-sprinklers-with-homekit/|title=Elgato launches Eve Aqua to let you control your garden hose and sprinklers with HomeKit|date=2018-05-29|work=9to5Mac|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/29/17404914/elgato-eve-aqua-smart-hose-controller-apple-ios-homekit|title=Elgato made a HomeKit-connected smart hose controller|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Corsair acquired the gaming departments of Elgato, while Elgato's smart home team remains their own company and was spun off as Eve Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/27/elgato-unloads-gaming-peripherals-focuses-on-homekit-in-new-eve-systems-rebrand|title=Elgato unloads gaming peripherals, focuses on Homekit in new Eve Systems rebrand|website=AppleInsider|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.evehome.com/en/news/meet-eve|title=News {{!}} evehome.com|website=evehome.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elgato manufactures and markets a [[Smart key|smart-key system]]. The system comes with a small 10-gram device that is placed on a key ring, in a purse, inside a car, or somewhere else.&lt;ref name="nextweb"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2013/12/06/elgato-smart-key/|title=The Elgato Smart Key taps Bluetooth LE to help find your keys and remember where your car’s parked|last=Sawers|first=Paul|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=August 14, 2014|publisher=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it communicates with an Elgato app on an iOS device. If it is set up for keys, the app will alert the user when they are 10 meters away from their keys, indicating that they may have forgotten them.&lt;ref name="nextweb" /&gt; It takes advantage of the "Smart Bluetooth" Apple implemented in iOS 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/11/elgato-smart-key|title=Elgato's Smart Key uses iOS 7 Bluetooth Smart improvements to track your keys|last=Collins|first=Katie|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=August 14, 2014|publisher=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in TheNextWeb said it was "money well spent" and worked "exactly as described", but that the beeping of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find my Phone app.&lt;ref name="nextweb" /&gt; A review in [[Macworld]] gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-accessories/elgato-smart-key-review-iphone-ipad-device-tracker-3493163/|title=Elgato Smart Key Review: iPhone and iPad proximity location device tracker|last=Hattersley|first=Lou|date=December 10, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart home ===
In September 2014, Elgato announced a home monitoring system called Eve, which monitors a home's air pressure, water usage, temperature, air quality and other factors. Elgato said the product won't be available until the [[HomeKit]] software, which is expected to come with Apple iOS 8, is released.&lt;ref name="dkajfhk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/elgato-eve-monitors-the-air-in-your-house-works-with-ios-8-homekit/|title=Elgato Eve will monitor the air in your house, works with iOS 8 HomeKit|last=Westaway|first=Luke|date=September 1, 2014|accessdate=September 2, 2014|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced smart light bulbs, which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/01/elgato-avea-smart-lightbulb-eve-smart-home-sensors/|title=Elgato announces $50 Avea smart lightbulb and Eve smart home sensors|last=Gorman|first=Michael|accessdate=September 2, 2014|publisher=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AMD heatsink and fan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[Air cooling|fan-cooled]] heat sink on the processor of a personal computer. To the right is a smaller heat sink cooling [[northbridge (computing)|another integrated circuit]] of the motherboard.]]
A '''heat sink''' (also commonly spelled '''heatsink'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= GlacialTech announces Igloo FS125S 30W cold forged pin fin heatsink|url= http://www.eco-business.com/press-releases/glacialtech-announces-igloo-fs125s-30w-cold-forged-pin-fin-heatsink/|website= Eco-Business|access-date= 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The citation here is just one of many examples showing the use of "heatsink" --&gt;) is a passive [[heat exchanger]] that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a [[fluid]] medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is [[thermal management (electronics)|dissipated]] away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at optimal levels. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool [[central processing unit]]s or [[graphics processing unit|graphics processors]]. Heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices such as power [[transistor]]s and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.

A heat sink is designed to maximize its surface area in contact with the cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] temperature of the integrated circuit. [[Thermal adhesive]] or [[thermal grease]] improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the [[heat spreader]] on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium heat sinks are used as a low-cost, lightweight alternative to copper heat sinks, and have a lower thermal conductivity than copper.

==Heat transfer principle==
A heat sink transfers thermal energy from a higher temperature device to a lower temperature [[fluid]] medium. The fluid medium is frequently air, but can also be water, refrigerants or oil. If the fluid medium is water, the heat sink is frequently called a cold plate. In [[thermodynamics]] a heat sink is a [[heat reservoir]] that can absorb an arbitrary amount of heat without significantly changing temperature. Practical heat sinks for electronic devices must have a temperature higher than the surroundings to transfer heat by convection, radiation, and conduction. The power supplies of electronics are not 100% efficient, so extra heat is produced that may be detrimental to the function of the device. As such, a heat sink is included in the design to disperse heat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aegispower.com/index.php/2015-01-15-19-35-10/192-cooling-methods-for-power-supplies|title=Overview of Cooling Methods for AC-DC and DC-DC Power Supplies|last=Vaughn|first=Arlissa|website=www.aegispower.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cui.com/catalog/resource/design-considerations-for-thermal-management-of-power-supplies.pdf|title=Design Considerations for Thermal Management of Power Supplies|page=3|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cui.com|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the principle of a heat sink, consider [[Fourier's law|Fourier's law of heat conduction]]. Fourier's law of heat conduction, simplified to a one-dimensional form in the ''x''-direction, shows that when there is a temperature gradient in a body, heat will be transferred from the higher temperature region to the lower temperature region. The rate at which heat is transferred by conduction, &lt;math&gt;q_k&lt;/math&gt;, is proportional to the product of the temperature gradient and the cross-sectional area through which heat is transferred.
:&lt;math&gt;q_k = -k A \frac{dT}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Heat sink control volume.png|thumb|upright=2|Sketch of a heat sink in a duct used to calculate the governing equations from conservation of energy and Newton’s law of cooling.]]

Consider a heat sink in a duct, where air flows through the duct. It is assumed that the heat sink base is higher in temperature than the air. Applying the conservation of energy, for steady-state conditions, and [[lumped capacitance model#Newton.27s law of cooling|Newton’s law of cooling]] to the temperature nodes shown in the diagram gives the following set of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = \dot{m}c_{p,in}(T_{air,out} - T_{air,in})&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q} = \frac{T_{hs} - T_{air,av}}{R_{hs}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

where
:&lt;math&gt;T_{air,av} = \frac{T_{air,in} + T_{air,out}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (3)

Using the mean air temperature is an assumption that is valid for relatively short heat sinks. When compact heat exchangers are calculated, the logarithmic mean air temperature is used. &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the air mass flow rate in kg/s.

The above equations show that
*When the air flow through the heat sink decreases, this results in an increase in the average air temperature. This in turn increases the heat sink base temperature. And additionally, the thermal resistance of the heat sink will also increase. The net result is a higher heat sink base temperature.
**The increase in heat sink thermal resistance with decrease in flow rate will be shown later in this article.
*The inlet air temperature relates strongly with the heat sink base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the inlet air temperature is not the ambient air temperature. The inlet air temperature of the heat sink is therefore higher, which also results in a higher heat sink base temperature.
*If there is no air flow around the heat sink, energy cannot be transferred.
*A heat sink is not a device with the "magical ability to absorb heat like a sponge and send it off to a parallel universe".&lt;ref name="TK"&gt;Kordyban, T., 1998, Hot air rises and heat sinks – Everything you know about cooling electronics is wrong, ASME Press, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural convection requires free flow of air over the heat sink. If fins are not aligned vertically, or if fins are too close together to allow sufficient air flow between them, the efficiency of the heat sink will decline.

==Design factors==

===Thermal resistance===
For semiconductor devices used in a variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of ''[[thermal resistance]]'' simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.

The idea of thermal resistance of a semiconductor heat sink is an approximation. It does not take into account non-uniform distribution of heat over a device or heat sink. It only models a system in thermal equilibrium, and does not take into account the change in temperatures with time. Nor does it reflect the non-linearity of radiation and convection with respect to temperature rise. However, manufacturers tabulate typical values of thermal resistance for heat sinks and semiconductor devices, which allows selection of commercially manufactured heat sinks to be simplified.&lt;ref name=National75&gt;Nello Sevastopoulos et al., ''National Semiconductor Voltage Regulator Handbook'',National Semiconductor Corp., 1975 chapters 4, 5,6&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial extruded aluminium heat sinks have a thermal resistance (heat sink to ambient air) ranging from {{nowrap|0.4 °C/W}} for a large sink meant for [[TO3]] devices, up to as high as {{nowrap|85 °C/W}} for a clip-on heat sink for a [[TO92]] small plastic case.&lt;ref name=National75/&gt; The popular [[2N3055]] power transistor in a TO3 case has an internal thermal resistance from junction to case of {{nowrap|1.52 °C/W}}.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Instruments ''Type 2N3055 N-P-N Single Diffused Mesa Silicon Power Transistor'' data sheet, Texas Instruments, bulletin number DL-S-719659, August 1967, revised December 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The contact between the device case and heat sink may have a thermal resistance of between {{nowrap|0.5 up to 1.7 °C/W}}, depending on the case size, and use of grease or insulating mica washer.&lt;ref name=National75/&gt;

===Material===
The most common heat sink materials are [[aluminium alloys]].&lt;ref name="San"&gt;Anon, Unknown, [http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/ndejong/ME%20146%20files/Heat%20Sink.ppt "Heat sink selection"], Mechanical engineering department, San Jose State University [27 January 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium alloy [[1050 aluminium alloy|1050]] has one of the higher thermal conductivity values at 229 W/m•K &lt;ref name="AL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aluminium.matter.org.uk/aluselect/default.asp|title="Aluminium Matter Organization UK"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is mechanically soft. Aluminium alloys 6060 (low stress), [[6061 aluminium alloy|6061]], and [[6063 aluminium alloy|6063]] are commonly used, with thermal conductivity values of 166 and 201 W/m•K, respectively. The values depend on the [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] of the alloy. Aluminium heat sinks can be cast or extruded.

[[Copper in heat exchangers|Copper]] has excellent heat sink properties in terms of its thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, biofouling resistance, and antimicrobial resistance ''(See also [[Copper in heat exchangers]])''. Copper has around twice the thermal conductivity of aluminium, around 400 W/m•K for pure copper. Its main applications are in industrial facilities, power plants, solar thermal water systems, HVAC systems, gas water heaters, forced air heating and cooling systems, geothermal heating and cooling, and electronic systems.

Copper is three times as dense&lt;ref name="San"/&gt; and more expensive than aluminium.&lt;ref name="San"/&gt; Copper heat sinks are machined and [[skiving machine|skived]]. Another method of manufacture is to solder the fins into the heat sink base. Copper is less ductile than Aluminium, so it cannot be extruded into heat sinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Fin efficiency====
Fin efficiency is one of the parameters which makes a higher thermal conductivity material important. A fin of a heat sink may be considered to be a flat plate with heat flowing in one end and being dissipated into the surrounding fluid as it travels to the other.&lt;ref name="Krum"/&gt; As heat flows through the fin, the combination of the thermal resistance of the heat sink impeding the flow and the heat lost due to convection, the temperature of the fin and, therefore, the heat transfer to the fluid, will decrease from the base to the end of the fin. Fin efficiency is defined as the actual heat transferred by the fin, divided by the heat transfer were the fin to be isothermal (hypothetically the fin having infinite thermal conductivity). Equations 6 and 7 are applicable for straight fins:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_f = \frac{\tanh(mL_c)}{mL_c}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; (6)
:&lt;math&gt;mL_c = \sqrt{\frac{2h_f}{k t_f}}L_f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; (7)

Where:
*h&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[heat transfer coefficient|convection coefficient]] of the fin
**Air: 10 to 100 W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K)
**Water: 500 to 10,000 W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K)
*k is the [[thermal conductivity]] of the fin material
**Aluminium: 120 to 240 [[watt|W]]/([[metre|m]]·[[kelvin|K]])
*L&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the fin height (m)
*t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the fin thickness (m)
Fin efficiency is increased by decreasing the fin [[aspect ratio]] (making them thicker or shorter), or by using more conductive material (copper instead of aluminium, for example).

====Spreading resistance====
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Another parameter that concerns the thermal conductivity of the heat sink material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy is transferred from a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the heat sink base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and the edges of the heat sink. This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the heat sink. This nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective thermal resistance.

To decrease the spreading resistance in the base of a heat sink:
*Increase the base thickness
*Choose a different material with better thermal conductivity &lt;!-- We don't yet know how to change the intrinsic thermal conductivity of a metal, afaik! :) -- user Nikevich --&gt;
*Use a vapor chamber or [[heat pipe]] in the heat sink base.

===Fin arrangements===
{{Main|Fin (extended surface)}}
[[File:Pin fin, straight fin and flared heat sinks.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Heat sink types: Pin, Straight and Flared Fin]]

A pin fin heat sink is a heat sink that has pins that extend from its base. The pins can be cylindrical, elliptical or square. A pin is one of the more common heat sink types available on the market. {{Citation needed|reason=Does not provide citation that shows that pin heat sinks are the most common. A simple internet search shows predominantly straight fin type heat sinks |date=August 2014}} A second type of heat sink fin arrangement is the straight fin. These run the entire length of the heat sink. A variation on the straight fin heat sink is a cross cut heat sink. A straight fin heat sink is cut at regular intervals.

In general, the more surface area a heat sink has, the better it works.&lt;ref name="TK"/&gt; However, this is not always true. The concept of a pin fin heat sink is to try to pack as much surface area into a given volume as possible.&lt;ref name="TK"/&gt; As well, it works well in any orientation. Kordyban&lt;ref name="TK"/&gt; has compared the performance of a pin fin and a straight fin heat sink of similar dimensions. Although the pin fin has 194&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface area while the straight fin has 58&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the temperature difference between the heat sink base and the ambient air for the pin fin is {{nowrap|50 °C}}. For the straight fin it was 44&amp;nbsp;°C or 6&amp;nbsp;°C better than the pin fin. Pin fin heat sink performance is significantly better than straight fins when used in their intended application where the fluid flows axially along the pins (see [[:File:Natural-convection-heat-sink-fluid-WBG.jpg|figure 17]]) rather than only tangentially across the pins.

Another configuration is the flared fin heat sink; its fins are not parallel to each other, as shown in figure 5. Flaring the fins decreases flow resistance and makes more air go through the heat sink fin channel; otherwise, more air would bypass the fins. Slanting them keeps the overall dimensions the same, but offers longer fins. Forghan, et al.&lt;ref name="Forghan"&gt;Forghan, F., Goldthwaite, D., Ulinski, M., Metghalchi, M., 2001, Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of Thermal Performance of Heat Sinks, ISME May.&lt;/ref&gt; have published data on tests conducted on pin fin, straight fin and flared fin heat sinks. They found that for low approach air velocity, typically around 1&amp;nbsp;m/s, the thermal performance is at least 20% better than straight fin heat sinks. Lasance and Eggink&lt;ref name="Lasance"&gt;Lasance, C.J.M and Eggink, H.J., 2001, A Method to Rank Heat Sinks in Practice: The Heat Sink Performance Tester, 21st IEEE SEMI-THERM Symposium.&lt;/ref&gt; also found that for the bypass configurations that they tested, the flared heat sink performed better than the other heat sinks tested. &lt;!-- Any info. avail. about laminar vs. turbulent flow? Just curious - - - user Nikevich --&gt;

===Cavities (inverted fins)===
Cavities (inverted fins) embedded in a heat source are the regions formed between adjacent fins that stand for the essential promoters of nucleate boiling or condensation. These cavities are usually utilized to extract heat from a variety of heat generating bodies to a heat sink.&lt;ref&gt;Bisemi C, Rocha LAO, Bejan A. Inverted fins: geometric optimization of the intrusion into a conducting wall. Int J Heat Mass Transfer 2004;47:2577–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzini G, Biserni C, Rocha LAO. Geometric optimization of isothermal cavities according to Bejan’s theory. Int J Heat Mass Transfer 2011;54: 3868–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conductive thick plate between the heat source and the heat sink===
Placing a conductive thick plate as a heat transfer interface between a heat source and a cold flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the cooling performance. In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate instead of being cooled in direct contact with the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat transfer surface area, that is quite different from fins (extended surfaces).

===Surface color===
[[File:Huawei Tecal ES3000 face 20140805.jpg|thumb|A server grade flash memory card with a black heat sink.]]
The [[heat transfer]] from the heat sink occurs by convection of the surrounding air, conduction through the air, and [[thermal radiation|radiation]].

Heat transfer by radiation is a function of both the heat sink temperature, and the temperature of the surroundings that the heat sink is optically coupled with. When both of these temperatures are on the order of 0&amp;nbsp;°C to 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the contribution of radiation compared to convection is generally small, and this factor is often neglected. In this case, finned heat sinks operating in either natural-convection or forced-flow will not be affected significantly by surface [[emissivity]].

In situations where convection is low, such as a flat non-finned panel with low airflow, [[radiative cooling]] can be a significant factor. Here the surface properties may be an important design factor. Matte-black surfaces will radiate much more efficiently than shiny bare metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ludens.cl/Electron/Thermal.html|title=Thermal design|first=Manfred|last=Mornhinweg|website=ludens.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavid.com/product-group/extrusions-na/anodize|title=Effects of Anodization on Radiational Heat Transfer - heat sinks|website=www.aavid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shiny metal surface has low emissivity. The emissivity of a material is tremendously frequency dependent, and is related to absorptivity (of which shiny metal surfaces have very little). For most materials, the emissivity in the visible spectrum is similar to the emissivity in the infrared spectrum{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}; however there are exceptions, notably certain metal oxides that are used as "[[selective surface]]s".

In a [[vacuum]] or in [[outer space]], there is no convective heat transfer, thus in these environments, radiation is the only factor governing heat flow between the heat sink and the environment. For a satellite in space, a 100&amp;nbsp;°C (373 Kelvin) surface facing the [[Sun]] will absorb a lot of radiant heat, because the [[Sun]]'s surface temperature is nearly 6000 Kelvin, whereas the same surface facing deep-space will radiate a lot of heat, since deep-space has an effective temperature of only a few Kelvin.

==Engineering applications==

===Microprocessor cooling===
[[File:Cooling system on an ASUS GTX-650 Ti TOP Cu-II graphics card.jpg|thumb|right|Cooling system of an [[Asus]] GTX-650 graphics card; three heat pipes are visible]]

Heat dissipation is an unavoidable by-product of electronic devices and circuits.&lt;ref name="Krum"/&gt; In general, the temperature of the device or component will depend on the thermal resistance from the component to the environment, and the heat dissipated by the component. To ensure that the component does not [[overheating (electricity)|overheat]], a thermal engineer seeks to find an efficient heat transfer path from the device to the environment. The heat transfer path may be from the component to a printed circuit board (PCB), to a heat sink, to air flow provided by a fan, but in all instances, eventually to the environment.

Two additional design factors also influence the thermal/mechanical performance of the thermal design:
# The method by which the heat sink is mounted on a component or processor. This will be discussed under the section ''attachment methods''.
# For each interface between two objects in contact with each other, there will be a temperature drop across the interface. For such composite systems, the temperature drop across the interface may be appreciable.&lt;ref name="Incro"&gt;Incropera, F.P. and DeWitt, D.P., 1985, Introduction to heat transfer, John Wiley and sons, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature change may be attributed to what is known as the thermal contact resistance.&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; ''Thermal interface materials'' (TIM) decrease the thermal contact resistance.

====Attachment methods====
As power dissipation of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't [[overheating (electricity)|overheat]]. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal as well as its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form [[tie (engineering)#Z-clip|z clip]]s, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.

; Thermally conductive tape
[[File:Thermally conductive tape.png|thumb|right|Roll of thermally conductive tape.]]

Thermally conductive tape is one of the most cost-effective heat sink attachment materials.&lt;ref name="Attach"&gt;Azar, K, et al., 2008, [http://www.can-dotape.com/thermally-conductive-tapes.php "Thermally Conductive Tapes"], can-dotape.com, accessed on 3/21/2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is suitable for low-mass heat sinks and for components with low power dissipation. It consists of a thermally conductive carrier material with a pressure-sensitive adhesive on each side.

This tape is applied to the base of the heat sink, which is then attached to the component. Following are factors that influence the performance of thermal tape:&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt;
# Surfaces of both the component and heat sink must be clean, with no residue such as a film of [[silicone grease]].
# Preload pressure is essential to ensure good contact. Insufficient pressure results in areas of non-contact with trapped air, and results in higher-than-expected interface thermal resistance.
# Thicker tapes tend to provide better "wettability" with uneven component surfaces. "Wettability" is the percentage area of contact of a tape on a component. Thicker tapes, however, have a higher thermal resistance than thinner tapes. From a design standpoint, it is best to strike a balance by selecting a tape thickness that provides maximum "wettablilty" with minimum thermal resistance.

; Epoxy
[[Epoxy]] is more expensive than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between the heat sink and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt; The epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to the heat sink, and before the heat sink is placed on the component. The epoxy is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must be clean and free of any residue.

The epoxy bond between the heat sink and component is semi-permanent/permanent.&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt; This makes re-work very difficult and at times impossible. The most typical damage caused by rework is the separation of the component die heat spreader from its package.

[[File:Pin fin heat sink with a z-clip.png|thumb|right|A pin fin heat sink with a Z-clip retainer.]]
; Wire form Z-clips
More expensive than tape and epoxy, wire form z-clips attach heat sinks mechanically. To use the z-clips, the printed circuit board must have anchors. Anchors can be either soldered onto the board, or pushed through. Either type requires holes to be designed into the board. The use of RoHS &lt;!-- Ref. needed to define RoHS? -- Regards, user Nikevich --&gt;solder must be allowed for because such solder is mechanically weaker than traditional Pb/Sn solder.

To assemble with a [[tie (engineering)#Z-clip|z-clip]], attach one side of it to one of the anchors. Deflect the spring until the other side of the clip can be placed in the other anchor. The deflection develops a spring load on the component, which maintains very good contact. In addition to the mechanical attachment that the z-clip provides, it also permits using higher-performance thermal interface materials, such as phase change types.&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt;

[[File:MaxiGRIP and Talon Clip heat sink attachment methods.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Two heat sink attachment methods, namely the maxiGRIP (left) and Talon Clip (right).]]
; Clips
Available for processors and [[ball grid array]] (BGA) components, clips allow the attachment of a BGA heat sink directly to the component. The clips make use of the gap created by the ball grid array (BGA) between the component underside and PCB top surface. The clips therefore require no holes in the PCB. They also allow for easy rework of components.

[[File:Pushpins.png|thumb|right|upright|A pair of push pins.]]
; Push pins with compression springs
For larger heat sinks and higher preloads, push pins with compression springs are very effective.&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt; The push pins, typically made of brass or plastic, have a flexible barb at the end that engages with a hole in the PCB; once installed, the barb retains the pin. The compression spring holds the assembly together and maintains contact between the heat sink and component. Care is needed in selection of push pin size. Too great an insertion force can result in the die cracking and consequent component failure.

; Threaded standoffs with compression springs
For very large heat sinks, there is no substitute for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method.&lt;ref name="Attach"/&gt; A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw &lt;!-- screw? Word was omitted. -- Regards, user Nikevich --&gt;which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.

====Thermal interface materials====
[[File:Difference between thermal conductivity of thermal interface materials and thermal contact resistance.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Thermal conductivity and the interface resistance form part of the thermal interface resistance of a thermal interface material.]]
Thermal contact resistance occurs due to the voids created by surface roughness effects, defects and misalignment of the interface. The voids present in the interface are filled with air. Heat transfer is therefore due to conduction across the actual contact area and to conduction (or natural convection) and radiation across the gaps.&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; If the contact area is small, as it is for rough surfaces, the major contribution to the resistance is made by the gaps.&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; To decrease the thermal contact resistance, the surface roughness can be decreased while the interface pressure is increased. However, these improving methods are not always practical or possible for electronic equipment. Thermal interface materials (TIM) are a common way to overcome these limitations,

Properly applied thermal interface materials displace the air that is present in the gaps between the two objects with a material that has a much-higher thermal conductivity. Air has a thermal conductivity of 0.022 W/m•K&lt;ref name="Lienard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lienard |first=J. H., IV &amp; V |year=2004 |title=A Heat Transfer Textbook |edition=Third |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt; while TIMs have conductivities of 0.3 W/m•K&lt;ref name="Saint"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint-Gobain |year=2004 |url=http://www.fff.saint-gobain.com/Media/Documents/S0000000000000001036/ThermaCool%20Brochure.pdf |title=Thermal management solutions for electronic equipment |accessdate=22 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018184506/http://www.fff.saint-gobain.com/Media/Documents/S0000000000000001036/ThermaCool%20Brochure.pdf |archivedate=18 October 2006 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher.

When selecting a TIM, care must be taken with the values supplied by the manufacturer. Most manufacturers give a value for the thermal conductivity of a material. However, the thermal conductivity does not take into account the interface resistances. Therefore, if a TIM has a high thermal conductivity, it does not necessarily mean that the interface resistance will be low.

Selection of a TIM is based on three parameters: the interface gap which the TIM must fill, the contact pressure, and the electrical resistivity of the TIM. The contact pressure is the pressure applied to the interface between the two materials. The selection does not include the cost of the material. Electrical resistivity may be important depending upon electrical design details.

===Light-emitting diode lamps===
[[Light-emitting diode]] (LED) performance and lifetime are strong functions of their temperature.&lt;ref name="Bider"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bider |first=C. |year=2009 |url=http://www.led-professional.com/downloads/LpR_13_468932.pdf |title=Effect of thermal environment on LED light emission and lifetime |work=LED Professional Review May/June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective cooling is therefore essential. A case study of a LED based downlighter shows an example of the calculations done in order to calculate the required heat sink necessary for the effective cooling of lighting system.&lt;ref name="Eng"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azar |first=K. |date=September 2009 |url=http://www.qats.com/cpanel/UploadedPdf/Qpedia_0909_web.pdf |title=LED lighting: A case study in thermal management |journal=Qpedia Thermal E-Magazine |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article also shows that in order to get confidence in the results, multiple independent solutions are required that give similar results. Specifically, results of the experimental, numerical and theoretical methods should all be within 10% of each other to give high confidence in the results.

===In soldering===
Temporary heat sinks are sometimes used while soldering circuit boards, preventing excessive heat from damaging sensitive nearby electronics. In the simplest case, this means partially gripping a component using a heavy metal crocodile clip, [[hemostat]], or similar clamp. Modern semiconductor devices, which are designed to be assembled by reflow soldering, can usually tolerate soldering temperatures without damage. On the other hand, electrical components such as magnetic [[reed switch]]es can malfunction if exposed to hotter soldering irons, so this practice is still very much in use.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James Johnston, [http://www.eleinmec.com/article.asp?23 "Reed Switches"], ''Electronics in Meccano'', Issue 6, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods to determine performance==
In general, a heat sink performance is a function of material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, [[heat transfer coefficient]], air flow rate, and duct size. To determine the thermal performance of a heat sink, a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the thermal performance can be measured experimentally. Due to the complex nature of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) can also be used. This section will discuss the aforementioned methods for the determination of the heat sink thermal performance.

===A heat transfer theoretical model===
[[File:Heat sink thermal resistances.png|thumb|upright=2|Sketch of a heat sink with equivalent thermal resistances.]]
[[File:Thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient plotted against flow rate for specific heat sink design.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient plotted against flow rate for the specific heat sink design used in.&lt;ref name="Jeggels"/&gt; The data was generated using the equations provided in the article. The data shows that for an increasing air flow rate, the thermal resistance of the heat sink decreases.]]

One of the methods to determine the performance of a heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al.,&lt;ref name="Jeggels"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeggels |first=Y. U. |last2=Dobson |first2=R. T. |last3=Jeggels |first3=D. H. |title=Comparison of the cooling performance between heat pipe and aluminium conductors for electronic equipment enclosures |work=Proceedings of the 14th International Heat Pipe Conference, Florianópolis, Brazil |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.&lt;ref name="Prstic"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prstic |first=S. |last2=Iyengar |first2=M. |last3=Bar-Cohen |first3=A. |year=2000 |title=Bypass effect in high performance heat sinks |work=Proceedings of the International Thermal Science Seminar Bled, Slovenia, June 11&amp;nbsp;– 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat sink thermal resistance model consists of two resistances, namely the resistance in the heat sink base, &lt;math&gt;R_{b}&lt;/math&gt;, and the resistance in the fins, &lt;math&gt;R_{f}&lt;/math&gt;. The heat sink base thermal resistance, &lt;math&gt;R_{b}&lt;/math&gt;, can be written as follows if the source is a uniformly applied the heat sink base. If it is not, then the base resistance is primarily spreading resistance:
:&lt;math&gt;R_b = \frac{t_b}{kA_b}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

where &lt;math&gt;t_b&lt;/math&gt; is the heat sink base thickness, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the heat sink material thermal conductivity and &lt;math&gt;A_b&lt;/math&gt; is the area of the heat sink base.

The thermal resistance from the base of the fins to the air, &lt;math&gt;R_{f}&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated by the following formulas:
:&lt;math&gt;R_f = \frac{1}{n h_f W_f \left ( t_f + 2\eta_f L_f \right)}&lt;/math&gt; (5)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_f = \frac{\tanh{mL_c}}{mL_c}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; (6)
:&lt;math&gt;mL_c = \sqrt{\frac{2h_f}{k t_f}}L_f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Incro"/&gt; (7)
:&lt;math&gt;D_h = \frac{4A_{ch}}{P_{ch}}&lt;/math&gt; (8)
:&lt;math&gt;Re = \frac{4 \dot{G} \rho}{n \pi D_h \mu}&lt;/math&gt; (9)
:&lt;math&gt;f = (0.79 \ln Re - 1.64)^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;Mills, A.F., 1999, Heat transfer, Second edition, Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; (10)
:&lt;math&gt;Nu = \frac{(f/8)(Re - 1000)Pr}{1+12.7(f/8)^{0.5}(Pr^{\frac{2}{3}}-1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt; (11)
:&lt;math&gt;h_f = \frac{Nu k_{air}}{D_h}&lt;/math&gt; (12)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{P_{atm}}{R_aT_{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (13)

The flow rate can be determined by the intersection of the heat sink system curve and the fan curve. The heat sink system curve can be calculated by the flow resistance of the channels and inlet and outlet losses as done in standard fluid mechanics text books, such as Potter, et al.&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Potter |first=C. M. |last2=Wiggert |first2=D. C. |year=2002 |title=Mechanics of fluid |edition=Third |publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; and White.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=F. M. |year=1999 |title=Fluid mechanics |edition=Fourth |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the heat sink base and fin resistances are known, then the heat sink thermal resistance, &lt;math&gt;R_{hs}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{hs}=R_{b} + R_{f}&lt;/math&gt; (14).

Using the equations 5 to 13 and the dimensional data in,&lt;ref name="Jeggels"/&gt; the thermal resistance for the fins was calculated for various air flow rates. The data for the thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficient are shown in the diagram, which shows that for an increasing air flow rate, the thermal resistance of the heat sink decreases.

===Experimental methods===
Experimental tests are one of the more popular ways to determine the heat sink thermal performance. In order to determine the heat sink thermal resistance, the flow rate, input power, inlet air temperature and heat sink base temperature need to be known. Vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results.&lt;ref name="HSTM"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azar |first=A. |date=January 2009 |url=http://www.qats.com/cpanel/UploadedPdf/January20092.pdf |title=Heat sink testing methods and common oversights |journal=Qpedia Thermal E-Magazine |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application. More details on heat sink testing methods and common oversights can be found in Azar, et al.&lt;ref name="HSTM"/&gt;

===Numerical methods===
[[File:Flow-vector-heat-sink-fluid-WBG.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Radial heat sink with thermal profile and swirling forced convection flow trajectories predicted using a [[computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] analysis package]]
In industry, thermal analyses are often ignored in the design process or performed too late&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;when design changes are limited and become too costly.&lt;ref name="Krum"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sergent |first=J. |last2=Krum |first2=A. |year=1998 |title=Thermal management handbook for electronic assemblies |edition=First |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods can be used to determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heatsinkcalculator.com|title=Heat Sink Calculator: Online Heat Sink Analysis and Design|website=heatsinkcalculator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows.&lt;ref name="DK"&gt;Kuzmin, D., Unknown, [http://www.mathematik.uni-dortmund.de/~kuzmin/cfdintro/lecture1.pdf "Course: Introduction to CFD"], Dortmund University of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Seo Young|author2=Koo, Jae-Mo |author3=Kuznetsov, Andrey V. |title=Effect of anisotropy in permeability and effective thermal conductivity on thermal performance of an aluminum foam heat sink|journal=Numerical Heat Transfer Part A: Applications|year=2001|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–36|doi=10.1080/104077801300348851|bibcode= 2001NHTA...40...21K}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.

CFD can give an insight into flow patterns that are difficult, expensive or impossible to study using experimental methods.&lt;ref name="DK"/&gt; Experiments can give a quantitative description of flow phenomena using measurements for one quantity at a time, at a limited number of points and time instances. If a full-scale model is not available or not practical, scale models or dummy models can be used. The experiments can have a limited range of problems and operating conditions. Simulations can give a prediction of flow phenomena using CFD software for all desired quantities, with high resolution in space and time and virtually any problem and realistic operating conditions. However, if critical, the results may need to be validated.&lt;ref name="TK"/&gt;

'''High-level design''' (HLD) explains the architecture that would be used for developing a software product. The architecture diagram provides an overview of an entire system, identifying the main components that would be developed for the product and their interfaces.
The HLD uses possibly nontechnical to mildly technical terms that should be understandable to the administrators of the system. In contrast, [[low-level design]] further exposes the logical detailed design of each of these elements for programmers.

== Purpose ==
* Preliminary design—In the preliminary stages of a software development, the need is to size the project and to identify those parts of the project that might be risky or time consuming.
* Design overview—As the project proceeds, the need is to provide an overview of how the various sub-systems and components of the system fit together.

In both cases the high-level design should be a complete view of the entire system, breaking it down into smaller parts that are more easily understood. To minimize the maintenance overhead as construction proceeds and the lower-level design is done, it is best that the high-level design is elaborated only to the degree needed to satisfy these needs.

== High-level design document ==
A high-level design document or HLDD adds the necessary details to the current project description to represent a suitable model for coding. This document includes a high-level architecture diagram depicting the structure of the system, such as the database
architecture, application architecture (layers), application flow (navigation), security architecture and technology architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/research/Students/CJ_05_Design.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design overview ==
A high-level design provides an overview of a system, product, service or process.

Such an overview helps supporting components be compatible to others.

The highest-level design should briefly describe all platforms, systems, products, services and processes that it depends on and include any important changes that need to be made to them.

In addition, there should be brief consideration of all significant commercial, legal, environmental, security, safety and technical risks, issues and assumptions.

The idea is to mention every work area briefly, clearly delegating the ownership of more detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration between the various project teams.

Today, most high-level designs require contributions from a number of experts, representing many distinct professional disciplines.

Finally, every type of end-user should be identified in the high-level design and each contributing design should give due consideration to customer experience.

==IGEP processor boards==

===IGEPv2===
[[File:IGEPv2 Board, angle, provided by ISEE.png|thumb|200px|right|alt=Photo of the IGEPv2 Board|IGEPv2 Board]]
[[IGEPv2]] was released in 2009.&lt;ref name=igepv2 /&gt;
It consists of a low-power, fanless, industrial [[single-board computer]] (SBC) based on the [[Texas Instruments]] DM3730 [[ARM Cortex-A8]] processor in a 65mm x 95mm board. IGEPv2 was the first open hardware IGEP Processor Board from ISEE and may be used to evaluate IGEP Technology, develop full-fledged product prototypes or can be completely customized by the user thanks to the freely available schematics.

===IGEPv5===
IGEPv5 was presented in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

It is based on the Texas Instruments [[OMAP5]] [[System on a chip|SoC]], which uses a dual-core [[ARM Cortex-A15]] CPU. IGEPv5 allows additional connectivity via its on-board connectors and can be used to develop applications with advanced multimedia requirements.

===IGEP COM PROTON===
IGEP COM PROTON was released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

'''Ingeborg J. Hochmair-Desoyer''' (born 1953) is an [[Austria]]n [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] from [[Vienna University of Technology|Technical University of Vienna]]. She helped create the first micro-electronic multi-channel [[cochlear implant]] in the world with her husband [[Erwin Hochmair|Prof. Erwin Hochmair]]. In 1980 she co-founded together with Prof. Erwin Hochmair the medical device company MED-EL and serves as its CEO and CTO. In 2013, she was honored together with two more scientists with the [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award]] for developing the modern cochlear implant.

==Biography==
Ingeborg Hochmair was born in 1953 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ingeborg Hochmair – Vorzeigeunternehmerin mit Berufung|url=https://science.apa.at/rubrik/medizin_und_biotech/Ingeborg_Hochmair_-_Vorzeigeunternehmerin_mit_Berufung/SCI_20130912_SCI39371351214598262|publisher=APA-Science|date=12 September 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was a physicist and her father was Dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Vienna University of Technology. Her grandmother was one of the first female chemical engineers in Austria. She commenced her studies at Technical University of Vienna in electrical engineering in 1971 [and was the first woman to do her PhD (with distinction)in 1979]. Her dissertation was on the "Technical realization and psychoacoustic evaluation of a system for multichannel chronic stimulation of the auditory nerve."&lt;ref name="Riedler"&gt;{{cite news|last=Riedler|first=Michael|title=Gutes Gespür für's Gehör|url=http://wirtschaftsblatt.at/archiv/karriere/867516/index|newspaper=Wirtschafts Blatt|date=19 May 2001|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976 to 1986 she worked as Assistant Professor at the Institute of General Electrical Engineering and Electronics at Technical University of Vienna. She also worked at Stanford University’s Institute for Electronics in Medicine as a Visiting Associate Professor in 1979. Together with her husband she decided to move from Vienna to Innsbruck in 1986 where she taught (first as Assistant Professor and later as Associate Professor) at the Institute of Applied Physics Electronics of University of Innsbruck till 1999. In 1998 she achieved Venia Legendi (Univ. Doz.) in Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Technical University of Vienna.

The idea of creating a company to develop and manufacture hearing implants was put to effect in the early eighties when she co-founded together with her husband Erwin Hochmair the medical device company MED-EL. The first employees were hired in 1990 and mark the beginning of the company. Since 2000 she has founded and co-founded multiple companies linked to the area of hearing loss and hearing implants.

==Hearing implant research &amp; work==
In 1975 Ingeborg and Erwin Hochmair started the cochlear implant development at Technical University of Vienna with the overall goal of enabling the user not only to hear sounds but also to provide some speech understanding. Together they developed the world’s first microelectronic multi-channel cochlear implant. This implant included a long, flexible electrode, which could, for the first time, deliver electric signals to the auditory nerve along a large part of the cochlea, the snail-shaped inner ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journey to Developing MED-EL's Cochlear Implant: Interview with Dr. Ingeborg and Professor Erwin Hochmair, Founders of MED-EL|url=http://cochlearimplantonline.com/site/journey-to-developing-med-els-cochlear-implant-interview-with-dr-ingeborg-and-professor-erwin-hochmair-founders-of-med-el/|publisher=Cochlear Implant Online|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had "8 channels, a stimulation rate of 10.000 pulses per second per channel, 8 independent current sources, and a flexible electrode for 22-25mm insertion into the cochlea." The first device was implanted on 16 December 1977 in Vienna by Prof. Kurt Burian followed by a second implantation in March 1978. Despite an early shunt in the first patient and some existing tinnitus in the second patient, place pitch could be demonstrated and the second patient could reliably discriminate and identify stimulation channels.

With a next version of this device modified for better signal transparency, the next milestone in cochlear implant development was reached in March 1980: the understanding of words and sentences without lip-reading in a quiet environment via a small, body-worn sound processor. Over the years, about 500 devices were implanted in adults and children.  Owing to the implant’s very low power consumption and external processing, the world’s first behind-the-ear (BTE) processor for a cochlear implant was designed in 1991. It was called COMFORT.

As CEO and CTO of MED-EL Ingeborg Hochmair has developed many world’s first products and solutions to cater to the demand of patients and surgeons worldwide for a broad spectrum of indications of hearing loss.

'''Karl Friedrich Benz''' ({{IPA-de|bɛnts|lang|Karl Friedrich Benz.ogg}}; 25 November 1844 – 4 April 1929) was a German engine designer and automobile engineer.  His [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen|Benz Patent Motorcar]] from 1885 is considered the first practical automobile. He received a patent for the motorcar on 29 January 1886.

==Early life==
[[Image:Karl Benz 1869.png|thumb|left|upright=.8|Karl Benz, 1869, 25 years old (Zenodot Verlagsges. mbH)]]
Karl Benz was born Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant, on 25 November 1844 in [[Mühlburg]], now a borough of [[Karlsruhe#Famous people|Karlsruhe]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], which is part of modern [[Germany]], to Josephine Vaillant and a [[locomotive]] driver, Johann Georg Benz, whom she married a few months later. According to German law, the child acquired the name "Benz" by legal marriage of his parents Benz and Vaillant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographic.hu/index.php?act=napi&amp;rov=5&amp;id=6102 1844. november 25-én Karlsruheban született Karl Friedrich Vaillant] Karlsruheban született Karl Friedrich Vaillant, a Benz autógyár alapítója.

'''Carl''' is the spelling variant he used for one company, C.&amp;nbsp;Benz Söhne, he formed with his son Eugen after leaving the active management of his long standing company, but remaining on its board of directors for the rest of his life (through its merger with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in which the two companies became Daimler-Benz), and it is used for his autobiography by a recent publisher. This spelling variant has been copied often and may be found frequently.&lt;!--What do these say? (Benz 2001; Seidel 2005)--&gt; &lt;!-- need source for middle name --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local [[Grammar School]] in Karlsruhe and was a [[child prodigy|prodigious]] student. In 1853, at the age of nine he started at the scientifically oriented Lyceum. Next he studied at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Poly-Technical University]] under the instruction of [[Ferdinand Redtenbacher]].

Benz had originally focused his studies on [[locksmithing]], but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Karlsruhe]], which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.

Following his formal education, Benz had seven years of [[professional]] training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The [[training]] started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a [[mechanical engineering]] company.

He then moved to [[Mannheim]] to work as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] and [[designer]] in a [[Weighing scale|scales]] factory. In 1868 he went to [[Pforzheim]] to work for a [[bridge]] building company ''Gebrüder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik''. Finally, he went to [[Vienna]] for a short period to work at an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron construction]] company.

==Benz's first factory and early inventions (1871–1882)==
In 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in [[Mannheim]], later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.&lt;ref name="benz-bio-daimler"&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Karl Benz's life as described on daimler.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629163949/http://www.daimler.com/dccom/0-5-1333261-49-1279445-1-0-0-0-0-1-36-7145-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html |date=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fiancée, [[Bertha Benz|Bertha Ringer]], bought out Ritter's share in the company using her [[dowry]].&lt;ref name="benz-bio-daimler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbusa.com/heritage/karl-benz.do Mercedes-Benz, Home of Mercedes-Benz Luxury Automobiles&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.mbusa.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1872, Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).

Despite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenues, in 1878 he began to work on new [[patent]]s. First, he concentrated all his efforts on creating a reliable petrol [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke engine]]. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1878, New Year's Eve, and was granted a patent for it in 1879.

Karl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the [[accelerator (car)|speed regulation]] system, the [[ignition system|ignition]] using sparks with [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the [[spark plug]], the [[carburetor]], the [[clutch]], the [[gear shift]], and the water [[radiator]].

==Benz's Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882–1883)==
Problems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] due to the high production costs it maintained. The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with [[photographer]] Emil Bühler and his brother (a cheese merchant), in order to get additional bank support. The company became the [[joint-stock company]] ''Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim'' in 1882.

After all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the [[Share (finance)|shares]] and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.

[[File:Benz Patent Motorwagen Engine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engine of the Benz Patent Motorwagen]]
Benz's lifelong [[hobby]] brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm Eßlinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: ''[[Benz &amp; Cie.|Benz &amp; Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik]]'', usually referred to as ''Benz &amp; Cie.'' Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static [[gas engine]]s as well.

The success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a ''horseless carriage''. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an [[automobile]]. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones)
&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition&lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]]&lt;/ref&gt; and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; Power was transmitted by means of two [[roller chain]]s to the rear axle. Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it "''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen]]''".

It was the first [[automobile]] entirely designed as such to generate its own power, not simply a motorized stage coach or horse carriage, which is why Karl Benz was granted his patent and is regarded as its inventor.

The Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: "automobile fueled by gas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf DRP's patent No. 37435] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204045616/http://home.arcor.de/carsten.popp/DE_00037435_A.pdf |date=4 February 2012 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]], 561 kB, [[German language|German]]) was filed 29 January 1886 and granted 2 November 1886, thus taking effect 29 January.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt;

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as "''Benz Patent Motorwagen''") in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian [[bicycle]] manufacturer&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; [[Emile Roger]], who had already been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.

The early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had no gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after [[Bertha Benz]] made her famous trip driving one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of brake linings to act as brake pads.

==Bertha Benz's long-distance drive==
[[File:Berthabenzmemorialrouteschild.jpg|thumb|left|Official signpost of [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], commemorating the world's first long distance journey with a Benz Patent-Motorwagen Number 3 in 1888]]
In the first long distance automobile trip, Bertha Benz, supposedly without the knowledge of her husband, on the morning of 5 August 1888, took this vehicle on a {{convert|106|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies on the way to fuel up, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems and invented brake lining. After some longer downhill slopes, she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather on the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by [[telegram]]. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally. In 2008, the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bertha-Benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home|title=Bertha Benz Memorial Route|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was officially approved as a route of industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz's tracks of the world's first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. Now everybody can follow the 194&amp;nbsp;km of signposted route from [[Mannheim]] via [[Heidelberg]] to [[Pforzheim]] ([[Black Forest]]) and back. The return trip was along a different, slightly shorter, itinerary, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.

Benz's Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 [[World's Fair]] in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.

The great demand for stationary, static [[internal combustion engines]] forced Karl Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. ''Benz &amp; Cie.'' had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.

During the last years of the nineteenth century, ''Benz'' was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.

Because of its size, in 1899, ''Benz &amp; Cie.'' became a [[joint-stock company]] with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Ganß, who came aboard as members of the [[Board of directors|Board of Management]]. Ganß worked in the commercialization department, which is somewhat similar to [[marketing]] in contemporary corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html|title=How it all began|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819021657/http://www.mercedes-benz.co.ke/content/kenya/mpc/mpc_kenya_website/en/home_mpc/passengercars/home/world/mythos/how_it_began.html|archivedate=19 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new directors recommended that Benz should create a less expensive automobile suitable for [[mass production]]. In 1893, Karl Benz created the ''[[Benz Viktoria|Victoria]]'',&lt;!--Is it spelled "Viktoria"?--&gt; a two-passenger automobile with a {{convert|2.2|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, which could reach the top speed of {{convert|18|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and had a [[lever|pivot]]al front [[axle]] operated by a [[roller chain|roller-chained]] [[tiller]] for [[steering]]. The model was successful with 85 units sold in 1893.

The Benz ''Velo'' also participated in the world's first automobile race, the 1894 [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]], where Émile Roger finished 14th, after covering the {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 hours 01 minute at an average speed of {{convert|12.7|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

In 1895, Benz designed the first [[truck]] with an internal combustion engine in history. Benz also built the first motor buses in history in 1895, for the ''[[Netphener]]'' bus company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The first motorized bus, dating back to 1895, was a Benz.|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/lifestyle/mercedes-benz-magazines/classic-magazine/the-first-motorized-bus-dating-back-to-1895-was-a-benz/|website=mercedes-benz.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benz motorized bus.|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/museum/exponate-benz-omnibus/|website=mercedes-benz.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From landau to low-frame bus: passenger transportation from 1885 to 1926|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/ko/en/9361266|website=media.daimler.com|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:zzz-Vik-Lond.jpg|thumb|left|Benz "Velo" model presentation in London 1898]]
In 1896, Karl Benz was granted a [[patent]] for his design of the first '''[[flat engine]]'''. It had horizontally opposed [[piston]]s, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to [[momentum]]. Flat engines with four or fewer cylinders are most commonly called '''boxer''' engines, ''boxermotor'' in German, and also are known as ''horizontally opposed engines''. This design is still used by [[Porsche]], [[Subaru]], and some high performance engines used in [[racing cars]]. In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in [[BMW Motorrad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/technology/90-years-of-bmw-motorrad-an-evolution-of-the-motorcycle/|title=90 years of BMW motorrad: an evolution of the motorcycle|date=29 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including [[Victoria (motorcycle)|Victoria]], [[Harley-Davidson|Harley-Davidson XA]], [[Zündapp]], [[History of BMW motorcycles|Wooler]], [[Douglas Dragonfly]], [[Ratier]], Universal, [[IMZ-Ural]], [[Dnepr (motorcycle)|Dnepr]], [[Gnome et Rhône]], [[Chang Jiang (motorcycle)|Chang Jiang]], [[Marusho]], and the [[Honda Gold Wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093827/http://carlbenz.idschools.kit.edu/history_of_carl_benz.php |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Gottlieb Daimler]] died in March 1900—and there is no evidence that Benz and [[Gottlieb Daimler|Daimler]] knew each other nor that they knew about each other's early achievements—eventually, competition with [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Stuttgart]] began to challenge the leadership of Benz &amp; Cie. In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, [[Wilhelm Maybach]], built the engine that would later be used in the  ''[[Mercedes 35hp|Mercedes-35hp]]'' of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of [[Emil Jellinek]] under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-''Mercedes'' (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.

Benz countered with ''Parsifil'', introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|abbr=on}}. Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mercedes-benz-publicarchive.com/marsPublic/en/instance/ko/810-hp---35-hp-Benz-Parsifal-and-18-hp---3540-hp-Benz-1902--.xhtml?oid=4418|title=8/10 hp – 35 hp Benz Parsifal and 18 hp – 35/40 hp Benz, 1902 – 1908 – marsPublic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach's creations. Because of this action, after difficult discussions, Karl Benz announced his retirement from design management on 24 January 1903, although he remained as director on the Board of Management through its merger with DMG in 1926 and, remained on the board of the new Daimler-Benz corporation until his death in 1929.

He was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1984&lt;ref name="Benz"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://media.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1675571_EAHoF_e.rtf |title=European Automotive Hall of Fame |publisher=[[Mercedes-Benz]] |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHF=Benz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |title=Karl Benz |work=Hall of Fame Inductees |publisher=Automotive Hall of Fame |year=1984 |accessdate=4 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308034830/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/karl-benz/7/ |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Automotive Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="Benz"/&gt;

Benz's sons Eugen and Richard left Benz &amp; Cie. in 1903, but Richard returned to the company in 1904 as the designer of passenger vehicles.

That year, sales of Benz &amp; Cie. reached 3,480 automobiles, and the company remained the leading manufacturer of automobiles.

Along with continuing as a director of Benz &amp; Cie., Karl Benz would soon found another company, ''C.&amp;nbsp;Benz Söhne'', (with his son Eugen and closely held within the family), a privately held company for manufacturing automobiles. The brand name used the first initial of the French variant of Benz's first name, "Carl".

==Blitzen Benz==
[[Image:Blitzen Benz racing car.jpg|thumb|1909 ''Blitzen Benz''  – built by Benz &amp; Cie., which held the [[land speed record]]]]
In 1909, the ''Blitzen Benz'' was built in Mannheim by Benz &amp; Cie. The bird-beaked vehicle had a 21.5-liter (1312ci), {{convert|150|kW|hp|abbr=on}} engine, and on 9 November 1909 in the hands of [[Victor Hémery]] of France,&lt;ref&gt;Northey, Tom, "Land Speed Record", in ''The World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis Publishing, 1974), Volume 10, p.1163.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[land speed record|land speed racer]] at [[Brooklands]], set a record of 226.91&amp;nbsp;km/h (141.94&amp;nbsp;mph), said to be "faster than any plane, train, or automobile" at the time, a record that was not exceeded for ten years by any other vehicle. It was transported to several countries, including the United States, to establish multiple records of this achievement.

==Benz Söhne (1906–1923)==

Karl Benz, Bertha Benz, and their son, Eugen, moved {{convert|10|km}} east of Mannheim to live in nearby [[Ladenburg]], and solely with their own capital, founded the private company, C.&amp;nbsp;Benz Sons (German: ''Benz Söhne'') in 1906, producing automobiles and gas engines. The latter type was replaced by petrol engines because of lack of demand.&lt;ref name="automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de/?section=historie&amp;infopart=drcarlbenz|title=Automuseum Dr. Carl Benz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:C-Benz-Soehne-Logo.png|thumb|upright|Logo on family held business production vehicles]]
This company never issued stocks publicly, building its own line of automobiles independently from Benz &amp; Cie., which was located in Mannheim. The ''Benz Sons'' automobiles were of good quality and became popular in [[London]] as [[taxicab|taxis]].

In 1912, Karl Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz &amp; Cie.

During a birthday celebration for him in his home town of [[Karlsruhe]] on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Karl Benz was awarded an honorary [[Honorary degree|doctorate]] by his alma mater, the ''[[Karlsruhe University]]'', thereby becoming—Dr.&amp;nbsp;Ing. h.&amp;nbsp;c.&amp;nbsp;Karl Benz.&lt;ref name="automuseum-dr-carl-benz.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/mercedes-benz/classic/community/dr-carl-benz-car-museum/|title=Dr. Carl Benz Car Museum.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Almost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in [[sports car racing]] became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz ''Velo'' participated in the first automobile race: [[Auto racing#Paris–Rouen: the world's first motoring contest|Paris to Rouen 1894]]. Later, investment in developing [[racecar]]s for [[motorsports]] produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time, as seen in the photograph here of the Benz, the first [[mid-engine]] and [[aerodynamically]] designed, ''Tropfenwagen'', a "teardrop" body introduced at the 1923 [[European Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]].

In the last production year of the ''Benz Sons'' company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Karl Benz built two additional 8/25&amp;nbsp;hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.

==Toward ''Daimler-Benz'' and the first ''Mercedes-Benz'' in 1926==

[[Image:Ladenburg Wohnhaus Carl Benz 20100920.jpg|thumb|Last home of Karl and Bertha Benz, now the location of the Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation in [[Ladenburg]], in [[Baden-Württemberg]]]]
The German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 ''Benz &amp; Cie.'' produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and ''DMG'' made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25&amp;nbsp;million [[German papiermark|marks]] because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an "Agreement of Mutual Interest" valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising—marketing their automobile models jointly—although keeping their respective brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Merger-in-the-Year-1926-DMG-and-Benz--Cie-merge-to-become-Da.xhtml?oid=12358477|title=Merger in the Year 1926: DMG and Benz &amp; Cie. merge to become Daimler-Benz AG: Together for the best for 90 years – marsMediaSite|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 1926, Benz &amp; Cie. and DMG finally merged as the ''[[Daimler-Benz]]'' company, baptizing all of its automobiles, ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'', honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 ''[[Mercedes 35 hp]]'', along with the Benz name. The name of that DMG model had been selected after ten-year-old [[Mercédès Jellinek]], the daughter of [[Emil Jellinek]] who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG's board of management and long before the merger Jellinek had resigned.

Karl Benz was a member of the new ''Daimler-Benz'' board of management for the remainder of his life. A new [[logo]] was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler's [[motto]]: ''"engines for land, air, and water"'') surrounded by traditional [[Bay Laurel|laurels]] from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]''. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.

The next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the [[diesel engine|diesel]] line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the ''[[Mercedes-Benz SSK]]'' was presented.

On 4 April 1929, Karl Benz died at home in Ladenburg at the age of eighty-four from a [[bronchitis|bronchial inflammation]]. Until her death on 5 May 1944, [[Bertha Benz]] continued to reside in their last home. Members of the family resided in the home for thirty more years. The Benz home now has been designated as [[historic preservation|historic]] and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the ''Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation'', that honors both Bertha and Karl Benz for their roles in the history of automobiles.

[[File:Bed - 's-Gravenhage - 20086856 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Lit à la turque in the 18th-century [[Huis ten Bosch palace]], the Hague, Netherlands]]
The '''Lit à la Turque''', a [[bed]] with two scrolling ends and a [[baldachin]], was one of many products of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=6778 |title=Bed (Lit à la Turque) (Getty Museum)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the obsession with anything exotic or unusual from foreign countries; beds, [[furniture]] and other objects reflected this style.  The design of this bed is not directly linked with any Turkish design, but reflects the luxurious and romantic designs that inspired the [[Master craftsman|craftsmen]] of this time.

Beds of this type were usually placed sideways against the wall with a [[baldachin]].  Many times these beds were placed on wheels allowing the body of the bed to be pulled out and made up easily, while the back would stay attached to the wall.

Fashion for Turkish things peaked in the 18th century when [[Madame de Pompadour]] had a bedroom called the ''chambre à la turque'' (Turkish bedroom).

The Mark 22 nuclear bomb (Mk-22) was the first thermonuclear device test by the [[University of California Radiation Lab]] (UCRL). The test was part of the [[Castle Koon|''Koon'' shot of Operation Castle]]. The Mk-22 failed to achieve anything like its intended yield due to premature heating of the secondary from exposure to neutrons. As the other UCRL test planned for the Castle series, the liquid fueled "[[Ramrod]]" device had the same basic [[Product defect|design flaw]], that test was canceled. Within a month of the bomb’s failure, the Mk-22 was terminated because the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] realized there was nothing that could be done to salvage the design.

Most mechanics specialize in a particular field, such as [[auto mechanics]], truck mechanic, [[bicycle mechanic]]s, [[motorcycle]] mechanics, [[boiler]] mechanics, general mechanics, industrial maintenance mechanics ([[millwrights]]), [[air conditioning]] and [[refrigeration]] mechanics, [[bus]] mechanics, [[Aircraft maintenance technician|aircraft mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Henderson | first=C.J. | last2=Dolphin | first2=J. | last3=Fehl | first3=P. | last4=Davenport | first4=R. | title=Career Opportunities in the Armed Forces | publisher=Facts On File, Incorporated | series=Career Opportunities Series | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4381-1062-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfAzNoC9o2oC&amp;pg=PA230 | access-date=December 18, 2017 | page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diesel engine|diesel mechanics]] and [[tank]] mechanics in the [[Military branch|armed services]]. Auto mechanics, for example, have many trades within. Some may specialize in the [[Electricity|electrical]] aspects, while others may specialize in the [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanical]] aspects. Other areas include: [[brakes]] and [[steering]], suspension, automatic or manual [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[engine]] repairs or diagnosing customer complaints. An automotive technician, on the other hand, has a wide variety of topics to learn. A mechanic is typically [[Certification|certified]] by a [[trade association]] or regional government power. Mechanics may be separated into two classes based on the type of machines they work on, heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work is on larger machines or [[heavy equipment]], such as tractors and trailers, while lightweight work is on smaller items, such as automotive engines.

Daniel Fahrenheit's mercury-in-glass thermometer was far more reliable and accurate than any that had existed before, and the mercury thermometers in use today are made in the way Fahrenheit devised.]]
[[Image:Fahrenheit small.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danzig]]-born [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]], a pioneer of [[exact thermometry]] (or [[precision thermometry]]. He invented the [[mercury thermometer]] (first practical, accurate thermometer) and [[Fahrenheit scale]] (first standardized [[temperature scale]] to be widely used).]]
The '''mercury-in-glass''' or '''mercury thermometer''' was invented by physicist [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] in [[Amsterdam]] (1714). It consists of a bulb containing [[mercury (element)|mercury]] attached to a [[glass]] tube of narrow diameter; the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulb. The volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature; the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with [[nitrogen]] gas or it may be at less than [[atmospheric pressure]], a partial [[vacuum]].

In order to calibrate the thermometer, the bulb is made to reach [[thermal equilibrium]] with a temperature standard such as an ice/water mixture, and then with another standard such as water/vapour, and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed points. In principle, [[thermometer]]s made of different material (e.g., coloured [[alcohol thermometer]]s) might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties; in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true [[thermodynamic temperature]], and so give similar results.

The application of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (1714) and [[Fahrenheit scale]] (1724) for [[liquid-in-glass thermometer]]s ushered in a new era of accuracy and precision in [[thermometry]], and is still to this day regarded as one of the most accurate thermometers available.&lt;ref&gt;Grigull, Ulrich (1966).  ''Fahrenheit, a Pioneer of Exact Thermometry''. (The Proceedings of the 8th International Heat Transfer Conference, San Francisco, 1966, Vol. 1, pp. 9-18.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Quicksilvertermometer Osaby.JPG|thumb|upright|A large mercury in glass thermometer.]]
{{See also|Liquid-in-glass thermometer|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology}}
The thermometer was used by the originators of the [[Fahrenheit]] and [[Celsius]] scales.

[[Anders Celsius]], a Swedish scientist, devised the Celsius scale, which was described in his publication ''The origin of the Celsius temperature scale'' in 1742.

Celsius used two fixed points in his scale: the temperature of melting ice and the temperature of boiling water.  This wasn't a new idea, since [[Isaac Newton]] was already working on something similar.  The distinction of  Celsius was to use the condition of melting and not that of freezing. The experiments for reaching a good calibration of his thermometer lasted for 2 winters.  By performing the same experiment over and over again, he discovered that ice always melted at the same calibration mark on the thermometer.  He found a similar fixed point in the calibration of boiling water to [[water vapor|water vapour]] (when this is done to high precision, a variation will be seen with atmospheric pressure; Celsius noted this).  At the moment that he removed the thermometer from the vapour, the mercury level climbed slightly.  This was related to the rapid cooling (and contraction) of the glass.

When Celsius decided to use his own temperature scale, he originally defined his scale "upside-down", i.e. he chose to set the boiling point of pure water at &lt;!--DON'T CHANGE THIS. It's supposed to be the wrong way around. Please check the source. Thanks--&gt;0&amp;nbsp;°C (212&amp;nbsp;°F) and the freezing point at -100&amp;nbsp;°C (-32&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anders Celsius 1701–1744 |work=Astronomical Observatory: History |publisher=Uppsala University |url=http://www.astro.uu.se/history/Celsius_eng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Frenchman [[Jean-Pierre Christin]] proposed to invert the scale with the freezing point at {{convert|0|C}} and the boiling point at {{convert|100|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacqueline |last=Smith |chapter=Appendix I: Chronology |title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Weather and Climate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAfa1orgvwQC&amp;pg=PA246 |year=2009 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-0951-0 |pages=246 |quote=1743 Jean-Pierre Christin inverts the fixed points on Celsius' scale, to produce the scale used today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it Centigrade (100 grades).

Finally, Celsius proposed a method of calibrating a thermometer:

#Place the cylinder of the thermometer in melting ice made of pure water and mark the point where the fluid in the thermometer stabilises.  This point is the freeze/thaw point of water.
#In the same manner mark the point where the fluid stabilises when the thermometer is placed in boiling water vapour.
#Divide the length between the two marks into 100 equal parts.

These points are adequate for approximate calibration but both vary with atmospheric pressure. Nowadays, the [[triple point]] of water is used instead of the freezing point (the triple point occurs at 273.16 kelvins (K), 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C).

Before the discovery of the true thermodynamic temperature, the thermometer ''defined'' the temperature; thermometers made with different materials would define different temperature scales (a coloured alcohol thermometer would give a slightly different reading than a mercury thermometer at, say half-scale). In practice, several materials gave very similar temperatures to each other and, when discovered, to the thermodynamic temperature.

==Maximum thermometer==
[[Image:Maximum thermometer close up 2.JPG|thumb|Closeup of a maximum thermometer. The break in the column of mercury is visible.]]
[[Image:Clinical thermometer 38.7.JPG|thumb|A medical mercury-in-glass maximum thermometer showing the temperature of 38.7 °C.]]
One special kind of mercury-in-glass thermometer, called a maximum thermometer, works by having a constriction in the neck close to the bulb. As the temperature rises, the mercury is pushed up through the constriction by the force of expansion. When the temperature falls, the column of mercury breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. The observer can then read the maximum temperature over the set period of time. To reset the thermometer it must be swung sharply. This design is used in the traditional type of [[medical thermometer]].

==Maximum minimum thermometer==
A maximum minimum thermometer, also known as [[Six's thermometer]], is a thermometer which registers the maximum and minimum temperatures reached over a period of time, typically 24 hours. The original design contains mercury, but solely as a way to indicate the position of a column of alcohol whose expansion indicates the temperature; it is not a thermometer operated by the expansion of mercury; mercury-free versions are available.

==Physical properties==
Mercury thermometers cover a wide temperature range from {{convert|−37|to|356|C}}; the instrument's upper temperature range may be extended though the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen. This introduction of an [[inert gas]] increases the pressure on the liquid mercury and therefore its boiling point is increased, this in combination with replacing the [[Pyrex]] glass with [[fused quartz]] allows the upper temperature range to be extended to {{convert|800|C}}.

Mercury cannot be used below the [[Melting point|temperature at which it becomes solid]], {{convert|−38.83|C}}. If the thermometer contains nitrogen, the gas may flow down into the column when the mercury solidifies and be trapped there when the temperature rises, making the thermometer unusable until returned to the factory for reconditioning. To avoid this, some weather services require that all mercury-in-glass thermometers be brought indoors when the temperature falls to {{convert|−37|C}}.

To measure lower meteorological temperatures, a thermometer containing a mercury-[[thallium]] [[alloy]] which does not solidify until the temperature drops to {{convert|−61.1|C}} may be used.

==Phase-out==
{{As of|2012}}, many mercury-in-glass thermometers are used in [[meteorology]]; however, they are becoming increasingly rare for other uses, as many countries banned them for [[Medical thermometer|medical use]] due to the toxicity of mercury. Some manufacturers use [[galinstan]], a liquid alloy of [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[tin]], as a replacement for mercury.

The typical "fever thermometer" contains between {{convert|0.5|and|0.3|g|dram|abbr=on|lk=out}} of elemental mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thermometers and Thermostats: Fever Thermometers |date=2010-06-03 |work=Mercury and the Environment: Products that Contain Mercury |publisher=Environment Canada |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/mercure-mercury/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=AFE7D1A3-1#Fever}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/hg/thermometer-main.html |title=Mercury: Thermometers |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |quote=* oral/rectal/baby thermometers, containing about 0.61 grams of mercury; and&lt;br&gt;* basal temperature thermometers, containing about 2.25 grams of mercury.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swallowing this amount of mercury would, it is said, pose little danger but the inhaling of the vapour could lead to health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mercury and Human Health |date=2009-03-02 |work=Healthy Living: It's Your Health: Environment |publisher=Health Canada |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/iyh-vsv/environ/merc_e.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219141902/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/iyh-vsv/environ/merc_e.html |archivedate=2006-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Argentina
In February 2009, the [[Argentine Health Ministry]] instructed by resolution 139/09 that all health centres and hospitals should buy mercury-free thermometers and [[blood pressure meter]]s and called on [[dentist]]s, [[medical technician]]s, and [[environmental health]] specialists to start eliminating this toxin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/Argentina-empieza-despedirse-termometros-mercurio_0_462553833.html Clarín newspaper, Argentina starts to say goodbye to mercury thermometers, 14/04/11] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016}} mercury thermometers were still on sale to the public at [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]].

;Austria
There was a voluntary take-back action for thermometers containing mercury based on the Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the [[Federal Ministry of Environment]], a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a collection bin and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for the distribution of the thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.unep.ch/mercury/storage/LAC_Docs/LAC_storage_RC_INF_5_SBC%20tech%20guidelines%20on%20ESM%20waste.doc UNEP(DTIE)/Mercury/WG/1/INF/3 Draft Technical Guidelines on the Environmentally Sound Management of Mercury Waste, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414221405/http://www.chem.unep.ch/MERCURY/storage/LAC_Docs/LAC_storage_RC_INF_5_SBC%20tech%20guidelines%20on%20ESM%20waste.doc |date=2010-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Philippines
By the Philippines [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]]’s Administrative Order 2008-0221, all mercury equipment from hospitals, including mercury-in-glass thermometers, will be phased out in the [[Philippines]] by September 28, 2010. Even before the order was released, 50 hospitals have already banned mercury from their establishments. Among these fifty hospitals, the [[Philippine Heart Center]] was the first one to do so. [[San Juan De Dios Educational Foundation|San Juan de Dios Hospital]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Philippine Children’s Medical Center]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|San Lazaro Hospital]], [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Ospital ng Muntinlupa]], [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], the [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|National Kidney and Transplant Institute]], [[Manila Adventist Medical Center]] and [[List of hospitals in the Philippines|Las Piñas Hospital]] also made steps to ban the toxic chemical. The country was the first one to make a step to ban mercury from its health care system in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://zerowastepilipinas.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/01_faye-ferrer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Salazar T |title=RP hospitals to phase out devices containing mercury |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2008-09-13 |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080913-160332/RP-hospitals-to-phase-out-devices-containing-mercury |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024090011/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20080913-160332/RP-hospitals-to-phase-out-devices-containing-mercury |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">The '''Royal Society and Académies des sciences Microsoft Award''' was an annual award given by the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Académie des sciences]] to scientists working in Europe who had made a major contribution to the advancement of science through the use of computational methods. It was sponsored by [[Microsoft Research]].

The award was open to any research scientist who had made a significant contribution at the intersection of computing and the sciences covering Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering. The prize recognized the importance of interdisciplinary research at the interface of science and computing for advancing scientific boundaries, as well as the importance of investing in European scientists to give Europe a competitive science base. The recipient was selected by a Committee comprising members of the Académie des sciences and Fellows of the Royal Society. The prize consisted of a trophy and monetary amount of €250,000, of which €7,500 is prize money and the rest earmarked for further research. 

The first award was made in 2006 and the last in 2009. It has now been replaced by the Royal Society [[Milner Award]].

A '''microwave antenna''' is a physical transmission device used to broadcast [[microwave]] transmissions between two or more locations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Balanis |first1=Constantine |title=Antenna theory; analysis and design |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to broadcasting, antennas are also used in [[radar]], [[radio astronomy]] and [[electronic warfare]].

==Antenna types==

===Reflector antennas===

A [[parabolic antenna]] is an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] that uses a [[parabolic reflector]], a curved surface with the cross-sectional shape of a [[parabola]], to direct the radio waves. These devices range anywhere from 6" to more than 12' diameter depending on application and use.

===Horn antennas===
A [[horn antenna]] or microwave horn is an antenna that consists of a flaring metal [[waveguide]] shaped like a [[horn (acoustic)|horn]] to direct radio waves in a beam.  Horns are widely used as antennas at [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] frequencies, above 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="Bevilaqua"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bevilaqua | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = Horn antenna - Intro | work = Antenna-theory.com website | date = 2009 | url = http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/aperture/horn.php | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lens antennas===
A [[lens antenna]] uses a lens to direct or collect microwave radiation.

===Array antennas===
An [[array antenna]] is a high gain antenna consisting of an array of smaller antenna elements.

===Leaky wave antenna===
A [[leaky wave antenna]] uses a leaking transmission line to obtain radation.

[[File:Mammals 02995 Thibetian Musk (22899919524).jpg|thumb|262x262px|Musk Deer of Tibet in old illustration]]
'''Musk''' is a class of aromatic substances commonly used as [[base note]]s in [[perfume]]ry. They include [[gland]]ular secretions from animals such as the [[musk deer]], numerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial substances with similar [[odor]]s.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher = Klincksieck |year= 1990 | pages = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musk'' was a name originally given to a substance with a strong odor obtained from a gland of the musk deer. The substance has been used as a popular perfume [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]] since ancient times and is one of the most expensive [[animal product]]s in the world. The name originates from the Late Greek μόσχος 'moskhos', from Persian 'mushk', ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] मुष्क muṣka meaning "a testicle", from a diminutive of मूष् mūṣ ("mouse"). &lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|musk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher =  Klincksieck |year= 1990 | page = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer gland was thought to resemble a scrotum. It is applied to various plants and animals of similar smell (e.g. musk-ox, 1744) and has come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors, despite their often differing [[chemical structure]]s and molecular shapes.

Natural musk was used extensively in [[perfumery]] until the late 19th century when economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of [[synthetic musk]], which is now used almost exclusively.&lt;ref name=Rimkus&gt;{{cite book | title = Synthetic Musk Fragrances in the Environment (Handbook of Environmental Chemistry) | first = Gerhard G. (Ed.)| last = Rimkus |author2=Cornelia Sommer | chapter = The Role of Musk and Musk Compounds in the Fragrance Industry |publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 3-540-43706-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]] primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of musk is [[muscone]].

Modern use of natural musk pods occurs in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Natural sources==

===Musk deer===
{{main|Deer musk}}
[[File:Primary Form of Musk.jpg|thumb|A musk pod, obtained from the male [[musk deer]]]]
The musk deer belongs to the family [[Moschidae]] and lives in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106000253184?urlappend=%3Bseq=72"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Section of the Foreign Office (Great Britain)|title="Tibet". Handbook (No. 70)|publisher=H M Staionery Office (1920)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]]. The musk pod is normally obtained by killing the male deer through traps laid in the wild. Upon drying, the reddish-brown paste inside the musk pod turns into a black [[granular material]] called "musk grain", which is then tinctured with alcohol. The aroma of the [[tincture]] gives a pleasant odor only after it is considerably [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d. No other natural substance has such a complex aroma associated with so many contradictory descriptions; however, it is usually described abstractly as animalistic, earthy and woody&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; or something akin to the odor of baby's skin.&lt;ref name=Kraft/&gt;

Musk has been a key constituent in many perfumes since its discovery, being held to give a perfume long-lasting power as a fixative. Today, the trade quantity of the natural musk is controlled by [[CITES]], but illegal [[poaching]] and trading continues.&lt;ref name=Kraft&gt;{{cite book | title = Chemistry and Technology of Flavours and Fragrances | first = David J. (Ed.)| last = Rowe |author2=[[Philip Kraft]] | chapter = Chapter 7. Aroma Chemicals IV: Musks | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 0-8493-2372-X | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Other animals===
[[File:Ondatra zibethicus FWS.jpg|thumb|right|''Ondatra zibethicus'', the [[muskrat]]]]
[[Muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethicus''), a rodent native to [[North America]], has been known since the 17th century to secrete a glandular substance with a musky odor.&lt;ref name=Groom/&gt; A chemical means of extracting it was discovered in the 1940s, but it did not prove commercially worthwhile.&lt;ref name=Groom&gt;{{cite book | title = New Perfume Handbook | first = Nigel | last = Groom | pages = 219–220 | publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-7514-0403-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glandular substances with musk-like odors are also obtained from the [[musk duck]] (''Biziura lobata'') of southern [[Australia]], the [[muskox]], the [[musk shrew]], the [[musk beetle]] (''Aromia moschata''), the [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta''), the [[Sternotherus odoratus|musk turtle]] (''Sternotherus odoratus''), the [[American alligator]] of [[North America]],  lynx musk, ''lungurion'' which, in antiquity, was highly valued, and from several other animals.

In [[crocodile]]s, there are two pairs of musk glands, one pair situated at the corner of the jaw and the other pair in the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Herpetological and Related Terminology | first = D.C. |last = Wareham | publisher = [[Elsevier Science]] | year = 2005 | isbn =0-444-51863-0 | pages = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk glands are also found in snakes.

===Plants===
{{NIE Poster|Musk Plant}}
Some plants such as ''[[Angelica archangelica]]'' or ''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'' produce musky-smelling macrocyclic lactone compounds. These compounds are widely used in perfumery as substitutes for animal musk or to alter the smell of a mixture of other musks.

The plant sources include the musk flower (''[[Mimulus moschatus]]'') of western North America, the muskwood (''[[Olearia argophylla]]'') of Australia, and the musk seeds (''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'') from India.

==Artificial compounds==
{{main|Synthetic musk}}
[[File:Galaxolide 200.svg|thumb|[[Galaxolide]], a polycyclic musk commonly found in [[laundry detergent]]s to mask the smell of the detergent chemicals]]
Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the [[Endangered species|endangered animal]], nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called "white musk". They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musks, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk compounds.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; The first two groups have broad uses in industry ranging from [[cosmetics]] to [[detergent]]s. However, the detection of the first two chemical groups in human and environmental samples as well as their carcinogenic properties initiated a public debate on the use of these compounds and a ban or reduction of their use in many regions of the world. Macrocyclic musk compounds are expected to replace them since these compounds appear to be safer.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt;

==Other uses==

Musk has been used to attract wild animals, including in man-made perfume mixtures. For example, in 2018 Indian authorities used the perfume ''Obsession'' by [[Calvin Klein]] to attract and thus trap a wild tiger that had attacked and killed more than a dozen humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Calvin Klein's Obsession Could Be The Trick To Catching A Tiger |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/14/657238908/calvin-kleins-obsession-could-be-the-trick-to-catching-a-tiger |website=NPR |date=14 October 2018 |access-date=18 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; however it has one key difference — a NUVO is not affiliated with a specific carrier. 
NUVO’s use real [[telephone numbers]], and through these they combine with all other commercial operators, allowing NUVO users to communicate with anyone — not just other people who use an [[mobile App]], for example. 

By assigning telephone numbers to their users, NUVO’s can transmit [[text messages]] and [[voice call]] to anyone who has a telephone number. &lt;ref name=iptvvnodefinition3&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

This allows an app user to communicate with anyone simply by dialing their phone number, rather than limiting their communications to just other app users, as most [[over the top content]]  ('''OTT''') apps do.&lt;ref name=iptvvnodefinition4&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7457">The '''Open Location Code''' ('''OLC''') is a [[geocoding|geocode]] system for identifying an area anywhere on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plus.codes|title=Plus codes|website=Plus.codes|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was developed at [[Google]]'s Zürich engineering office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlocationcode.com/|title=Open Location Code|website=Openlocationcode.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released late October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://github.com/google/open-location-code/commits/master Open Location Code Github] and [https://groups.google.com/d/forum/open-location-code Open Location Code forum].&lt;/ref&gt; Open Location Codes are also referred to as "'''plus codes'''".

Open Location Codes are a way of encoding location into a form that is easier to use than showing coordinates in the usual form of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]].  They are designed to be used like street addresses, and may be especially useful in places where there is no formal system to identify buildings, such as street names, [[House numbering|house numbers]], and post codes.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://openlocationcode.com/ Open Location Code website] provides an overview. The document [https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/master/docs/comparison.adoc "An Evaluation of Location Encoding Systems"] provides a rationale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open Location Codes are derived from latitude and longitude coordinates, so they already exist everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Specification: [https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/master/docs/olc_definition.adoc "Open Location Code: An Open Source Standard for Addresses, Independent of Building Numbers And Street Names"]&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar in length to a telephone number&amp;nbsp;– 849VCWC8+R9, for example&amp;nbsp;– but can often be shortened to only four or six digits when combined with a locality (CWC8+R9, Mountain View).  Locations close to each other have similar codes. They can be encoded or decoded offline. The character set avoids similar looking characters, to reduce confusion and errors, and avoids vowels to make it unlikely that a code spells existing words. The Open Location Code is not case-sensitive, and can therefore be easily exchanged over the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-opensource.blogspot.ch/2015/04/open-location-code-addresses-for.html|title=Open Location Code: Addresses for everything, everywhere|website=Google-opensource.blogspot.ch|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specification==
The Open Location Code system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/master/docs/olc_definition.adoc|title=google/open-location-code|website=GitHub|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on latitudes and longitudes in [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84]] coordinates. Each code describes an area bounded by two parallels and two meridians out of a fixed grid, identified by the South-West corner and its size. The largest grid has blocks of 20 by 20 degrees (9 rows and 18 columns), and is divided in 20 by 20 subblocks up to four times. From that level onwards division is in 5 by 4 subblocks. The table shows the various block sizes at their maximum near the equator. The block width decreases with distance from the equator.

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align: left" | Code length 
| 2 || 4 || 6 || 8 || + || 10 || 11
|-
! style="text-align: left" | Block size
| 20&amp;deg; || 1&amp;deg; || 0.05&amp;deg; (3′) || 0.0025&amp;deg; (9″) || || 0.000125&amp;deg; (0.45″) || 
|-
! style="text-align: left" | Approximately
| 2200 km || 110 km || 5.5 km || 275 m || || 14 m || 3.5 m
|}

The full grid uses offsets from the [[South Pole]] (–90&amp;deg;) and the [[antimeridian]] (–180&amp;deg;) expressed in [[base 20]] representation. To avoid misreading or spelling objectionable words, the encoding excludes vowels and symbols that may be easily confused with each other. The following table shows the mapping.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="text-align: left" | Base 20 digit
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19
|-
! style="text-align: left" | Code digit
| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || C || F || G || H || J || M || P || Q || R || V || W || X
|}

The code begins with up to five pairs of digits, each consisting of one digit representing latitude and one representing longitude. The biggest blocks have just two digits. After 8 digits, a plus sign "+" is inserted in the code as a delimeter to aid with visual parsing. After 10 digits at each subdivision, subblocks are coded in a single code digit as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!  || colspan="4" | longitude &amp;rarr;
|-
! rowspan="6" {{verth|latitude &amp;rarr;|va=top}}
| R || V || W || X
|-
| J || M || P || Q
|-
| C || F || G || H
|-
| 6 || 7 || 8 || 9
|-
| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5
|}

==Example==
Consider for example zooming in on the [[Merlion Park|Merlion in Singapore]] (N 1.286785, E 103.854503). It lies in the block around the equator bounded by –10&amp;deg; and +10&amp;deg; and between 100&amp;deg; and 120&amp;deg; East. It has offsets 80&amp;deg; from the South Pole and 280&amp;deg; from the anti-meridian, or 4 and 14 as first base-20 digit, coded as 6 and P. Thus the code is 6P. This may be padded as [http://plus.codes/6P000000+ 6P000000+]

Now refine this block to a subblock between 1&amp;deg; and 2&amp;deg; N and 103&amp;deg; and 104&amp;deg; E. This adds 11&amp;deg; and 3&amp;deg; to the SW corner. So the base-20 coordinate codes added are H and 5. The result is padded to [http://plus.codes/6PH50000+ 6PH50000+].

After 4 refinements one lands on Merlion park as  [http://plus.codes/6PH57VP3+PR 6PH57VP3+PR].

The next step requires us to divide the square so far used to refine the position into a 4 by 5 grid and finding the cell the coordinates are pointing to. This is the cell named 6. The resulting Open Location Code is [http://plus.codes/6PH57VP3+PR6 6PH57VP3+PR6].

==Usage==

When using the code in conjunction with Google Maps, it is common to omit the first 4 digits from the code and add a rough location, like a city, state or country. The above example then becomes [http://plus.codes/7VP3+PRJ%20singapore 7VP3+PRJ Singapore].

'''Phryctoria''' ({{lang-el|φρυκτωρία}}) was a means of [[communication]] used in [[Ancient Greece]].

==Details==
''Phryctoriae'' were towers build on selected mountaintops so that one tower (phryctoriae) would be visible to the next tower (usually 20 miles away). The towers were used for the transmission of a specific prearranged message. Flames were lit on one tower and then the next tower in succession also lit flames.

[[Aeschylus]] in the tragedy "Agamemnon" describe how the message for the fall of [[Troy]] arrived at [[Mycenae]] with phryctoriae.

==Phryctoriae and Pyrseia==

[[File:Pyrseia table.png|right|thumb|Pyrseia table.]]

Ιn the [[2nd century BC]] the [[Greeks|Greek]] engineers from [[Alexandria]], Cleoxenes ({{lang-el|Κλεόξενος}}) and Democletus ({{lang-el|Δημόκλειτος}}) invented the pyrseia ({{lang-el|πυρσεία}}). 
The letters of the [[Greek alphabet]] were listed on a table. Each letter corresponded to a row and a column on the table. By using two groups of torches (five torches in every group), the left indicating the row and the right the column of the table, they could send a message by defining a specific letter  through combination of light torches.

The coding system was as follows:

α	β	γ	δ	ε&lt;br&gt;
ζ	η	θ	ι	κ&lt;br&gt;
λ	μ	ν	ξ	ο&lt;br&gt;
π	ρ	σ	τ	υ&lt;br&gt;
φ	χ	ψ	ω	

When they wanted to send the letter ''o'' ([[omicron]]), they opened five torches on the right set and three torches on the left set.

Later [[Polybius]] used the same system in his [[Polybius square]].

[[Image:Assorted cranks.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A variety of plug lures.]]
'''Plugs''' are a popular type of hard-bodied [[fishing lure]].  They are widely known by a number of other names depending on the country and region.  Such names include '''crankbait''', '''wobbler''', '''minnow''', '''shallow-diver''' and '''deep-diver'''.  The term '''minnow''' is usually used for long, slender, lures that imitate  baitfish, while the term '''plug''' is usually used for shorter, deeper-bodied lures which imitate deeper-bodied fish, frogs and other prey.  '''Shallow-diver''' and '''deep-diver''' refer to the diving capabilities of the lure, which depends on the size and angle of the lip, and lure buoyancy.

==History==
The concept of an attractant tied to the end of a line to entice fish goes back to prehistoric peoples, but the modern concept of the plug lure is attributed to James [[Heddon]], a beekeeper from [[Dowagiac, Michigan]], who was whittling a piece of wood one day in the late 19th [[century]] while relaxing alongside a millpond.  When he rose to leave, he tossed the carved scrap of wood into the pond, and a large bass struck at it as it wobbled down through the water.  Intrigued by this, Heddon began experimenting and perfected a design he dubbed the "Lucky 13" — a plug that is still sold today.  By the early 20th century, many companies were in the business of designing and selling plug lures.

==Construction==
The construction of typical plug is:
*A solid or hollow body made out of a light weight material such as [[balsa]] or [[plastic]], sometimes separated into two pieces joined by a small flexible link to enhance the impression of a fish whipping its [[fin|tail fin]].
*A thin sheet metal or plastic lip attached to the front of the body, sometimes adjustable to change the diving ability and wobbling movements of the lure.
*Two, or occasionally three, [[Fish hook|treble hook]]s.
*An [[grommet | eyelet]] for attaching the fishing line.
*Generally, a painted or imprinted color and/or design, to make the plug appear as close as possible to a natural food of the aquatic environment. However, some very effective plugs occasionally have a design or color unlike anything seen in such an environment.

==Action==
Classic plugs float on the surface or suspend in the water, but will dive under the surface of the water and swim with a side-to-side wobbling movement (hence the alternative name ''wobbler'') upon retrieval, which usually consists of slow to medium fast reel in. This makes the bait seen like a real fish which attracts predatory fish such as [[bass (fish) | bass]] and [[northern pike | pike]]. Plastic plugs can dive to either a very shallow depth, due to a small lip, or to a moderately deep depth (i.e. several meters), due to a large lip. The angle of the bib also affects diving depth. Sometimes, plugs are named after their diving ability, e.g. "''deep-diver''" or "''shallow-diver''".  Plugs can also be designed to hover (neutral buoyancy), sink slowly, or sink rapidly.  Some have a small metal ball inside to "rattle" when retrieved. 

Other [[ fishing lures | lures]] are sometimes generically called plugs or wobblers.  They come in all different shapes and sizes. These plugs are usually made by small companies and cost around twenty dollars. Each plug has its own action or has none unless you give it one. Wood plugs usually range from between 3/4 oz. and 4 oz. The different plugs come in a few basic categories. There are surface swimmers, subsurface swimmers, needlefish, [[fishing popper|poppers]], pencil poppers, and darters. they all have their own specific place and time to be fished.

==Size==
Plugs range in size from around an inch (~3 cm) to around 8 inches (~20 cm).  Plugs in the 2–3 inch (~5–7 cm) size range are most commonly used however.  As a general rule large plugs are used for large fish, and small plugs for small fish. Fishermen [[casting]] for very small fish such as [[crappie]] will use very small plugs, and anglers fishing for large fish such [[muskellunge]] or [[Murray cod]] will use extremely large plugs. But trophy-sized fish are occasionally caught on very small plugs, and fingerling [[perch]] will sometimes strike — and hook themselves — on a plug as big as they are themselves. Plug fishing is more common in freshwater fishing than saltwater fishing, but it is growing greatly upon East-Coast striper fishermen.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Fishing technique==
Most plugs have their "action" built into them by design, but good fishermen give nuance to the plug's action in many ways, such as varying the speed of the retrieve, occasionally "twitching" the rod tip during retrieve, or even letting the plug stop completely in the water, then resuming retrieve at a very high speed.  Plugs are often cast so they land next to places where fish may be hiding, such as a [[snag (ecology)|snag]] pile or an overhanging tree and worked back enticingly.  A skilled fisherman can methodically explore many possible hiding places for fish by continually casting and retrieving a plug.

Theoretically, any plug design will catch fish (most anglers use them to catch bass) — fish will, out of anger, hunger, territorial protection or simple curiosity, occasionally strike at any small object moving or falling through the water.  But some plugs have become famous for their high degree of effectiveness in the hands of a good fisherman, while others come and go from the market quickly when found to have limited success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1464">The '''screenless hammer mill''', like regular [[hammer mill]]s, is used to pound grain. However, rather than a screen, it uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones. 

Conventional hammer mills in poor and remote areas, such as many parts of Africa, suffer from the problem that screens break easily, and cannot be easily bought, made or repaired. Thus regular hammer mills break down and fall into disuse. The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus more reliable. 

The screenless hammer mill is claimed to be 25% cheaper &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060101161727/http://web.media.mit.edu/~nitin/thinkcycle/notes/dtm_feb20.html Design That Matters: Notes, 2001-02-20] - saved by archive.org&lt;/ref&gt; and much more energy efficient than regular hammer mills, as well as more reliable. 

It was designed by [[Amy B. Smith|Amy Smith]] of [[MIT]].

This effect is ascribed to '''spin canting''', a phenomenon through which spins are tilted by a small angle about their axis rather than being exactly co-parallel. 
[[File:Dzyloshinskii Moriya antisymmetric exchange.jpg|thumb|right|Antisymmetric exchange would align spins perpendicular to each other]]
Spin canting is due to two factors contrasting each other: [[isotropic exchange]] would align the spins exactly antiparallel, while [[antisymmetric exchange]] arising from relativistic effects ([[spin-orbit coupling]]) would align the spins at 90° to each other. The net result is a small perturbation, the extent of which depends on the relative strength of these effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Richard Winpenny|title=Molecular Cluster Magnets|publisher=World Scientific|year=2011|isbn=9789814322942|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">The '''Symphony of Fire''' is an annual multi-day fireworks exhibition and friendly international competition held around the world. The fireworks are choreographed to music. They continue  to be presented at [[Victoria &amp; Alfred waterfront]] in [[Cape Town]].

It was presented at [[English Bay, Vancouver|English Bay]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and at the [[Lake Ontario]] waterfront of the [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] theme park in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] until 2000, when these presentations were forced to seek new sponsors and, thus, the exhibition changed names.

==History==
The event had been previously sponsored by [[British American Tobacco]] (with the branding ''[[Benson &amp; Hedges]] Symphony of Fire''), but once tobacco advertising restrictions were legislated by the Canadian federal government in 2000, there were fears that the event would fail to receive sufficient funding to continue operations.

The Vancouver event, with various sponsors, has been re-branded as the ''[[Celebration of Light]]''.

British American Tobacco informed [[Ontario Place Corporation]], the hosts of the Toronto exhibition, that they could continue holding the annual event, but under a different name, as the ''Symphony of Fire'' trademark vested with Benson and Hedges. The Toronto event has since been renamed ''the Canada Dry [[Festival of Fire]]''.

In South Africa, the event is still marketed under the name ''Symphony of Fire'' and is sponsored by a local radio station.

The Cape Town events took place in 2000 and March 2006. Spain, Canada and South Africa took part in the 2006 event with South Africa winning on the 8 April.

Standard [[inverter]]s are very low [[inertia]] elements.

[[Hydro-Québec]] began requiring synthetic inertia in 2005 as the first grid operator. To counter [[Ancillary services (electric power)#Frequency Control|frequency drop]], the grid operator demands a temporary 6% power boost by combining the power electronics with the [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]] of a [[Wind turbine design#Blades|wind turbine rotor]].&lt;ref name=Fairley&gt;{{cite web|url= http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/can-synthetic-inertia-stabilize-power-grids |title=Can Synthetic Inertia from Wind Power Stabilize Grids?|publisher=IEEE |first=Peter |last=Fairley |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar requirements came into effect in Europe in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.entsoe.eu/major-projects/network-code-development/requirements-for-generators/Pages/default.aspx |title=Network Code on Requirements for Grid Connection Applicable to all Generators (RfG)|publisher=[[ENTSO-E]] |date=April 2016|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://elforsk.se/Rapporter/?rid=13_02_ |title=The utilization of synthetic inertia from wind farms and its impact on existing speed governors and system performance|publisher=ELFORSK |date=2013 |accessdate=18 April 2017|page=6 (Summary) |quote=Installing wind turbines with synthetic inertia is a way of preventing this deterioration. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synchronverter Model==
[[File:Synchronverter power part.png|300px|thumb|Figure 2. Power part of a synchronverter]]
[[File:Synchronverter grid.png|300px|thumb|Figure 3. The per-phase model of an SG connected to an infinite bus]]
Synchronverter structure can be divided into two parts: power part (see figure 2) and electronic part. The power part is energy transform and transfer path, including the bridge, filter circuit, power line, etc. The electronic part refers to measuring and control units, including sensors and [[digital signal processor|DSP]].

The important point in modeling synchronverter is to be sure that it has similar dynamic behavior to Synchronous generator (see figure 3). This model is classified into 2-order up to 7-order model, due to its complexity. However, 3-order model is widely used because of proper compromise between accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="imp"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Chang-Hua |last2=Qing-Chang|first2=Zhong |last3=Jin-Song|first3=Meng |last4=Xin|first4=Chen |title=An Improved Synchronverter Model and its Dynamic Behaviour Comparison with Synchronous Generator}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{q} = \omega ( E_{q}+x_{d}.i_{d} )+i_{q} .R_{s}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{d} = \omega ( E_{d}+x_{q}.i_{q} )+i_{d} .R_{s}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_{d}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{q}&lt;/math&gt; are [[dq-axes]] components of terminal voltage.

While synchronverter terminal voltage and current satisfy these equations, synchronverter can be looked as Synchronous generator. This make it possible to replace it by a synchronous generator model and solve the problems easily.

==Control strategy==
[[File:Synchronverter control.png|300px|thumb|Figure 4. Typical control structures for a grid-connected power inverter.(a) When controlled as a voltage supply.(b) When controlled as a current supply.]]
As shown in the figure 3, when the inverter is controlled as a voltage source, it consists of a synchronization unit to [[synchronize]] with the grid and a power loop to regulate the real power and reactive power exchanged with the grid. The synchronization unit often needs to provide frequency and amplitude.&lt;ref&gt;S. Shinnaka, “A novel fast-tracking D-Estimation method for single-phase signals,” IEEE Trans. Power Electron., vol. 26, no. 4, pp. 1081–1088, Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; But when inverter is controlled as a current source, the synchronization unit is often required to provide the phase of the grid only, so it is much more easier to control it as a current source.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kazmierkowski and L. Malesani, “Current control techniques for threephase voltage-source PWM converters: A survey,” IEEE Trans. Ind. Electron., vol. 45, no. 5, pp. 691–703, Oct. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Synchronverter compact control.png|300px|thumb|Figure 5. Compact control structure for a grid-connected inverter.]]
Since a synchronous is inherently able to synchronize with the grid, it is possible to integrate the synchronization function into the power controller without synchronization unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Qing-Chang|title=Self-Synchronized Synchronverters: Inverters Without a Dedicated Synchronization Unit|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics|date=2014|volume=29|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a compact control unit, as shown in the figure 4.

==Applications==
===PV===
[[File:Synchronverter PV.png|300px|thumb|Figure 6. Power part of three-phase synchronverter.]]
As mentioned before, synchronverters can be treated like synchronous generator, which make it easier to control the source, so it should be widely used in [[Photovoltaics|PV]] primary energy sources (PES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|last2=Brandao |title=Single-phase Synchronverter for Residential PV Power Systems|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synchronverter also is suggested to be used in microgrids because DC sources can be coordinated together with the frequency of the ac voltage, without any communication network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peyghami|first1=Saeed|last2=Davari|first2=Pooya|last3=Mokhtari|first3=Hossein|last4=Chiang Loh|first4=Poh|title=Synchronverter-Enabled DC Power Sharing Approach for LVDC Microgrids|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal energy battery''' is a physical structure used for the purpose of storing and releasing [[heat|thermal energy]]—see also [[thermal energy storage]].  Such a thermal battery (a.k.a. TBat) allows energy available at one time to be temporarily stored and then released at another time.  The basic principles involved in a thermal battery occur at the atomic level of matter, with [[energy]] being added to or taken from either a solid mass or a liquid volume which causes the substance's [[temperature]] to change.  Some thermal batteries also involve causing a substance to transition thermally through a [[phase transition]] which causes even more energy to be stored and released due to the delta [[heat of fusion|enthalpy of fusion]] or delta [[heat of vaporization|enthalpy of vaporization]].

== History of thermal batteries ==

Thermal batteries are very common, and include such familiar items as a [[hot water bottle]].  Early examples of thermal batteries include stone and mud cook stoves, rocks placed in fires, and kilns.  While stoves and kilns are ovens, they are also thermal storage systems that depend on heat being retained for an extended period of time.  [[Earthship|Earthships]] rely on heat from the Sun to charge insulated thermal batteries, securing stable temperatures and comfort in any climate without utility bills.  This reduces nuclear and coal power dependence and infrastructure and provides a sustainable "HVAC" technology for future generations.

== Types of thermal batteries ==

Thermal batteries generally fall into 3 categories:

*Encapsulated thermal batteries
*Phase change thermal batteries
*Other thermal batteries

These 3 types of batteries are each unique in their form and application, although fundamentally all are for the storage and retrieval of thermal energy.  They also differ in method and density of heat storage.  A description of each type of thermal battery follows.

=== Phase change thermal battery ===

Phase change materials used for thermal storage are capable of storing and releasing significant thermal capacity at the temperature that they change phase.  These materials are chosen based on specific applications because there is a wide range of temperatures that may be useful in different applications and a wide range of materials that change phase at different temperatures.  These materials include salts and waxes that are specifically engineered for the applications they serve.  In addition to manufactured materials, water is a phase change material.  The latent heat of water is 334 joules/gram.  The phase change of water occurs at 0°C (32°F).

Some applications use the thermal capacity of water or ice as cold storage; others use it as heat storage.  It can serve either application; ice can be melted to store heat then refrozen to warm an environment which is below freezing (putting liquid water at 0°C in such an environment warms it much more than the same mass of ice at the same temperature, because the latent heat of freezing is extracted from it, which is why the phase change is relevant), or water can be frozen to "store cold" then melted to make an environment above freezing colder (and again, a given mass of ice at 0°C will provide more cooling than the same mass of water at the same temperature).

The advantage of using a phase change in this way is that a given mass of material can absorb a large quantity of energy without its temperature changing. Hence a thermal battery that uses a phase change can be made lighter, or more energy can be put into it without raising the internal temperature unacceptably.

=== Encapsulated thermal battery ===

An encapsulated thermal battery is physically similar to a phase change thermal battery in that it is a confined amount of physical material which is thermally heated or cooled to store or extract energy.  However, in a non-phase change encapsulated thermal battery the temperature of the substance is changed without inducing a phase change.  Since a phase change is not needed many more materials are available for use in an encapsulated thermal battery.

One of the key properties of an encapsulated thermal battery is its [[volumetric heat capacity]] (VHC), also termed volume-specific [[heat capacity]].  Typical substances used for these thermal batteries include water, concrete, and wet sand.

An example of an encapsulated thermal battery is a residential water heater with a storage tank.&lt;ref name=WP1&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/02/24/the-secret-power-of-your-most-boring-home-appliance/ Your home water heater may soon double as a battery, Washington Post, February 24, 2016, By Chris Mooney]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nreca.coop/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Hidden-Battery-01-25-2016.pdf The Hidden Battery: Opportunities in Electric Water Heating, The Brattle Group, Prepared for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), January 2016, by Ryan Hledik, Judy Chang, Roger Lueken]&lt;/ref&gt;  This thermal battery is usually slowly charged over a period of about 30–60 minutes for rapid use when needed (e.g., 10–15 minutes).  Many utilities, understanding the "thermal battery" nature of water heaters, have begun using them to absorb excess renewable energy power when available for later use by the homeowner.  According to the above cited article,&lt;ref name=WP1 /&gt; "net savings to the electricity system as a whole could be $200 per year per heater – some of which may be passed on to its owner".

===Other thermal batteries===

There are some other items that have historically been termed "thermal batteries".  In this group is the [[molten salt battery]] which is a device for generating electricity.  Other examples include the heat packs that skiers use for keeping hands and feet warm (see [[hand warmer]]).  These are a chemical battery which when activated (with air in this case) will produce heat.  Other related chemical thermal batteries exist for producing cold (see [[instant cold pack]]) generally used for [[sport injuries]].

The one common principle of these other thermal batteries is that the reaction involved is generally not reversible.  Thus, these batteries are not used for storing and retrieving heat energy.

The '''Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel''', located at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in [[Moffett Federal Airfield]], [[Mountain View, California]], United States, is a research facility used extensively to design and test new generations of [[aircraft]], both [[airliner|commercial]] and [[military aircraft|military]], as well as [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] space vehicles, including the [[Space Shuttle]]. The facility was completed in 1955 and is one of five facilities created after the 1949 [[Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act]] supporting aeronautics research.

==Background==

After the construction of the [[Variable Density Tunnel]] at [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]] in 1921,&lt;ref name="unitary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/santaclara/uni.htm | title=Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel | work=California's Historic Silicon Valley | publisher=[[National Park Service]] | accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] built a variety of technical research facilities upon which the American aircraft industry was based. These facilities enabled the American aircraft industry to dominate the skies in both commercial and military aviation. By 1945, America's lead in the field of aviation seemed to be evaporating. The technological achievements of the German [[missile]]s and [[jet aircraft]] indicated a lag in American aeronautical research. 
   
In 1949, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Unitary Wind Tunnel Plan Act]], under which the [[Federal Government of the United States|Federal government]] coordinated a national plan of facility construction encompassing NACA, as well as the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], private industry, and universities. The Unitary Plan resulted in the construction of a new series of wind tunnel complexes to support the American aircraft industry, including the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex.

==Construction==
[[File:Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel.JPG|thumb|Portion of the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel in 2014]]
Construction of this facility began in 1950-1951 and continued until 1955. Because no one wind tunnel could meet all the demands for additional research facilities simulating the entire range of aircraft and missile flight, NACA chose to build the Ames tunnel with three separate test sections drawing power from a common centralized power plant. The [[Subsonic and transonic wind tunnel|transonic]] test section spanned 11 by 11 feet (3.3 x 3.3 m), while the two [[supersonic wind tunnel|supersonic]] sections were smaller: nine by seven feet (2.7 x 2.1 m) and eight by seven feet (2.4 x 2.1 m). Giant valves 20 feet (6 m) in diameter supplied air from one supersonic leg to another. 
   
The American West Coast aircraft industry quickly capitalized on the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex. The famed [[Boeing]] fleet of commercial transports and the [[Douglas DC-8]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]], and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] were all tested here; as well as military aircraft such as the [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] fighter, the [[C-5A Galaxy]] transport and the [[B-1 Lancer]] bomber. In addition to aircraft, in the 1960s and 1970s almost all NASA manned space vehicles including the Space Shuttle were tested in the Ames Unitary Plan Wind tunnel complex.

The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel has three closed-loop wind tunnels, each with its own model test section, but all sharing the same powerful electric motors (100,000 horsepower, 75,000 kilowatts) driving their compressors to propel the air within them. Because of this shared layout, only one UPWT test section can be used at a time. The three wind tunnels that are part of this system are:
* 11-by 11-foot Transonic Test Section.  A closed-return, variable-density tunnel with a fixed-geometry, ventilated test section with a flexible wall nozzle with a Mach range of 0.20 to 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/pdf-files/Western_Hemisphere_Wind_Tunnels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9-by 7-foot Supersonic Test Section.  A closed circuit, single return, variable density, continuous flow wind tunnel with a Mach range of 1.55 to 2.55.
* 8-by 7-foot Supersonic Test Section. A closed circuit, single return, variable density, continuous flow wind tunnel

The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel / Unitary Plan Facility|url={{NHLS url|id=85002799}} |date=May 15, 1984 |author=Harry A.

The major element of the tunnel complex is its drive system, consisting of four intercoupled electric motors. The transonic wind tunnel is a closed-return, variable density tunnel with a fixed geometry, ventilated throat, and a single-jack flexible [[De Laval nozzle|nozzle]]. Airflow is produced by a three-stage, axial-flow compressor powered by four-wound-rotor, variable-speed induction motors. For conventional steady-state tests, models are generally supported on a string. A [[Schlieren photography|Schlieren]] system, one that allows regions of varying [[refraction]] in a transparent medium caused by [[pressure]] or [[temperature]] differences and detectable by photographing the passage of a beam of light, is available for studying flow patterns, either by direct viewing or by photographs.

The details of the larger supersonic tunnel are much the same, except that it is equipped with an asymmetric, sliding-block nozzle and the airflow is produced by an 11-stage, axial-flow compressor powered by four variable-speed, wound-rotor, induction motors. The smaller supersonic tunnel is a closed-return, variable-density tunnel equipped with a symmetrical, flexible-wall throat and the sidewalls are positioned by a series of jacks operated by hydraulic motors.
