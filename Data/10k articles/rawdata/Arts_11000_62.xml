'''Anne Hull Grundy''' (née Ullmann, 1926 – 1984) was a German-born British art collector and philanthropist. Her 1978 bequest to the [[British Museum]] comprised some of the finest [[netsuke]] and European decorative arts received by that museum.&lt;ref name=burlington/&gt;

==Early life==
Anne Ullmann was born in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]] in 1926 in a Jewish banking family. Forced to emigrate following the advent of the Nazis, her family settled in Northampton. Her father's company Mettoy became famous for its metal toys, including the [[Corgi Toys|Corgi line]] of cars.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The British Museum Magazine|issue=86|year=2016|title=Gifts from the past|author=Nicole Rousmaniere|publisher=[[British Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
She has family wealth as well as income from the Keyser-Ullmann bank and this enabled Ulmann to collect art from the age of 11, especially ivory, ceramics, metalwork and jewellery.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref name=fitz/&gt;

She married John Hull Grundy, an entomologist and artist, in 1949. Shortly thereafter, she was debilitated by a chronic respiratory illness. Her purchases of fine art continued, with trusted dealers bringing the works to her sickbed. In many cases, she bought works via mail.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

Her focus of collection became European jewellery and Japanese ivory.&lt;ref name=fitz&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=10 December 2016|publisher=[[Fitzwilliam Museum]]|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/hiddenhistories/biographies/bio/love/hullgrundy_biography.html|title=Anne Hull Grundy (1926-1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1976 catalogue of an exhibition of decorative arts at the British Museum (''Jewellery through 7000 years'') made Grundy realise that the museum's collection ended in the 1700s. She resolved to update their holdings by acquiring 18th and 19th century objects.&lt;ref name="Smith2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rupert Smith|title=The Museum: Behind the Scenes at the British Museum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pSQ42BTQYQC&amp;pg=PA114|year=2007|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-53913-1|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, she donated a large part of her collection to the British Museum. This possibly comprised the best of her collections as she had separately donated fine pieces to other museums in the UK, including the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge, Manchester and Glasgow. Some of the major pieces included a 1559 silver roundel by [[Lambert Suavius]] commemorating the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambresis]], and silver portrait medallions of [[Elizabeth I]] and James I by [[Simon de Passe]]. There were also cameos by Italian masters, [[Benedetto Pistrucci|Pistrucci]], Berini and Girometti.&lt;ref name=burlington&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=121|number=912|jstor=879524|title=The Jeweller's Art: The Hull Grundy Gift|author=Shirley Bury|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of her donation stemmed from the good documentation of the art works, especially those from European and American engravers and designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html |author=Marjorie Caygill |title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum |date=January 2008 |publisher=British Museum |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730002432/http://fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html |archivedate=2012-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From her Japanese collections were ''[[Okimono|jizai okimono]]'', articulated iron animals, as well as netsuke.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

Another recipient of Grundy's gift was the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] in Glasgow, which obtained nearly a thousand pieces of jewellery tracing the history of European jewellery over a period of two centuries. This included an Italian miniature [[Aladdin's lamp]] brooch from 1860 and English fuchsia gold and ivory drop earrings from 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Herald|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12731085.Gems_in_Scotland_apos_s_cultural_heritage/|title=Gems in Scotland's cultural heritage|date=3 July 1993|accessdate=10 December 2016|author=Deedee Cuddihy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Grundy wrote articles on the decorative arts both for the specialist and the popular press. Between 1958-1961, she contributed a 'collectors' column for ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite journal|title=Knowledge, Money and Time: Anne Hull Grundy as a Collector of Victorian Jewellery|journal=The Journal of the Decorative Arts Society|number=24|pages=80–97|author1=Charlotte Gere|author2=Judy Rudoe|jstor=41809299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundy's husband died in 1984. She died the same year.&lt;ref name=fitz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">The '''Association for Research into Crimes against Art''' ('''ARCA''') is a research and outreach organization that works to promote research and the study of art crime and cultural heritage protection. ARCA aims to bridge the gap between the practical and theoretical by fostering collaboration between foreign and domestic law enforcement officials, security consultants, academics, lawyers, archaeologists, insurance specialists, criminologists, art historians, conservators, and others. Their goal is to raise public awareness about art related crime and to better preserve the world's collective cultural heritage.

At the grassroots level, ARCA objective is to identify emerging and under-examined trends related to the study of art crime and to develop strategies to advocate for the responsible stewardship of our collective artistic and archaeological heritage. ARCA advances this mission through educational programming, research, publications and public outreach at the national and international level to foster an exchange of knowledge in the field.

As part of this work, ARCA sponsors a [[Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection]] which is held from June to August every year in Italy.  It also publishes the ''Journal of Art Crime'', and hosts an annual academic conference on [http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/interdisciplinary-art-crime-conference/ art crime and cultural heritage at risk.]

Dan Brown mentions ARCA and their blog in his novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' (2013).  In chapter 72, Robert Langdon uses the ARCA website to check the history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, and is startled by the passage:

"''The decorative collars were added to the horses' necks in 1204 by the Venetians to conceal where the heads had been severed to facilitate their transportation by ship from Constantinople to Venice.''"&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dan.  "Inferno."  Bantam: 2013.  Pg 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage is taken from a series of [http://art-crime.blogspot.it/2011/06/judge-arthur-tompkins-on-four-horses-of.html four articles] discussing the long and tumultuous history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, the art work with the longest history of crimes against it, written by Judge Arthur Tompkins.  Judge Tompkins is an ARCA trustee and faculty member, who teaches a course on Art Crimes in War as part of ARCA's Postgraduate Certificate Program and includes detailed discussion of the Four Horses as part of his course.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5168">[[File:Athens biennale logo.png|thumb|Athens biennale logo]]
Athens Biennale is one of the largest [[contemporary art]] exhibitions held every two years in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is organised by the Athens Biennale Non-Profit Organization, which was founded in November 2005 by Xenia Kalpaktsoglou, Poka-Yio, and Augustine Zenakos.

Athens Biennale functions within an international network of large-scale periodic contemporary art events. It emerged from the intense cultural activity that makes Athens one of the most interesting places for contemporary art, and it aims to be an agent of constant change and innovation, provide a context for creativity and dialogue and constitute a wide platform for the designation and the critical engagement of local artistic production, as well as a forum for discussion and exchange with the international scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://athensbiennale.org/en/|title=Athens Biennale|website=athensbiennale.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has presented so far five editions: "Destroy Athens" (2007), "Heaven" (2009), "Monodrome" (2011), "Agora" (2013), "Omonoia" (June 2015-February 2017), as well as the prelude of AB6 "Waiting for the Barbarians" (April 2017). AB launches its 6th edition, under the title ANTI, on October 26, 2018, curated by Stefanie Hessler/ Kostis Stafylakis/ Poka-Yio.

Athens Biennale is internationally acknowledged and awarded (by the European Cultural Foundation) for its forward-looking and often controversial productions that challenge fixed notions of how contemporary art should be exhibited, what art interventions in the "public space" should be and how a major art production could be collectively co-created.

== History ==
The first Biennale, entitled ''Destroy Athens'' was held at Technopolis of Athens in 2007 and focused [[on avant-garde]] creations of contemporary art with participating artists from Greece and abroad.&lt;ref name="e-flux destroy"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/destroy-athens/ Destroy Athens], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second one, entitled ''HEAVEN'',  took place in June 2009, at former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] venues at Palaio Faliro with the participation of 120 international artists.&lt;ref name="e-flux heaven"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/heaven/ HEAVEN], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Athens Biennale, entitled ''MONODROME'', was curated by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]] along with Kalpaktsoglou and Poka-Yio at the building of Diplareios School Square Theatre, Athens.&lt;ref name="e-flux mono"&gt;[http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/3rd-athens-biennale-2011/ MONODROME], e-flux.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 4th Biennale ==
[[File:AthensBiennale AB4 AGORA Logo Web-200x135.png|thumb|4th Athens Biennale 2013 AGORA logo]]
The fourth Athens Biennale, entitled ''AGORA'', was held in the former [[Athens Stock Exchange]] building in [[Sofokleous Street]] between September 28 - December 1 2013 and it featured works by [[George Harvalias]], [[FYTA]], Theo Prodromidis and [[Hito Steyerl]] among others.&lt;ref name="agora press"&gt;[http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=a15ac04c853c529f20d5f4f92&amp;id=531528e23c&amp;e=%5BUNIQID AGORA], 4th Athens Biennale 2013 AGORA official press release &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Drake, Cathryn.

Retrieved 2017-05-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Athens Biennale was awarded the [[ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture]] for Agora's innovative collective curatorial approach that broke from a consumer-oriented model of exhibition-making. &lt;ref name="ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture Awarded To Athens Biennale (Greece)."&gt;[http://www.biennialfoundation.org/2015/03/ecf-princess-margriet-award-for-culture-awarded-to-athens-biennale-greece/], Biennale Foundation "ECF Princess Margriet Award For Culture Awarded To Athens Biennale (Greece)." &lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Their collaborative process in producing the exhibition reflects on the way a [[biennale]] operates. The 4th Athens Biennale (AB4) proposed AGORA as a place of exchange and interaction, and as an ideal setting for critique.&lt;ref name="NeMe.org"&gt;[http://news.neme.org/1597/4th-athens-biennale-2013 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA], NeMe.org.&lt;/ref&gt; AB4 was realized by a nameless and ephemeral group of artists, curators, theorists and practitioners in the creative industries.&lt;ref name="agora team"&gt;[http://athensbiennale.org/en/agora_en/ab4-team/ 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA curatorial team], 4th Athens Biennalle 2013 AGORA official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">[[Image:Beuys+Furlong 1985.jpg|right|thumb|Bill Furlong interviewing [[Joseph Beuys]] in 1985]]
'''''Audio Arts''''' was a British sound magazine published on [[audio cassettes]], documenting contemporary artistic activity via artist or curator interviews, sound performances or sound art by artists.

==History==
The project was launched in 1973 by [[Barry Barker]] and British sculptor William Furlong, born 1944 in Woking, Great Britain. From 1973 to 2006, Audio Arts published 25 volumes of 4 issues of the Audio Arts Cassettes (later releasing LPs and CDs as well). Furlong conducted all interviews until 1996, when Jean Wainwright took the baton as interviewer. Each interview starts with ''I am here with...'', stating artist's name and recording location. Interviewees include: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Anish Kapoor]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Hermann Nitsch]], [[Mario Merz]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Nam June Paik]], as well as an interview with [[WB Yeats]]' daughter and readings by Yeats himself (in Vol.1 Issue #4, 1974).

William Furlong was part of a generation of British artists of the 1960s-70s including [[Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Bruce McLean]] or [[Paul Richards (artist)|Paul Richards]] (whose Nice Style performance group was the first pose band) who were consciously moving from traditional art forms to conceptual art, performance, new media, cheap materials, in a dematerialized and process-oriented ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Information from Heidi Grundmann's essay featured in the ''See This Sound (Promises in Sound and Vision)'' catalogue published by Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther König, Köln, Germany, 2009. Catalogue supervised by Cosima Rainer, Stella Rollig, Dieter Daniels and Manuela Ammer.&lt;/ref&gt; Furlong is now a sound artist with sound installations exhibited in Lisbon (''Walls of Sound'', 1998), Bexhill on Sea, Sussex (''Anthem'', 2009), Genillard Gallery, London (''Possibility &amp; Impossibility of Fixing Meaning'', 2009).

With the acquisition of the Audio Arts archive by [[Tate]] in 2004 (itself a long-time subscriber to Audio Arts cassettes releases),
over 200 boxes of master tapes used to edit the magazine are now secured for future researchers. A selection was [http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/audioarts/ exhibited] at Tate Britain March–August 2007.

==The cassette medium==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AAcassette collection.jpg|right|thumb|Audio Arts cassettes display {{puic|AAcassette collection.jpg|2010 February 21}}]] --&gt;
Like other audio magazine publishers,&lt;ref&gt;Like [[Joseph Nechvatal]]'s [[Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine]] or [[Tina Pearson]]'s Musicworks cassettes&lt;/ref&gt; William Furlong took full advantage of the cassette medium as the most efficient way to spread his material the world over. The cassette was indeed the most pertinent medium for various reasons:
* easy copy on demand and cheap postage reduced production costs ;
* Furlong considered lengthy interviews as an equivalent to conceptual art and language-based art ;
* Furlong considered the cassette as an 'organic sculpture' in itself.

Some of the interviewees were themselves great defenders of the cassette medium, like [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Dieter Roth]]. In an interview with Ilari Valbonesi, Furlong says he considered the cassette medium as a radical form of communication back in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecopolis.org/embodying-sound-an-interview-with-bill-furlong-audio-arts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515194914/http://www.ecopolis.org/embodying-sound-an-interview-with-bill-furlong-audio-arts/ |archivedate=2008-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What he means by ''radical'' can be figured out from this Jean Wainwright recollection: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am reminded of [[Vito Acconci]]'s work ''Face Off'' (1973) where he listens attentively to his own-recorded voice on an audio tape player telling of extremely intimate moments in his life. When the confessional material becomes too highly charged for him he cries out over the taped voice, 'no don't tell this, don't reveal this,' his dramatic response to his conflicting drives between self-revelation and self-concealment."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.axisweb.org/dlFULL.aspx?ESSAYID=40/{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birmingham EBRI front.jpg|thumb|The front of the former Delicia Cinema, and later the Aston University Centre for the Arts. 12 Gosta Green, Birmingham, which Birmingham Arts Lab turned into the Triangle Arts Centre]]
The '''Birmingham Arts Laboratory''' or '''Arts Lab''' was an experimental [[arts centre]] and [[artist collective]] based in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] from 1968 to 1982 – an "arts and performance space dedicated to radical research into art and creativity".&lt;ref name="little-obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fox |title=Ted Little |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/ted-little-1116790.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Newspaper Publishing PLC |date=6 September 1999 |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loosely organised and biased towards the obscure and avant-garde, it was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1997 as "one of the emblematic institutions of the 1960s".&lt;ref name="barker-obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Hutchinson |title=Edward Barker: Lines from the underground |url= http://www.arsydd.btinternet.co.uk/edobituary.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=19 April 1997 |accessdate=21 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070814062218/http://www.arsydd.btinternet.co.uk/edobituary.html |archivedate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab was originally based in a run-down youth centre run by The Birmingham Settlement on Tower Street in [[Newtown, Birmingham|Newtown]] on the northern edge of [[Birmingham City Centre]], and was accessible from the street only via a metal fire escape. It moved to a former brewery on Holt Street in [[Gosta Green]] in 1977, before financial problems and pressure from the arts establishment forced it to amalgamate with and take over [[Aston University]]'s Centre for the Arts on Gosta Green to form the more conventional '''Triangle Arts Centre''' in 1982.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grimley |first=Terry |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |place=Birmingham |publisher=[[Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery]] |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Introduction |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Birmingham Arts Lab had a wide influence across numerous art forms. Figures involved with the Arts Lab, often early in their careers, included cartoonists [[Hunt Emerson]], [[Edward Barker (cartoonist)|Edward Barker]], [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], [[Bryan Talbot]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]] and [[Suzy Varty]];&lt;ref name="Skinn"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinn |first=Dez |title=Comix: The Underground Revolution |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DaISz0tCjMIC |year=2004 |place= |publisher=Collins &amp; Brown |isbn=1-84340-186-X |pages=193–194 |chapter=Hunt Emerson and Ar:Zak Comix}}&lt;/ref&gt; playwrights [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] and [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]; film director [[Mike Figgis]]; writer and poet [[Gareth Owen (writer)|Gareth Owen]]; comedian and performance artist [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]; photographer and journalist [[Derek Bishton]]; the psychedelic group [[Bachdenkel]]; novelist [[Jim Crace]]; singer [[Ruby Turner]], film maker and photographer [[Pogus Caesar]] and composer and sonic artist [[Trevor Wishart]].&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The genesis of the Birmingham Arts Laboratory can be traced to a meeting on 8 September 1968, of five figures (Mark Williams, Fred Smith, Dave Cassidy, Tony Jones and Bob Sheldon) from the [[mac (Birmingham)|Midlands Arts Centre]], who had been promoting avant garde music performances at the centre's outdoor auditorium and had been involved in [[Mike Leigh]]'s experiments in improvised theatre, but had become frustrated at what they saw as the bureaucracy and obstructionism of the centre's management.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt; The group resolved to start a breakaway venue to "provide a centre for experimenting in the Arts; be a community of creative people, self-aware and self-supporting; participate creatively in the life of the City; and present work of both its members and visiting groups and individuals"&lt;ref name="aims"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |editor= |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |origyear=1969 |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery |place=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Published aims of the Arts Lab (reprinted)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed five months of fund-raising events around the city called Strange Days and featuring bands such as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]] and DJ [[John Peel]] (whose fundraising efforts saw him became the Arts Lab's first life member), during which a local charity offered the group the use of a first floor room in its [[Newtown, Birmingham|Newtown]] Youth Centre as a venue. The Arts Lab opened in January 1969, initially only at weekends.&lt;ref name="chronology"&gt;{{harvnb|BMAG|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry Grimley, later arts correspondent of the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', recalled "When I first found my way to the Arts Lab, it did not resemble an arts centre so much as a night club with a rather different ambience to other places in town. Nothing happened except at weekends, and not much happened then either, except that music was played, coloured lights were projected and people ate vegetables and brown rice and drank instant coffee."&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt;

===Tower Street===
The Arts Lab was open full-time from April 1969. Initially occupying only a single room, it quickly established cinema and theatre programmes and in its first year held two experimental arts festivals – ''Cybervironment Plus'' organised by Simon Chapman and ''Gathering Number One'' organised by Pete Stark. Funding from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] from 1971 secured its future and saw it gradually expand: firstly to occupy the whole first floor (with the gymnasium becoming the main theatre and performance space), and eventually to occupy the entire building.

The Arts Lab was initially run along the lines of a club for members and guests.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Although it never had a drinks licence (due to constant friction with the local licensing authorities) it had a coffee bar, beneath which was a void between the floors in which several members intermittently lived. [[Jim Crace]] later recalled that "it was no surprise to discover a badly-smelling playwright or drink-wrecked mime artist emerging between your legs from a priest hole below the floorboards".&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crace |first=Jim |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery |place=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |chapter=Birmingham Arts Lab: Remembered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab started with no formal organisation, but with Peter Stark as unofficial administrator. Stark left in 1970 and was replaced by Simon Chapman, who left in 1972 to become the Director of the [[Ikon Gallery]] and was replaced by [[Ted Little]]. Little was to be artistic director through to 1982, apart from a two-year spell as head of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in [[London]], during which he transformed it "from a club for the self-absorbed of Kensington to a roaring popular venue" and paved the way for its important role in the early years of British [[punk rock|punk]].&lt;ref name="little-obit"/&gt;

===Holt Street===
The Arts Lab's earlier chaotic, co-operative organisation was increasingly challenged by funders from 1975 onwards, with a formal Board of Management being established in 1976. August 1977 saw the Arts Lab move completely from Tower Street to new, much larger premises in a former brewery on the campus of [[Aston University]], with a bookshop, studios and exhibition spaces. Shortage of funds meant that not all of the planned facilities were finished, however, and the new more orderly surroundings were felt by some to have compromised the Arts Lab's uniquely liberating culture.&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"/&gt;

The first signs of problems became apparent in 1980 when two members of the music staff were made redundant and [[Ted Little]] left to pursue freelance work. The Arts Lab's programme began to focus increasingly on film to the exclusion of other media. In 1982 West Midlands Arts sponsored a move to combine the Arts Lab with Aston University's own Centre for the Arts (with the resultant demise of the Centre for the Arts, which had previously been a popular, thriving, live performance arts venue)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/972394445|title=UP THE FIRE ESCAPE AND THROUGH THE KITCHENS.|last=CLIFF.|first=DIX,|date=2015|publisher=COMPLETELYNOVEL|isbn=9781849146111|location=[S.l.]|oclc=972394445}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a venue focussing primarily on cinema and photography, and in 1983 the Arts Lab's premises reopened as a new Arts Centre called the Triangle Media and Arts Centre. Funding for this was removed in 1987, however, and the cinema finally closed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Grimley |title=Looking back on good old 70s: The Arts Lab was a great launching platform, says Terry Grimley |newspaper=[[Birmingham Post]] |publisher=Mirror Regional Newspapers |page=15 |date=3 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and influence==
===Theatre and performance===
The Arts Lab's theatre programme was controversial from its start in 1969, with a nude open-air performance on the Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the ''Birmingham Post''. By 1971 there was a regular programme of visiting theatre companies - mainly radical [[performance art]] groups such as the [[People Show]], [[Pip Simmons Theatre Group]] and [[John Bull Puncture Repair Kit]] - together with performances by the Arts Lab's own theatre company '''Zoo'''.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;

A regular Theatre Workshop was established from 1973, and the following years saw a series of plays written specifically for the Arts Lab including [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]'s ''Stillsmith'', [[Gareth Owen (writer)|Gareth Owen]]'s ''Confession of Jon-Jak Crusoe'' and his rock operetta ''Rupert'', [[Bruce Lacey|Bruce Lacey and Jill Bruce]]'s ''Stella Superstar and Her Amazing Intergalactic Adventures''&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; and most notably [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s ''Summer Sports'', later revived as ''Blood Sports'' and still widely performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edgar |first=David |authorlink=David Edgar (playwright) |title=Edgar: Shorts |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FtYX_9YGQl8C |accessdate=21 November 2008 |year=1989 |place= |publisher=Nick Hern Books |isbn=1-85459-051-0 |page=vii |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1976 the '''Performance Group''' - based at the Arts Lab but touring internationally - produced a range of shows that combined dance, film, text, poetry, electronics and ambient music; declaring "Total Theatre, Mixed or Multimedia, Compound Theatre are all terms we use in this connection",&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; and from 1976 the '''Writers' Theatre Company''' provided an outlet for the professional production of work by young local writers. The Arts Lab was also notable as a [[Stand-up comedy|comedy]] venue, with [[Stewart Lee]] crediting [[Victoria Wood]] and [[John Dowie (humourist)|John Dowie]]'s work at the Arts Lab as being one of the earliest roots of the later [[alternative comedy]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefixonline.com/features.php?id=148 |title=Simon Munnery and Stewart Lee in Conversation |accessdate=23 November 2008 |last=Lee |first=Stewart |authorlink=Stewart Lee |date=November 2007 |work=The Fix Online |publisher= |quote=You know, people say alternative started in ’79, but there were people like Victoria Wood and John Dowie who were both coming out of the Arts Lab in Birmingham.

Janice Connolly, who later became comedy character Mrs Barbara Nice, performed at Tower Street in a piece directed by John Dowie from a Hunt Emerson cartoon "Dog Man".

===Cinema===
The Arts Lab's cinema programme was established by Tony Jones – the first film shown being ''[[Medium Cool]]'' by [[Haskell Wexler]], which had never before seen in the UK&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; – and it continued after the programmes in most other media went into decline from 1980 onwards. The reputation of the Arts Lab's Tower Street venue as "the world's most uncomfortable cinema, the silence only broken by the accompaniment of some thrasher on the piano and the timpani of scurrying rats"&lt;ref name="crace-remembered"/&gt; was partly explained by the fact that the seating had been bought second-hand from a local cinema.&lt;ref name="grimley-intro"/&gt; In addition to its regular programme the Arts Lab held an annual Film Festival from 1972, focussing on particular themes including film makers such as [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Josef von Sternberg]] or [[F. W. Murnau]], or 1976's focus on [[Cinema of Poland|Polish Cinema]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Jones left the Arts Lab in 1978 to join the Cambridge Film Theatre.

===Music===
The Arts Lab's music programme was defiantly aimed at "presenting contemporary music in Birmingham on a regular basis, regardless of the support it may or may not receive", starting off with a then-unusual all-[[Bartók]] concert by the [[Lindsay String Quartet]].&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; 1970 saw the foundation of the '''Arts Lab Sound Workshop''' by Jolyon Laycock, which produced a series of experimental sound performances throughout the 1970s involving [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], [[electronic music]], [[Audio amplifier|amplification effects]] and  [[liquid light shows]], in regular collaboration with artists such as [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[David Panton]], [[Trevor Wishart]] and various ensembles associated with the [[University of Birmingham]], often touring through Europe and North America. Notable premieres included Wishart's ''Menagerie'' and ''Audio Movies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stalk.net/paradigm/pd03.html |title=Trevor Wishart – Beach singularity/Menagerie/Vocalise |accessdate=21 November 2008 |work=Releases |publisher=Paradigm Discs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts Lab also developed a reputation as a centre of improvised [[rock music|rock]], running from the [[psychedelia]] of [[Bachdenkel]] in the late 1960s, through the Arts Lab's own '''Amphioxus''' [[jazz-rock]] ensemble of the mid-seventies, to later collaborative performances at [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]].

===Art, comics and poster art===
The Arts Lab had a printing operation from its establishment in 1969, set up by Bryan Brown and Simon Chapman whose work was influenced by the psychedelic imagery of the West Coast of America.  It initially used [[silkscreen printing]] to produce [[posters]] for Arts Lab events, and raising funds by producing posters for local Student Unions and music promotors. The posters operation was later taken over by [[Bob Linney]] and [[Ken Meharg]] for the Arts Lab – emphasising simultaneous colour contrasts and the dynamic integration of hand-painted text with manipulated photographic imagery – were especially notable, being the subject of an international touring exhibition by the [[British Council]] between 1981 and 1985,&lt;ref name="Meharg-Linney"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sidey |first=Tessa |title=Birmingham Arts Lab: the phantom of liberty |year=1998 |publisher=Birmingham Museums &amp; Art Gallery |location=Birmingham |oclc=60370741 |pages= |chapter=Bob Linney and Ken Meharg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibition by [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] in 1998. Ernie Hudson was particularly renown for his revolutionary multiple colour silk screen prints produced during this time, notably posters for John Peel at Aston University, and various bands at the time. Although few remain, those that do are archived in Birmingham Museum and Art gallery. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Edmonds |title=Memory of unique Birmingham experiment. Richard Edmonds visits the Museum and Art Gallery's exhibition about Birmingham's 1970s experimental arts centre, the Arts Lab |newspaper=Birmingham Post |publisher=Mirror Regional Newspapers |page=14 |date=7 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Arts Lab obtained an [[Offset printing|offset]] [[Lithography|litho]] press on loan from a local cash and carry operation (in return for printing the company's price list for free) and in 1972 bought a second hand press of its own. Initially intended to print flyers and price lists on a commercial basis, the take-over of the printing operation by [[Hunt Emerson]] in 1974 saw the Arts Lab move into comic art, producing a series of publications under its own '''Ar:Zak''' imprint.&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt; Starting with Emerson's own ''Large Cow Comix'' – which also featured work by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] and [[Bryan Talbot]]&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt; – and eventually branching out such varied publications as [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]'s ''Big Foot''; [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]]'s anti-Nazi ''Committed Comix'' and [[Suzy Varty]]'s ''Heroine'' (the first British women's comic),&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt; Ar:Zak was to become an important part of the history of underground British comics, a position reinforced when the Arts Lab held ''KAK'' – the first ''Konvention of Alternative Komix'' in 1976.&lt;ref name="Skinn"/&gt;

'''The Castlestrange stone''' is located in the grounds of "Castlestrange House" near [[Athleague]] in [[County Roscommon]], [[Ireland]]. It is a granite boulder decorated with flowing spirals in the [[La Tène style]], dating from the [[Iron Age]] period between 300 BC and 100 AD. 

Only three other stones of this type have been found in Ireland, of which the [[Turoe stone]] in [[County Galway]] is the best known. The use of the stones is not known but it is assumed they served some religious or ritual purpose. 

The stone is a protected National Monument.

The title character in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' has an aversion to the color red caused by a trauma during her childhood&lt;ref name="StromgrenNorden1984"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stromgren|first1=Richard L.|last2=Norden|first2=Martin F.|title=Movies, a language in light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3hZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=July 1984|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=9780136043072}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Hitchcock presents through expressionistic techniques, such as a [[Wash (visual arts)|wash of red]] coloring a close up of Marnie.&lt;ref name="RaubicheckSrebnick2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raubicheck|first1=Walter|last2=Srebnick|first2=Walter|title=Scripting Hitchcock: Psycho, The Birds, and Marnie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW6kxB-nXSUC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=23 August 2014|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252036484|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term colorphobia can also be used  refer to its literal etymological origin to refer to an apprehension towards image processing on one's vision and its visual perceptual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=Molly|title=Nice Girls Don't Live Forever|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term's association with a racial component has been used by public figures such as [[Frederick Douglass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephens|first1=Gregory|title=On Racial Frontiers|date=1999|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leukophobia often takes the form of a fixation on pale skin. Those with the phobia may make implausible assumptions such as paleness necessarily representing ill health or a [[ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Excess of Phobias and Manias: A Compilation of Anxieties, Obsessions, and Compulsions that Push Many Over the Edge of Sanity |page=114 |first=John G. |last=Robertson |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Senior Scribe |year=2003 |isbn=9780963091925 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4PgawVAzB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Excess+of+Phobias+and+Manias&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3ldjXobLOAhUC3GMKHe1QD50Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=leukophobia&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, leukophobia is directed more towards the symbolic meaning of whiteness, for instance in individuals who associate the color white with chastity and are opposed to or fear chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamec|first=Christine|title=The Encyclopedia of Phobias, Fears, and Anxieties |edition=3rd |year=2009|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Paul Beatty]]'s novel ''Slumberland'', leukophobia refers to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Slumberland |page=185 |first=Paul |last=Beatty |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2008 |isbn=9781596912403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''conformal symmetry''' of [[spacetime]] is expressed by an extension of the [[Poincaré group]]. The extension includes [[special conformal transformation]]s and [[dilation (affine geometry)|dilation]]s. In three spatial plus one time dimensions, conformal symmetry has 15 [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]: ten for the Poincaré group, four for special conformal transformations, and one for a dilation.

[[Harry Bateman]] and [[Ebenezer Cunningham]] were the first to study the conformal symmetry of [[Maxwell's equations]]. They called a generic expression of conformal symmetry a [[spherical wave transformation]].
 
==Generators==

The [[conformal group]] has the following [[group representation|representation]]:&lt;ref name="difrancesco"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Di Francesco |author2=Mathieu, Sénéchal |title= Conformal field theory |series= Graduate texts in contemporary physics |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-94785-3 |page= 98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; M_{\mu\nu} \equiv i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;P_\mu \equiv-i\partial_\mu \,, \\
&amp;D \equiv-ix_\mu\partial^\mu \,, \\
&amp;K_\mu \equiv i(x^2\partial_\mu-2x_\mu x_\nu\partial^\nu) \,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]] [[generating set of a group|generators]], &lt;math&gt;P_\mu&lt;/math&gt; generates [[translation (physics)|translation]]s, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; generates scaling transformations (also known as dilatations or dilations) and &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; generates the [[special conformal transformation]]s.

==Commutation relations==

The [[Commutator|commutation]] relations are as follows:&lt;ref name="difrancesco"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp;[D,K_\mu]=-iK_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[D,P_\mu]=iP_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu,P_\nu]=2i (\eta_{\mu\nu}D-M_{\mu\nu}) \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu, M_{\nu\rho}] = i ( \eta_{\mu\nu} K_{\rho} - \eta_{\mu \rho} K_\nu ) \,, \\
&amp;[P_\rho,M_{\mu\nu}] = i(\eta_{\rho\mu}P_\nu - \eta_{\rho\nu}P_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;[M_{\mu\nu},M_{\rho\sigma}] = i (\eta_{\nu\rho}M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\sigma}M_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\mu\rho}M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\nu\sigma}M_{\mu\rho})\,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
other commutators vanish. Here &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor.

Additionally, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar and &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a covariant vector under the [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

The special  conformal transformations are given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Di Francesco |author2=Mathieu, Sénéchal |title= Conformal field theory |series= Graduate texts in contemporary physics |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-94785-3 |page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   x^\mu \to \frac{x^\mu-a^\mu x^2}{1 - 2a\cdot x + a^2 x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter describing the transformation.  This special conformal transformation can also be written as &lt;math&gt; x^\mu  \to x'^\mu &lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{x}'^\mu}{{x'}^2}= \frac{x^\mu}{x^2} - a^\mu,
&lt;/math&gt; 
which shows that it consists of an inversion, followed by a translation, followed by a second  inversion.

[[Image:Conformal grid after Möbius transformation.svg|frame|The same grid after a special conformal transformation]]

In two dimensional [[spacetime]], the transformations of the conformal group are the [[conformal geometry|conformal transformations]]. There are [[Conformal_field_theory#Two_dimensions|infinitely many]] of them.

In more than two dimensions, [[Euclidean conformal transformations]] map circles to circles, and hyperspheres to hyperspheres with a straight line considered a degenerate circle and a hyperplane a degenerate hypercircle.

In more than two [[Lorentzian dimension]]s, conformal transformations map null rays to null rays and light cones to light cones with a null hyperplane being a [[degenerate light cone]].

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===

The largest possible{{why|date=March 2017}} global [[symmetry group]] of a non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[interaction|interacting]] [[quantum field theory|field theory]] is a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of the conformal group with an [[internal group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Second-order phase transitions===
{{main|phase transitions}}

One particular application is to [[critical phenomena]] in systems with local [[interaction]]s. Fluctuations{{clarify|of what?|date=March 2017}} in such systems are conformally invariant at the critical point. That allows for classification of universality classes of phase transitions in terms of [[Conformal field theory|conformal field theories]]

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

Conformal invariance is also present in two-dimensional turbulence at high [[Reynolds number]].

===High-energy physics===

Many theories studied in [[high-energy physics]] admit the conformal symmetry{{why|date=March 2017}}. A famous{{why|date=March 2017}} example is the [[N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory]]. Also, the [[worldsheet]] in [[string theory]] is described by a [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] coupled to the two-dimensional gravity.

The '''culture of [[Washington, D.C.]]''' is influenced by the presence of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], which has been instrumental in developing numerous cultural institutions throughout the city.  During the early 20th century, Washington's [[U Street Corridor]] was an important center for [[African American culture]].

== Museums and monuments ==

[[Image:Mount St Sepulchre DC.JPG|thumb|right|Mt. St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery]]
Washington is home to numerous [[National Historic Landmark|national landmarks]] and is one of the most popular [[Tourism in the United States|tourist destinations]] in the United States. The [[National Mall]] is a large, open area in the center of the city featuring many monuments to American leaders; it also serves to connect the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[United States Capitol]] buildings. Located prominently in the center of the Mall is the [[Washington Monument]]. Other notable points of interest near the Mall include the [[Jefferson Memorial]], [[Lincoln Memorial]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]], [[National World War II Memorial]], [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]], [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], the [[District of Columbia War Memorial]] and the [[Albert Einstein Memorial, Washington DC|Albert Einstein Memorial]].

The world-famous [[Smithsonian Institution]] is located in the District. The Smithsonian today is a collection of museums that includes the [[Anacostia Museum]], [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]], [[Hirshhorn Museum]], [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[National Museum of American History]], [[National Museum of the American Indian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[National Portrait Gallery, Washington, DC|National Portrait Gallery]], [[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], [[Renwick Gallery]], and the [[Smithsonian National Zoological Park|National Zoo]].

There are many art museums in D.C., in addition to those that are part of the Smithsonian, including the [[National Gallery of Art]], [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], and the [[Phillips Collection]].

The [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] house thousands of documents covering every period in American history. Some of the more notable documents in the National Archives include the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

Other points of interest in the District include [[Arena Stage]], [[Chinatown, Washington, D.C.|Chinatown]], [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Blair House]], [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]], [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], [[Ford's Theatre]], [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]], [[International Spy Museum]], [[National Building Museum]], [[National Geographic Society]], [[Old Post Office Building (Washington)|Old Post Office Building]], [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]], [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Washington National Cathedral]] and the [[Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery]].

==Performing arts==
[[Image:KennedyCtr.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kennedy Center]]]]
{{main|Theater in Washington, D.C.}}
Washington is a major national center for the arts, with many venues for the performing arts in the city.  Theater dates back to the early 19th century when a theater was established in Samuel Blodgett Jr's Great Hotel on E Street in 1800, soon after the capital was relocated to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="meersman-p527"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meersman, Roger |title=The Kennedy Center: From Dream to Reality |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society |date=1980 |volume=50 |pages= 527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] opened in 1835 on E Street, near the [[White House]].  [[DAR Constitution Hall]] opened in 1929, and remained the city's primary concert hall until the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] opened in 1971.&lt;ref name="meersman-p527"/&gt;

DAR Constitution Hall, National Theatre, and other venues remained [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] throughout the early part of the 20th century.  [[Contralto]] [[Marian Anderson]] was barred from performing at Constitution Hall in 1939, instead performing at the Lincoln Memorial to large crowds.  The [[U Street Corridor]] was the center of [[African American]] culture in Washington, D.C.  The [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theatre]] hosted the likes of [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] on [[U Street Corridor|U Street]] (known as "Washington's Black Broadway") prior to the 1968 riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Miracle on the Potomac |author=Becker, Ralph E. |date=1990 |publisher=Bartleby Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arena Stage]], one of the first non-profit regional theaters in the nation produces an eight-show season ranging from classics to world premieres, dedicated to the American canon of theater. The [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] is regarded as one of the world's great Shakespeare troupes. Numerous other professional theaters, such as the Studio Theatre and Woolly Mammoth, and venues such as the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]], make the city a major theater center.  The Kennedy Center hosts the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Washington National Opera]], the [[Washington Ballet]], and a variety of other musical and stage performances.

Notable local music clubs include [[Madam's Organ Blues Bar]] in [[Adams Morgan]]; Blues Alley in Georgetown; the [[Eighteenth Street Lounge]] in the [[Dupont Circle]] district; and the [[the Black Cat (nightclub)|Black Cat]], the [[9:30 Club]], the [[Bohemian Caverns]] jazz club, the Twins jazz clubs, all in the [[U Street]] NW area. The U Street area actually contains more than two dozen bars, clubs, and restaurants that feature jazz either nightly or several times a week.  Notable Washingtonians in the entertainment industry include singer-songwriter [[Marvin Gaye]], film actress [[Helen Hayes]], comedian [[David Chappelle]], musician [[Duke Ellington]], filmmaker [[Ted Salins]] and two members of [[Jefferson Airplane]]: guitarist [[Jorma Kaukonen]] and bass player [[Jack Casady]].

==Music==
{{main|Music of Washington, D.C.}}
D.C. has its own native music genre, called [[go-go]], a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of [[R&amp;B]] that blends live sets with relentless dance rhythms, so-called because they "go and go and go." The most accomplished practitioner of go-go was D.C. bandleader [[Chuck Brown]], who brought go-go to the brink of national recognition with his 1979 LP ''[[Bustin' Loose (Chuck Brown album)|Bustin' Loose]]''. Go-Go band and Washington natives [[Experience Unlimited]] (E.U.) hit the American pop charts in 1988 with their memorable dance tune "[[Da Butt]]" Other notable go-go bands include [[Rare Essence]], [[Trouble Funk]], [[Junkyard Band]], [[Backyard Band]], and the [[Northeast Groovers]].

Washington was an important center in the genesis of [[punk rock]] in the United States. Punk bands of note from Washington include [[Tru Fax &amp; the Insaniacs]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], [[Bad Brains]], and [[Minor Threat]]. Washingtonians continue to support punk bands, long after the punk movement's popularity peaked. The region also has a significant [[indie rock]] history and was home to [[TeenBeat Records|TeenBeat]], [[Dischord Records]] and [[Simple Machines Records|Simple Machines]], among other indie record labels.

Washington is also home to [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]], founded in 1974 and part of the [[District of Columbia Public Schools|DC Public School System]]. Some other notable music education organizations which are located and founded in Washington include the [[DC Youth Orchestra Program]] founded in 1960; [[Blues Alley]], founded in 1985; and the Levine School of Music, founded in 1976.

==Television shows==
There have been several television series that have featured the District. Most of these have been related to government (e.g., ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' and ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'') or security organizations (''[[The District]]'', ''[[Get Smart]]''). Other programs had the nation's capital as a secondary focus, telling stories on their own that were not always tied to the infrastructure of the government either in the district or for the country. For instance, ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' focused on the lives of the reporters of the (fictional) Washington-based television newsmagazine, ''FYI''. The soap opera ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]'' allowed for stories about political intrigue alongside the traditional class struggle sagas. The sitcom ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]'' portrayed the life of the [[African American]] majority as seen through the eyes of residents in a Washington apartment building. There are also many movies shot and filmed in the city yearly.  ''[[Cory in the House]]'' on [[The Disney Channel]] uses Washington, D.C. as a backdrop.

{{see also|List of television shows set in Washington, D.C.}}

== Movies ==

The District has also been host to several movies, where the main characters are often linked to politics (''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' and ''[[Being There]]'') or adventure (''[[Hollow Man]]'' and ''[[National Treasure]]'').

[[Image:Mci center jan2006b.jpg|right|thumb|[[Capital One Arena]], home of the [[Washington Wizards]] and [[Washington Capitals]]]]
Other professional and semi-professional teams based in D.C. include the [[Australian rules football|USAFL]] [[Baltimore Washington Eagles]], the [[National Women's Football Association|NWFA]] [[D.C. Divas]], the [[Minor League Football]] [[D.C. Explosion]], the [[Washington Rugby Football Club|Washington RFC]] [[rugby union]] team of the [[Rugby Super League (United States)|Rugby Super League]], as well as a host of others playing in the [[Potomac Rugby Union]] and the [[cricket|Washington Cricket League]]. It was also home to the [[Women's United Soccer Association|WUSA]] [[Washington Freedom]], from 1987 to 1989 home of the [[Major Indoor Lacrosse League]]'s [[Washington Wave]], and during the [[2000 NLL season|2000]]–[[2002 NLL season|2002]] [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] seasons, the [[Washington Power]] was based in the city. In [[rugby league]], the [[Washington, D.C. Slayers]] play in the [[American National Rugby League]].

There were two [[Major League Baseball]] teams named the Washington Senators in the early and mid-20th century, which left to become respectively the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. In the [[Washington Senators (1891–99)|19th century]], the town was home to teams called the Washington Nationals, Washington Statesmen, and Washington Senators on and off from the 1870s to the turn of the century.

Washington was home to several [[Negro League baseball]] teams, including the [[Homestead Grays]], [[Washington Black Senators]], [[Washington Elite Giants]], [[Washington Pilots]], and [[Washington Potomacs]].

The [[Capital One Arena]] in Chinatown, home to the Capitals, Mystics, Wizards and the [[Georgetown Hoyas]], is also a major venue for concerts, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) [[professional wrestling]], and other events, having replaced the old [[Capital Centre]]. Since its opening in 1997, the arena has served as a catalyst of prosperity in Chinatown. Office buildings, high-end condominiums, restaurant chains, movie theatres, and other luxuries have sprung up around Chinatown. On the downside, the growth has forced out many Chinatown landmarks, and only a fraction of Chinatown remains "Chinese".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The city's soccer team, D.C. United, is the most successful franchise in MLS history, with 4 league championships and 10 total tournament victories, both league highs. The city is also considered the most passionate soccer market, with a list of people including MLS Commissioner Don Garber and TV Commentator (and former US National team and MLS star) Eric Wynalda outright declaring Washington the country's best soccer market. Washington will host the 2007 edition of MLS Cup at RFK Stadium.

Washington hosts the annual [[Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] [[tennis]] tournament that takes place at the [[Carter Barron Tennis Center]] on 17th Street.

The [[Marine Corps Marathon]] and the [[National Marathon]] are both held annually in Washington.

==Media==

===Newspapers===
''[[The Washington Post]]'' is the oldest and most-read daily newspaper in Washington, and it has developed into one of the most reputable daily newspapers in the U.S. It is most notable for exposing the [[Watergate scandal]], among other achievements.  ''The Washington Post'' also has a daily free newspaper called the ''[[Express (Washington, D.C. newspaper)|Express]]'', summarizing events, sports, and entertainment. The daily ''[[Washington Times]]'' and the free weekly ''[[Washington City Paper]]'' also have substantial readership in the District. On [[February 1]], 2005 the free daily [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' debuted, having been formed from a chain of suburban newspapers known as the ''Journal Newspapers''.

The weekly ''[[Washington Blade]]'' and ''[[Metro Weekly]]'' focus on [[gay]] issues, and the ''[[Washington Informer]]'' on African American issues. Bi-weekly ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'' focuses on issues of [[homelessness]] and poverty.

Many neighborhoods in the District have their own community newspapers, usually published on a weekly basis. Some of these include The Current Newspapers, which has editions serving [[Dupont Circle]], [[Foggy Bottom]], [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]], [[Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C.|Chevy Chase]], Upper Northwest and a [[United States Capitol|Capitol Hill]] paper called The Capitol Hill Current/Voice of the Hill. Additional papers include ''In-Towner'' (Dupont Circle, [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]], and [[Adams Morgan]]), ''[[Hill Rag]]'' (Capitol Hill), ''East of the River'' (Anacostia), and ''DC North'' (Northeast DC). In addition, several specialty newspapers serve the U.S. Congress; most notable are ''[[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]]'' and ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''.

===Television===
The metro area is served by several local broadcast television stations and is the eighth largest [[media market|designated market area]] in the U.S., with 2,252,550 homes (2.04% of the U.S. population). Major television network affiliates include [[WRC-TV|WRC]] 4 ([[NBC]]), [[WTTG]] 5 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[WJLA-TV|WJLA]] 7 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]] 9 ([[CBS]]), [[WDCA]] 20 ([[MyNetwork TV]]) and [[WDCW]] 50 ([[The CW Television Network|The CW]]) as well as [[WETA-TV|WETA]] 26 and [[WHUT-TV|WHUT]] 32 ([[PBS]]) stations. Channels 4 and 5 are [[Owned-and-operated station]]s. [[Public access television|Public Access]] on Cable Television is provided by the [[Public Access Corporation of the District of Columbia]] on two channels simulcast to both local cable TV Systems. One channel is devoted to religious programming and the other channel provides a diversity of offerings. A regional news station, [[News Channel 8]], is carried on Channel 8 on all cable systems in Washington, D.C. and surrounding communities. Additionally, most [[Baltimore]] area television stations can be seen in the Washington region. Besides being viewed clearly in the District, they can especially be seen in the suburbs of the [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|Interstate 95]] corridor between both cities. They are:

[[WMAR-TV|WMAR]] 2 ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) – [[WBAL-TV|WBAL]] 11 ([[NBC]]) – [[WJZ-TV|WJZ]] 13 ([[CBS]]) – [[WMJF-LP|WMJF]] 16 (Ind/MTV2) – [[Maryland Public Television|WMPT]] 22 / [[Maryland Public Television|WMPB]] 67 (PBS/MPB) – [[WUTB]] 24 ([[MyNetwork TV]]) – [[WBFF]] 45 ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]) – [[WNUV]] 54 (The [[The CW Television Network|CW]]) (The Tube on DT2)

The WTTG Television Tower, built in 1963, is a 214.8 metre high guyed TV mast; it is only 17.2 meters shorter than the [[Hughes Memorial Tower]]: the tallest structure in Washington, D.C. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Spanish-language television is also represented by [[Telemundo]] [[WZDC-LP]] 25 and Telefutura affiliate [[WMDO-CA]] 47, but these are [[LPTV|low-power television stations]] limited to within the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]] area. Univision's [[WFDC]] 14, however, transmits as a full power station and can be received as far north as Baltimore.

Incidentally, D.C's Univision and Telefutura stations (owned by Entravision) switched call letters on January 1, 2006; meaning that now Univision is the only Spanish station which can be seen at full power over the whole Washington metropolitan area. The Univision network moved from low-powered Channel 47/[[WMDO-CA|WMDO]] to full-powered Channel 14/[[WFDC-TV|WFDC]]; Univision's youth-oriented Telefutura network moved from 14 to 47. The change caused Univision and Telefutura to exchange channel locations on D.C. area cable TV systems, too.

[[Azteca America]] announced they would start transmitting from a new full powered Spanish-language broadcast affiliate in the region, Channel 69/[[WQAW]] on October 6, 2006, as well as its addition to local channel lineups for Comcast Cable. However it has not been seen on the air as of yet. Earliest reports from viewers do not indicate availability of its broadcasts inside the District, as far south as Prince William County, Virginia, or as far north as the Columbia/Baltimore area.

Several [[cable television]] networks have their headquarters in the Washington area including [[C-SPAN]] on Capitol Hill, [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) in [[Washington, D.C. (northeast)|Northeast Washington]], and [[Discovery Channel|Discovery Communications]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], as well as the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. Major national broadcasters and cable outlets including [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Columbia Broadcasting Service|CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], and [[CNN]] maintain a significant presence in Washington, as do those from around the world including the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and [[Al Jazeera]]. ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' is the only network primetime program produced in Washington.

===Radio===
[[Image:Npr headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Public Radio]] former headquarters, located at [[Mount Vernon Square]]]]
There are several major radio stations serving the metro area, with a wide variety of musical interests. [[Contemporary music]] Station (and arguably the most popular) is [[WIHT]] 99.5 FM (Hot 99.5) located in [[Rockville, Maryland]]. [[Rock and roll|Rock]] stations include [[WTGB-FM|WTGB]] 94.7 FM ([[Adult album alternative|Triple A]]) and [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] 101.1 FM (alternative rock/pop).

'''Emily Bishop''' (also '''Nugent''', '''Swain''' and known and credited in the early days of the show as '''Miss Nugent''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[soap opera]], ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Portrayed by [[Eileen Derbyshire]], the character is the longest-standing female character in the serial, having first appeared on-screen during an episode which aired on 27 January 1961.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/characters/emilybishop/ |title=Coronation Street : Cast &amp; Characters : A-E Cast &amp; Characters : Emily Bishop – ITV Soaps |publisher=ITV.com |author=Webmaster |year=2010 |accessdate=27 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123145315/http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/characters/emilybishop/ |archivedate=23 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Derbyshire announced in November 2015 that she would be taking a sabbatical from the show and Emily departed on 1 January 2016 after 55 years on screen, but to date she has not returned.

==Storylines==
Emily first moved to [[Weatherfield]] in the late 1940s from [[Harrogate]] to work for [[Leonard Swindley]] ([[Arthur Lowe]]) at the Glad Tidings Mission Hall. A very quiet and Christian woman, she hardly knew anyone up on the street except [[Ena Sharples]] ([[Violet Carson]]) the caretaker of the Mission Hall and the owners of the Corner Shop, [[Elsie Lappin]] ([[Maudie Edwards]]) and then [[Florrie Lindley]] ([[Betty Alberge]]). She eventually meets the residents of the street following a gas leak in January 1961 which forced them to stay the night at the Mission Hall. After that she soon becomes friends with many of the residents and became a pillar of the community.

Swindley soon ventures out becoming manager of the Rosamand Street branch of Gamma Garments, a clothing chain with Emily as his head assistant, their relationship becomes stronger and they decide to get married, however Swindley's pompousness and arrogance forces her to jilt him at the altar. A very moral woman, Emily prides herself on saving herself for marriage, but her resolve is eventually weakened and she begins a relationship with a Hungarian man called Miklos Zadic (Paul Stassino). She later confides in her friend [[Valerie Barlow]] ([[Anne Reid]]) that she has no regrets about the encounter; Emily is, by that time, 39 years old and assumes it will be now or never. With Miklos out of the picture, Emily falls in love with mild-mannered [[Ernest Bishop]] ([[Stephen Hancock]]) after meeting him at his mother's funeral. Their courtship is tested many times over and lasts for three years. They get engaged. The next year, Ernest is jailed in [[Majorca]] and subsequently freed, and it is at this time that they get married, broadcast across the UK on [[Easter Monday]].

Despite rough patches, Emily and Ernest's marriage is relatively stable and they love each other very much. Emily miscarries and later starts [[menopause]], dashing their chances of having a child of their own. This leads to many arguments between them, and they are forced to re-evaluate their marriage after just two years. They turn to short-term fostering to assuage Emily's need to connect with young children. Tragedy strikes when Ernest is shot and killed in a botched robbery, leaving Emily devastated. Emily only starts to heal from heartbreak by playing with a baby, namely [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]]'s ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) infant daughter [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy]] (Christabel Finch). To occupy her time more interestingly, Emily leaves her post at the local hospital and becomes manageress of a café, with [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Potter]] ([[Helen Worth]]) as her assistant. When the cafe is abruptly sold and new owner Jim Sedgwick (Michael O'Hagan) makes drastic changes to the food and service, Emily walks out and Gail takes over, although eventually Jim's wife [[Alma Halliwell|Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]) starts managing the cafe. In many respects, Emily has never let Ernest go but does marry again, to [[List of Coronation Street characters (1980)#Arnold Swain|Arnold Swain]] (George Waring). He unfortunately turns out to be a bigamist. After she ends their relationship, he visits her and plans a murder-suicide. Emily tells him that God would not approve of what he is doing but Arnold insists she is wrong and goes upstairs to find a Bible. While he is gone, Emily runs outside for help. Arnold is sent to an institution where he dies ten months later. When factory boss [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) needs a new wages clerk, he turns to Emily and she starts working in the same job held by her husband at the time of his death.

Emily has a mental breakdown. She can't remember appointments, becomes confused and her appearance suffers. Lodger [[Percy Sugden]] ([[Bill Waddington]]), protects her, covering up these very unusual actions. He becomes increasingly concerned about her behaviour and alerts Emily's friends and neighbours. One day, Emily disappears without a word. When friends and neighbours ignore Percy's call for help, he calls the police who find Emily wandering aimlessly, clearly having suffered a breakdown. When Emily has recovered enough to leave hospital, she tells Percy that he is a good friend, and thanks him for all he had done. Percy later leaves. Emily falls in love once more, with Bernard, a vicar. He breaks off the engagement when he finds out she had suffered a mental breakdown. Due to his past, he cannot not face the possibility of it recurring. Since then, Emily has sworn off love completely, pushing herself into more topical endeavours instead. When her nephew [[List of Coronation Street characters (1997)#Spider Nugent|Spider]] ([[Martin Hancock]]) arrives on the scene, Emily takes him in and they become fast friends as well as partners in saving the Red Rec from [[Alf Roberts]]' ([[Bryan Mosley]]) proposed plans for a "Millennium Bowl". Emily spends a night up in a tree standing by her convictions that the Red Rec is the last green space in Weatherfield and it deserves preservation.

[[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]), Gail's husband, attempts to murder Emily for monetary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2818067.stm|title=Corrie killer voted top soap villain|publisher=BBC.co.uk|author=Editor|date=4 March 2003|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He breaks in while she is watching television and babysitting for [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] ([[Steven Arnold]]) and [[Maxine Peacock]] ([[Tracy Shaw]]). Richard knocks her unconscious with a crowbar but is interrupted by Maxine's early return. He attacks Maxine with the same weapon, killing her instantly. Emily makes a full recovery but suffers terrible guilt for surviving when Maxine didn't. She prevents a murder when grief-crazed [[Brenda Fearns]] ([[Julia Deakin]]) almost jumps off a forty-three foot church tower with baby [[Bethany Platt]] (Amy &amp; Emily Walton).

Emily befriends [[Ed Jackson (Coronation Street)|Ed Jackson]] ([[Chris Walker (actor)|Chris Walker]]), a new member of the congregation at her church. He soon becomes a regular visitor to her house, doing odd jobs and they remain friends after he confesses that he has recently been released from prison. However, Emily is devastated when Ed admits why he has been in prison—he was the man who shot and killed Ernest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16507599&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=ernie-gun-killer-is-back-on-the-street--name_page.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: ERNIE GUN KILLER IS BACK ON THE STREET|publisher=The Mirror|author=Brian Roberts|date=21 December 2005|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tells her that, after finding God while in prison, he has come looking for her, attempting to atone for his misdemeanours. Enraged, Emily throws him out, and goes on to question her faith. Eventually, Emily forgives Ed as he contemplates suicide, and gives him Ernest's camera as a keepsake, asking him to send her a photo of him every year so that she can make sure he is alive and well.

When [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) finds an envelope in Emily's drawer while looking to see what her PIN was when she has forgotten it. The envelope reads: "to be opened after my death". Norris tells [[Rita Sullivan]] ([[Barbara Knox]]) about it and she tells Emily about the situation so Emily agrees to tell Norris. She makes him promise not to tell anyone but it turns out that the envelope contains plans for her funeral. Norris discovers that this envelope isn't the one he has seen and tries hard to find out what really is in the envelope. It is revealed to be old photos of Rita from her singing days. Emily encounters [[Jed Stone]] ([[Kenneth Cope]]), a former resident of the street, when she is working at the canteen at [[Weatherfield]] General Hospital. Taking pity on him as he has no home to go to, Emily invites him to come and lodge with her and Norris. When Jed later goes missing, Emily is worried as he has left his cap behind. When [[Maria Connor]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]) returns from holiday she is surprised to learn that Jed has disappeared as they both had believed [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) was a killer. After Maria accuses Tony of killing Jed both Maria and Emily are relieved when Jed turns up "unharmed" but Jed is really hiding marks on his neck from when Tony had strangled him. Emily is later upset to hear that Jed has suffered a second heart attack after he receives a visit from Tony's henchman.

Norris' half-brother [[Ramsay Clegg]] ([[Andrew Sachs]]) arrives after them not seeing each for many years. Emily tries to get Norris to forgive Ramsay before his return to Australia, and in doing so begins to fall for the man. She is very upset when he departs the Street, and is later shocked when he dies suddenly on his flight. She condemns Norris for treating Ramsay in the cold manner that he did. Emily later forgives Norris for his treatment of Ramsay. Emily took in Tracy (now played by [[Kate Ford]]) and [[Amy Barlow]]  (Elle Mulvaney) as lodgers in her front parlour, after they were made homeless. However she kicks them out after Tracy deliberately ruins Ernest's pair of shoes believing them to be Norris'. Emily told Norris of her ambition to do charity work in [[Peru]] and to see her nephew, Spider again, she booked a flight and she departed the street.

In early 2018, [[Ken Barlow]] ([[William Roache]]) told [[Sophie Webster]] ([[Brooke Vincent]]) that Emily was back in the country, to look after a sick Freda. Ken told Sophie that they might see Emily back in Weatherfield soon. In April, [[Mary Taylor (Coronation Street)|Mary Taylor]] ([[Patti Clare]]) mentions to [[Jude Appleton|Jude]] and [[Angie Appleton]] ([[Paddy Wallace]] and Victoria Ekanoye) that Norris has visited Emily.

==Creation==

===Casting===
In December 1960, actress [[Eileen Derbyshire]] was approached by Granada to play a part in the show, but the actress was tied up in a Christmas stage play. Of this Derbyshire said: "Four weeks after it started (airing) they said I could either wait until they introduced a new family into the programme or take the tiny part of a little, shy woman helper at the Mission Hall" going on to say "I have always been a fatalist, so I took the bird in one hand, not realising what a momentous decision I was making".&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

===Background===
[[File:EMILYBISHOP1961.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An early image of Emily Bishop (then Nugent) as she appeared in 1961.]]
The character of Emily was introduced when actress Eileen Derbyshire took on the role in Episode 15 on Friday, 27 January. At first, the character was simply called "Miss Nugent"; it wasn't until 1962 that she was given the name "Emily" by the show's writers. She continued to be credited on the programme as "Miss Nugent" until 1969.

Although rarely seen, the set of Emily's kitchen is the oldest surviving set. (The second oldest set is Ken's kitchen, with the famous avocado-green tiles.) All other sets have been redecorated at least once since we first saw Emily's kitchen. Emily's back room/parlour, however, was redecorated off screen. In the story a fire was caused by a candle left unattended by Spider and Toyah when they made their way upstairs after a romantic evening. Spider was able to track down matching wallpaper to cover up the fire damage so that Emily would not know what had happened, but in reality, the wallpaper was no longer obtainable, so the whole set was re-decorated in a very similar style.  Emily has lived at No. 3 Coronation Street since 1972. It is mentioned that Emily is from [[Harrogate]].

==Development==
In January 2009, a ''Coronation Street'' spokesperson denied claims that the character of Emily, along with other established actresses [[Barbara Knox]] and [[Betty Driver]] (who portray characters [[Rita Sullivan]] and [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Williams]] respectively) were axed by producer Kim Crowther in a bid to save money on salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1104284/Coronation-Street-bosses-deny-shows-longest-running-characters-facing-axe.html|title=Coronation Street bosses deny three of the show's longest-running characters are facing the axe|publisher=Daily Mail|author=Reporter|date=2 January 2009|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in 1991, Derbyshire spoke about her character's thirty years in the show, stating: "The writers have a tough enough task as it is, trying to find new storylines for a character who has been in the serial for three decades." Going on to say "I just get on with it. Emily has had a more colourful past than you might think. She has had lots of men friends and liaisons. In the early days, when they were stuck for something to do with her, I think the writers used to say 'Let's give Emily another boyfriend.' I've lost count of the number of men friends she has had".&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Life in the Street |last= |first= |authorlink=Graeme Kay |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Boxtree Limited |location= |isbn=1-85283-161-8 |page=34 |pages= |url=http://www.book-info.com/isbn/1-85283-161-8.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the character has proved her good neighbour image by taking in a number of lodgers, most notably Percy Sugden, [[Curly Watts]], her nephew Spider, [[Rita Tanner]] and current lodger [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]].

===Departure===
In November 2015, ''Coronation Street'' confirmed that Derbyshire had requested a six-month break with immediate effect, which she was granted.&lt;ref name="break"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a774913/coronation-streets-eileen-derbyshire-takes-break-from-emily-bishop-role/|title=Coronation Street's Eileen Derbyshire takes break from Emily Bishop role|author=Daniel Kilkelly|work=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derbyshire was one of four cast members to announce their temporary exit around the same time as [[Alison King]] who plays [[Carla Connor]], [[David Neilson]] who plays [[Roy Cropper]] and [[Les Dennis]] who plays [[Michael Rodwell]] also announced that they would be temporarily departing. Derbyshire's exit scenes aired on 1 January 2016 in which Emily left the street to visit her nephew [[Spider Nugent|Spider]] ([[Martin Hancock]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lizardfish.co.uk/#!Coronation-Street-Emily-Bishop-Exit/cmfg/566aa09f0cf2f7de56e3e458&lt;/ref&gt;

Derbyshire later extended her leave until the end of 2016. In November 2016, it was reported that Derbyshire would not be reprising the role. A source told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that there was "no expectation that she will be back". They went on to say: "All of her cast mates have accepted she won't be returning. She's 85 and has been out of the show for a year, so she probably would have found it tough to get back into the fast pace of filming." However, a spokesperson later said the door is still open for her when she is ready, saying: "Eileen is taking an extended break, and has given no indication that she doesn't plan to return."&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2016/11/13/coronation-street-deny-emily-bishop-star-eileen-derbyshire-has-quit-shes-taking-an-extended-break-6254898/#ixzz4PtAGNysn Coronation Street deny Emily Bishop star Eileen Derbyshire has quit | Metro News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During an episode broadcast on 3 January 2018, Ken Barlow remarked to Sophie Webster that Emily had returned to the UK to look after her niece Freda, who had fallen ill. This led to speculation that the character would soon be returning to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a846607/coronation-street-emily-bishop-eileen-derbyshire-return/|title=Coronation Street fans are delighted to hear Emily Bishop is back in the UK|last=Roker|first=Sarah|date=4 January 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 2001, a storyline involving Emily lending her nephew Spider £15,000 for a new business venture was criticised for not being authentic. Journalist Tony Bridgland writing for the ''Telegraph'' said of the plot; "It is beginning to look as though ''Coronation Street'''s researchers failed to do enough homework to make their plot watertight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/2744469/Where-did-Emily-get-the-money.html|title=Where did Emily get the money?|publisher=The Telegraph|author=Tony Bridgland|date=5 December 2001|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' compiled a list of ten favourite Christmas moments from soap; on the list was the 2002 Christmas episode where Richard Hillman came close to suffocating Emily with a pillow as she slept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/dec/23/favouritechristmassoapmomen|title=Favourite Christmas soap moments|publisher=The Guardian|author=Daniel Martin|date=23 December 2007|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the scene where Emily was attacked by Richard Hillman in 2003, critic Chris Diamond wryly commented: "Surely Emily wouldn't be in the line of fire? Poor, drippy, sensible shoes Emily? But she was and the scene where Richard laid the blow on her was one of the most genuinely shocking things I have ever seen on television. I just couldn't believe my eyes. And that was where the genius of the episode lay. I knew Emily was going to get it. I saw Richard creeping up behind her and I was fully cognoscent of the fact that the crowbar in his hand was not for snagging her cardie. But I was sure that even at this point something was going to happen that would divert Richard from his target. When the blow actually fell I was utterly amazed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5157 |title=CORONATION STREET |publisher=Offthetelly.co.uk |author=Chris Diamond |date=13 January 2003 |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608044727/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5157 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dek Hogan writing for media website ''Digital Spy'' in 2005 praised Eileen Derbyshire's comedic abilities; "the book club storyline doesn't exactly fill me with joy but does have the advantage of giving some fine comedic material to the underused talents of Eileen Derbyshire.

After two or three episodes the matter was resolved.

In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website [[Lowculture]] commented that Emily is underused in storylines, but praised her stating: "Emily is one of those characters who seems to have always been around but rarely gets singled out for attention, yet she can be both funny and heartbreaking. She's really stood out in her scenes this month and has been the only good thing about the Norris/Ramsay storyline of infinite tedium."&lt;ref name="low"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/08/31/soapstar-superstars-august/ |title=Soapstar Superstars: August |publisher=[[Lowculture]] |author=Deller, Ruth |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908163520/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/08/31/soapstar-superstars-august/ |archivedate=8 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book "Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps", Christine Geraghty describes Emily as being "shy, frightened of speaking out until roused, a spinster type whose complex marital history is seldom referred to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Christine|title=Women and soap opera: a study of prime time soaps|year=1991|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=0-7456-0568-0|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3hWqZwJgN8C&amp;pg=PA97&amp;dq=elsie+tanner&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r80-TaqtBMe5hAfgnbStCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=elsie%20tanner&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Emma''''' is a 1996 [[Period piece|period film]] based on the [[Emma (novel)|1815 novel of the same name]] by [[Jane Austen]]. Written and directed by [[Douglas McGrath]], the film stars [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Ewan McGregor]], and [[Jeremy Northam]].

==Plot==
The film describes a year in the life of [[Emma Woodhouse]], a congenial but naïve young woman who thinks of herself as a romantic matchmaker in her small community in early-19th-century England.  When her [[governess]], Miss Taylor, gets married and goes to live with her new husband, Mr Weston, Emma proudly takes the credit for having brought the couple together. Her father and their old family friend (and brother of Emma's sister's husband) [[George Knightley]] dispute her claim and disapprove of her trying to make more matches, but she ignores their warnings and sets her mind on setting up Mr Elton, the minister who performed the Westons' marriage ceremony, with Harriet Smith, an unsophisticated young woman on the verges of society.

As a close friendship develops between Emma and Harriet, it becomes clear that Harriet is being courted by Robert Martin, a farmer who has known Harriet since she was a girl. When Mr Martin proposes to Harriet, she is inclined to accept, but she has come to rely heavily on Emma's advice, and Emma persuades her to reject the proposal. Meanwhile, Mr Elton has been expressing a desire for Emma by taking an interest in a picture she drew of Harriet and by giving her a riddle for a book of riddles being compiled by Harriet. Emma misinterprets this as interest in Harriet, but when Mr Elton and Emma are alone, he fervently declares his love for Emma herself, and she finally realizes her mistake. She harshly rejects his pleas, and he later marries another woman, who turns out to be a vain socialite who competes with Emma for status in the community.

Over the next few months, various gatherings show who loves whom among Emma's friends. Emma is briefly attracted to a charming, gallant young man named Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son who comes to visit from London, but Emma soon decides to set him up with Harriet. However, Frank is revealed to have a secret engagement with a shy, pretty woman named Jane Fairfax. Harriet states that she has no interest in Frank, preferring Mr Knightley, who was the only man who would dance with her at a party. Mr Knightley only danced with Harriet out of politeness and has started to fall in love with Emma.

The conclusion of the story begins when Emma ridicules a poor woman named Miss Bates during a picnic, after which Mr Knightley angrily scolds Emma and leaves town for a while. She finds herself thinking about him while he's away, but does not realize she loves him until Harriet expresses interest in him. When Mr Knightley returns, he and Emma cross paths in a meadow and have a conversation that begins awkwardly but ends with him asking her to marry him and her gladly accepting. The news of their engagement upsets Harriet, who avoids Emma for a while, but returns a few weeks later, engaged to Mr Martin. The film ends with Emma and Mr Knightley's wedding.

==Production==

===Conception and adaptation===
[[Douglas McGrath]] "fell in love" with [[Jane Austen]]'s 1815 novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', while he was an undergraduate at [[Princeton University]]. He believed the book would make a great film, but it was not until a decade later that he was given a chance to work on the idea.&lt;ref name="Chollet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22515311.html|title=Clued into Austen's 'Emma'|last=Chollet|first=Laurence|date=August 11, 1996|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]]|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1995 for his work on ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]]'', McGrath decided to make the most of the moment and took his script idea for a film adaptation of ''Emma'' to [[Miramax Films]].&lt;ref name="Chollet" /&gt; McGrath had initially wanted to write a modern version of the novel, set on the [[Upper East Side]] of New York City. Miramax's co-chairman, [[Harvey Weinstein]], liked the idea of a contemporary take on the novel.&lt;ref name="Chollet" /&gt; McGrath was unaware that [[Amy Heckerling]]'s ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' was already in production until plans for ''Emma'' were well underway.&lt;ref name="Chollet" /&gt;

===Casting===
McGrath decided to bring in American actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] to audition for [[Emma Woodhouse]], after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in ''[[Flesh and Bone (film)|Flesh and Bone]]''.&lt;ref name="JClark"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-21/entertainment/ca-26277_1_american-girl/3|title=The Girl Can't Help It|last=Clark|first=John|date=July 21, 1996|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his decision to bring Paltrow in for the part, McGrath revealed "The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people. I grew up in Texas, and I have never heard an actor or actress not from Texas sound remotely like a real Texan. I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'"&lt;ref name="JClark" /&gt; Following the read through, the co-chairman of [[Miramax]], [[Harvey Weinstein]], decided to give ''Emma'' the green-light. However, he wanted Paltrow to appear in ''[[The Pallbearer]]'' first, before going ahead and allowing the film to be made.&lt;ref name="JClark" /&gt; While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself do her own research for the part.&lt;ref name="Strauss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PLAIN+JANE+%3A+NOT+A+%60CLUELESS'+REMAKE+OF+AUSTEN,+%60EMMA'+TACKLES...-a083956396|title=Plain Jane : Not a 'Clueless' remake of Austen, 'Emma' tackles classic story head-on|last=Strauss|first=Bob|date=July 31, 1996|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the "highly stylized" manners and dialect during a three-week rehearsal period.&lt;ref name="Strauss" /&gt; 
[[File:Gwyneth Paltrow avp Iron Man 3 Paris.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] was picked by the director to portray [[Emma Woodhouse]].]]
[[Jeremy Northam]] revealed that when he first tried to read ''Emma'', he did not get very far and was not a fan.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24974961.html|title=An ideal squeeze Jeremy Northam is the latest hero of a screen Jane Austen|last=Donnelly|first=Rachel|date=September 14, 1996|work=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irish Times Trust|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he read the script for the film, he was initially considered for another role, but he wanted to play [[George Knightley]].&lt;ref name="Donnelly" /&gt; He stated "When I met the director, we got on very well and we talked about everything except the film. At the end of it, he said he thought Knightley was the part for me, so I didn't have to bring up the issue at all."&lt;ref name="Donnelly" /&gt; Northam added that Knightley's faith in Emma becoming a better person was one of the reasons he loved the character.&lt;ref name="Donnelly" /&gt; Australian actress [[Toni Collette]] was cast as Harriet Smith.&lt;ref name="Ganahl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Aussie-actress-shines-in-the-latest-Austen-outing-3131029.php|title=Aussie actress shines in the latest Austen outing|last=Ganahl|first=Jane|date=August 4, 1996|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collette also struggled to get into the Austen books when she was younger, but after reading ''Emma'', which she deemed "warm and witty and clever", she began to appreciate them more.&lt;ref name="Ganahl" /&gt; Collette had to gain weight to portray "the Rubenesque Harriet" and she explained "I think it's important for people to look real in films. There's a tendency to go Barbie doll and I don't agree with that at all."&lt;ref name="Ganahl" /&gt;

[[Ewan McGregor]] was cast as Frank Churchill. He told Adam Higginbotham from ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he chose to star in ''Emma'' because he thought it would be something different from his previous role in ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/07/features.magazine|title=Scot free|last=Higginbotham|first=Adam|date=September 7, 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor later regretted appearing in the film, saying "My decision-making was wrong. It's the only time I've done that. And I learnt from it, you know. So I'm glad of that – because it was early on and I learnt my lesson. It's a good film, ''Emma'', but I'm just... not very good in it. I'm not helped because I'm also wearing the world's worst wig. It's quite a laugh, checking that wig out."&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; Real-life mother and daughter, [[Phyllida Law]] and [[Sophie Thompson]], portrayed Mrs and Miss Bates.&lt;ref name="Gritten"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-28/entertainment/ca-28711_1_miss-bates|title=Mother-daughter Comedy Team|last=Gritten|first=David|date=July 28, 1996|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson revealed that it was a coincidence that she and her mother were cast alongside each other, as the casting director had their names on separate lists.&lt;ref name="Gritten" /&gt; McGrath initially believed Thompson to be too young to play Miss Bates, but he changed his mind after seeing her wearing glasses with her hair down.&lt;ref name="Gritten" /&gt;

[[Alan Cumming]] appeared as Reverend Philip Elton, who falls in love with Emma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-29/entertainment/ca-8402_1_british-critics|title=Jumping From the Bard to 'GoldenEye'|last=Mills|first=Nancy|date=November 29, 1995|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumming wrote on his official website that the friendship that developed between himself and McGrath was one of the most memorable things about his time working on the film.&lt;ref name="Cumming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alancumming.com/done.php?id=11 |title=Emma |publisher=Alancumming.com |accessdate=November 29, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to state that the worst thing about the shoot was his hair, which had been lightened and curled for the character.&lt;ref name="Cumming" /&gt; [[Juliet Stevenson]] portrayed the "ghastly" Mrs Elton, while [[Polly Walker]] and [[Greta Scacchi]] starred as Jane Fairfax and Anne Taylor respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/1996-12-13-jane-austen-on-saccharine|title=Jane Austen on saccharine|last=Malcolm|first=Derek|date=December 31, 1996|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|publisher=M&amp;G Media Ltd|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/people/polly_walker_person_page.shtml|title=Polly Walker|date=April 2007|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23172288.html|title=Endurance test|last=Kunz|first=Mary|date=April 28, 2000|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cast members included [[Edward Woodall]] as Robert Martin, [[James Cosmo]] as Mr Weston and [[Denys Hawthorne]] as Mr Woodhouse, in one of his last film appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984920,00.html|title=Cinema: A touch of class|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=July 29, 1996|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/01/denys-hawthorne-obituary|title=Denys Hawthorne obituary|last=Norman|first=Neil|date=November 1, 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===
[[File:Dress worn by Gwyneth Paltrow in Emma.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Emma's wedding dress created by Ruth Myers.]]
British costume designer [[Ruth Myers (costume designer)|Ruth Myers]] created and designed the clothing for the film.&lt;ref name="De Witt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/COSTUME+COUTURE+%3A+DESIGNERS+CREATE+CHARACTERS+WITH+CLOTHING+FIT+FOR...-a083859981|title=Costume Couture: Designers create characters with clothing fit for an Oscar|last=De Witt|first=Barbara|date=March 13, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wanted to mirror the lightness of the script within the costumes and give "a spark of color and life" to the early 19th century setting.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9310041_ITM|title=Myers' way: Costume designer Ruth Myers runs the stylistic gamut with 'LA Confidential' &amp; 'A Thousand Acres'|last=Calhoun|first=John|date=October 1, 1997|work=[[AccessMyLibrary]]|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her research, Myers noted a similarity between the fashions after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[1920s in fashion|1920s]], saying that they had "the same sort of flapperish quality".&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; The designer explained "The moment I set to research it, more and more it kept striking me what the similarities were between the two periods. It was a period of freedom of costume for women, and it was a period of constant diversions for the upper classes–picnics, dinners, balls, dances. What I wanted to do was make it look like the watercolors of the period, which are very bright and very clear, with very specific colors."&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;

Myers went on to reveal that she did not want the costumes to have a "heavy English look" and instead she wanted "to get the freedom of bodies that you see in all the drawings, the form of the body underneath, the swell of the breasts."&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt; Myers told Barbara De Witt from the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' that using pastel-colored clothing to get the watercolor effect was one of her major challenges during the production.&lt;ref name="De Witt" /&gt; The designer was later criticised for being inaccurate, but she stated that she did not want the costumes to look old or [[Sepia (color)|sepia]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun" /&gt;   Myers only had five weeks in which to create 150 costumes for the production, and she was constantly working on the set.&lt;ref name="De Witt" /&gt;

Emma's wedding dress was made from silk crepe and embroidered with a small sprig pattern, while the sleeves and the train were made from embroidered net.&lt;ref name="WeddingDress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/env-acadcostume1-pic,0,875870.photo|title=Emma|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the dress, Myers stated "The inspiration for Emma's wedding dress began with a small amount of exquisite vintage lace that became the overlay. I wanted a look that would work not only for the period but also one that would compliment Gwyneth Paltrow's youth, swan neck, and incredible beauty. I was also hoping to evoke happiness and the English countryside; the sun did shine on the day we shot the scene!"&lt;ref name="WeddingDress" /&gt;

The musical score of the film was written by British composer [[Rachel Portman]]. It was released on July 29, 1996.&lt;ref name="Ankeny" /&gt; Portman told Rebecca Jones from the [[BBC]] that her score was "purely classical". She continued "It is an orchestral piece, by which I mean that there is nothing in it that you wouldn't find in a symphony orchestra. It was influenced by my roots and my classical background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1489097.stm|title=Proms go to the movies|last=Jones|first=Rebecca|date=August 13, 2001|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portman used various instruments to give a voice to the characters. She revealed that "a quivering violin" would represent Harriet's uneasy stomach, while "a bittersweet clarinet" would accompany Emma though her emotional journey.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/05/entertainment/et-tips5|title=Music's Key Role in Movies' Moods|last=Friedman|first=Josh|date=August 5, 2002|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Friedman from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' believed Portman's "crafty score guides the audience through the heroine's game playing, and ultimately, to her romantic destiny."&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt; He also thought the music had "a sneaky, circular feel".&lt;ref name="Friedman" /&gt;

''[[Playbill]]'s'' Ken LaFave commented that the score "underlined the period romanticism" in ''Emma'' and contained a "string-rich, romantic sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbillarts.com/features/article/205.html|title=Composer's Notes|last=LaFave|first=Ken|date=February 1, 2003|work=[[Playbill]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Ankeny, a music critic for ''[[Allmusic]]'', wrote that Portman's score to ''Emma'' employed all of her "signatures" like "whimsical yet romantic melodies, fluffy string arrangements, and woodwind solos", which would be familiar to anyone who had listened to her previous film scores.&lt;ref name="Ankeny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/emma-original-score-mw0000611677|title=Emma (Original Score)|first=Ankeny|last=Jason|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Guide]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "it seems as if she's simply going through the motions, content to operate within the confines of an aesthetic that, admittedly, is hers and hers alone.

Although in general staying close to the plot of the book, the screenplay by [[Douglas McGrath]] enlivens the banter between the staid Mr Knightley and the vivacious Emma, making the basis of their attraction more apparent.

Austen's original novel deals with Emma's false sense of class superiority, for which she is eventually chastised.  In an essay from ''Jane Austen in Hollywood'', Nora Nachumi writes that, due partly to Paltrow's star status, Emma appears less humbled by the end of this film than she does in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Nichols, The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies, Times Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8050-7198-9}},&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film has received generally positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 84% based on reviews from 50 critics, with a rating average of 7.1 out of 10. The consensus writes: "''Emma'' marks an auspicious debut for writer-director Douglas McGrath, making the most of its Jane Austen source material – and a charming performance from Gwyneth Paltrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1073316-emma/|title=Emma (1996)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a rating of 66 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/emma|title=Emma|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Eisner, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', proclaimed "Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes."&lt;ref name="Eisner" /&gt;

[[File:Enchiridion geistlicher Gesänge 28.jpg|thumb|''Der XIII. Psalm. "{{Lang|la|Dixit insipiens in cor.|italic=unset}}'', p. 2, Erfurt Enchiridion, 1524]]
"'''{{lang|de|Es spricht der Unweisen Mund wohl|italic=unset}}'''" ("The mouth of fools doth God confess")&lt;ref name="Hymnary" /&gt; is a Lutheran [[hymn]] of 1524, with words written by [[Martin Luther]] in 1523, paraphrasing [[Psalm 14]]. It was published as one of eight songs in 1524 in the [[first Lutheran hymnal]], the Achtliederbuch. It was also published later that year in the [[Erfurt Enchiridion|Erfurt ''Enchiridion'']]. It has appeared in many hymnals, both in German and in translation. The text inspired vocal and organ music by composers such as [[Johann Pachelbel]].

== History and text ==

At the end of 1523, Luther paraphrased [[Psalm 14]] (Psalm 13 in [[Vulgata]] numbering), in Latin {{lang|la|Dixit insipiens in cor|italic=unset}}, attempting to make the psalms accessible to Protestant church services in German. As he did with "{{Lang|de|[[Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein]]|italic=unset}}", Luther expanded the content of the psalm to show the precise situation of the early [[Reformation]] as a time of conflict.&lt;ref name="Hofreiter" /&gt; Luther wrote six [[stanza]]s of seven lines each.&lt;ref name="Gesellschaft" /&gt;

The hymn was one of the eight hymns in the [[first Lutheran hymnal]], published 1524 in [[Nuremberg]] under the title {{lang|de|Etlich Cristlich lider}} (Some Christian songs), also called Achtliederbuch,&lt;ref name="Wursten" /&gt; which contained four songs by Luther, three by [[Paul Speratus|Speratus]], and one by [[Justus Jonas]].&lt;ref name="Wursten" /&gt; Later that same year it appeared in Erfurt in ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion|Eyn Enchiridion]]'', and in Wittenberg in [[Johann Walter]]'s choral hymnal {{lang|de|[[Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn]]}}&lt;ref name="Gesellschaft" /&gt; in a five-part setting.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;

== Melody and settings ==
In the Achtliederbuch, the hymn was indicated to be sung to the same melody as "{{lang|de|[[Es ist das Heil uns kommen her]]|italic=unset}}" by [[Paul Speratus]].&lt;ref name="Crist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chorale melody 1" /&gt; In the Walter hymnal, it appeared with a different melody.&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt;

The hymn was set by composers for instruments and for voices. [[Johann Pachelbel]] composed three [[chorale prelude]]s for organ as part of {{lang|de|Erster Theil etlicher Choräle (Choräle zum praeambuliren)}} before 1693. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] set the hymn in a four-part setting, BWV 308,&lt;ref name="Bach" /&gt; but without text. The text was added in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe.&lt;ref name="Chorale" /&gt;

== Translation ==
The hymn was translated to English as "The mouth of fools doth God confess" and appeared in R. Massie's ''M. Luther's Spiritual Songs'' in 1854. It was copied to other hymnals. Other, less common translations were published in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Hymnary" /&gt;

An '''essay mill''' (also '''term paper mill''') is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit [[academic fraud]]. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; The similar '''essay bank''' concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.

==History==
The idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which "paper reservoirs" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as "fraternity files," these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students.&lt;ref name="Stavisky"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavisky |first=Leonard Price |title=Term Paper 'Mills', Academic Plagiarism, and State Regulation |journal=Political Science Quarterly |date=1973 |pages=445–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=August 2015|reason=volume, issue, and month missing, so source cannot be verified.}} These essay banks inspired the commercialization of [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for [[Doctoral dissertation|dissertations]], [[Master's thesis|theses]], and [[term paper]]s.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

In conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

Soon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses.&lt;ref name="Pemberton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pemberton|first=Michael |title=Threshold of Desperation: Winning the Fight Against Term Paper Mills |journal=Writing Instructor |date=March 1992 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=143–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets,  speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses.&lt;ref name="Stavisky" /&gt;

==Products and services==
"Essay mill" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns.&lt;ref name="Pemberton" /&gt; By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an [[e-commerce]] business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website.  Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches.

To obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that sparks their interest. A writer will take anything that they know they can write something that will be quick and hit the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Depending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a "C" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty.

Similar to essay mills, an '''essay bank''' is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays.  Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills.

==Legal status==

Although essay mills and the students who use them are considered unethical by many educational professionals, they do not violate copyright law; the mill is the legal copyright holder of the papers, and the papers are licensed to paying students for limited use.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The mill may, however, hold the student legally responsible in the case where they redistribute the paper to other students without the permission of the mill.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In informal settings where students exchange papers without any formal licensing or transfer of copyright, copyright violation may occur, but it is unlikely that the students will press charges, since they would incriminate themselves by doing so.{{Citation needed|reason=Parts of this paragraph seem to express a legal opinion. Whose opinion is it?|date=May 2014}}

In some countries, essay mills are legally allowed to operate because of the way in which they describe their services.  Essay mills state that the papers that they produce are not intended to be submitted for credit, but rather to be used by the customer to generate ideas to his or her own paper.  When asked if their services are considered cheating, one online company states that, "No, it’s not.  Dealing with us is pretty much like going to the library, where we would be acting as a helpful librarian helping you get enough material for a good grade. We are only offering you to make use of our take on your assignment and the results of our research on your paper's topic."  The company is not responsible if the customer submits the essay verbatim for credit because that goes against the company’s terms of use.

While there is no federal law against the operation of essay mills, there are over a dozen individual states in the US that have their own laws against them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of ''State of New York v. {{sic|hide=y|reason=Yes, it's "Saksniit", not "Saksnitt", etc.|Saksniit}}''.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit"&gt;Decision, [http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT State of New York v. Saksniit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063159/http://www.leagle.com/decision/197262369Misc2d554_1483.xml/STATE%20OF%20NEW%20YORK%20v.%20SAKSNIIT |date=March 4, 2016 }}, 69 Misc.2d 554 (1972). New York State Supreme Court, Special Term, New York County. April 18, 1972. Via Leagle.com. Accessed: August 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law.  The law "condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same."&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jeffes|first1=Errin J. |last2=Janosik|first2=Steven M. |title=The Courts' Response to Student Cheating with the Help of Term Paper Mills: Implications for Student Affairs Administrators |journal=College Student Affairs Journal |volume=21 |issue=2 |date=2002 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades.&lt;ref name="NY vs. Saksniit" /&gt; The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system.  The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York.&lt;ref name="Jeffes &amp; Janosik" /&gt; Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them.

California Education Code Section 66400 "penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ...." The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit.  State residents or academic institutions "acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public" can file suit against offenders for "any relief as is necessary."&lt;ref name="Mocello"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mocello |first=Marie |title=Essay Mills 101: Selling College Term Papers Online May Be a Crime |work=Yahoo Contributor Network: Yahoo Voices |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|date=August 2015|reason=User-generated content.}}{{dead link|date=August 2015|reason=YCN/YV doesn't even exist any more; see http://searchengineland.com/panda-strikes-yahoo-voices-yahoo-contributor-network-closing-195698}} This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received.

The 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree [[misdemeanor]] to "sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale" a "written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment" to another for submission "unaltered to a substantial degree."&lt;ref name="Mocello" /&gt; In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison.

==Criticism and controversy==
The [[academic community]] has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud.

Some essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that "any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Major|first=Lee Elliot |title=Web of Deceit |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jan/08/highereducation.students |accessdate=May 15, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=8 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other essay mills claim that they are "scholarly publishing houses" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work.

Students from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills.  Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year.  One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Ruff|first1=Bob|last2=Costello|first2=Carol |title=Educating America: Cheating on Papers is a Booming Web Business |work=American Morning Blogs |publisher=CNN |url= http://am.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/30/cheating-on-papers-is-a-booming-web-business |ps=&lt;!--This is an official CNN blog, subject to editorial control, not a primary source.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies.  Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral.  People view essay mills as [[ethical]] for different reasons.  Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading.  Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes.  They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;  Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ethics in Computing |website=ethics.csc.ncsu.edu |publisher=North Carolina State University |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url= http://ethics.csc.ncsu.edu/commerce/termpapers/study.php |accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills.  Essay mills have been compared to business situations.  Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor.  [[Outsourcing]] labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Conversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual’s work.  Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning.  Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself.  Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of ''The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty'', worry about the message term paper mills send to students.  He believes the existence of essay mills validates slacking off.  Ariely has come across essay mills use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Ariely |first=Dan |title=Essay Mills – A Coarse Lesson on Cheating |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 2012 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/17/opinion/la-oe-ariely-cheating-20120617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students generally know that using essay mill services is not right; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. However, the same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services.&lt;ref name="Scanlon &amp; Neumann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scanlon|first1=Patrick |last2=Neumann|first2=David |title=Internet Plagiarism among College Students |journal=Journal of College Student Development |date=2002 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=374–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many customers believe that when they are ordering an essay [[online]], that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |title=Cheating Goes Global as Essay Mills Multiply |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=March 2009 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Cheating-Goes-Global-as-Essay/32817/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt;

Having essay mills set up overseas allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Compared to American writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'' from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he makes half of what the paper sells for.&lt;ref name="Dante"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dante |first=Ed |title=The Shadow Scholar |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=November 2010 |url= http://chronicle.com/article/The-Shadow-Scholar/125329/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the US, the amount that writers get paid can vary. Some American writers are only able to bring in around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months which can make some writers have to take up a second job.&lt;ref name="Bartlett" /&gt; Other American writers are more successful when working for essay mills. Some of the better writers are able to make up to $5,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Dante" /&gt;

==Strategies for combating academic fraud==
Universities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of [[academic misconduct]]. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as [[Turnitin]]) against databases of known "essay mill" term papers.

Other universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students [[oral examination]]s on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that  he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program.

When a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2246">'''Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles''' is a non-profit foundation located in [[Arles]] France dedicated to the work and legacy of [[Vincent Van Gogh]]. Its goal is to generate and promote cultural and artistic activities with reference to the oeuvre of Vincent van Gogh as related to the time he spent in Arles, and the intention that van Gogh expressed in establishing an international center of artistic creation and exchange in Arles. The artistic director is editor-in-chief of [[Parkett]], [[Bice Curiger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-vincentvangogh-arles.org/en/foundation/organization/team/ Fondation Vincent van Gogh. Team]. Retrieved 2 July 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1983 Yolande Clergue, a curator married to the photographer [[Lucien Clergue]], founded the Association for the Creation of the Fondation Van Gogh (subsequently known simply as the Fondation Van Gogh).
 
In 1985 Yolande Clergue proposed initiating a collection of works executed by contemporary artists in tribute to Van Gogh, including [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. Bacon responded enthusiastically by producing a painting specifically for the foundation. More than ninety artists chose to contribute to this homage to Vincent van Gogh.

In 2008 Yolande Clergue’s original ambition to create a Fondation Van Gogh was given new momentum by [[Luc Hoffmann]] who established a permanent framework for activities designed to preserve the memory of Van Gogh in Arles and to foster [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-vincentvangogh-arles.org/en/foundation/presentation/introduction/ Fondation Vincent van Gogh. History]. Retrieved 2 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This new foundation was officially established in 2010, under the name of the Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles. It is now located in the Hôtel Léautaud de Donines.

The figures are based on [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]] annual reports. As all financial data is given in [[US dollars]] annual rates of change for all countries other than the United States are heavily influenced by [[exchange rate]] fluctuations as well as by actual changes in revenue in local currency terms.

It is important to note that the information presented in this page only accounts for revenue generated from the recorded music industry (recorded music and auxiliary revenues generated by these recordings), and is not reflective of the entirety of the music industry including sectors such as publishing, live music, etc.

''Also see [[Conch (instrument)]]''
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
[[File:Antique Japanese horagi (conch shell trumpet).JPG|300px|thumb|right|Japanese horagai. A conch shell used for religious purposes or as a [[signal instrument|signal]] for [[samurai]]]]
'''''{{nihongo|Horagai|[[wiktionary:法|法]][[wiktionary:螺|螺]][[wiktionary:貝|貝]]|}}''''' (or '''''{{nihongo|jinkai|[[wiktionary:陣|陣]][[wiktionary:貝|貝]]|}}''''' ) are large [[conch shell]]s, usually from ''[[Charonia tritonis]]'', that have been used as [[trumpet]]s in Japan for many centuries. The instrument, which has served a number of purposes throughout [[Japanese history]], has been given a number of Japanese names depending on its function. Special schools still teach students to play the traditional music associated with the conch.

==Instrument==
Unlike most shell trumpets from other parts of the world which produce only one pitch, the Japanese ''hora'' or ''horagai'' can produce three or five different notes. The different pitches are achieved using a bronze or wooden mouthpiece attached to the apex of the shell's spire. At freezing temperatures (often encountered in the mountainous regions of Japan) the lips may freeze to the metal surface, so wooden or bamboo mouthpieces are used.

==Historical usage==

===Religion===
The conch is used by [[Japanese Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks for religious purposes. Its use goes back at least{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} 1,000 years, and it is still used today for some rituals, such as the ''[[omizutori]]'' (water drawing) portion of the [[Shuni-e]] rites at the [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Each Shugendō school has his own conch shell melodies.

The ''hora'' is especially associated with the ''[[Yamabushi]]'', [[ascetic]] warrior monks of the [[Shugendō]] tradition. The ''[[yamabushi]]'' used the trumpet to signal their presence (or movements) to one another across mountains and to accompany the chanting of [[sutra]]s.

===Military===
In war, the shell, called ''jinkai'', or "war shell", was one of several [[Commons:Category:Samurai signal devices|signal devices]] used by Japanese feudal warriors known as [[samurai]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8n9A-jWUhHMC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=samurai+horagai&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IwoQTqToJYKftweDz7DXDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=samurai%20horagai&amp;f=true ''Warriors of Medieval Japan'', Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing, 2007 P.106]&lt;/ref&gt; A large conch would be used and fitted with a bronze (or wooden) mouthpiece. It would be held in an [[openwork]] basket and blown with a different combination of "notes" to signal troops to attack, withdraw, or change strategies, in the same way a bugle or [[flugelhorn]] was used in the west. The trumpeter was called a ''kai yaku'' ([[wiktionary:貝|貝]][[wiktionary:役|役]]).

The ''jinkai'' served a similar function to [[taiko|drums]] and bells in signaling troop formations, setting a rhythm for marching, providing something of a heroic accompaniment to encourage the troops and confusing the enemy by inferring that the troop numbers were large enough to require such trumpeters. Many ''[[daimyō]]s'' (feudal lords) enlisted ''yamabushi'' to serve as ''kai yaku'', due to their experience with the instrument.

The sound of ''jinkai'' is often used in motion pictures and television dramas as a symbolic sound effect indicating an impending battle, e.g., ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' or the 2007 [[Taiga drama]] ''[[Fūrinkazan]]'', but both of these screen renditions use deep, resonating monotones, not the melodic tones that ''yamabushi'' used for relaying messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5837">[[File:Howe Amber Cup 1857.png|thumb|Hove amber cup, from original description in 1857]]
The '''Hove amber cup''' is a [[Bronze Age]] cup that was discovered in a great [[round barrow]] mound which was crudely excavated in 1856, in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]], [[England]], and is now in [[Hove Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx The Hove amber cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027000939/http://brighton-hove-rpml.org.uk/HistoryAndCollections/collectionsthemes/hovelocalhistorygallery/Pages/hoveambercup.aspx |date=2010-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found during the construction of [[Palmeira Square]].  The barrow was of exceptional size and quality, suggesting a date in the mid-Bronze Age. The Hove amber cup is one of only two found in Britain; the other was in [[Dorset]]. However, the two are not of the same style of craftsmanship.

Dated to around 1250 BCE, the amber cup was found in a [[Wessex culture]] grave in a coffin made from a treetrunk. Also in the coffin were a skeleton, a Camerton (Wessex culture) type dagger, a [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] and a small axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=A. F.|title=European Societies in the Bronze Age|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521367295|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbIVASSe9jcC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Hove+amber+cup+dagger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yr7T4C5O6qx0AX1o72_Ag&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hove%20amber%20cup%20dagger&amp;f=false|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been associated with a small group of other "unstable" cups with round bottoms, made of precious materials and found in north-western Europe.  Most are in gold, but also silver, amber and [[shale]]. The [[Ringlemere Cup]] and [[Rillaton Cup]] are the two British gold cups.  The amber would have come from the [[Baltic region]], and the group suggest early trade links between Britain and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Needham et al., full catalogue entry at pp. 97-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original account==
According to the original description by Barclay Philips, 
{{Quote|In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, some of which were picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —

An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a " lip " or " nick," and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet on each side of the surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.

That on the left of the handle is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it ; that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface ; but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.

The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — &lt;br /&gt;
External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. &lt;br /&gt;
Height, 2.5 ; depth, 2.4. &lt;br /&gt;
Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; width of lip, '125. &lt;br /&gt;
Distance of band from upper rim of lip, .5; width of band of six fillets, .3. &lt;br /&gt;
Width of handle at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6. &lt;br /&gt;
Thickness of handle, '2; depth of handle from upper surface of insertion between lip and fillet to surface below, 1'4. &lt;br /&gt;
Projection of handle from surface of cup to outer surface of handle, .85; average thickness of cup, .2.

According to these measurements I find, by calculation, that the capacity of the cup is a little more than half a pint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philips|first=Barclay|title=Discovery of a Tumulus at Hove, near Brighton, Containing an Amber Cup, &amp;c|journal=Sussex Archaeological Collections|year=1857|volume=IX|pages=119–125|url=https://archive.org/details/sussexarchaeolog09suss}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The '''Joyce Theater''' (The Joyce") is a 472-seat [[dance]] performance venue located in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. The building opened in 1941 as the [[Elgin Theater]], a movie house, and was gut-renovated and reconfigured in 1981-82 to reopen as the Joyce Theater. The Joyce is a leading presenter of dance in New York City and nationally.

==Creation of The Joyce==
In 1977, the [[Eliot Feld | Eliot Feld Ballet]] had begun exploring more affordable approaches to presenting its annual season of performances in New York City. Rental costs and house sizes of the theaters available to the company made these seasons financially risky propositions. [[Eliot Feld]], the company’s founder and Artistic Director, and Cora Cahan, its Executive Director, envisioned creating a theater specifically for smaller dance organizations that their company could use, which would also be available to other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Leslie|last2=Morgan|first2=Roger|title=Space for Dance|date=1984|publisher=Publishing Center for Cultural Resources|location=Washington, D.C.|page=101|url=https://archive.org/details/spacefordancearc00arms|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first facility they looked at in late 1978 was the [[Elgin Theater]], a defunct movie theater in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood built in 1941. They quickly commenced negotiations to purchase it, ultimately arriving at a price of $225,000 and concluded the transaction in January, 1979. The philanthropist [[LuEsther Mertz]], co-founder of [[Publishers Clearing House]] and a benefactor of the company who had supported the renovation of the company’s studio, underwrote the full cost of the purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Elgin Will Be Theater for Medium‐Sized Troupes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/29/archives/news-of-the-dance-elgin-will-be-theater-for-mediumsized-troupes-to.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=January 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing financial projections for the theater, Feld and Cahan anticipated an inclusive rental cost of around $12,000 per week. In a national survey they conducted, 73 dance organizations expressed interest in using the theater at the projected rental rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Plans to Convert Elgin To Dance Theater Falter|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/06/04/113944263.html?pageNumber=77|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 4, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings helped garner a wide range of financial support for developing the theater. The project secured a $400,000 Federal Urban Development Action Grant, which recognized its potential to provide employment and add to the vitality of its neighborhood. Other Federal Government support included a $450,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, and a guarantee of a $600,000 bank loan. Private donors and foundations such as the Rockefeller Foundation contributed the balance of the funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=Creating a Theater Just for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/creating-a-theater-just-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=July 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feld and Cahan engaged architect [[Hugh Hardy]] of the firm [[Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer]] to develop plans for a gut renovation of the facility. Major changes to the structure included the elimination of the original balcony configuration to create a steeply raked seating area on one level, new construction at the rear of the building to provide additional backstage space, and the installation of a 67 x 36 foot proscenium stage with a [[sprung floor]]. The completed theater had 472 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Leslie|last2=Morgan|first2=Roger|title=Space for Dance|date=1984|publisher=Publishing Center for Cultural Resources|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=101-102|url=https://archive.org/details/spacefordancearc00arms|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall cost of the project was $3.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance Theater Opening Delayed to April 12|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/20/arts/dance-theater-opening-delayed-to-april-12|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=December 20, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the June 25, 1981 groundbreaking, the building was renamed the Joyce Theater after the daughter of LuEsther Mertz in recognition of the elder Mertz’s leadership support of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Facelift Begins at Renamed Elgin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/theater/facelift-begins-at-renamed-elgin.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater opened with a gala performance on June 2, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennifer|first1=Dunning|title=Chelsea Program Opens Joyce Theater for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/02/theater/chelsea-program-opens-joyce-theater-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 2, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Feld organization retained ownership of the building and created a separate non-profit organization to operate the theater under a 35-year lease at a nominal rent of $1 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kisselgoff|first1=Anna|title=Creating a Theater Just for Dance|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/creating-a-theater-just-for-dance.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=July 26, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2016 conclusion of the lease term approached, the operating organization, the Joyce Theater Foundation, purchased the theater from the Feld organization for $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Joyce Theater to Buy Its Chelsea Home|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/joyce-theater-to-buy-its-chelsea-home/|accessdate=24 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both the Feld organization and the Joyce Theater Foundation operated under successive legal names during the period recounted here. For the sake of clarity, these various names are elided in this section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and management==
The Joyce is a [[501(c)3 charitable organization]] whose mission is “To serve and support the art of dance and choreography, to promote the richness and variety of the art form in its fullest expression, and to advance the public interest in, and appreciation of, dance and the allied arts of music, design, and theater.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: Mission and History|url=https://joyce.org/about/our-mission-and-history|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 27-member Board of Trustees oversees the organization. It operates on a budget of around $10 million annually that is supported by earned revenue, contributed income, government support and endowment income. Executive Director Linda Shelton oversees day-to-day activities of the Joyce, supported by a full-time staff of approximately 45 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater Foundation FY2015 IRS Form 990|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3038262|website=Guidestar|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the Joyce in 1993, Shelton was General Manager of the [[Joffrey Ballet]], and had earlier held senior management roles at [[Twyla Tharp|Twyla Tharp Dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linda Shelton Biography|url=https://www.danceusa.org/lindashelton|website=Dance/USA|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Mattocks is Director of Programming, with lead responsibility for developing each year’s presenting season.

==Main activities==
The Joyce presents an annual 40 to 45 week season on its stage, hosting an audience of approximately 150,000 people. In addition to this Chelsea season, the Joyce presents or co-presents at a small number of other venues, including the [[David H. Koch Theater]] at [[Lincoln Center]] and alternative spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater Foundation FY2015 IRS Form 990|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3038262|website=Guidestar|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through artistic residency and commissioning programs, the Joyce gives resources to established, early- and mid-career artists to advance their practice and develop new works for the Joyce stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: Artist Residency|url=https://joyce.org/artist-residency|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New commissions are supported by the Stephen and Cathy Weinroth Fund for New Works, a $1 million endowment contributed by a Joyce board member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Joyce Gets a $1 Million Fund to Foster New Dances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/01/arts/joyce-gets-a-1-million-fund-to-foster-new-dances.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also mounts a range of education, school and family programs that range from structured class visits to Joyce performances, to lessons at schools and community centers with Joyce-affiliated teaching artists, to family matinees with discount tickets for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Theater: School and Family Programs|url=https://joyce.org/school-family-programs|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center cultural center==
In 2004, The Joyce's proposal to operate a dance theater in the planned "arts hub" at the [[World Trade Center (2001–present)|World Trade Center]] was accepted by the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]]. The Joyce would have been one of several arts organizations at the facility, and proposed a 1,000-seat theater for major dance companies, with supporting programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Giving Dance a Better Presence Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/11/nyregion/giving-dance-a-better-presence-downtown.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, the vision for the cultural center has evolved through multiple iterations and tenant lists. It is currently planned as [[Performing Arts Center (Manhattan)|The Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center]], a multi-venue facility encompassing a range of performing and media arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Perlman Center: Artistic Vision|url=http://www.theperelman.org/artistic-vision/|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joyce's role in the current plan for the center has not been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Plans for Ground Zero Arts Hub Shift Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/arts/plans-for-ground-zero-arts-center-change-again.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former affiliated spaces==
===Joyce SoHo===
In 1996, The Joyce purchased a dance performance and rehearsal facility at 155 Mercer Street in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood that was owned and operated by the [[Dia Art Foundation]]. The building had been used for dance since 1985, and was sold because of financial difficulties at Dia. The Joyce obtained the building for $1.5 million with support from the [[LuEsther Mertz|LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust]], the charitable organization established by the organization's longstanding benefactor LuEsther T. Mertz upon her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Joyce Theater Buys Dia Dance Space in SoHo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/24/theater/joyce-theater-buys-dia-dance-space-in-soho.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=October 24, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joyce continued Dia's program of rehearsal space rental and performances in the 75-seat theater until 2012, when it accepted an unsolicited offer to sell the building for $27.25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pogrebin|first1=Robin|title=Joyce Theater to Buy Its Chelsea Home|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/joyce-theater-to-buy-its-chelsea-home/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DANY Studios===
In December, 2009, the Joyce leased a rehearsal studio facility at 305 West 38th Street, in Manhattan's Garment District, that it operated under the name DANY [Dance Art New York] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Rocco|first1=Claudia|title=Joyce Theater Expands Its Studio Space|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/joyce-theater-expands-its-studio-space/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility contained 11 studios. The Joyce did not renew when its lease ended in 2016 and closed DANY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DANY Studios in NYC Closing|url=http://www.danceinforma.us/articles/dany-studios-in-nyc-closing/|website=Dance Informa|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Happens''''' (stylized as '''''L!fe Happens''''') is a 2011 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Kat Coiro]] and written by Coiro and [[Krysten Ritter]]. The film stars Ritter, [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Kristen Johnston]], [[Geoff Stults]], [[Jason Biggs]], and [[Rachel Bilson]]. Ritter plays the main character, Kim, who lives with her two roommates, Deena (Bosworth) and Laura (Bilson), in Los Angeles. Kim becomes pregnant after a one-night stand so she turns to her friends for help. ''Life Happens'' was released theatrically on April 13, 2012.

==Plot==
Deena ([[Kate Bosworth]]) and Kim ([[Krysten Ritter]]) each bring home a guy one night. Realizing they have no condoms, they go looking around in their house where Kim ultimately finds the last one, but Deena takes it and Kim has [[safe sex|unprotected sex]]. One year later, Kim is a single mother. She still lives with her two girlfriends, Deena and Laura ([[Rachel Bilson]]), while trying to juggle her son named Max. She takes Max to his father Mark (Coiro), but he announces that he is not interested in being a father. Kim brings Max along to work with her one day, as a dog service company assistant to her youth-obsessed boss Francesca ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Francesca reprimands Kim for bringing Max with her and says that she would be fired if she does it again. Kim then takes Max to her grandfather ([[Seymour Cassel]]) who is currently living in a retirement home.

Meanwhile, Deena tries to finish writing her book in a library and ends up hooking up with a guy. One night, as Kim works as a bouncer in one of Francesca's parties, she falls for a guy named Nicolas ([[Geoff Stults]]) who was with two of his friends, Henri ([[Justin Kirk]]) and Sergei ([[Jason Biggs]]), attending the party. That night, Francesca finally allows Kim to have a break and meet up with Nicolas who promised to buy her a drink earlier and they spend the night getting to know each other. They quickly form a relationship after Nicolas intently asks Francesca to have Kim take his dog in his house. Kim brings along Max with her yet again where she lies to Nicolas that Max is a child of one of her roommates and that she was just relied on to look after Max. Kim asks Deena to come with her on her date with Nicolas that evening where Deena agrees. Nicholas arrives along with his friend Henri, where they look to Deena as her roommate with the baby. Kim begs Deena to just go with the lie they have come up with where Deena responds that it wouldn't take long enough for them to know that Kim is the one with a baby. They have a double date where it seems that Deena and Henri are attracted to each other, although Henri dresses up in hippie clothing.

The next day, Deena seems promoted from her career as a writer when someone could recognize her from an article she wrote. Kim on the other hand, seems to be an underdog as Francesca wouldn't allow to invest in her own dog service business. Laura, the other roommate seems to be unstable as she has been shifting jobs every week. Kim asks her to take care of Max since she has a date with Nicholas that night, but tells her she can't. She then freaks out and calls Deena who isn't answering her calls. Finally, she asks a young boy to babysit Max for her. Nicolas and Kim have sex after their romantic date, but it is not long before Nicolas discovers Kim's secret when milk leaks out of her breasts. This leaves Nicholas upset and Kim leaves.

On her way home, she sees a paramedic leave and asks Deena what happened. Kim yells at Deena for not returning home early where Deena strikes back at her saying that Max is her responsibility and there is nothing that could excuse her behavior. Deena and Kim's friendship is compromised. Kim spends all day around the house and finally quits her job telling Francesca she never looked 21. The next day, Kim informs Deena that she has to move out of the house and focus her life on being a mother and as for Deena, her successful career. Kim buys a house and visits Mark who regrets everything he said about not being ready and he wants a shot of being a dad for once. Laura then enters a show competition and seems to be successful. Kim finally reconciles with Deena and Nicolas where they all play pool together.

==Development==
In an interview, Ritter described how she and Coiro came up with the movie's plot. "Kat and I have been longtime friends.  We’re both very psychotically driven, hard-working young women, and we always had this plan to dominate the world, like the two characters in the movie.  We started writing and she had a baby, and we had this eureka moment where we just realized that’s the story we wanted to tell, about young girls, figuring out who they are and trying to have it all, but also when you throw a baby in the mix, it creates a whole other set of challenges."&lt;ref&gt;Radish, Christina.  [http://collider.com/krysten-ritter-life-happens-vamps-interview/158101/ ''Krysten Ritter Talks Life Happens, Vamps, Don't Trust the B in Apt. 23 and More''], collider.com, April 11, 2012.  Retrieved April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Life Happens'' premiered at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] and has been chosen as a selection to the 2012 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 26%, based on 31 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 4.3/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lfe_happens/ |title=''L!fe Happens'' (2012) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/life-happens |title=''Life Happens'' Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called ''Life Happens'' "a much milder and more grounded comedy than the recent ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'', with a smart if somewhat contrived script".&lt;ref&gt;Roeper, Richard. [http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/11738124-421/life-happens-three-babes-and-a-baby.html ''Life Happens: Three babes and a baby''], ''Chicago Sun-Times'', April 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Goldstein of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said "the film is rarely hijacked by its more familiar themes and sitcom potential. Instead, aided by a nimbly voluble script by Kat Coiro and Ritter, it emerges as an amusing kaleidoscope of contemporary urban angst and romantic aspirations."&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Gary. [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/12/entertainment/la-et-capsules-20120413 ''Life Happens spins single mom comedy''], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 12, 2012.  Retrieved April 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' liked the relationship between the women but thought the "execution dissipate[d] most of the film's potential".&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, Justin. [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/life-happens-film-review-207747 ''Life Happens'': Film Review], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', July 1, 2011. Retrieved April 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Weitzman of ''[[Daily News (New York)|The New York Daily News]]'' rated the film three out of five stars, noting that the filmmakers "spice up the formula just enough to keep us watching".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, Elizabeth. [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movie-review-life-article-1.1060630?localLinksEnabled=false Movie review: ''Life Happens''], ''The New York Daily News'', April 12, 2012. Retrieved April 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS ''Viking'' (already used in the film) in order to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} off the [[Horse Islands (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Horse Islands]]. On March 15, 1931, a cache of [[dynamite]] loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of [[iceberg]]s, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the ''Viking'' to catch fire and sink,&lt;ref name="Rist"&gt;Rist 2001, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhodes95"&gt;Rhodes 2001, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Film and Video - Early Days"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/arts/early_days.html| title=Film and Video - Early Days| publisher=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage| accessdate=December 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing 27&lt;ref name="Andrew McIntosh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiff.net/CANADIANFILMENCYCLOPEDIA/content/films/viking |title=The Viking (White Thunder) |author=Andrew McIntosh |publisher=Canadian Film Encyclopedia |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  members of the crew who were filming an iceberg, including Frissell and cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod.

* ''[[The Viking (1931 film)|The Viking]]'' (1931), given its public release over three months after producer [[Varick Frissell]]'s death in an explosion, along with 26 other crew members, on board the [[SS Viking|SS ''Viking'']]; the film, shot on location in [[Newfoundland]] by co-directors [[George Melford]] and Frissell (Melford filming actors, Frissell filming nature) in the winter of 1930-31, had been nominally complete when Frissell screened it privately at the [[Nickel Theatre]] at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] on March 5, 1931, but the producer came away feeling it needed more sensational and realistic footage from the [[Labrador]] ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS ''Viking'' (already used in the film) for its annual seal hunt to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} off the [[Horse Islands (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Horse Islands]]. On March 15, 1931, while trying to film an iceberg, Frissell, cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod, and 25&lt;ref name="Andrew McIntosh"/&gt; other film crew members were killed when a cache of [[dynamite]] loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of [[iceberg]]s, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the ''Viking'' to catch fire and sink.&lt;ref name="Rist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhodes95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Film and Video - Early Days"/&gt; The film that had been screened at the Nickel Theatre was subsequently polished and prepared for release by associate producer Roy W. Gates, who directed a prologue featuring Newfoundland explorer Sir [[Wilfred Grenfell]], who had known and worked with Frissell, lionizing the producer and the men who had died with him. A French-language version of the film, ''Ceux du "Viking"'', shot simultaneously with Melford's English-language version by French director René Ginet and also produced by Frissell and featuring his nature footage, was released in February 1932, 11 months after Frissell's death.

* ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator [[Mark Hellinger]]'s death from a sudden [[heart attack]]; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure. Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a ''"guarantee of release"'' clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio.

==Actors and actresses==
&lt;!-- This list is NOT a "last films" list. If the actor died months after the film's release, they should not be included here Actors and actresses ONLY; producers and composers need their own sections, and writers of a source novel don't count in the least here. --&gt;
In several cases, actors or actresses have died prior to the release of a film: either during filming or after it has been completed, but is yet to be released. In the case that the actor dies during filming, their scenes are often completed by [[stunt double]]s, or through special effects. Only people who actually appear in some capacity in a posthumously released film are listed here. Those who were scheduled to start a project, but died before filming began, are not included.

===1910s===
* ''[[A Dash Through the Clouds]]'' (1912), released just twenty-three days after aviator and actor [[Philip Orin Parmelee]]'s death in a plane crash; he was piloting an airplane at an air show in [[Yakima, Washington]], on June 1, 1912, at altitudes variously described from 400 to 2,000 feet, when air turbulence flipped over his airplane and caused it to crash, killing him instantly.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Aviator Parmelee Plunges to Death.

* ''A Woman's Way'' (1913), ''In the Haunts of Fear'' (1913), and ''The Blight'' (1913), all released after [[Joseph Graybill]]'s death at the age of 26—strangely, different records state conflicting information as to the cause of Graybill's death; the [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB) lists it as acute [[spinal meningitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337033/|title=Joseph Graybill|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first death notice in the ''[[New York Times]]'' contradicts the death certificate as to the day of death—it lists the cause of death on August 2, not the 3, as a [[nervous breakdown]]&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 2, 1913, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—but an obituary on August 4 lists the cause as [[gastritis]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 4, 1913, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting all of these, a 1913 ''Motion Picture Story'' magazine article states that he had a ''"nervous disorder of the optic nerve and died"''. Finally, Graybill's death certificate states that the cause of death was acute pachymeningitis and a contributory factor was [[alcohol poisoning]]; both the certificate and the first death notice note he entered [[Bellevue Hospital]] on July 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/vital_records/|title=Birth, Death, Marriage &amp; Divorce Records|work=state.ny.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Across the Border'' (1914), released over a month after Grace McHugh's death during filming; while on location on the [[Arkansas River]] in [[Colorado]], re-shooting a scene of McHugh fording the river on horseback, her horse lost its footing, and the actress was thrown into the swift current. Cinematographer Owen Carter stopped filming and plunged into the river to save her; together they succeeded in reaching a sandbar, which unfortunately proved to be quicksand, and they both drowned.

* ''The Great Romance'' (1919), ''Shadows of Suspicion'' (1919), and ''A Man of Honor'' (1919), all released after [[Harold Lockwood]]'s death in the [[1918 flu pandemic]]; because he died before filming on ''Shadows of Suspicion'' was completed, changes were made to the script, and the film was completed using a double shot from behind to stand in for Lockwood.

He forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks, so that he could see to pull out of the dive; the lights remained full on, blinding him, and he crashed. The finished film showed this crash, and its aftermath, in gruesome detail.
* ''[[Everybody's Sweetheart (1920 film)|Everybody's Sweetheart]]'' (1920), released less than a month after [[Olive Thomas]]'s death, at the age of 25; on the night of September 5, 1920, Thomas and her husband, [[Jack Pickford]], went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the [[Montparnasse]] Quarter of Paris. Returning to their room in the [[Hotel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]] around 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the room for a final round of drugs. An intoxicated and tired Thomas accidentally ingested a large dose of a [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury bichloride]] liquid solution, which had been prescribed for her husband's chronic [[syphilis]]. Being liquid it was supposed to be applied topically, not ingested.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top"&gt;Long, Bruce. Editor.

The label was in [[French language|French]], which may have added to the confusion.

* ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' (1922), released almost a year after Rudolph Christians's death from pneumonia; the [[Cinema of Germany|German actor]], father of [[Cinema of Austria|Austrian stage and screen actress]] [[Mady Christians]], was playing the central part of the cuckolded American envoy in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s film. As Christians died in the middle of production, von Stroheim was forced to bring in actor [[Robert Edeson]] (back to camera) to finish Christians's scenes.

* ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1924 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]'' (1924), almost a year after actress [[Martha Mansfield]]'s death at the age of 24; on November 30, 1923, while working on the film on location in [[San Antonio, Texas]], Mansfield was severely [[burn]]ed when a [[match]], tossed by a cast member, ignited her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] costume of [[Hoop skirt|hoopskirts]] and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy [[overcoat]] over her. The [[chauffeur]] of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body. She was rushed to a Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in San Antonio, where she died in less than twenty-four hours; however, most of Mansfield's scenes had already been shot, so production on the film continued.

Sari mistook this chimney for a scenery [[balcony]], climbed up, and fell into a heating [[boiler]], where she died instantly.

Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a ''"guarantee of release"'' clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio.
* ''[[Noose (film)|Noose]]'' (1948) and ''[[Brass Monkey (film)|Brass Monkey]]'' (1948), both released after [[Carole Landis]]'s suicide; Landis was reportedly crushed when her lover, actor [[Rex Harrison]], refused to divorce his wife, [[Lilli Palmer]], for her. Unable to cope any longer, she committed suicide at her [[Pacific Palisades, California|Pacific Palisades]] home by taking an overdose of [[Secobarbital|Seconal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert |title=The Hollywood Book of Death: The Bizarre, Often Sordid, Passings of More Than 125 American Movie and TV Idols|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2002|edition=3|page=315|isbn=0-8092-2227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gans|first=Eric Lawrence|title=Carole Landis: A Most Beautiful Girl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4m7nPlavJi8C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;ct=result#PPA199,M1|accessdate=13 June 2009|year=2008|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-013-5|pages=197–199 |chapter=The Good Die Young (1948)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had spent her final night alive with Harrison; the next afternoon, he and the maid discovered her on the bathroom floor.

He died having filmed two minutes of footage.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; This footage, not shot for ''Plan 9'', but for two separate, unfinished [[Ed Wood]] projects, was combined and then inter-cut with new footage featuring a double, [[Tom Mason]], who looked nothing like Lugosi, in order to put a credit for Lugosi on the picture.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
* ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' (1959), following [[Tyrone Power]]'s death of a sudden heart attack; having completed 75 per cent of the required shooting, Power's death forced the production to recast the role with [[Yul Brynner]] and reshoot most of Power's scenes. Footage of Power, however, was retained for long shots, such as in the sword fighting sequence toward the end of the film, and reels featuring the rest of Power's performance are rumored to be kept locked away in vaults to this day.

* ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), released on what would have been actor [[Clark Gable]]'s 60th birthday; he had died three months earlier of a heart attack, brought on in part, according to later reports, by the stress of difficulties working with co-star [[Marilyn Monroe]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The car flipped over, and burst into flames. Dorléac had been ''en route'' to Nice airport and was afraid of missing her flight. She was seen struggling to get out of the car, but was unable to open the door; police later identified her body only from the fragment of a cheque book, a diary, and her driving license.

Due to his death occurring in the middle of production, his role was posthumously made smaller, and what footage needed to be reshot for scenes where Lahr had completed his close-ups employed burlesque legend Joey Faye, shot from behind, to fill in for Lahr.
* ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), released seven months after [[Al Mulock]]'s suicide; Mulock, a noted [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] [[character actor]], played the gunslinger Knuckles in the opening sequence. This sequence, the last filmed in Spain on the production, was scheduled for four days; Mulock committed suicide after the third day's shooting, for reasons that are still unclear, by jumping from his hotel room window, several floors up, in full costume. Production manager Claudio Mancini and screenwriter Mickey Knox, who were sitting in a room in the hotel, witnessed Mulock's body pass by their window. Knox recalled in an interview that while Mancini put Mulock, still in his costume, in his car to drive him to the hospital, [[Cinema of Italy|director]] [[Sergio Leone]] said to Mancini, "Get the costume! We need the costume!" As Mulock had already shot most of his close-ups and a few medium and wide shots, only a double, of similar height and build, was needed to complete the sequence; looking similar enough to pass, screenwriter Knox was drafted into taking Mulock's place for those shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/articles/knox.html |title=Articles |publisher=Fistful-of-Leone |date= |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulock's absence is obvious in the last few minutes of the sequence; while the other two gunslingers, played by [[Woody Strode]] and [[Jack Elam]], get close-up reaction shots to [[Charles Bronson]]'s character, Knuckles gets none before he is shot to death.

After his death, his voice was dubbed by actor [[Robert Rietty]], although [[impressionist]] [[Rich Little]] also dubbed three words near the end of the picture (''"Harry, come on"''), and six words in Shaw's own voice were deemed usable (''"Too hot in that train"'' and ''"Harry"'').

'''Key works of {{Interlanguage link multi|Carolingian illumination|de|3=Karolingische Buchmalerei}}''' are those [[Illuminated manuscript]]s of the [[Carolingian period]] which are recognised in art historical scholarship as works of particular artistic significance (especially those included in general overviews).

The first work to be considered Carolingian is the [[Godescalc Evangelistary]], which was created for [[Charlemagne]] between 781 and 783. Until this point, [[Merovingian illumination|Merovingian]] and [[Insular illumination]] had continued without a breach. The developers of Carolingian illumination were the so-called "court school of Charlemagne" at the [[Palace of Aachen]], which created the manuscripts of the "{{Interlanguage link multi|Ada School|de|3=Ada-Gruppe}}." Contemporary was the "Palace School" which was probably based in the same place, but whose artists were from [[Eastern Roman Empire|Byzantium]] or [[Byzantine Italy]]. The codices of this school are also known as the "group of the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]]" after their most outstanding examples. After the death of Charlemagne, the centre of illumination shifted to [[Rheims]], [[Tours]] and [[Metz]]. Since the Court School dominated in the time of Charlemagne, it was more influential in later times than the works of the Palace School. The high point of Carolingian illumination came to an end in the late ninth century. In late Carolingian times a {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco-Saxon School|fr|3=École franco-saxonne}} developed which incorporated forms from insular illumination, before a new epoch began at the end of the tenth century with the development of {{Interlanguage link multi|Ottonian illumination|de|3=ottonischen Buchmalerei}}

[[File:Leonidas Molon Labe.jpg|thumb|Commemorative statue of King [[Leonidas]] at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], with the words ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ (''Molon labe'', ""Come and get them!").]]
'''''Molon labe''''' ({{lang-grc|μολὼν λαβέ|molṑn labé|having come, take}} {{IPA-el|mo.lɔ᷆ːn la.bé|pron}}), meaning "come and take [them]", is a classical expression of defiance. According to [[Plutarch]],&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'' 225D, "Sayings of Spartans", Leonidas, Son of Anasandridas, saying 11 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0196%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D11 original Greek] in the [[Perseus Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerxes I]]—king of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]—demanded that the Spartans surrender their weapons and King [[Leonidas I]] responded with this phrase. It is an exemplary use of a [[laconic phrase]].

== Grammar ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
When properly transliterated with diacritics, the spelling becomes ''molṑn labe''. The literal translation is "having come, take". While English normally requires an explicit object in a transitive imperative construction ("Take them!" or "Take it!"), Ancient Greek does not; the object ''them'' is understood from context.

The first word, {{lang|grc|μολών}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|molōn}}'', is the [[aorist]] active [[participle]] ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]], [[nominative]], [[Grammatical number|singular]]) of the [[Ancient Greek verbs|Greek verb]] {{lang|grc|βλώσκω}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|blōskō}}'' "to come", meaning "having come".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dblw%2Fskw {{lang|grc|βλώσκω}}] at Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The root is evidently ΜΟΛ, so that βλώ-σκ-ω is apparently a contraction for μ(ο)λώ-σκ-ω, where the cluster *μλ- regularly becomes βλ-.&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'': The two words function together in a grammatical structure (not as common in English as in Greek) called the circumstantial participle. Different ways to phrase this name are in use. For simplicity, the one used here comes from Alston Hurd Chase and Henry Phillips Jr., ''A New Introduction to Greek'' ({{ISBN|978-0196111704}}), Lesson 21. Chase and Phillips is an elementary textbook on Ancient Greek.&lt;/ref&gt; Where English would put two main verbs in two [[independent clause]]s joined by a [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]: "come and take", a strategy sometimes called [[paratactic]], Ancient Greek, which is far richer in participles, [[Subordination (linguistics)|subordinates]] one to the other, a strategy called [[hypotaxis|hypotactic]]: "having come", "take". The first action is expressed with a participle with [[adverb]]ial force. In this structure, the participle gives some circumstance (the coming) attendant on the main verb (the taking).

The aorist participle may be used where the action is completed, called the [[perfective aspect]]. That is: the action of the participle occurs before that of the main verb. Thus the Greek provides a nuance similar to the English translation (come and [then] take it), making clear that the coming must precede the taking (i.e., "having come, take"). The latter {{lang|grc|λαβέ}} is in second person singular, and therefore is not being spoken to a large group of people, but rather to an individual. King Leonidas spoke to [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] personally, and not to the Persians en masse.

A better Greek designation of the relationship between the participle and the imperative verb is to view the participle not as adverbial (circumstantial) but rather as a verbal participle of attendant circumstances. The indicators of this usage are that the participle typically precedes the main verb and is in the aorist tense while the main verb is in either the indicative or imperative mood (here the imperative). Finally, the usage normally (but not always) occurs within narrative literature (Daniel Wallace, ''Greek Grammar beyond the Basics'' [Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1996], 640–45). With these structures in mind, the participle then "borrows" the mood of the main verb and then adds the conjunction "and" after translating the participle. "Come and take!"

When a more refined understanding of aspect is introduced (see, for example, Stanley Porter, Verbal Aspect in the Greek of the New Testament, with Reference to Tense and Mood, Peter Lang, 1993, a work covering Homeric through NT Greek), the translation of the aorist participle may be seen as devoid of time (the participle here not as temporally "first").  Instead, the use of the aorist form with the present-form imperative conveys the speaker's conception of a process, not a sequence.  (Time in ancient Greek is marked by different feature called deixis.)  Thus, the aorist form gives completeness (not completion) or a view of the "coming on" process by wide-angle lens, whereas the present form conveys immersion in the process of "taking"--a semantic framework alien to time-based English, hobbled by the time-term "tense."  In aspectual terms, the aorist is thus designated perfective (not perfected) and the present as imperfective (not imperfect, and designates incompleteness and intimate immersion); this arrangement is referred to as "binary opposition" (perfective-imperfective), permeating ancient Greek.  The result is a pithy saying that to the ancient Greek speaker conveys the sense, "Come on, take them!" as a conceptual singularity (no sequence, no conjunction).  Note that the so-called circumstantial participle is actually an integral feature of the imperative itself, its head word.  The speaker integrates the two elements while preserving the force of their individual aspects (not moods) essential to framing his mental picture.  This process strategy sets the semantic stage: the aorist giving the broad context within which resides the intimacy of an envisioned clash.

== History ==
The phrase was reportedly the defiant response of King Leonidas I of Sparta to Xerxes I of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] when Xerxes demanded that the Greeks lay down their arms and surrender. This was at the onset of the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] (480 BC). Instead, the Greeks held Thermopylae for three days. Although the Greek contingent was defeated, they inflicted serious damage on the Persian army.  Most importantly, this delayed the Persians' progress to Athens, providing sufficient time for the city's evacuation to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. Though a tactical defeat, Thermopylae served as a strategic and  [[moral victory]], inspiring the Greek forces to crush the Persians at the [[Battle of Salamis]] later the same year and the [[Battle of Plataea]] one year later.

[[File:SIG-Sauer 1911 Spartan.jpg|thumb|[[SIG Sauer 1911]] engraved with "ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ", a statement on the American [[right to keep and bear arms]].]]

''Molon labe'' has been repeated by many later generals and politicians to express an army's or nation's determination not to surrender. The motto {{lang|el|ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ}} is on the emblem of the [[I Army Corps (Greece)|I Army Corps]] of Greece and the Second Infantry Division of [[Cyprus]], and is also the motto of United States [[Special Operations Command Central]] (SOCCENT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom1/USSOCCENT%20Newsletter/Jun%2006%20Newsletter.pdf See the top of the page for the two logos and their motto usage].&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the phrase in the [[new world]] is first noted in 1778 at [[Fort Morris]] in the [[Province of Georgia]] during the [[American revolution]], and later in 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales during the Texas Revolution where it became a prevalent slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fort Morris State Historic Site |url=http://www.exploregeorgia.org/listing/1796-fort-morris-state-historic-site |publisher=Georgia Department of Economic Development |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Molon labe'' has been used once again in Greek history, on 3 March 1957, during a battle in Cyprus between members of the [[EOKA]] organization and the British Army. After someone had betrayed his location, the British forces surrounded the hideout of the second-in-command of EOKA, [[Grigoris Afxentiou]], near the [[Machairas Monastery]]. Inside the hideout were Afxentiou and four of his followers. Realizing he was outnumbered, Afxentiou ordered them to surrender themselves while he barricaded himself for a fight to the death. The British asked Afxentiou to come out and surrender. He replied with the phrase ''Molon labe'', imitating the ancient Spartans. Unable to get him out, and after sustaining casualties, the British set fire to the hideout, and he was burnt alive. The British buried his body in the yard of the central jail of [[Nicosia]], where it lies today.

In the United States, the original Greek phrase and its English translation are often heard as a defense of the [[right to keep and bear arms]]. It began to appear on [[website]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://setup.rightwingamerica.com/index.php/topic,1428.msg10379.html#msg10379 |title=Senate To Vote On Legislation That Allows U.S. Military to Detain Americans |publisher=setup.rightwingamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Amendment or firearms freedom context, the phrase expresses the notion the person uttering the phrase is a strong believer in these ideals and will not surrender their firearms to anyone, especially to governmental authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0602/0602sigs.htm |work=ESR |title=Signatures of the gun culture |publisher=www.enterstageright.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[college football]], the [[Michigan State Spartans football]] team wore alternate jerseys featuring the phrase in their 2011 [[Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry|rivalry]] game with the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hecken|first=Phil|title=Molon Labe... or 'Come and Get Them'!|url=http://www.uni-watch.com/2011/10/15/msu-prepares-for-pro-combat/|publisher=Uni-Watch|date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monologist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|ɪ|s|t|,_|-|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), or interchangeably '''monologuist''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|n|ɒ|l|ə|ɡ|ɪ|s|t}}), is a solo artist who recites or gives [[oral interpretation|dramatic readings]] from a [[monologue]], [[soliloquy]], [[poetry]], or work of literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monologue |title=Monologue |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the entertainment of an audience.  The term can also refer to a person who monopolizes a conversation; and, in an obsolete sense, could describe a bird with an unchanging, repetitive song.&lt;ref&gt;"Monologist." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. Retrieved via ''OED Online'', 2017-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatic monologist==
A '''dramatic monologist''' is a term sometimes applied to an actor performing in a [[monodrama]] often with accompaniment of [[music]]. In a monodrama the lone player relays a story through the eyes of a central character, though at times may take on additional roles.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis, Patrice (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tIXwrduoDMoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217 Dictionary of the Theatre: Terms, Concepts, and Analysis]''.  Translated from the French by Christine Shantz. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|9780802081636}}. "Monodrama", pp.&amp;nbsp;217–18.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the more successful practitioners of this art have been actresses frequently referred to by the French term “diseuse”.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Technique  By Joseph Twadell Shipley 1964 p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette - the December 21, 1935 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennyson's Rapture: Transformation in the Victorian Dramatic Monologue  By Cornelia D. J. Pearsall 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseuse==
'''Diseuse''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|d|iː|ˈ|z|ɜː|z}}, {{IPAc-en|us|d|iː|ˈ|z|uː|z}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|diseuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; French for "teller", also called talkers, storytellers, dramatic-singers or dramatic-talkers,&lt;ref&gt;Theater Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beaver County Times (Earl Wilson column) March 9, 1972 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  is a term, at least on the English-speaking stage, that appears to date back only to the last decade of the 19th century. The early uses of “diseuse” as a theatrical term in the American press seem to coincide with [[Yvette Guilbert|Yvette Guilbert’s]] tour of New York City in the mid-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mars Semi-Weekly Sentinel''. Lemars, Iowa. January 09, 1896. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]'' in a February 1896 article on Guilbert described the term as a "newly-coined and specific title".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmopolitan''. February 1896. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TheaterDictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Diseuse is the feminine form of the French word ''diseur'' "teller", a derivative of ''dire'' "to say, to tell", which in turn came from [[Latin]] ''dīcere''.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster's Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that over the last century or so few male actors became noteworthy performing solely as a dramatic monologist, though many well known actors have played in monodramas over their careers.

The publication ''Theatre World'' wrote in a 1949 piece: "In our time we have fallen under the spell of three remarkable women practising the art of the diseuse—[[Ruth Draper]], [[Cornelia Otis Skinner]], and [[Joyce Grenfell]]. Each of these great artists has the gift of crowding the stage with imaginary figures who become so vivid as to be practically visible, but as all of these artists happen to be members of the fair sex it could be assumed that they possess a magic denied the mere male of the theatre." The article goes on to suggest that [[Sid Field]] was an actor of comparable talents.&lt;ref&gt;"Whispers from the Wings", by "Looker On". ''Theatre World''. April 1949 (vol. 45, no. 291), p.&amp;nbsp;32. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVNXAAAAIAAJ Snippet preview on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "''The Guest List''" by Ethan Mordden, the art of the diseuse is defined as "a speaker of lyrics: in effect, one who uses the music to get to the words".&lt;ref&gt;The Guest List: How Manhattan Defined American Sophistication—from the Algonquin Round Table to Trumam capote's Ball” by Ethan Mordden (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 21, 1935, edition of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' an entertainment columnist wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The English language does not contain a word which perfectly describes the performance of Ruth Draper, who comes to the [[Regional Enterprise Tower|Nixon]] next Thursday for the first time in several years to give a different program at each of her four performances here. "Speaking Portraits" and "Character Sketches" are the two terms most frequently applied to Miss Draper's work; and yet it is something more than that. "Diseuse" is the French word, but that is more readily applicable to an artist like Yvette Guilbert or Raquel Meller. Monologist is wholly inadequate. The word "Diseuse" really means "an artist in talking" so that may be the real term to use in connection with Miss Draper.&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joyce Grenfell wrote in ''Darling Ma: Joyce Grenfell's Letters to her Mother 1932–1944'', "What makes a good diseuse is a capacious verbal (and visual) imagination, and an excellent oral delivery. Call these witty ladies Diseuses of the Heart and Lungs. I do."&lt;ref&gt;Darling Ma: letters to her mother, 1932–1944 by Joyce Grenfell  1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oral interpretation==

'''Oral interpretation''', sometimes called dramatic reading or interpretative reading, is the oral staging of a work of literature, prose or poetry, by a person who reads rather than memorizes the material. Typically they are performed by solo artists who – unlike players in a monodrama – do not assume or tell the story through any one character, but do so instead with oral nuances to bring the story alive with their interpretation of how the creator of the piece intended the story to be told.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Communication  By James Fernandes  2005 p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studygs.net/interpretive.htm |title=Studyygs.net |publisher=Studygs.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soliloquist==

The term soliloquist can apply to a monologist reciting a [[soliloquy]], usually from a play, to entertain an audience. Passages in which characters orally reveal their thoughts are probably most associated with the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/soliloquy |title= definition of soliloquy by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
The museum building dates from the [[Safavid]] era. Many changes were made to the building during the [[Qajar]] era. The building has been decorated by [[stucco]]ed forms, which are the principal architectural feature of the Qajar period. There are many patterns of flowers and vase, which are a distinctive feature of decoration in the Qajar period. This feature is one that distinguishes the Qajar age from the Safavid age, in which flowers were never in vases.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 137"&gt;{{cite book| title=Rāhnamā ye Safar be Ostān e Esfāhān (Travel Guide for the Province Isfahan) | publisher=Rouzane | isbn=964-334-218-2 | first=Hosseyn | last=Yaghoubi | editor-first=Arash | editor-last=Beheshti | page=137 | language=Persian | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The [[museum]] is open from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 5 to 8 p.m. in the spring and summer. In the autumn and winter, it is open from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4 to 7 p.m.&lt;ref name="Rāhnamā 2004, p. 137"/&gt;

'''Neoism''' is a parodistic [[Wiktionary:en:-ism|-ism]]. It refers both to a specific subcultural network of artistic performance and media experimentalists, and more generally to a practical underground philosophy. It operates with collectively shared [[pseudonym]]s and [[Cultural identity|identities]], [[prank]]s, [[paradox]]es, [[plagiarism]] and [[counterfeit|fake]]s, and has created multiple contradicting definitions of itself in order to defy categorization and historization

==Background==

Definitions of Neoism were always disputed. The
main source of this is the undefinable concept of Neoism which created
vastly different, tactically distorted accounts of Neoism and its
history. Undisputed, however are the origin of the movement in the late 1970s Canada. It was initiated by Hungarian-born Canadian performance and media-artist [[Istvan Kantor]] aka [[Monty Cantsin]] in 1979, in Montreal. At around the same time the open-pop-star identity of Monty Cantsin was spread through the [[Mail Art]]ist [[David Zack]]
&lt;ref&gt;Kantor, Istvan (editor). ''Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack'', 2010, The New Gallery Press, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; (born New Orleans, June 12, 1938, died presumably in Texas ca. 1995) with the collaboration of artists Maris Kudzins and performance artist Istvan Kantor.

Schisms followed in the mid-1980s. Questions and concerns arose about whether the "open pop star" Monty Cantsin moniker was being overly associated with certain individuals. Later, writer [[Stewart Home]] sought to separate himself from the rest of the [[Neoists|Neoist network]], manifesting itself in [[Stewart Home|Home's]] books on Neoism as opposed to the various [[#External links|Neoist resources in the Internet]]. In non-Neoist terms, Neoism could be called an international subculture which in the beginning put itself into simultaneous continuity and discontinuity with, among others, xperimental arts (such as [[Dada]], [[Surrealism]], [[Fluxus]] and [[Concept Art]]), [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[industrial music]] and [[electropop]], political and religious [[Freethought|free-spirit movements]], [[Science Fiction]] literature, '[[pataphysics]] and speculative [[science]]. Neoism also gathered players with backgrounds in [[graffiti]] and street erformance, language writing (later known as [[language poetry]]), [[experimental film]] and [[video art|video]], [[Mail Art]], the early [[Church of the Subgenius]] and [[homosexual|gay]] and [[lesbian]] culture. Neoism then gradually transformed from an active subculture into a self-written [[urban legend]]. As a side effect, many other subcultures, artistic and political groups since the late 1980s have—often vaguely—referred to or even opposed Neoism and thereby perpetuated its myth.

Since the gradual disappearance of Neoism in the 1990s, brief offshoots have appeared including [[The Seven by Nine Squares]], Stewart Home's frequent use of [[Karen Eliot]] (as well as [[Sandy Larson]], [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)]] and others) to replace Monty Cantsin as the embodiment of the open pop star concept. "This project... confuses the restrictions that both define and delimit individual identity.... Changing details, such as biographical particulars... are usually considered indispensible {{sic}} in securing the signature of an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Priest, Eldritch. ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and the Aesthetics of Failure''. Bloomsbury Academic Publishing Plc, London, 2013: 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Neoism, as a name for a different context, was coined in 1914 by the American satirist [[Franklin P. Adams]] as a parody of modern arts.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin P. Adams, 'The Neo-Neoism', in: By and Large, Doubleday 1914, p. 82,  [https://archive.org/stream/byandlarge00adamgoog facsimile at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sydney J. Bounds]] used the word as the name of a planet in his 1977 Science Fiction story ''No Way Back''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Harbottle (ed.), The Best of Sydney J. Bounds, vol. 2: The Wayward Ship and other stories, Cosmos Books, 2003, {{ISBN|1-58715-517-6}}, p. 190, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i3-1-TXPTH8C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=sydney+j.+bounds+neoism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=osBbTqexOYKf-QabxpGeDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the name was reinitiated by Istvan Kantor aka Monty Cantsin for a subcultural [[-ism]] that grew out of the [[mail art]] network, particularly those parts of mail art that emphasized—rather than the exchange of artwork—alternative lifestyles, pranks, practical jokes, the use of pseudonyms and experimentation with identity {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In 1980 Monty spent two weeks at mail artist [[Ginny Lloyd]]'s San Francisco Storefront.,&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Ginny. ''Storefront: A Living Art Project''. 1984. Fault Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a one year living art project holding art events and installations in a storefront window. He lived in the space, compiled writings and launched his Blood Campaign.

Centered on the idea of the "open pop star" or multiple persona Monty Cantsin in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, New York, New York and Baltimore, Maryland in the United States {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Neoism quickly spread to other places in America, Europe and Australia and involved up to two dozens of [[Neoists]]. Until the late 1980s and before the mass availability of the [[Internet]], the [[mail art]] network continued to be used as the main communication and propaganda channel for Neoism.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Florian and Home, Stewart. Words Made Flesh: Code, Culture, Imagination, Rotterdam: Media Design Research, Piet Zwart Institute, Willem de Kooning Academy Hogeschool Rotterdam, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoists refer to their strategies as "the great confusion" and "radical play". They were acted out in semi-private [[Apartment Festivals]] which took place in North America, Europe and Australia between 1980 and 1998 and in publications which sought to embody confusion and radical play rather than just describing it. Consequently, both Neoist festivals and Neoist writing  experimented with radical undermining of identity, bodies, media, and notions of ownership and truth. Unlike typical [[postmodern]] currents, the experiment was practical and therefore existential. Monty Cantsin, for example, was not simply a collective pseudonym or mythical person, but an [[identity (social science)|identity]] lived by [[Neoists]] in their everyday life.

For these purposes, Neoists employed [[performance]], [[video]], small press publications (such as ''[[SMILE (magazine)|Smile]]'', the international magazine of multiple origins) and [[computer virus]]es, but also food ([[Chapati]]), flaming steam irons and metal coat hangers (used as telepathic antennas). Borrowing from [[Thomas Pynchon]], Neoism could be more suitably called an "[[anarchist]] miracle" of an international network of highly eccentric persons collaborating, often with extremist intensity, under the one shared identity of Monty Cantsin and Neoism.

In 2004 Neoism was cited by [[Javier Ruis]] in response to the [[National Assembly Against Racism]]'s condemnation of [[anarchism|anarchists]] disrupting the Third [[European Social Forum]] session on anti-      m and anti-racism in [[London]] ([http://antisystemic.org/pga/PGA_Considered_As_Neoist_Invisible_Theatre.htm PGA Considered As Neoist Invisible Theatre]).

In the early 1980s, the Neoist [[Neoists|Reinhard U. Sevol]] founded [[Anti-Neoism]], which other Neoists adopted by declaring
Neoism a pure fiction created by Anti-Neoists. The Dutch Neoist [[Neoists|Arthur Berkoff]] operated as a one-person-movement 
"Neoism/[[Anti-Neoism]]/[[Pregroperativism]]". Similarly, [[Blaster Al Ackerman]] declared himself a "Salmineoist" after Sicilian-American actor [[Sal Mineo]], and [[John Berndt]] was credited by Ackerman as having given Neoism the name "Spanish Art," circa 1983. In 1989, following the post-Neoist "Festival of Plagiarism" in [[Glasgow, Scotland]], artist [[Mark Bloch]] left [[mail art]] and after publishing "The Last Word" remained defiantly silent on Neoism for almost two decades. In 1994, [[Stewart Home]] founded the [[Neoist Alliance]] as an occult order with himself as the magus. At the same time, [[Italy|Italian]] activists of the [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]] project operated under the name "Alleanza Neoista".

In 1997, the critic [http://www.ccca.ca/performance_artists/k/kantor/kantor_perf18/neoism/books_about_neoism/pages/book-007.html Oliver Marchart] organized a "Neoist World Congress" in [[Vienna]] which did not involve any Neoists. In 2001, the Professional Association of Visual Artists in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Wiesbaden]] declared itself Neoist.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In 2004 Istvan Kantor received the [[Governor General's Award]], and an international "Neoist Department Festival" took place in [[Berlin]].

==Influences on other artists and subcultures==

Notable artists who participated in Neoist apartment festivals include early street artist [[Richard Hambleton]], writer and director [[Kirby Malone]], media artist [[Niels Lomholt]], visual artist [[Peter Below]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blitzableiter-horizontal.de&lt;/ref&gt; media artist [[Bill Vorn]], the filmmaker [[Michael Brynntrup]] and the model and actress [[Eugenie Vincent]].

Neoist "play" such as multiple names, [[plagiarism]] and pranks were adopted, frequently mistaken for Neoism proper and by mixing in [[Situationist International|situationist]] concepts, by other subcultures such as the [[Plagiarism]] and [[Art Strike 1990-1993]] campaigns of the late 1980s (triggered largely by [[Stewart Home]] after he had left the Neoist network), [[Plunderphonics]] music, the refounded [[London Psychogeographical Association]], the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]], the Luther Blissett project, the Michael K Project, the German [[Communication Guerilla]], and, since the late 1990s, by some [[net art]]ists such as [[0100101110101101.org]]. Other artists who explicitly if vaguely credit Neoism are [[The KLF]], [[Luther Blissett (nom de plume)|Luther Blissett]], [[Alexander Brener]]/[[Barbara Schurz]], [[Lee Wells]] and [[Luke Haines]] (of [[The Auteurs]] and [[Black Box Recorder]]). The contemporary Dutch Artist [[Thomas Raat]] created a series of artworks based on Neoist manifestos and photographic documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacestudios.org.uk/All_Content_Items/Exhibitions_Archive/Thomas_Raat:_MUMU_Malice_and_Misunderstanding/ Gallery site on Thomas Raat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoism is also mentioned briefly in [[David O. Russell]]'s 2005 film [[I ♥ Huckabees]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character says the word under his breath in response to [[Jason Schwartzman]]'s experience to "the blanket thing," which is a method of understanding the universe derived from being zipped up in a body bag.

The California-based tech-pop band Brilliant Red Lights also applies the word in the song "Neoism," the first track off their second album, Actualism. The band imagines a literal—albeit applicable—definition of the word, defining it as "the culture of the new."

In 2017, Istvan Kantor was featured in hiphop artists Future and The Weeknd's music video [https://itunes.apple.com/us/music-video/comin-out-strong-feat-the-weeknd/id1243160223 Coming Out Strong], prominently showing a tattoo of the word "NEOISM" on his head.

'''New wave''' is a genre of [[rock music]]&lt;ref name=ste /&gt; popular in the late 1970s and the 1980s with ties to mid-1970s [[punk rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=9–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; New wave moved away from [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]] sounds to create [[rock music]] (early new wave) or [[pop music]] (later) that incorporated [[disco]], [[Mod (music)|mod]], and [[electronic music]]. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including [[synth-pop]].&lt;ref name="synthpop subgenre"/&gt;

New wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more "artsy" [[post-punk]].&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/new-wave-d381|title=Music Genres – AllMusic|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos,&lt;ref name=discoinferno&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/disco-inferno-680390.html |title=Disco inferno |date=11 December 2004 |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reynolds160&gt;[[Simon Reynolds|Reynolds, Simon]] "Rip It Up and Start Again PostPunk 1978–1984" p160&lt;/ref&gt; new wave exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, and a distinctive visual style featured in music videos and fashion.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com" /&gt;

New wave has been called one of the definitive genres of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://80music.about.com/od/top10list1/tp/80snewwaveartists.htm|title=Top 10 New Wave Artists of the '80s|first=Steve | last=Peake|work=About.com Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it was promoted heavily by [[MTV]] ([[the Buggles]]' "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" music video was broadcast as the [[First music videos aired on MTV|first music video]] to promote the channel's launch),&lt;ref name="allmusic.com" /&gt;. The popularity of several new wave artists is often attributed to their exposure on the channel. In the mid-1980s, differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur.&lt;ref name="dissertation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic.com" /&gt; New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s, after a rising "nostalgia" for several new wave-influenced artists. Subsequently, the genre influenced other genres.{{refn|&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaofContemporaryBritishCulture /&gt;&lt;ref name=Revival /&gt;&lt;ref name=msnbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=DrumsIndependent /&gt;&lt;ref name=decade /&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt;&lt;ref name="CateforisQ&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115556-qa.pdf|title=Q&amp;A with Theo Cateforis, author of Are We Not New Wave?

These acts were sometimes labeled "[[new wave of new wave]]".

== Etymology and usage ==
[[File:Blondie1977.jpg|thumb|left|[[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], 1976. L–R: Gary Valentine, Clem Burke, Deborah Harry, Chris Stein and Jimmy Destri.]]
The [[umbrella term|catch-all]] nature of new wave music has been a source of much confusion and controversy. The 1985 [[discography]] ''Who's New Wave in Music'' listed artists in over 130 separate categories.&lt;ref name="cateforis11"&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New [[Rolling Stone]] Encyclopedia of Rock'' calls the term "virtually meaningless",&lt;ref name="cateforis11" /&gt; while [[AllMusic]] mentions "stylistic diversity".&lt;ref name=AllMusicAboutNewWave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/new-wave-ma0000002750Allmusic|title=AboutNew Wave|website=allmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New wave first emerged as a rock genre in the early 1970s, used by critics including [[Nick Kent]] and [[Dave Marsh]] to classify such New York-based groups as [[the Velvet Underground]] and [[New York Dolls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained currency beginning in 1976 when it appeared in UK punk [[fanzine]]s such as ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' and newsagent music weeklies such as ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[New Musical Express]]''.&lt;ref name=Gendron&gt;Gendron, Bernard (2002).

In the United States, [[Seymour Stein|Sire Records chairman Seymour Stein]], believing that the term "punk" would mean poor sales for Sire's acts who had frequently played the club [[CBGB]], launched a "Don't Call It Punk" campaign designed to replace the term with "new wave".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As radio consultants in the United States had advised their clients that punk rock was a fad, they settled on the term "new wave". Like the filmmakers of the [[French New Wave|French new wave movement]] (after whom the genre was named), its new artists were anti-corporate and experimental (e.g. [[Ramones]] and [[Talking Heads]]). At first, most U.S. writers exclusively used the term "new wave" for British punk acts.&lt;ref&gt;Source: The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition New 3 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in December 1976, ''[[The New York Rocker]]'', which was suspicious of the term "punk", became the first American journal to enthusiastically use the term starting with British acts, later appropriating it to acts associated with the [[CBGB]] scene.&lt;ref name=Gendron /&gt; Part of what attracted Stein and others to new wave was the music’s stripped back style and upbeat tempos, which they viewed as a much needed return to the energetic rush of rock and roll and 1960s rock that had dwindled in the 1970s with the ascendance of overblown progressive rock and stadium spectacles.&lt;ref name="Cateforis, Theo 2014"&gt;Cateforis, Theo.

Music historian Vernon Joynson claimed that new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk.&lt;ref name="Joynson 2001 11" /&gt; Music that followed the anarchic [[garage band]] ethos of the [[Sex Pistols]] was distinguished as "punk", while music that tended toward experimentation, lyrical complexity or more polished production, came to be categorized as "new wave". In the U.S., the first new wavers were the not-so-punk acts associated with the New York club [[CBGB]] (e.g. [[Talking Heads]], [[Mink DeVille]] and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]).&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaofContemporaryBritishCulture /&gt;

CBGB owner [[Hilly Kristal]], referring to the first show of the band [[Television (band)|Television]] at his club in March 1974, said, "I think of that as the beginning of new wave."&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Heylin, ''Babylon's Burning'' (Conongate, 2007), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many artists who would have originally been classified as punk were also termed new wave.

=== US/UK differences ===
New wave is much more closely tied to punk and came and went more quickly in the United Kingdom than in the United States. At the time punk began, it was a major phenomenon in the United Kingdom and a minor one in the United States. Thus when new wave acts started getting noticed in America, punk meant little to the mainstream audience&lt;ref name="Cateforis4647"&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was common for rock clubs and discos to play British dance mixes and videos between live sets by American guitar acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-punk music developments in the UK became mainstream and were considered unique cultural events.&lt;ref name="Cateforis4647" /&gt; By the early 1980s, British journalists largely had abandoned the term "new wave" in favor of subgenre terms such as "synthpop".&lt;ref name="Cateforis 2011 254"&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1983, the term of choice for the US music industry had become "[[New Music (music industry)|new music]]", while to the majority of US fans it was still a "new wave" reacting to [[Album-oriented rock|album-based rock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New wave represented a break from the blues and rock &amp; roll sounds of late 1960s to mid-1970s rock music. According to [[Simon Reynolds]], the music had a twitchy, agitated feel to it. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, and keyboards were common as were stop-start song structures and melodies. Reynolds noted that new wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban.&lt;ref name=Reynolds160 /&gt; A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo and [[Elvis Costello]]. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals and clothing fashions such as suits and big glasses that hid the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elvis Costello 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Elvis Costello, in [[Massey Hall]], Toronto, April 1979]]
This seemed radical to audiences accustomed to post-counterculture forms such as disco dancing and macho "[[cock rock]]" that emphasized a "hang loose" philosophy, open sexuality and sexual bravado.&lt;ref name="cateforis7194"&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=71–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of American male new wave acts of the late 1970s were from Caucasian middle-class backgrounds, and Theo Cateforis of [[Syracuse University]] theorized that these acts intentionally presented these exaggerated nerdy tendencies associated with their "whiteness" either to criticize it and/or to reflect their identity.&lt;ref name="cateforis7194" /&gt;

The British [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] scene of the mid-1970s was the source of new wave acts such as [[Ian Dury]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]] and [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]].&lt;ref name="Bomp"&gt;Adams, Bobby.

Retrieved 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriters who were "angry" and "intelligent" and who "approached pop music with the sardonic attitude and tense, aggressive energy of punk" such as [[Elvis Costello]], [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]] and [[Graham Parker]] were also part of the new wave music scene.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r10059|pure_url=yes}} Album Review Look Sharp]&lt;/ref&gt;

A British revival of [[ska music]] on the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] label, led by [[the Specials]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], the [[English Beat]], and [[Selecter]] were more politically oriented than other new wave genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/ska-revival-ma0000002403|title=Ska Revival – Music Highlights – AllMusic|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of rock music as a serious art form started in the late 1960s and was the dominant view of the genre at the time of new wave's arrival. New wave looked back or borrowed in various ways from the years just prior to this occurrence. One way this was done was by taking an ironic look at consumer and pop culture of the 1950s and early 1960s. The [[B-52's]] became most noted for a [[kitsch]] and [[camp (style)|camp]] presentation with their [[bouffant]] wigs, [[beach party films|beach party]] and sci-fi movie references. Other groups that referenced the pre-[[progressive rock]] era were [[the Go-Go's]], Blondie and Devo.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=95–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejam.org.uk/gigs.html |title=The Jam Information Pages:The Gigs |accessdate=29 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816015007/https://thejam.org.uk/gigs.html |archivedate=16 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, new wave acts embraced a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] of rock music with African and African-American styles. [[Adam and the Ants]] and [[Bow Wow Wow]], both acts with ties to former Sex Pistols manager [[Malcolm McLaren]], used [[Burundi]]-style drumming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=185–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talking Heads album ''[[Remain in Light]]'' was marketed and positivity reviewed as a breakthrough melding of new wave and African styles, although drummer [[Chris Frantz]] said that he found out about this supposed African influence after the fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=203–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1981 U.S. number 1 single "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" by Blondie was an homage to [[rap music]]. The song name-checked rap artists and [[Fab 5 Freddie]] appeared in the video for the song.&lt;ref&gt;Bondie One Way or Another BBC documentary 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second British Invasion]] acts were influenced by [[funk]] and [[disco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power pop ===

[[File:Thejam.gif|thumb|right|The Jam in concert in Newcastle during their ''Trans-global Unity'' tour in March 1982]]
[[Power pop]] continued the guitar-based, singles-oriented [[British invasion]] sound of the mid-1960s into the 1970s and the present day. Although the name "power pop" had been around before punk (it is believed to have been coined by [[Pete Townshend]] in 1967) it became widely associated with new wave when ''[[Bomp]]'' and ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazines (respectively in March and April 1978) wrote cover stories touting power pop as a sound that could continue new wave's directness without the negativity associated with punk. [[Cheap Trick]], [[the Romantics]], [[the Records]], [[Shoes (band)|Shoes]], [[the Motors]],&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaofContemporaryBritishCulture /&gt; [[the Only Ones]], [[the Plimsouls]], [[the dB's]], [[The Beat (American band)|the Beat]], [[XTC]], [[the Vapors]], [[20/20 (band)|20/20]] and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] were groups that found success playing this style. [[The Jam]] was the prime example of the [[mod (subculture)|mod]] sensibility of British power pop. By the end of 1979 a backlash had developed against power pop in general, particularly in regards to the Los Angeles scene. The skinny ties worn by LA power pop groups, epitomized by [[the Knack]], became symbolic of the supposed lack of authenticity of the genre.&lt;ref name="dissertation"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:K1FT9s7iZgMJ:iaspm-us.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Cateforis.pdf+Theo+Cateforis+the+death&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgXPV1cYTF5r2LVbQGmx2Vq76McE-1jikbaLuWR25ICOVhW1DXrVLZHO3GRx7LE_ki7TaPXhVFLU-DR_UJGNT9WLGe9rzwHKHs65aEhz92mAr0sxeZ81Vw_KUOOjJcoDsuvbehB&amp;sig=AHIEtbSjIigaJFb7ZIlERw4k5u8F4Wt3ug The Death of New Wave] Theo Cateforis Assistant Professor of Music History and Cultures in the Department of Art and Music Histories at Syracuse University 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d383|pure_url=yes}} Power Pop genre Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt; Power pop's association with the genre was later forgotten.&lt;ref name="Cateforis 2011 69" /&gt;

=== Punk and post-punk ===

The term "[[post-punk]]" was coined to describe groups such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Public Image Ltd]], [[Joy Division]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[The Cure]], [[the Psychedelic Furs]] and [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] which were initially considered part of new wave but were more ambitious, serious and challenging, as well as darker and less pop-oriented. Some of these groups would later adopt synths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/post-punk-ma0000004450|title=Post-Punk – Music Highlights – AllMusic|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greil Marcus, ''Ranters and Crowd Pleasers'', p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; While punk rock wielded a major influence on the popular music scene in the UK, in the US the music’s stigma of violence and sexual deviance made it virtually unmarketable.&lt;ref name="Cateforis, Theo 2014" /&gt;

=== New Romantic and synth-pop ===

The [[New Romantic]] scene developed in the London nightclubs Billy's and [[Blitz Kids|the Blitz]] in the late 1970s. Club-goers wore flamboyant, eccentric costumes and make-up derived from the [[Romanticism|historical Romantic era]]. Beginning at "Bowie and Roxy Music" themed nights at these clubs, the scene was spearheaded by [[Steve Strange]] of [[Visage (band)|Visage]], with other soon-to-be pop acts also as regular fixtures such as [[Boy George]] of [[Culture Club]], and [[Spandau Ballet]]. Around the same time, [[Duran Duran]] emerged from a similar scene in Birmingham.&lt;ref name="Rimmer2003"&gt;{{Citation |author=D. Rimmer |contribution= |year=2003 |title=New Romantics: The Look |journal= |editor= |edition= |isbn=0-7119-9396-3 |volume= |pages= |place=London |publisher=Omnibus Press |url= |accessdate= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the acts that arose from the New Romantic club scene adopted synthpop in their own music, though all would credit [[David Bowie]] and [[Roxy Music]] as primary influences, both musically and visually.&lt;ref name="BowieInfluence" /&gt;

[[Kraftwerk]] were acclaimed for their groundbreaking use of synthesizers. Their 1975 pop single "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]" reached number 11 in the United Kingdom. In 1978, [[Gary Numan]] saw a synthesizer left by another music act and started playing around with it. In 1979, he released two number one albums and two number one singles (one of each under his band name [[Tubeway Army]]). Numan's admitted amateurism and deliberate lack of emotion was a sea change from the masculine and professional image that professional synth players had in an era when elaborate, lengthy solos were the norm. His open desire to be a pop star broke from punk orthodoxy. The decreasing price and ease of use of the instrument led acts to follow in Kraftwerk and Numan's footsteps. While Numan also utilized conventional rock instruments, several acts that followed used only synthesizers. [[Synthpop]] (or "technopop" as it was described by the U.S. press)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; filled a void left by [[disco]],&lt;ref name=decade&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Claire |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/scene/scene-cover/2009/10/23/decade-never-dies/ |title=The decade that never dies Still '80s Fetishizing in '09 Yale Daily News |publisher=Yaledailynews.com |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213075504/http://www.yaledailynews.com/scene/scene-cover/2009/10/23/decade-never-dies/ |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew into a broad genre that included groups such as [[the Human League]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Soft Cell]], [[a-ha]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yazoo-p5889/biography |title=Allmusic bio Yazoo |publisher=Allmusic.com |date=19 April 2002 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultravox]],&lt;ref name=StJames /&gt; [[Kajagoogoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kajagoogoo-p18608/biography |title=Kajagoogoo Allmusic bio |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thompson Twins]].&lt;ref name=StJames&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100891/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 |title=St. James encyclopedia of Pop Culture |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=29 January 2002 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/thompson-twins-p5644/biography |title=Allmusic Thompson Twins Allmusic bio |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Synth Britannia BBC 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=152–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1980, influential radio consultant [[Lee Abrams]] wrote a memo saying that with a few exceptions, "we're not going to be seeing many of the new wave circuit acts happening very big over here (referring to America). As a movement, we don't expect it to have much influence."

In September 1988, ''Billboard'' launched their [[Modern Rock]] chart. While the acts on the chart reflected a wide variety of stylistic influences, new wave's legacy remained in the large influx of acts from Great Britain and acts that were popular in rock discos, as well as the chart's name, which reflected how new wave had been marketed as "modern".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cateforis|2011|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; New wave's [[Independent music|indie]] spirit would be crucial to the development of [[college rock]] and [[grunge]]/[[alternative rock]] in the latter half of the 1980s and beyond.&lt;ref name=StJames /&gt;

It's all drops and bass lines looped for five minutes non-stop. Back in the '80s, you had classic themes and iconic melodies. I try to take the best of '80s music and the best of what modern electro has. The 80s were the golden age of synths too, with master composers like Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, who are huge inspirations for most of us in this genre. There’s this special imagery that comes up in your mind when you think about this decade. There's a lot of '80s cliché that I find to be extremely cool, like gory practical effects or over-saturated neon colours. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pan-asian-theatre.jpg|thumb|250px|Theatre entrance]]
The '''Pan Asian Repertory Theatre''' is a [[New York City]]-based theatre group that explores the [[Asian American|Asian-American]] experience and provides professional opportunities for Asian-American artists to collaborate. Pan-Asian was founded by [[Tisa Chang]] in 1977 "with her salary from six months of [[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]] with [[Al Pacino]],"&lt;ref name=Haun&gt;Harry Haun, [http://www.playbill.com/article/40-years-on-pan-asian-rep-still-uses-art-as-protest "40 Years On, Pan Asian Rep Still Uses Art as Protest"], Playbill, June 16th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; who continues on today as artistic director. Chang established the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre as a resident company at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in 1977, with the intention of popularizing [[Asian American theater|Asian-American theater]]. [[Mel Gussow]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that "Before Pan Asian Rep, Asian Americans had severely limited opportunities in the theater… [now] heartened by Ms. Chang's example, similar companies have sprung up around the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gussow, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/22/theater/a-stage-for-all-the-world-of-asian-americans.html "A Stage for All the World of Asian-Americans"], New York Times, April 22nd, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  For over thirty years, Pan Asian has created opportunities for underrepresented artists to  stage modern classics that give insight into the Asian-American experience.

Specializing in intercultural productions of new Asian-American plays, Asian classics in translation, and innovative adaptations of Western classics, some of the works Pan Asian has presented included: 
*''Empress of China'' - featuring [[Tina Chen]] in the title role of China's last dowager ruler
*''[[Yellow Fever (play)|Yellow Fever]] -'' continued to an [[Off-Broadway]] run
*''[[Ghashiram Kotwal]] -'' [[Marathi language|Marathi]] play with music
*''Teahouse'' - by [[Lao She]], spanning fifty years of modern Chinese history
*''Cambodia Agonistes'' - by Ernest Abuba, music by Louis Stewart
*''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (play)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' - by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]]
*''Forbidden City Blues -'' by Alexander Woo
*''The Fan Tan King'' - by C. Y. Leethe, world premiere
*''Yohen -'' by [[Philip Kan Gotanda]]
*''Tea -'' by [[Velina Hasu Houston]], 20th anniversary production
Pan Asian has staged early works of writers including Momoko Iko, [[Wakako Yamauchi]], [[Philip Kan Gotanda]], [[Rick Shiomi|R. A. Shiomi]], and [[David Henry Hwang]]. 

Pan Asian Rep had a season in the West End Theatre in the [[Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew (New York City)|Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew]], and in 2007 returned to the Julia Miles Theatre to revive their classic productions with a large cast. Major programs include the Senior Artist Resident Ensemble, the Theatre For Youth program, touring and residencies domestically and internationally, the Staged Reading Series directed by Ron Nakahara, and Actor Training Workshops taught by Ernest Abuba.

The company has been invited to several national theater festivals including Edinburgh in 1988, Singapore in 1992, Cairo and Johannesburg (1995), and the Xi Havana Theatre Festival in 2003. From June 11–24, 2007, Pan Asian served along with [[Ma-Yi Theater Company|Ma-Yi Theater]] and NAATCO as a Co-Steering Committee member of the first National Asian American Theatre Festival. The two-week festival brought work from more than 35 emerging and established artists and ensembles from across the United States to 13 venues around New York City.

Pan Asian celebrated its 39th anniversary in 2016, and continues a cycle of Masterpiece productions. The cycle began in 2007 with ''The Joy Luck Club,'' a play by Susan Kim adapted from the novel by [[Amy Tan]], directed and choreographed by [[Tisa Chang]]. In 2008, Pan Asian presented the first professional theatrical production of ''The Missing Woman'', written and directed by Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc. The play was performed in Vietnamese and English, and  enabled diverse audiences to explore themes of social justice and human rights through the lens of traditional Vietnamese art forms. ''The Missing Woman'' represented Pan Asian's efforts towards international artistic collaboration.

''Shogun Macbeth'' opened the 2008 season. Adapted by John R. Briggs from Shakespeare's [[Macbeth]], the epic production combined medieval history with traditional Japanese techniques of Noh, Kyogen, and Samurai sword fighting, while retaining the complexity of [[Shakespearean]] language. Ernest Abuba, who had acted in the title role 22 years prior, directed the 2008 production. In the fall of 2009, the company produced ''Imelda'', a new musical based on the controversial figure of [[Imelda Marcos]]. Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and [[East West Players]] collaborated on this production, which was directed by Tim Dang, with the book by Sachi Oyama, lyrics by Aaron Coleman, music by Nathan Wang, and choreography by Reggie Lee.

In spring 2010, Pan Asian produced the East Coast premiere of ''Ching Chong Chinaman'', a comedy by Lauren Yee and directed by May Adrales. The work used the pejorative jingle to examine common assumptions about identity and culture. Pan Asian continued their relationship with Vietnamese audiences and artists with 2011's "Vietnam Project II: Past and Present". This included productions of Nguyen thi Minh Ngoc's ''We Are'', about Vietnamese women who work or marry abroad, and Derek Nguyen's ''Monster'', about a Vietnamese-American detective in search of a missing child and his past. The company's 35th anniversary season included ''Shanghai Lil's'' by Lilah Kan with music by Louis Stewart, a musical about the nightclub scene in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]] just prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]; and Mayank Keshaviah's ''Rangoon'', a world premiere about a family of Indian immigrants pursuing the [[American Dream]].

For their 41st season starting in 2017, Pan-Asian Rep featured the show ''Daybreak'' by [[Joyce Van Dyke]], which features the Armenian Genocide in the 1920s. If asked why Armenia, Chang replies: "Because Pan Asian is all of Asia and Polynesia. And I also feel the Middle East needs to be represented. It’s a very affirming play and, again, a story seldom told. If anything, history tends to hide traumatic periods, so I think that it’s a great service we do presenting these stories."&lt;ref name=Haun&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Putlog holes''' or '''putlock holes'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putlog&lt;/ref&gt; are small holes made in the walls of structures to receive the ends of poles (small round logs) or beams, called [[putlog]]s or putlocks, to support a [[scaffolding]].&lt;ref&gt;''Putlog holes.'' In: {{cite book |date=2015 |editor1-last= Weyer |editor1-first=Angela |editor2-last=Roig Picazo |editor2-first=Pilar |editor3-last=Pop |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Cassar |editor4-first=JoAnn |editor5-last=Özköse |editor5-first= Aysun |editor6-last=Vallet |editor6-first=Jean-Marc |editor7-last=Srša |editor7-first= Ivan |title=EwaGlos.

A historically common type of scaffolding, putlog holes date from ancient Roman buildings. The term putlock and the newer term putlog date from the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0)© Oxford University Press 2009. Putlog, putlock, n.&lt;/ref&gt; and are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Chudley, R., and Roger Greeno. ''Building construction handbook''. 8th ed. Oxford: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, 2010. 140-144. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Putlogs may be supported on the outer ends by vertical poles (standards), cantilevered by one end being firmly embedded in the wall, or cantilevered by penetrating the wall to provide scaffolds on both sides. Putlogs may be sawn off flush with the wall if they cannot be removed,&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Jean Pierre. ''Roman building: materials and techniques''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 151-152. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but exterior putlog holes are typically filled in as the scaffold is removed to prevent water from entering the walls. Interior putlog holes may be left open, particularly if not in a finished space.

The inconsequential size and the spacing of the holes meant that they did not affect the solidity of the walls, and in well-preserved castles, like [[Beaumaris Castle|Beaumaris]], the ancient putlog holes can be seen to this day.

The '''''Solly Madonna''''' by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] was painted somewhere between 1500 and 1504.

An early work, it clearly shows the influence of Raphael's teacher [[Perugino]].&lt;ref name="Sociology, Religion and Grace"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEh_AgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Sociology, Religion and Grace | publisher=Routledge | author=Szakolczai, Arpad | year=2007 | isbn=9781134194506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two motifs in this work would recur in later Madonnas by Raphael. The virgin Mary is reading a book, as in the [[Madonna and Child (Raphael, Pasadena)|Madonna and Child]] in the [[Norton Simon Museum]], the [[Connestabile Madonna]], the [[Madonna Colonna]] and the [[Madonna del cardellino]]. As in that last painting a small bird, a [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]], is part of the scene.&lt;ref name="Uffizi"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNE3ofu8psMC&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;dq=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;pg=PA420#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Solly%20Madonna%22&amp;f=false | title=Uffizi | publisher=Giunti Editore | author=Fossi, Gloria | year=2004 | isbn=9788809036765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is located in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. It is called the ''Solly Madonna'' because it was owned by the British banker and art collector [[Edward Solly]] (1776–1848).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">The concept of the '''spatial icon''', introduced by [[Aleksey Lidov|Alexei Lidov]],&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hodegetria of Constantinople" in the encyclopedia ''Miraculous icons in the Eastern Christian culture'', Moscow, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; plays a central role in [[hierotopy]] and is used to describe the perception of sacred spaces. Spatial icons are image-visions, that are evoked, for example, in the space of a [[temple]] or [[sanctuary]]. The spatial icon encompasses a broad range of components involved in the formation and definition of sacred spaces.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Spatial Icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria of Constantinople" in ''Hierotopy. Creation of  Sacred Spaces in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Progress-tradition, 2006, pp. 325-372.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a consciously created spatial image that transcends the material objects involved in its formation. A variety of plastic elements, including everything from buildings to decoration, and from [[mural]]s to [[liturgy|liturgical]] artifacts, work together to form a spatial icon. Sacred [[relic]]s and iconic images often play an integral role in the creation of a comprehensive spatial image.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bogdanovich. "The Performativity of Shrines in a Byzantine Church: The Shrines of St. Demetrios" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 275-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Sarabianov. "Relics and Images of Saints in the Sacred Space of St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 364-392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Akiyama. "Interrelationships of Relics and Images in Buddhist and Christian Traditions: Comparative and Performative Aspects" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 643-662.&lt;/ref&gt; Various dynamic and performative media also play a significant role, such as rituals and song,&lt;ref&gt;L. Evseeva, L. Kondrashkova. "Creating the Iconic Space: Text, Singing and Image in the Sixteenth Century Festive Liturgy" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 473-507.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the artistic manipulation of natural light,&lt;ref&gt;A. Godovanets. "The Icon of Light in the Architectural Space of Hagia Sophia" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 119-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vs. Rozhniatovsky. "The Performative Iconography. Effects of Light in the Space of Eastern Christian Churches." in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 393-442.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vs. Rozhniatovsky. "Light Effects in the Space of Byzantine Church: Peculiarities and Stages of Evolution" in ''Light and Fire in the Sacred Space'', ed. A.

Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 443-473.&lt;/ref&gt; and sounds, and also elements dealing with odor and touch.&lt;ref&gt;B. V. Pentcheva. The Sensual Icon. Space, Ritual, and the Senses in Byzantium, Pennstate Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point of view, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Church (building)|churches]] can be seen as spatial icons in which divine image-visions, such as [[Paradise]] or [[Heavenly Jerusalem]], were incarnated in the sacred space by means of the various media employed without being directly depicted.&lt;ref&gt;M. Sokolov. "Principle of Paradise." Moscow: Progress-Tradition, 2011, Ch. 1. Earthern and Heavenly Paradise, pp. 23-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: Spatial icons and Image-Paradigms in Byzantine Culture", Moscow: Theoria, 2009.  Ch. 10, Image-Paradigms as a New Notion of Visual Culture, pp. 293-305, 335-337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. L. Kessler. "Seeing Medieval Art", Broadview Press, 2004, ch.5, Church, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The temples and sanctuaries of various [[religion]]s were originally conceived, designed and created as spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;Sh. Tsuji. "Creating an Iconic Space. The Transformation of Narrative Landscape" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 627-642.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition in particular, impressive examples of spatial icons are to be found in re-creations of the Holy Land, or "New Jerusalems".&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. [http://hierotopy.ru/contents/NewJerusalems_01_Lidov_Introduction_2009_RusEng.pdf "New Jerusalems. Transferring of the Holy Land as Generative Matrix of Christian Culture"] in ''New Jerusalems. Hierotopy and iconography of sacred spaces'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2009, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Bacci. "Performed Topographies and Topomimetic Piety. Imaginative Sacred Spaces in Medieval Italy" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 101-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, spatial icons were the work of specific authors; their art could be compared with that of contemporary [[film director]]s, for in both cases, there is the coordinated effort of various artists and specialists in shaping a single, comprehensive vision.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Creator of Sacred Space as a Phenomenon of Byzantine Culture" in ''L’artista a Bisanzio e nel mondo cristiano-orientale'', ed. Michele Bacci, Pisa, 2003, pp.135-176.&lt;/ref&gt;

Performativity, as well as various dynamic elements, is a significant feature of spatial icons.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "The Byzantine World and Performative Spaces" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011. pp. 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a statue or building, they are constantly in motion, changing with the movement and activity of ritual and celebration, as well as with the alteration of light, odor and the movements of those participating and inhabiting them. The Tuesday performance surrounding the [[Hodegetria#Constantinople|Hodegetria icon in Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Lidov. "Hierotopy: spatial icons and image-paradigms in Byzantine culture", Ch. 2. Spatial icons. The Miraculous Performance with the Hodegetria in Constantinople. Moscow: Theoria, 2009, pp. 39-70.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Donkey walk]] taking place in [[Medieval]] Moscow&lt;ref&gt;M. Flier. "The Image of the Tsar in the Muscovite Palm Sunday Ritual" in ''Spatial icons. Performativity in Byzantium and Medieval Russia'', ed. A. Lidov, Moscow: Indrik, 2011, pp. 533-562.&lt;/ref&gt; are classical examples of iconic performativity in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Christian]] tradition. In both cases, the city itself was temporarily transformed into the matrix of a spatial icon; the participants involved in these rituals were thus veritable co-creators of the sacred space along with the artists, priests and celebrants responsible for leading it. Another example of this performative element at work in spatial icons can be found in the ritual creation and destruction of the [[sand mandala]] in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition.

[[Image:Steven Shaviro 05A.jpg|thumb|Steven Shaviro (2007)]]
'''Steven Shaviro''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|v|ɪr|oʊ}}; born April 3, 1954) is an American academic, [[philosopher]] and [[cultural critic]] whose areas of interest include [[film theory]], [[time]], [[science fiction]], [[panpsychism]], [[capitalism]], [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[subjectivity]]. He earned a PhD from Yale in 1981. 

==Work==
His most widely read book is ''Doom Patrols'', a "theoretical fiction" that outlines the state of [[postmodernism]] during the early 1990s, using poetic language, personal anecdotes, and creative prose. He has also written extensively about [[music videos]] as an artform.

Additionally, Shaviro has written a book about film theory, ''The Cinematic Body'', which examines the dominance of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in contemporary academic film theory. According to Shaviro, the use of [[psychoanalysis]] has mirrored the actions of a [[cult]], with its own religious texts (essays by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan).

Shaviro's book ''Connected, Or, What It Means to Live in the Network Society'', appeared in 2003. A later book, ''Without Criteria: Kant, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Aesthetics'' was published in May 2009.

'''The Invisible Generation''' was a contemporary art project conceived by artist [[Per Hüttner]] and Curator [[Daniele Balit]] and organized by [[Vision Forum (art organisation)|Vision Forum]] and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in  [[Melbourne]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Beijing]] and [[Kiev]] in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiences’ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation"&gt;The Invisible Generation, ed.

Most projects were realized in contexts where the audience does not necessarily expect to find artwork. In the metro (Dinu Li, Per Hüttner), in a newspaper office (Yan Jun), on a public square (Natasha Rosling) or even contained as a story in the mind of a person in a shop (Good TV). In other instances the project played with the perceived immutability of the artwork. The audience was asked to actively create or re-create artwork (The Anti-Hospital), remove or destroy drawings (Jean-François Robardet), bring books to be changed (Private Contractors) or in some cases it was disguised as an informative poster, graffity or political propaganda (Huang Xiaopeng, Per Hüttner).

The inspiration and title is taken from a text by [[William S. Burroughs]] where he describes a series of situation where a tape recorder is used to create new forms of meeting between people and new forms of engagement with the media.

==Melbourne, September 2009==
The first part of The Invisible Generation opened to the public in Australia in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1252072574&amp;day=1253138400&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation was co-curated by Hüttner and Balit. It was introduced at the [[Margaret Lawrence Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vca.unimelb.edu.au/gallarchive09/#cs_3602&lt;/ref&gt; which was also the starting point for a number of interventions in the public space of the city. In the gallery were two major installations presented: Do Not Go Gentle Court by Per Hüttner and Polka Dot by French artist Mark Geffriaud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fracidf-leplateau.com/en/index.html  The work is in the collection of FRAC Île de France]&lt;/ref&gt; The two works redefine the gallery experience through reflections on the fabric of space and time. Being situated at the boundaries between installation and performance, they delineated a space that was the starting point for the Anti-Hospital, an open-ended and evolving platform which formed the core of the project. The Anti-Hospital was designed by Melbourne-based collective Greatest Hits&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatesthitswebsite.com/the-invisible-generation.html&lt;/ref&gt; and focused around a collection of artistic documents providing instructions that were formulated as possible actions, performances, temporary artworks, objects and social situations, scores and sonic interventions proposed by absent artists and realized by local artists, non-artists and visitors to the gallery. Greatest Hits created a dozen videos that enacted, played with and read out the instructions and together created a sort of manual to aid and inspire the visitor to relate to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://tig-melbourne.blogspot.com/2009/12/greatest-hits-video-excerpt-montage.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many instructions were interpreted, primarily by local artists while the exhibition was open to the public.

For the period of the exhibition the Anti-Hospital also coordinated a series of events, performances, actions, workshops and ways of disseminating the instructions through the media and the urban space of Melbourne including, local artists, students and a program on the screen and LEDs at Federation Square. This included the controversial project “Young Dictators” conceived and realized by Per Hüttner with two local students. The three put up 2000 copies of A4 sized posters around the city showing images of dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] as children with the text “Have you seen this child? Please contact 0432 027 925” (Hüttner’s mobile number).

==Shenzhen October 2009==
Where the presentation in Melbourne focused on the relationship between suspended instructions in the gallery and interventions in the public space, the project in Shenzhen consisted mostly of unannounced performances in the public space and hosted by the contemporary art museum OCAT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocat.com.cn Official OCAT website]&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in political, economical, social and architectural context also meant the dynamics of the project changed greatly and made the participation of the local audience more difficult to achieve, but all the more successful on the occasions where it happened. Presentations included carnivalesque costumes appearing in public space as temporary and wearable architectural elements by Natasha Rosling. Yang Zhifei carried a giant white pillow through the streets of the city and she let an army of people sleep in public spaces, each with a normally sized pillow under their head. She also organized a dream workshop to compare the dreams of the Chinese with those of the Dutch. [[Dinu Li]] created a choreography of corruption and guilt on the Shenzhen underground provoking fear in the audience and laying bare how deep inside the psyches of its citizens a [[totalitarian]] government can reach. Neno Belchev designed a portable zebra crossings to facilitate [[jaywalking]], a passion shared by the Chinese and [[Bulgarians]].&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

[[File:Yzf1low.jpg|thumb|left| Yang Zhifei's performance in Beijing that was part of The Invisible Generation, October 2009.]]

==Beijing July 2009 – July 2010==
The events in Beijing took place over a whole year and culminated in a large presentation at [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]] in June 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucca.org.cn/portal/activitie/view.798?id=520&amp;lang=en&amp;menuId=28&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations kicked off with summer 2009 with Jon Phillips and [[Matt Hope|Matt Hope’s]] speaker event "Laoban Sound System" in conjunction with [[Ai Weiwei|Ai Weiwei’s]] day without internet. The two has since launched a range of events in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;http://laoban-soundsystem.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Other events included Yan Jun’s sonic material slipped into the desk drawers at Beijing Youth Weekly editorial office and interviews from the same newspaper that were replayed and perverted over 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.birdcagespace.com/index.php?/next-episode/yan-jun/&lt;/ref&gt; Good TV collected memories of images that had been lost for different reasons. collection of lost images retold by storytellers in their everyday life in the Wudaoying Hutong (五道营胡同). The Beijing context and the proximity to the centre of political power allowed “This Image Is No More” to develop another layer of interpretation which had been lacking in its realization in Europe. Both Natasha Rosling and Yang Zhifei created versions of their projects from Shenzhen in Beijing. Especially the giant white pillow carried through the streets the Chinese capital to mirrored its grandiose buildings in ways that also inspired interesting reactions among the unassuming audience.

==Kiev, November 2009 and July 2010==
In November Yulia Usova and PAI organised a series of talks in Kiev that approached issues such as [[Cultural heritage management|curation]] and art in public spaces and included speakers such as [[Olesya Turkina]], [[Olav Westphalen]] and Karen MacDonald. In conjunction with this a group of students from [[Kungliga Konsthögskolan]] in [[Stockholm]] made a series of improvised performances at [[Les Kurbas’ Theater Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kurbas.org.ua/en/les_kurbas.html Les Kurbas presentation in English]&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the project took place during the [[swine flu]] epidemic in Ukraine  all public theatre events were stopped and schools closed giving the whole event a very special flavour.

The actual project was scheduled to be realized in April 2010, but had to be cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud that prevented air travel in Europe at the given time and only web-performances were undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1271946267&amp;day=1271973600&lt;/ref&gt; The project was realized 19 June and 2–4 July 2010 and was co-curated by Per Hüttner and Yulia Usova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.se/Creative-Force/Start/Creative-Force/News/Nyheter/Invisible-generation/&lt;/ref&gt; The project saw a meeting between artists from China, Western Europe and Ukraine. Rumours claim that artists met with great problems with local authorities including arrests, theft by undercover policemen and that the artists had to bribe officials to be able to leave the country.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

==Documentation and talks==
Since most of the events in The Invisible Generation only had an unexpecting audience, the organizers present the documentation of the project in various art institutions around the world, including UCCA in Beijing and Norrköpings Konstmuseum in Sweden. Vision Forum has also published an extensive catalogue about The Invisible Generation in 2011. It was edited by Gerrie van Noord and includes all the original instructions presented in Melbourne. The publication also contains texts by Daniele Balit, Per Hüttner, Olav Westphalen and incidentally contains a reproduction of this page. The book is framed by three texts by the editor, Gerrie van Noord where she reflects on the difficulty and necessity of mediating projects ephemeral projects like The Invisible Generation.&lt;ref name="The Invisible Generation" /&gt;

In the 1790s this painting was in the collection of [[Jan Gildemeester]] and was included in the 1800 catalog of paintings (ordered alphabetically by artist) produced for his estate sale, though it was not included in [[Adriaan de Lelie]]'s 1794 painting of the collection known as ''[[The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of works in the collection of Jan Gildemeester]]&lt;/ref&gt; The catalog states that it is an "allegory of Raadpensionaris de Witt".&lt;ref name=cat/&gt; The painting was purchased by the art dealer [[Cornelis Sebille Roos]] for 100 guilders for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague, on behalf of the director [[Alexander Gogel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002646 Cornelis Sebille Roos] in [[KNAW]] members list&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifthenisnow.eu/fr/node/159786 Biography of Roos]&lt;/ref&gt; It is documented as the first purchase by that institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/denationalekonst00moes#page/n48/mode/1up De Nationale Konst-Gallery en het Koninklijk Museum, Amsterdam] by [[E.W. Moes]], 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the white text that was painted onto the painting was done during the [[Witten-Oorlog]].&lt;ref&gt;De inrichting van de Nationale Konst-Gallery in het openingsjaar 1800, by [[Pieter J.J. van Thiel]], Oud Holland, Vol. 95, No. 4 (1981), page 173&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was purchased for the Nationale Konst-Gallery in The Hague in 1800 based on its allegorical reference, but only later did visitors point out that the painter had died long before the murder of the De Witt brothers took place.

The '''Théâtre de l'Œuvre''' is a Paris theatre, located atop cité Monthiers, at 55 rue de Clichy in the 9° arrondissement in Paris, France. It is best known as the theatre where [[Alfred Jarry]]’s nihilistic farce ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' premiered in 1896.

Founded in Paris in 1893, the Théâtre de l'Œuvre was among the first theatrical venues in France to provide a home for the artists of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist Movement]] at the end of the nineteenth century. Modeled on the experimental structure of the [[Théâtre Libre]], the venue was directed by [[Lugné-Poe]],&lt;ref name="orsay"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay-more/page/0/article/le-theatre-de-loeuvre-1893-1900-naissance-du-theatre-moderne-4224.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=649&amp;cHash=e75d812114 | title = The Théâtre de l'Œuvre | accessdate = September 6, 2013 | publisher = [[Musée d'Orsay]] Online | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090350/http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay-more/page/0/article/le-theatre-de-loeuvre-1893-1900-naissance-du-theatre-moderne-4224.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=649&amp;cHash=e75d812114 | archivedate = March 4, 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Parisian actor and stage manager from its opening through 1929.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Edward Gordon|title=On the Art of the Theatre |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0203889746 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UzTYCqHaXJMC&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=%22theatre+de+l%27oeuvre%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Franc Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Lugné-Poe]] had embraced symbolism's "subjectivity, spirituality, and mysterious internal and external forces"&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett|first=Oscar Gross|title=The History of the Theatre|year=1968|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|pages=442–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a source of profound truth after working as an actor at the Théâtre d'Art. The first of the independent Symbolist theatre, the poet [[Paul Fort]], then just seventeen years old, formed the company to explore the performance potential of found texts such as ''[[The Iliad]]'', ''[[The Bible]]'', and his own lyric verse.  When Fort left the group in 1892, his work was carried on by what would become the Théâtre de l'Œuvre with [[Lugné-Poe]] at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasper|first=Rathbone|title=Adventure in the theatre: Lugné-Poe and the Théâtre de l'oeuvre to 1899|year=1947|publisher=Rutgers|location=Piscataway, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Fort's project which catered to the intellectual elite, Lugné-Poe sought to create a "theatre for the people," and customarily offered free tickets to most of the public, reserving only 100 seats for his subscription holders. Under his direction, the company first performed [[Maurice Maeterlinck| Maurice Maeterlinck's]] ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' on May 17, 1892. According to theatre historian Oscar Brockett:

{{cquote|The opening production, Maeterlink's ''Pelléas and Mélisande'', was typical.  Few properties and little furniture were used; the stage was lighted from overhead and most of the action passed in semidarkness; a gauze curtain, hung between the actors and the audience, gave the impression that mist enveloped the stage; backdrops, painted in gray tones, emphasized the air of mystery; costumes were vaguely medieval, although the intention was to create draperies of no particular period. The actors spoke in a staccato chant like priests and, according to some critics, behaved like sleepwalkers; their gestures were strongly stylized.  Given this radically new approach, it is not surprising that many spectators were mystified.&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;}}

With the help of poet and critic [[Camille Mauclair]] and the painter [[Édouard Vuillard]] (with whom Lugné-Poe was sharing an apartment), the director dedicated the theatre to presenting the work of the young French Symbolist playwrights in addition to introducing new foreign dramas. The group established themselves that same year, renting a small room atop the cité Monthiers called the ''salle Berlioz'' and calling themselves ''Maison de l'Œuvre'', or literally, the "House of Works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogeval|first=Guy|title=Édouard Vuillard|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Paris Salle Berlioz 55 rue de Clichy 1907.jpg|thumb|250px|left|La salle Berlioz in 1907]]

In addition to those of Maeterlinck, the theatre also produced [[Sanskrit drama]]s in addition to works by foreign authors such as [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Gabriele D’Annunzio]], alongside works by young French dramatists like [[Henry Bataille]], [[Henri de Régnier]] et [[Alfred Jarry]]. Lugné-Poe was also instrumental in introducing [[Henrik Ibsen]]’s plays to French audiences.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Théâtre de l'Oeuvre, a Paris Theatre|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/425539/Theatre-de-lOeuvre|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Britannica Online|accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in the description of the theatre's initial performance, the majority Lugné-Poe's stage settings were simple, non-realistic representations of line and color on canvas backdrops.  He sought to create a theatre of poetry and dreams while staying true to his motto, "The word creates the decor."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt; The staging was atmospheric and the acting stylized; costumes were usually simple and “timeless.”&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Some designers included [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Maurice Denis]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], and [[Édouard Vuillard|Vuillard]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simonson|first=Lee|title=The Stage Is Set|year=1963|publisher=Theatre Art Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 1896, Théâtre de l'Œuvre presented Alfred Jarry's legendary ''Ubu Roi'', with actor Firmin Gémier in the title role. Jarry had finished this epochal play about human greed, cowardice, and stupidity just six months before it would shock the audiences with its unapologetic opening line, "Merdre." Though Jarry affected an attitude of political indifference, his revolutionary ideas challenged assumptions about society, propriety, and existence. Brockett notes that "''Ubu Roi'' shows in all its grotesqueness a world without human decency."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;  In this lithograph announcement by Jarry for the performance of Ubu Roi, King Ubu appears as a shadow puppet with a segmented arm. He brandishes a scimitar in one hand and clutches a sack of gold in the other.

===Temporary Closures===
By 1899 the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre had presented 51 programs and toured England, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. In spite of this success, Lugné-Poe had come to feel that the work of the Symbolists was juvenile and limiting to his artistic development.  He closed the theatre in 1899, marking an end to the first major phase of the anti-realism movement in the theatre.

[[Lugné-Poe]] revived the theatre December 22, 1912 with a production of [[Paul Claudel| Paul Claudel's]] ''L'Annonce faite à Marie.'' Following that were several works by the [[Dada]]ist and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] writers of the era. The group was off to a running start, but activity was interrupted again with the beginning of [[World War I]] in 1914.  They reopened again in 1919 with the help of financing from the actor [[Marcelle Frappa]] and ran the theatre continuously until his final retirement in 1929. Through their productions, tours, and critical reviews the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre, under the direction of Lugné-Poe, had managed to influence "almost every departure from realism between 1893 and 1915."&lt;ref name="Brockett"/&gt;

Lucien Beer and [[Paulette Pax]] succeeded Lugné-Poe in 1929 and served as the theatre's directors until the beginning of [[World War II]].  Shortly after the conflict began, Hitler conquered France and the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] under Jacques Hébertot made most theatres illegal in the occupied zone.  After the [[Liberation of Paris]] in 1944, [[Raymond Rouleau]] rejoined Lucien Beer, and together they ran the theatre until 1951, when they were both replaced by Robert de Ribon.

In 1960 Pierre Franck and Georges Herbert took over direction. They ran the theatre until 1978, when they were replaced by Georges Wilson as Artistic Director and principal scenic designer.  He remained until 1995 when Gérard Maro, who had been Artistic Director of the Comédie de Paris since 1981 took over as chef of the Théâtre de l'Œuvre.  He is still in charge today.

'''Zenitism''' ({{Lang-sh|Zenitizam / Зенитизам}}) was an [[art]] movement in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1921 until 1926, first in [[Zagreb]] from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in [[Belgrade]]. The movement was mainly involved in [[visual arts]], [[graphic design]], [[poetry]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.nb.rs/zenit/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."

Most of its ideas were communicated through the [[Zenit (magazine)|Zenit]] magazine which [[Ljubomir Micić]] launched and which published 43 issues.

==The movement==

The movement was established following [[World War I]], during which [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] lost a million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.
