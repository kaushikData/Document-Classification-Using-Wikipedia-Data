{{Campaignbox Northern Ireland Troubles}}

On 20 March 1994, a [[British Army]] [[Westland Lynx|Lynx helicopter]] was shot down by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) in [[Northern Ireland]]. A unit of the IRA's [[Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade|South Armagh Brigade]] fired an [[Barrack buster|improvised mortar]] at the British Army base in [[Crossmaglen]], [[County Armagh]]. The mortar round hit and shot down the helicopter, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ZD275, while it was hovering over the [[helipad]]. Three British soldiers and a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) member were wounded.

== Background ==
Since the 1970s, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] developed a series of home-made [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The goal was to produce devices to be used as "stand-off" weapons, capable of being launched from safe ranges upon police or military outposts and easy to conceal on dead-ground.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The different designs evolved in 1992 into the Mark 15 mortar, widely known as the "[[barrack buster]]". The mortar shell consisted of a one metre long metal [[propane]] cylinder with a diameter of 36&amp;nbsp;cm that contained around 70&amp;nbsp;kg of home-made explosives and with a range between 75 and 275 m. The cylinder was an adaptation of a commercial 'Kosangas' gas cylinder for heating and cooking gas used in rural areas in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the "barrack buster" took place on 7 December 1992 against a joint RUC/British Army base in [[Ballygawley, County Tyrone|Ballygawley]], [[County Tyrone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryder,p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

== The attack ==
[[File:Barrack buster feb 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|IRA barrack buster mortar]]
On the evening of 20 March 1994, a Lynx helicopter, serial number ZD275, was in the process of landing at the large British Army base at [[Crossmaglen]]. Meanwhile, an IRA unit had mounted a Mark 15 mortar on a tractor, concealed behind bales of hay. The tractor was parked 150 yards from the intended target, on waste ground. At 20:27, there was a sudden blackout across Crossmaglen's square and at the same time, a single mortar shell was lobbed into the barracks. The IRA had used the [[Mains electricity|mains]] for the collapsing circuit of the firing pack, turning off the street's power supply and allowing the mortar's own battery to trigger the launcher. When the Lynx was hovering 100 feet over the [[helipad]], the mortar round hit the aircraft on the tail's boom, which was severed from the fuselage. The machine spun out of control, but the pilot was able to crash-land the Lynx inside the base. A [[Grenadier Guards]]' patrol spotted a huge orange fireball from a mile away. Three members of the crew managed to get out with minor injuries, but a member of the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] was trapped inside the blazing wreckage. The constable was rescued just before the fuel tanks and the ammunition started to explode.

Author [[Toby Harnden]] described the incident as the most successful IRA operation against a helicopter in the course of [[the Troubles]].&lt;ref name=SA&gt;Harnden, p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukserials.com/losses-1994.htm UK Military Aircraft Losses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English &amp; Oppenheimer, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the incident, the IRA and [[Sinn Féin]] were criticised by the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] [[Member of the Parliament]] for the area [[Seamus Mallon]], who said:
{{quote|God knows how many people could have been killed. When you realise this mortar was lobbed over a number of houses it brings home the enormity of the danger so many people faced. Yet again you have Sinn Féin talking peace in the morning and carrying out these murderous attacks through the IRA in the evening.}} John Fee, a local SDLP councillor who described the attack as "an act of lunacy", was later beaten by two men outside his home. The IRA denied responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporal Robert Tomlinson of the [[Royal Military Police]] was awarded the [[Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service]] for his part in coming to the aid of the wounded constable and organising his [[casevac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.corpsofmilitarypolice.org/soldier/2890/|title = Royal Military Police|date = |accessdate = 31 July 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporal Wayne Cuckson of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] was awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]] for dragging the wounded constable out of the crashed aircraft.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt; Cuckson, who reached the rank of Warrant Officer Class Two, died on 6 April 2011 in a crash while driving his motorcycle between [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] and [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-13090801 Abingdon crash victim was soldier]. BBC News, 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a second mortar attack on a British military helicopter on 12 July 1994, at [[Newtownhamilton]], when an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]] carrying 12 soldiers crash-landed on a soccer pitch after being hit on its tail by another Mark 15 mortar launched from a tractor. The helicopter was lifting off from the local military base. No serious injuries were reported.&lt;ref name=SA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=boJKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zpMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2697,4434472&amp;dq=mortar+ira&amp;hl=en IRA downs British Helicopter] [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 13 July 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The Puma sustained Category 3 or Category 4 damage on the RAF scale. After returning to service, the machine was definitively written off and scrapped after suffering another crash-landing in [[Germany]] on 15 February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Air pictorial: journal of the Air League, Volumen 59, p. 196, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The downing of two helicopters by mortar fire, along with the increasing [[South Armagh Sniper (1990–1997)|sniper activity]] of the IRA, was both a morale and military blow to the British forces in south County Armagh.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5024">'''Andreas Agnellus''' of [[Ravenna]] (c. 805 – after 846) was a historian of the bishops in his city. The date of his death is not recorded, although his history mentions the death of archbishop George of Ravenna in 846; Oswald Holder-Egger cites a papyrus charter dated to either 854 or 869 that contains the name of a priest named Andreas of the Church of Ravenna, but there is no evidence to connect him with Andreas Agnellus.{{sfn|Deliyannis|2004|p=12}}

==Life and writings==
Though called Abbot, first of [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|St. Mary ad Blachernas]], and, later, of St. Bartholomew, Andreas appears to have remained a [[secular priest]], being probably only titular abbot of each abbey. He is best known as the author of the ''Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis'' (LPR), an account of the occupants of his native church, compiled on the model of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', a compilation of the lives of the [[Pope]]s of Rome.{{sfn|Shahan|1907}} The work survives in two manuscripts: one in the Biblioteca Estense in [[Modena]], written in 1413; the other is in the [[Vatican Library]], written in the mid-16th century and breaks off in the middle of the life of Archbishop Peter II. Copies of Agnellus's lives of two saintly bishops of Ravenna, Severus and [[Peter Chrysologus]] exist in independent traditions, copied into collections of saints lives. 

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the LPR was published in Modena by [[Benedetto Bacchini]] in 1708;{{sfn|Shahan|1907}} a complete English translation of the LPR by Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis was published in 2004.{{sfn|Deliyannis|2004}} The LPR begins with [[Apollinaris of Ravenna|Saint Apollinaris]] and ends with Georgius, the forty-eighth archbishop (died 846).{{sfn|Shahan|1907}} Though the work contains "unreliable material" according to the article on Agnellus in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', Thomas Shahan (the author of the article) states that the LPR is "a unique and rich source of information concerning the buildings, inscriptions, manners, and religious customs of Ravenna in the ninth century".{{sfn|Shahan|1907}} Deliyannis notes that "two themes recur throughout the LPR: an anxiety for the rights of the clergy in the face of oppression by bishops, and a firm preference for the [[autocephaly]] of Ravenna, with a particular dislike of control of [the archbishopric of] Ravenna by the Roman pope".{{sfn|Deliyannis|2004|p=17}} The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' further comments that "in his efforts to be erudite he often falls into unpardonable errors. The diction is barbarous, and the text is faulty and corrupt".{{sfn|Shahan|1907}}

[[File:Aron Freimann.png|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Aron Freimann]]
'''Aron Freimann''' (5 August 1871 at [[Wieleń|Filehne]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]] &amp;ndash; 6 June 1948 at [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] librarian and historian. He was the son of [[Israel Meir Freimann|Israel Meïr Freimann]], and grandson, on his mother's side, of the chief rabbi of Altona, [[Jacob Ettlinger]]. He attended the Royal [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] of [[Ostrów Wielkopolski|Ostrowo]] (his father was the town's Jewish congregation rabbi) and in 1893 entered the [[University of Berlin]] (Ph. D., 1896), where he studied history and Oriental languages, devoting himself at the same time to the study of archival and library systems. Parallelly he took courses at the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary|Rabbinical Seminary at Berlin]].

From 1897 he was chief of the Hebrew department at the [[Frankfurt University Library|Stadtbibliotek Frankfurt]], and under his direction the library in [[Frankfurt]] upon Main assembled one of the richest collections of Judaica and Hebraica in the world. He retired in 1933 when the Nazis came to power and immigrated to the United States in 1938. Between 1939 and 1945 he served as consultant in bibliography to the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmelzer, Menahem, "Freimann, Aron", in: ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 7. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 237-238. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 16 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1900 he was one of the editors of ''Zeitschrift für Hebräische Bibliographie.'' He was the author of ''Die Isagoge des Porphyrius in den Syrischen Uebersetzungen'' (1896), and ''Geschichte der Israelitischen Gemeinde Ostrowo'' (1896). To the "Ḳobeẓ al-Yad," a collective work published by the ''Mekize Nirdamim'' Society, he contributed articles on the history of the Jews in Prague.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4969">'''Bruno the Saxon''' (Latin: ''Bruno Saxonicus'', also known as '''Bruno of Merseburg''' (German: ''Brun von Merseburg'') and '''Bruno of Magdeburg''') was a German chronicler of the eleventh century and author of the ''Historia de Bello Saxonico'' or History of the Saxon Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=English Historical Review xciv|year=1979|pages=723–37.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Life ==

Little is known of his life. Bruno was probably from an aristocratic background. He was a Saxon [[monk]] belonging to the household of Archbishop Werner, of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]], who was a vigorous opponent of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and one of the leaders of the Saxon uprising against the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Bachrach and Bachrach, 'Bruno of Merseburg', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the archbishop in 1078 at the hands of peasants, Bruno attached himself to Werner of Wolkenburg, [[Bishopric of Merseburg|Prince-Bishop of Merseburg]], to whom, in 1082, he dedicated the work, "De Bello Saxonico" by which he is chiefly known. As its name indicates, it is a record of the struggles of the Saxons with the Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The author begins with an account of the youth of Henry and the evil influence exerted over him by Archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Adalbert]] of [[Hamburg-Bremen]] after he had passed from the stern tutelage of [[Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne]]. He then traces the relations of the emperor with the Saxons and narrates at length the causes and events of the [[Saxon Rebellion]], ending with the election of [[Hermann of Luxemburg]] as king in 1081.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03018b.htm|title=Bruno the Saxon|work=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historia de Bello Saxonico''==
Bruno sought to justify the [[Saxon Rebellion|rebellion of the Saxons]] and the election of the first anti-king, [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden|Rudolf]], and to show how by his oppressive government King Henry had forfeited any right to rule, both for himself and his dynasty. Bruno also devoted considerable attention to Henry’s dispute with [[Pope Gregory VII]], ten of whose letters he reproduced in his history. But while supporting the pope against the king, he made clear, both in his own words and through letters which he copied, that the German rebels were deeply disappointed by the Gregory’s [[Walk to Canossa|absolution of Henry at Canossa]] in December 1076, and his attempt to remain neutral after the more intransigent rebels had elected a rival king at [[Forchheim]] in March 1077. Bruno was at pains to stress that this election was conducted with the full knowledge and involvement of a papal legate, and indeed followed the standards of probity laid down by canon law. Hence there could be no doubt about its validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/.../Bruno.doc|title=Bruno the Saxon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bruno described the dissatisfaction of the Saxons to the actions of Gregory VII. The German rebels reproached Gregory VII for not supporting the anti-king Rudolf.  The letters to which they refer, which Bruno reproduced in full, were those sent by Gregory in the summer of 1077 to his legates, and to the clergy and people of Germany, setting out the terms by which a judgement might be made between the respective claims of Henry and Rudolf to be the rightful king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowdrey|first=H.E.J. |authorlink=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=The Register of Pope Gregory VII 1073-1085. An English Translation|year=2002|location=Oxford|pages=236–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

There has been a difference of opinion regarding the historical value of Bruno's work. It was written during the contentions between Henry and [[Pope Gregory VII]], and the author has been classed with those partisans who, either through ignorance or malice, endeavoured to lower Henry in the esteem of his subjects.  Bruno indeed supported the pope's cause, and his Saxon sympathies manifest themselves at times in his writings, but of his sincerity and his expressed purpose to narrate the truth there can be no doubt. He made the most of his sources of information and, in spite of occasional omissions, gives a vivid picture of the times from the point of view of an interested contemporary. The letters of [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[bishops]] and other original documents which he includes in his history give an added value to the work.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The '''Cambrian Archaeological Association''' ({{lang-cy|'''Cymdeithas Hynafiaethau Cymru'''}}) was founded in 1846 to examine, preserve and illustrate the ancient monuments and remains of the history, language, manners, customs, arts and industries of [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches]] and to educate the public in such matters.  The association's activities include sponsoring lectures, field visits, and study tours; as well as publishing its journal, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', and monographs.  It also provides grants to support research and publications.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stephens, ''The New Companion to the Literature of Wales'' (University of Wales Press, 1998), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Meetings and lectures===
The association holds two meetings each year, a week in mid-summer and an autumn weekend, visiting sites and monuments in all parts of Wales and, on occasions, in England, Scotland, Ireland and abroad. Easter conferences with lectures on matters of current concern in history and archaeology are held on a bi-annual basis. It arranges a lecture in the [[Welsh language]] each year at the [[National Eisteddfod]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Moore, "Cambrian Meetings 1847–1997: A Society's Contribution to the Changing Archaeological Scene", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', Vol 147, 3–55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research grants and education awards===
Research grants are awarded annually and are normally in the region of £500-£2000. In 2012 an award was made to Dr Toby Driver and Dr Jeffrey Davies for post-excavation work on their excavations at the Abermagwr Roman villa, [[Ceredigion]]. The Blodwen Jerman Schools Prize is awarded annually to a Welsh school for their promotion of Archaeology and History within the School. An Undergraduate Essay Prize is also awarded by the association. The [[G. T. Clark]] Prizes are awarded every five years for the most distinguished published contributions to the study of the archaeology and history of Wales and The Marches. There are five categories: Prehistory, Roman, Early Medieval, Medieval and Post-Medieval.&lt;ref&gt;D Moore, ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', Vol 147, (1998), pp. 296–7 provides a list of recipients between 1946 and 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
Apart from the journal ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', the association has a long tradition of publishing supplementary volumes on Welsh History and Archaeology. A most ambitious project was the publication in 1888 of a facsimile edition of [[Thomas Dingley (antiquary)|Thomas Dineley]]'s ''Progress of...Henry ..Duke of Beaufort (Lord President of the council in Wales and Lord Warden of the Marches) Thorough Wales in 1684''&lt;ref&gt;The project was arranged by R. W. Banks, the Treasurer of the association , who supplied the introductory preface to the work. It was published in London by Blades, East and Blades in 1818&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. D. Fenn, "R. W. Banks and the Cambrian Archaeological Association", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 154 (2005), 2007, pp. 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the association has published between 1978 and 1998, in conjunction with [[Cadw]], an important series of monographs on excavations in Wales. In 2013 it published a [[Festschrift]], ''Reflections on the Past'', on the theme of British prehistory and archaeology, to mark the longstanding contribution made by the prehistorian [[Frances Lynch]] to the work of the association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=William J. |editor1-last=Britnell |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Silvester |title=Reflections on the Past: essays in honour of Frances Lynch |publisher=Cambrian Archaeological Association |place=Welshpool |year=2012 |ISBN=9780947846084 }}  pp. 452–66. &lt;/ref&gt; Other important publications by the association include:

* [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]] (edited and transcribed by [[David Thomas (Archdeacon of Montgomery)|Archdeacon D. R. Thomas]]), ''Notes on the Older Churches in the Four Welsh Dioceses'', 1903. These notes were made by the first president of the Cambrians between 1824 and 1874 and are particularly important as they describe many of the churches in Wales before they were altered by Victorian restorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lawrence |last=Butler |chapter=Sir Stephen Glynne and 'The Older Churches of the Four Welsh Dioceses' |editor1-first=William J. |editor1-last=Britnell |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Silvester |title=Reflections on the Past: essays in honour of Frances Lynch |publisher=Cambrian Archaeological Association |place=Welshpool |year=2012 |ISBN=9780947846084 |pages=452–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Antecedents and founding years, 1846–1855===
The Cambrian Archaeological Society was founded at a time when a sense of Welsh national identity was increasingly asserting itself. It was also at the moment that the dominance of the Antiquarian and Welsh learned societies centred in London were on the wane.&lt;ref&gt;Emrys Jones ed. (2001) ''The Welsh in London, 1500–2000'', Cardiff: UWP, pp. 69–74&lt;/ref&gt; There were two earlier learned Welsh Cultural societies in London; the [[Cymmrodorion]] founded in 1751&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cymmrodorion.org/our-history: Prof Prys Morgan, “A Brief History of the Cymmrodorion”- it should be noted that this society was the successor to an earlier society, ‘The Most Honorable and Loyal Society of Antient Britons’, which had been founded in 1715&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Cymreigyddion'' (who conducted all their business in the Welsh language) founded in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. Jenkins and Helen M. Ramage ‘A History of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and the ''Gwyneddigion'' and ''Cymreigyddion Societies'' (1751-1951), Y Cymmrodor Vol 50&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cymmrodorion had ceased to meet in 1843, although it was re-established in 1873, while the ''Cymreigyddion''  disappeared completely in the 1850s. The premier English antiquarian society, the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], which had received its [[Royal Charter]] in 1745, was also in an impoverished state, having virtually bankrupted itself as the result of publishing ventures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Evans (art historian)|Joan Evans]]"A History of the Society of Antiquaries", Oxford, 1956, 258–60&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] had been established in Edinburgh in 1780, while in Ireland the [[Royal Irish Academy]], established in 1786, had its own Antiquities Section, and in 1890 the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] had been formed from the Kilkenny Archaeological Society.[[File:Tower , near Mold 1846.jpeg|thumb|Tower, Broncoed, near Mold 1846. Soft Ground etching by Harry Longueville Jones, ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]'', vol. 1 (1846), p. 54]] Against this background the [[British Archaeological Association]] was founded in 1844, and was followed rapidly by a breakaway group, the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]], which pioneered a model of holding annual meetings or congresses in various parts of the British Isles and producing an annual journal (published in quarterly parts). This was the model adopted by Cambrian Archaeological Association for Wales and the Marches.

The driving figure in the establishment of the Cambrian Archaeological Association was the Rev. [[Harry Longueville Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;Longueville Jones took his name from inheriting the Longueville estates in Shropshire.  Sir Ben Bowen Thomas "Arch Camb" 127, apparently erroneously says that his mother came from the French Longueville family, which seems most unlikely as her maiden name was Stephen&lt;/ref&gt; who was supported by the celticist the Rev [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]]. Rather than form a society directly, Longueville Jones produced a 'manifesto' -''On the study and preservation of national antiquities''- calling on interested people to join together and form an association.&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Longueville Jones at this date was living at [[Beaumaris]] in Anglesey.  Between 1834 and 1842 he lived in Paris, where he worked for the English language publisher [[John Anthony Galignani|Galignani]] and edited several editions of Galignani's Paris Guide.  He worked with leading literary figures including [[William Thackeray]]. The ideas he put forward owed much to current developments in France, which followed the appointment in 1834 of the French novelist [[Prosper Mérimée]] as the first Inspector-General of ''Monuments Historiques''.&lt;ref&gt;André Fermigier, Mérimée et l'inspection des monuments historiques, dans Pierre Nora (dir.), Les lieux de mémoire, vol. 1, Paris: Gallimard Quarto, 1997, p. 1599-1614.&lt;/ref&gt; Longueville was also a talented artist and his work was used to illustrate early volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''.

===Early years 1847–1855===
[[File:Sir Stephen Glynne 01.jpeg|thumb|left|Sir Stephen Glynne, president 1847/9]]
The first annual meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society was held at Aberystwyth between 7 and 10 September 1847, and the first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Richard Glynne]]. By the time of the second annual meeting at Caernarvon it was claimed that the membership had grown to 350. Initially the association was well supported by members of the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]]. In 1849 [[Harry Longueville Jones]] resigned as joint general secretary on his appointment to the Civil Service position in the [[Privy Council]] office as Inspector for [[National school (England and Wales)|National Schools]] in Wales. This appointment was a result of the uproar that had been created by the publication of the 1847 Welsh [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Blue Book]] on Education. Jones remained a very active member of the association and resumed as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1855. He was succeeded as joint general secretary by the Rev [[Basil Jones]], later to become [[Bishop of St David's]].

Many scholars and academics were involved in the work of the association at this time. These included [[G. T. Clark]], the manager of [[Dowlais Ironworks]] for [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], who was to become a leading authority on [[Castle|British Castles]].&lt;ref&gt;James B Ll.(ed) G.T Clark : Scholar Ironmaster in the Victorian Age. University of Wales Press, Cardiff. 1998. {{ISBN|0-7083-1500-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's first article to be published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1853 was on [[Kidwelly Castle]]. It was accompanied by plans and drawings by a Mrs Trehearne engraved by [[John Henry le Keux]].[[File:Kidwelly Castle plan.jpg|thumb|Kidwelly Castle plan used to illustrate G T Clark's article]] Another figure was the youthful [[Edward Augustus Freeman]],&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133eaf-p1.shtml#id4243334, This is an extensive catalogue of writing and drawings by Freeman held by the [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester. It includes 446 drawings of Welsh architecture and extensive correspondence with Sir Stephen Glynne and other members of the Cambrians.&lt;/ref&gt; later celebrated as a medieval historian, and, from 1884, [[Regius Professor of History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at Oxford. Freeman submitted a series of articles on church architecture in Wales and on the domestic architecture of Pembrokeshire. Also in this group was [[John Obadiah Westwood]], a notable Oxford [[entomologist]], whose studies of inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period was to provide a systematic approach to the subject. The Cambrian Archaeological Association was to sponsor the publication of Westwood's ''Lapidarium Walliæ: the early Inscribed and Sculptured Stones of Wales'' in 1876–1879.&lt;ref&gt;"Moore" pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; A final key figure was Rev [[Cardale Babington|Charles Cardale Babington]], who came from [[Ludlow]] in Shropshire. Professor of Botany at Cambridge, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1851. Babington was also interested in archaeology, and joined the General Committee of the association in 1855: he was to chair the committee until 1882.

In the 1850s a schism developed among the membership of the Cambrians. [[John Williams (Ab Ithel)|John Williams]], who had been to [[Jesus College, Oxford]], and whose sympathies lay with the Tractarians (or [[Oxford Movement]]), belonged to an older school of celticism, which wished to promote the authenticity of the writings of [[Iolo Morganwg]]. Williams did not fit in with the members of the association, whose primary interests were in Welsh architecture and archaeology. The association was also in a poor state financially as there had been a failure to collect subscriptions. Williams resigned as general secretary and Editor late in 1853&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 5, 1854, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and he was followed by other joint secretary the Rev Basil Jones who resigned at the Summer Meeting at Ruthin. The published list of members now shows that membership had shrunk to 163. Williams, following his resignation created an alternative society, the Cambrian Institute, publishers of the ''Cambrian Journal'', which Williams edited until his death in 1863, when the Institute faded away.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The re-constituted association: 1856–1880s===
Following the Ruthin meeting active steps were made to re-establish the association, the objectives were redefined and a new constitution was adopted at the Welshpool Meeting of the association in 1856. For much of this period the General Committee of the association was under the capable chairmanship of [[Cardale Babington]] (from 1864–84)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and the general secretary to the committee was the [[Edward Barwell|Rev E L Barnwell]] (from 1854–75).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the association became more involved in Archaeology, sponsoring through an appeal the Rev David Davies' (their local Secretary for Montgomeryshire) excavations on the Roman auxiliary fort at [[Caersws]] which was published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;D. Davies, "Caersws: Roman Remains Discovered and Described", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 3rd ser., pp. 151–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longueville Jones, who was travelling extensively in Wales as part of his duties as inspector of [[National Schools]], now had more time as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. He produced many articles and listings of archaeological sites, which furthered his campaign for the establishment of a Monuments Record and Inspectorate, and anticipated the formation of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|Welsh Royal Commission]] in 1908. E L Barnwell also had a wide range of interests. Between 1855 and 1884 he contributed 102 articles and notes on a wide range of subjects to ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. His main interests were Archaeology, Vernacular Architecture, Medieval History and Genealogy. His last article in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'',  "On Some South Wales [[Dolmen|Cromlechs]]", disputed some of the assertions in Ferguson's recently published "Rude Stone Monuments of all Countries" and provides an overview of [[Chamber tomb|Chambered Tombs]] in Wales.[[File:Arch Camb Vol 2 1872 21 15.jpeg|thumb|Wigmore Grange by Edward Blore 1872]] Other important publications were by [[William Owen Stanley|Hon W O Stanley]] on his excavation of tumuli in Anglesey and one on [[Wigmore Abbey]] and Monastic Grange in Herefordshire by [[Edward Blore]].  Blore was a leading architect, who had been employed by Queen Victoria to re-build [[Buckingham Palace]] and he was an accomplished topographical artist specialising in later Medieval architecture. His drawings of Wigmore Grange were engraved by John le Keux and are some of the finest topographical prints published in ''Archaeologia Cambrensiis''.&lt;ref&gt;E. Blore, "Wigmore Abbey", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 4th ser., vol. 2, pp. 207–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambrians also established a relationship with the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests|"Office of Woods and Forests"]] who were responsible for Castles and other monuments belonging to the Crown in Wales. The Cambrians had already influenced [[Anthony Salvin|Salvin's]] restoration of Caernarvon Castle and made a financial contribution towards it. They now inaugurated a scheme whereby the Office would lease Castles and other monuments to members of the association so that they could be preserved and restored.  The [[Edward Barnwell|Rev E L Barnwell]], took up a lease of Denbigh Castle on behalf of the association. Slightly later the monastery of [[Strata Florida]] was leased by the association so that it could be safeguarded and displayed to the public.

===Late Victorian period to the end of the First World War===
By the early 1880s few of the original members or the association were still active. Cardale Babbington resigned as chairman of the General Committee in 1884, and was replaced by Archdeacon D R Thomas, who remained as chairman until 1916.  New figures included [[John Rhys]], who had become Professor of Celtic at Oxford in 1877. The emphasis changes slightly with more emphasis on Celtic studies and [[Alfred Neobard Palmer]], who contributed articles on the local history of the Wrexham area and the medieval borough of [[Holt, Wales|Holt]]. The great Welsh historian, Sir[[John Edward Lloyd|J E Lloyd]] joined the association in 1896.  The greatest impact was made by [[John Romilly Allen]] whose family came from [[Narberth, Pembrokeshire|Narbeth]] in Pembrokeshire.  Romilly Allen joined the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1875, was elected a member of the general committee in 1877, became one of two editors of its Journal in 1889, and was sole editor from 1892 until his death in 1907.  Romilly Allen was to replace Westwood (who died in 1893) as the acknowledged expert on inscribed and sculptured stones of the post Roman period and his researches in Scotland are even better known than those he undertook in Wales. Romilly Allen campaigned for a Welsh National Museum and wrote scathing criticisms when antiquities were acquired by British Museum; the [[Grosvenor Museum]] in Chester purchased some [[Bronze Age]] Urns from North Wales and particularly when the Late Iron Age [[Trawsfynydd]] Tankard was removed to Liverpool Museum. It was fitting that the [[National Museum of Wales]] was granted its foundation charter in 1907, the year of Romilly Allen's death.

Romilly Allen was also very adverse to what he perceived as other bodies interfering in Welsh matters. In 1886 the Cambrians launched an appeal to sponsor an excavation at [[Strata Florida]]. The [[Cistercian]] Abbey had been taken into 'guardianship' by the association and the intention was to provide a plan of the Abbey and to make it accessible for visitors. The excavation were placed in the hands of [[Stephen W. Williams (architect, civil engineer and archaeologist)|Stephen Williams]] and he started work in June 1887. The excavations did not find favour with [[John William Willis-Bund|J W Willis-Bund]], who was the local secretary of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] for South Wales. Bund denigrated William's work, alleging 'the mischief likely to be done if the excavations were continued without the direction of some competent person'. This was not taken well by the association, but St John Hope, the Assistant Secretary of the Antiquaries gave advice and was able to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David Henry (1992). " An Appreciation of Stephen William Williams, Montgomeryshire Collections, Vol 80, 73–4&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Romilly Allen, as editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', commented that "the Cambrian Archaeological Association has always shown itself willing to receive advice courteously offered, but it can never admit the contention that the Society of Antiquaries has the right to send its officials to Wales to dictate how explorations should be conducted".&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', 1890, pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was now becoming more adventurous as far its summer meetings and increasingly started to visit other 'Celtic' lands outside Wales and the [[Marches]]. The first of these visits was to Truro in 1862, followed by the Isle of Man in 1865. More ambitious was the visit to Brittany in 1889 and in 1891 Professor John Rees organised a trip to [[Kerry, Powys|Kerry]] in Ireland. The most ambitious meeting was in 1899 when the association hired a steamer to voyage round the Western Isles of Scotland to visit remote sites and see sculptured stones. The social life on these yearly trips and meetings from 1908 onwards is well described in Evelyn Lewes' book ''Out with the Cambrians'', which was published in 1934&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Lewes, ''Out with the Cambrians'', Williams and Norgate, London 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death in 1907 of Romilly Allen, the Rev [[Rupert Morris]], originally from [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in Flintshire took over the editorship. Morris had joined the Cambrians in 1875 and in 1892 he had become Chaplain and Librarian to the [[Duke of Westminster]] at [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]] near Chester.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: ''Arch. Camb''&lt;/ref&gt; Morris immersed himself in the history of Chester, his most notable publication being '' Chester during the Plantagenet and Tudor Reigns '', published in 1894, and he also edited the [[Chester Archaeological Journal]]. He then moved to [[St Gabriel's, Warwick Square|St Gabriel's, Pimlico]], a large London parish in the Duke's [[patronage]]. It was from here that he edited ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' until his death in 1917. With the onset of the First World War the association was able initially to keep up its publication programme, but then reduced the issues of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' to two each year. The summer meetings were abandoned, with a general meeting being called each year at Shrewsbury. Much of the organisation of the association was undertaken by the noted geologist and [[Palaeolithic]] archaeologist [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who had been born at [[Buttington]], near Welshpool. Boyd Dawkins, who was [[knighted]] in 1917, stood in as president of the association between 1914 and 1919.

===1918–1950===
By the mid-1920s the influence of the recently established National Museum of Wales starts to make its mark on the association. [[Mortimer Wheeler]] was appointed keeper of archaeology in 1922, and in 1924 he became director of the museum. He immediately started on notable excavations on the Roman sites of [[Segontium]]&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Mortimer Wheeler (1924) ''Segontium and the Roman occupation of Wales'' (Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion)&lt;/ref&gt; on the outskirts of Caernarvon and [[Brecon Gaer]]. These volumes were published in ''[[Y Cymmrodor]]'', an annual journal of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|Society of Cymmrodorion]] rather than in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', presumably because the Cambrians would not devote a single volume to each excavation.  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was still being published quarterly in a quarto format, which could not be adapted for the publication of excavation reports with large plans. As a result,  ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' was changed to the larger quarto format in 1928.  'Mortimer Wheeler encouraged non-professional archaeologists, such as the Bangor Architect Harold Hughes and [[Dr Willoughby Gardner]] in their research on [[Hillforts]] of Northern Wales. This research had started in 1909 and in his presidential address to the Cambrians in 1924, Willougby Gardner gives an extensive review of this research, illustrated with plans. They were later to survey [[Ffridd Faldwyn, Montgomery]] near Montgomery.&lt;ref&gt;Willoughby Gardner "Ffridd Faldwyn Hill Fort, near Montgomery", ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'', vol. 87 (1932), pp. 364–372.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was to form the basis for the excavations that followed at Ffridd Faldwyn by [[B. H. St. John O’Neill|St John O'Neill]], the [[Office of Works]] Inspector in Wales. Also Sir [[Cyril Fox]], who succeeded Wheeler as the Director of the National Museum of Wales, published his survey of [[Offa's Dyke]] in parts in ''Archaeologia Cambrensis''. It was afterwards republished as one volume by the [[British Academy]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Fox, ''Offa's Dyke: a Field Survey of the Western Frontier Works of Mercia in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries AD'' (London, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the War Years, from 1939 to 1945, the Cambrians were unable to hold any meetings, but volumes of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' continued to be produced. In 1946, to commemorate the  centenary of the association, the volume for that year was entitled ''100 Years of Welsh Archaeology 1846–1956'', which was a masterful survey of the state of knowledge about Welsh Archaeology. In the 1940s the noted church architectural  historian Fred Crossley, together with Maurice Ridgeway, started a detailed county by  county survey of roods screens, lofts and carved woodwork in Welsh Churches.

==Presidents==
In the early days of the Cambrian Archaeological Association the position of the president of the society went to a member of the landed gentry or aristocracy in Wales or the [[Welsh Marches]], as well as to Welsh bishops and senior figures in the [[Anglican]] Church. The first president was [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]], the brother-in-law of [[William Gladstone]], a passionate [[ecclesiologist]], who was a guiding figure of the association for many years. The main intention of the residency was, and still to some extent is, to provide an entree for visits and the organisation of the summer general meeting. It is normal for the presidency to be held for one year, but on some occasions it has been held for longer. Nearly all the early presidents were either clerics in the Anglican Church or had at some time been Members of Parliament. It is very clear that the summer meetings were used as a forum (outside the formal events), for the discussion of matters not directly associated with archaeology or Welsh history. Most notably a number of the presidents were members of the Canterbury Society, an association for the colonisation of the South Island of New Zealand. Also many were directly involved in the railway companies which were opening up Wales at the time, most notably [[George Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry|Earl Vane Tempest]], later Lord Londonderry of Machynlleth, president in 1866, who was the chairman of the [[Cambrian Railways]]. This does not imply that the majority of the presidents were uninterested in archaeology. The Earl of Dunraven of Dunraven Castle in Glamorgan, president in 1849 and 1869, while not involved in Welsh archaeology, was a leading Irish intellectual and Celtic scholar, as well as a supporter of [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Many of the other presidents who were MPs were leading [[Antiquaries]], particularly [[Octavius Morgan]] and [[Stanley Leighton]] – the latter was the founding figure of [[SPAB]]. Equally most of the bishops and churchmen, who were presidents, were leading academics. The scholarly Rev Basil Jones, the second secretary of the association, later became the president in 1878, after his elevation to the Bishopric of St David's.

A change starts to appear in 1881, when Professor [[Charles Cardale Babington]] a botanist and archaeologist at [[Cambridge University]], became president. Babington was also chairman of the General Committee of Association for many years. Babington was followed in 1891 by the noted celticist Prof [[John Rhys]] of Oxford, the [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] Rev Prof A H Sayce, also of Oxford. In 1895 and 1896 the renowned legal historian and [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury]] served twice as president.  The archaeologist and geologist Professor Sir [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who was president for six years and successfully steered the association through the years of the First World War.

After the First World War, further changes in the presidency are apparent. Leading archaeologists (Sir) [[Mortimer Wheeler]] (1930) and (Sir) [[Cyril Fox]] (1933); architects: Harold Hughes (1930) and [[W. D. Caröe]] (1936); historians and celticists [[Sir John Edward Lloyd]](1937) and [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Prof R. A. S. Macalister]] (1932 and 1934), were amongst the presidents. Since the Second World War the presidents have been a mixture of leading academics, professional architects and archaeologists, the occasional [[Anglican]] cleric, and local historians, such as [[John Davies Knatchbull Lloyd|J. D. K. Lloyd]] of [[Montgomery, Powys|Montgomery]], the editor of ''Archaeologia Cambrensis'' for many years.  While women such as [[Angharad Llwyd]] had been allowed to join the Cambrians in their own right from an early date, it was not until 1988 that [[Frances Lynch]] became first female president. Since then there have been three further women presidents.

'''Canaan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ən}}; [[Northwest Semitic]]: ''{{transl|sem|knaʿn}}''; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: &lt;span dir="rtl" title="Phoenician alphabet" class="script-phoenician" style="direction: rtl; font-size:125%; font-family: 'ALPHABETUM Unicode', 'MPH 2B Damase', Aegean, Code2001, 'Free Sans';" lang="phn-Phnx"&gt;𐤊𐤍𐤏𐤍&lt;/span&gt; ''Kenā‘an''; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &lt;big&gt;{{hebrew|כְּנָעַן}}&lt;/big&gt; ''{{transl|he|Kena‘an}}'') was a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking region in the [[Ancient Near East]] during the late [[2nd millennium BC]]. The name ''Canaan'' appears throughout the [[Bible]], where it corresponds to the [[Levant]], in particular to the areas of the [[Southern Levant]] that provide the main setting of the narrative of the Bible: i.e., the area of [[Phoenicia]], [[Philistia]], [[Land of Israel|Israel]], and other nations.

The word '''Canaanites''' serves as an ethnic catch-all term covering various indigenous populations—both settled and [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic-pastoral]] groups—throughout the regions of the southern Levant or Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1043&amp;context=humbiol_preprints |first1=Aaron J. |last1=Brody |first2=Roy J. |last2=King |title=Genetics and the Archaeology of Ancient Israel |work=Wayne State University |date=1 December 2013 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is by far the most frequently used ethnic term in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Dever"&gt;{{cite book |first=William G. |last=Dever |author-link=William G.

Throughout the area that we—with the Greek speakers—prefer to call 'Phoenicia', the inhabitants in the first millennium BC called themselves 'Canaanites'. For the area south of Mt. Carmel, however, after the Bronze Age ended references to 'Canaan' as a present phenomenon dwindle almost to nothing (the Hebrew Bible of course makes frequent mention of 'Canaan' and 'Canaanites', but regularly as a land that had become something else, and as a people who had been annihilated)."&lt;/ref&gt; and following the emigration of Canaanite-speakers to [[Carthage]] (founded in the 9th century BC), was also used as a self-designation by the [[Punics]] (''chanani'') of North Africa during [[Late Antiquity]].

Canaan had significant geopolitical importance in the [[Late Bronze Age]] [[Amarna period]] (14th century BC) as the area where the [[sphere of interest|spheres of interest]] of the [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]], [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]], [[Mitanni]] and [[Assyrian Empire]]s converged. Much of modern knowledge about Canaan stems from [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]] in this area at sites such as [[Tel Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo]], and [[Gezer]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Middle East by Robert de Vaugondy.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the Near East by [[Robert de Vaugondy]] (1762), indicating ''Canaan'' as limited to the [[Holy Land]], to the exclusion of Lebanon and Syria]]
The English term ''Canaan'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ən}} since c. 1500, due to the [[Great Vowel Shift]]) comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|כנען}} (''knʿn''), via [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Χαναάν}} ''Khanaan'' and [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|Canaan}}''. It appears as 𒆳𒆠𒈾𒄴𒈾 (''&lt;sup&gt;KUR&lt;/sup&gt;ki-na-ah-na'') in the [[Amarna letters]] (14th century BC), and ''{{lang|sem-Latn|knʿn}}'' is found on coins from [[Phoenicia]] in the last half of the 1st millennium. It first occurs in Greek in the writings of [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]] as ''Khna'' (Χνᾶ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0198149569 |first1=David |last1=Asheri |first2=Alan |last2=Lloyd |first3=Aldo |last3=Corcella |title=A Commentary on Herodotus, Books 1–4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars connect the name ''Canaan'' with ''{{lang|sem-Latn|knʿn}}'', ''Kana'an'', the general [[Northwest Semitic]] name for this region.'''

The etymology is uncertain. An early explanation derives the term from the [[Semitic root]] ''{{lang|sem-Latn|knʿ}}'' "to be low, humble, subjugated".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Gesenius]], ''Hebrew Lexicon'', 1833&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have suggested that this implies an original meaning of "lowlands", in contrast with [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], which would then mean "highlands",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=vYQaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA336 |title=Bible Places: Or, The Topography of the Holy Land |first=Henry Baker |last=Tristram |author-link=Henry Baker Tristram |year=1884 |page=336 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others have suggested it meant "the subjugated" as the name of Egypt's province in the Levant, and evolved into the proper name in a similar fashion to [[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]] (the first Roman colony north of the Alps, which became [[Provence]]).{{sfn|Drews|1998|pp=47–49|ps= :"From the Egyptian texts it appears that the whole of Egypt’s province in the Levant was called ‘Canaan’, and it would perhaps not be incorrect to understand the term as the name of that province...It may be that the term began as a Northwest Semitic common noun, ‘the subdued, the subjugated’, and that it then evolved into the proper name of the Asiaticland that had fallen under Egypt’s dominion (just as the first Roman province in Gaul eventually became Provence)"}}

An alternative suggestion put forward by [[Ephraim Avigdor Speiser]] in 1936 derives the term from [[Hurrian]] ''Kinahhu'', purportedly referring to the colour purple, so that ''Canaan'' and ''Phoenicia'' would be synonyms ("Land of Purple"). Tablets found in the Hurrian city of [[Nuzi]] in the early 20th century appear to use the term ''Kinahnu'' as a synonym for red or [[tyrian purple|purple dye]], laboriously produced by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] from [[murex]] shells as early as 1600&amp;nbsp;BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "purple", apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''. The purple cloth of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in Phoenicia was well known far and wide and was associated by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with nobility and royalty. However, according to [[Robert Drews]], Speiser's proposal has generally been abandoned.{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=48|ps=: "Until E.A. Speiser proposed that the name ‘Canaan’ was derived from the (unattested) word kinahhu, which Speiser supposed must have been an Akkadian term for reddish-blue or purple, Semiticists regularly explained ‘Canaan’ (Hebrew këna‘an; elsewhere in Northwest Semitic kn‘n) as related to the Aramaic verb kn‘: ‘to bend down, be low’. That etymology is perhaps correct after all. Speiser’s alternative explanation has been generally abandoned, as has the proposal that ‘Canaan’ meant ‘the land of merchants’."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lemche|1991|pp=24–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==

=== Origins ===
{{See also|Prehistory of the Levant}}
Canaanite culture apparently developed [[In situ conservation (archaeology)|''in situ'']] from the earlier [[Ghassulian]] [[chalcolithic]] culture, which pioneered the [[Mediterranean]] agricultural system typical of the Canaanite region, which comprised intensive [[subsistence]] [[horticulture]], extensive grain growing, commercial wine and olive cultivation and [[transhumance]] [[pastoralism]].  Ghassulian itself developed from the [[nomadic pastoralism|Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex]], which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral [[Natufian culture|Natufian]] and [[Harifian]] cultures with [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing [[animal domestication]], during the [[8.2 kiloyear event|6200&amp;nbsp;BC climatic crisis]] which led to the [[First agricultural revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]/[[Neolithic Revolution]] in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=ZjoR7vCdQh4C |last=Zarins |first=Juris |year=1992 |chapter=Pastoral nomadism in Arabia: ethnoarchaeology and the archaeological record—a case study |editor1-first=Ofer |editor1-last=Bar-Yosef |editor2-first=Anatoly |editor2-last=Khazanov |title=Pastoralism in the Levant |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Bronze Age state of [[Ugarit]] (at [[Ras Shamra]] in [[Syria]]) is considered quintessentially Canaanite archaeologically,&lt;ref name="JonTubb" /&gt; even though its [[Ugaritic language]] does not belong to the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite language group]] proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Roger D. |editor-last=Woodard |year=2008 |title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780511486890 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511486890}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Naveh |year=1987 |chapter=Proto-Canaanite, Archaic Greek, and the Script of the Aramaic Text on the Tell Fakhariyah Statue |editor1-first=Patrick D. |editor1-last=Miller |editor2-first=Paul D. |editor2-last=Hanson |title=Ancient Israelite Religion: Essays in Honor of Frank Moore Cross |isbn=9780800608316 |page=101 |publisher=Fortress Press |display-editors=etal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lvbAAAAMAAJ |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coulmas| first=Florian |title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems |year=1996 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-21481-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter from [[Mut-bisir]] to [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809&amp;nbsp;– 1776 BC) of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (2025–1750 BC) has been translated: "It is in Rahisum that the brigands (habbatum) and the Canaanites (Kinahnum) are situated". It was found in 1973 in the ruins of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], an [[Assyria]]n outpost at that time in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="JonTubb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |jstor=4197896 |title=Une mention de Cananéens dans une lettre de Mari |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4197896 |first=Georges |last=Dossin |publisher=Institut Francais du Proche-Orient |year=1973 |access-date=9 October 2018 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional unpublished references to Kinahnum in the Mari letters refer to the same episode.{{sfn|Na'aman|2005|pp=110–120}} Whether the term Kinahnum refers to people from a specific region or rather people of "foreign origin" has been disputed,{{sfn|Lemche|pp=27–28|ps=: "However, all but one of the references belong to the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, the one exception being the mention of some Canaanites in a document from Marl from the 18th century BC. In this document we find a reference to LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num. The wording of this passage creates some problems as to the identity of these 'Canaanites', because of the parallelism between LUKh-na-ah-num and LUhabbatum, which is unexpected. The Akkadian word habbatum, the meaning of which is actually 'brigands', is sometimes used to translate the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] expression SA.GAZ, which is normally thought to be a logogram for habiru, 'Hebrews'. Thus there is some reason to question the identity of the 'Canaanites' who appear in this text from Marl We may ask whether these people were called 'Canaanites' because they were ethnically of another stock than the ordinary population of Mari, or whether it was because they came from a specific geographical area, the land of Canaan. However, because of the parallelism in this text between LUhabbatum and LUKi-na-ah-num, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression 'Canaanites' was used here with a sociological meaning. It could be that the word 'Canaanites' was in this case understood as a sociological designation of some sort which shared at least some connotations with the sociological term habiru. Should this be the case, the Canaanites of Marl may well have been refugees or outlaws rather than ordinary foreigners from a certain country (from Canaan). Worth considering is also Manfred Weippert's interpretation of the passage LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num—literally 'Canaanites and brigands'—as 'Canaanite brigands', which may welt mean 'highwaymen of foreign origin', whether or not they were actually Canaanites coming from Phoenicia."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie |chapter=Kanaan |first=Manfred |last=Weippert |volume=5 |page=352 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=cEB1Z_c50qgC |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that Robert Drews states that the "first certain cuneiform reference" to Canaan is found on the Alalakh statue of King Idrimi (below).{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=46|ps=: "An eighteenth-century letter from Mari may refer to Canaan, but the first certain cuneiform reference appears on a statue base of [[Idrimi]], king of [[Alalakh]] c. 1500 BC."}}

References to Canaanites are also found throughout the [[Amarna letters]] of Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] c. 1350&amp;nbsp;BC. In these letters, some of which were sent by governors and princes of Canaan to their Egyptian overlord [[Akhenaten]] (Amenhotep IV) in the 14th century BC, are found, beside ''Amar'' and ''Amurru'' ([[Amorites]]), the two forms ''Kinahhi'' and ''Kinahni'', corresponding to ''Kena'' and ''Kena'an'' respectively, and including Syria in its widest extent, as [[Eduard Meyer]] has shown. The letters are written in the official and diplomatic [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]] of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], though "Canaanitish" words and idioms are also in evidence.

=== Late Bronze Age Hieroglyphic and Hieratic (1500–1000 BC) ===
[[File:KAnana.gif|thumb|right|150px|The name ''Canaan'' occurs in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] as ''{{transl|egy|k3nˁnˁ}}'' on the [[Merneptah Stele]] in the 13th century BC]]
During the 2nd millennium BC, [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts use the term ''Canaan'' to refer to an Egyptian-ruled colony, whose boundaries generally corroborate the definition of Canaan found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], bounded to the west by the Mediterranean Sea, to the north in the vicinity of [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]] in Syria, to the east by the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], and to the south by a line extended from the [[Dead Sea]] to around [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. Nevertheless, the Egyptian and [[Hebrew]] uses of the term are not identical: the Egyptian texts also identify the coastal city of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Qadesh]] in north west Syria near Turkey as part of the "Land of Canaan", so that the Egyptian usage seems to refer to the entire [[Levant]]ine coast of the Mediterranean Sea, making it a synonym of another Egyptian term for this coastland, [[Retjenu]].

Lebanon, in northern Canaan, bordered by the [[Litani River|Litani]] river to the watershed of the [[Orontes River]], was known by the Egyptians as upper [[Retjenu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breasted |first=J.H. |year=1906 |title=Ancient records of Egypt |publisher=University of Illinois Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egyptian campaign accounts, the term [[Djahi]] was used to refer to the watershed of the Jordan river.

Archaeological attestation of the name ''Canaan'' in [[Ancient Near East]]ern sources relates almost exclusively to the period in which the region operated as a colony of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] (16th–11th centuries BC), with usage of the name almost disappearing following the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] (c. 1206–1150 BC).{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=61|ps=: "The name 'Canaan', never very popular, went out of vogue with the collapse of the Egyptian empire."}} The references suggest that during this period the term was familiar to the region's neighbors on all sides, although scholars have disputed to what extent such references provide a coherent description of its location and boundaries, and regarding whether the inhabitants used the term to describe themselves.&lt;ref&gt;For details of the disputes, see the works of Lemche and Na'aman, the main protagonists.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek term ''[[Phoenicia]]'' is first attested in the first two works of [[Western literature]], [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. It does not occur in the [[Hebrew Bible]], but occurs three times in the [[New Testament]] in the [[Book of Acts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/popularandcriti01willgoog/popularandcriti01willgoog_djvu.txt The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopaedia], The three occasions are {{Bibleverse|Acts|11:19}}, {{Bibleverse|Acts|15:3}} and {{Bibleverse|Acts|21:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century BC, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] affirms that Phoenicia was formerly called ''χνα'', a name that [[Philo of Byblos]] subsequently adopted into his mythology as his eponym for the Phoenicians: "Khna who was afterwards called [[Phoenicians|Phoinix]]". Quoting fragments attributed to [[Sanchuniathon]], he relates that [[Byblos]], [[Berytus]] and [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] were among the first cities ever built, under the rule of the mythical [[Cronus]], and credits the inhabitants with developing fishing, hunting, agriculture, shipbuilding and writing.

Coins of the city of [[Beirut]] / Laodicea bear the legend, "Of Laodicea, a metropolis in Canaan"; these coins are dated to the reign of [[Antiochus IV of Syria|Antiochus IV]] (175–164 BC) and his successors until 123 BC.&lt;ref name=GetzelCohen /&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] also mentions that one of the terms the seafaring Phoenicians called their homeland was "Canaan". Augustine also records that the rustic people of [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]] in North Africa retained the [[Punic language|Punic]] self-designation ''Chanani''.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistulae ad Romanos expositio inchoate expositio,'' 13 (Migne, [[Patrologia Latina]], vol.35 p.2096):'Interrogati rustici nostri quid sint, punice respondents chanani.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brent D. |last=Shaw |title=Sacred Violence: African Christians and Sectarian Hatred in the Age of Augustine |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |page=431 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=F8ZRPTgcjrcC |isbn=9780521196055 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 'punic' in Latin also meant 'non-Roman', some scholars however argue that the language referred to as Punic in Augustine may have been [[Berber languages|Libyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Ellingsen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeU4uCL8DfUC&amp;pg=PA9 |title=The Richness of Augustine: His Contextual and Pastoral Theology |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2005 |page=9 |access-date=9 October 2018 |isbn=9780664226183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks also popularized the term ''Palestine'', named after the Greek Philistines or the Aegean [[Pelasgians]], for roughly the region of Canaan, excluding Phoenicia, with [[Herodotus]]' first recorded use of ''Palaistinê'', c. 480 BC. From 110 BC, the [[Hasmoneans]] extended their authority over much of the region, creating a [[Judean]]-[[Samaritan]]-[[Idumaean]]-[[Ituraean]]-[[Galilean]] alliance. The Judean (Jewish, see [[Ioudaioi]]) control over the wider area resulted in it also becoming known as [[Judaea]], a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the [[Judean Mountains]], the allotment of the [[Tribe of Judah]] and heartland of the former [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-judaism/6024720B2B5CB2A950F205C5C04EBBEB |title=The Cambridge History of Judaism |volume=3 |page=210 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521243773 |year=2008 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Horbury |editor2-first=W.

== History ==

=== Overview ===
* Prior to 3500&amp;nbsp;BC (prehistory&amp;nbsp;– [[Stone Age]] and [[Chalcolithic]]): hunter-gatherer societies slowly giving way to farming and herding societies, and early metal-working in the last thousand years;
* 3500–2000&amp;nbsp;BC (Early Bronze): prior to written records in the area;
* 2000–1550&amp;nbsp;BC (Middle Bronze): city-states;
* 1550–1200&amp;nbsp;BC (Late Bronze): Egyptian hegemony;
* 1200–586&amp;nbsp;BC (Iron Age, divided into Iron Age I and II): village societies in Iron I giving way to kingdoms in Iron II.
After the Iron Age the periods are named after the various empires that ruled the region: [[Assyria]]n, Babylonian, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ([[Hellenistic]]) and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noll|2001|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prehistory ===
{{History of the Levant}}
{{Main article|Prehistory of the Southern Levant}}
One of the earliest settlements in the region was at [[Jericho]] in Canaan. The earliest settlements were seasonal, but, by the [[Bronze Age]], had developed into large urban centres.

=== Early Bronze Age (3500–2000) ===
By the [[Early Bronze Age]] other sites had developed, such as [[Ebla]] (where an [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic language]], [[Eblaite language|Eblaite]], was spoken), which by c. 2300&amp;nbsp;BC was incorporated into the [[Mesopotamia]]-based [[Akkadian Empire]] of [[Sargon the Great]] and [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of Akkad (biblical Accad). Sumerian references to the ''Mar.tu'' ("tent dwellers", later ''Amurru'', i.e. [[Amorite]]) country West of the Euphrates date from even earlier than Sargon, at least to the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Enshakushanna]] of [[Uruk]], and one tablet credits the early Sumerian king [[Lugal-anne-mundu]] with holding sway in the region, although this tablet is considered less credible because it was produced centuries later.

The archives of Ebla show reference to a number of biblical sites, including [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Jerusalem]], and as a number of people have claimed, to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] mentioned in Genesis as well. [[Ebla]] and Amorites at [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] (Qadesh-on-the-Orontes), and elsewhere in [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] (Syria) bordered Canaan in the north and northeast. (Ugarit may be included among these Amoritic entities.&lt;ref name="Woodard"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Woodard |editor-first=Roger D. |title=The Ancient Languages of Syria-Palestine and Arabia |chapter=Ugaritic |first=Dennis |last=Pardee |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTrT-bZyuPcC&amp;pg=PA5 |access-date=5 May 2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-46934-0 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The collapse of the Akkadian Empire in 2154&amp;nbsp;BC saw the arrival of peoples using Khirbet Kerak Ware pottery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Suzanne |year=1987 |title=Archaeological Sources for the History of Palestine: The Early Bronze Age: The Rise and Collapse of Urbanism |journal=The Biblical Archaeologist |jstor=3210081 |pages=22-43 |doi=10.2307/3210081 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3210081 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming originally from the [[Zagros Mountains]] (in modern [[Iran]]) east of the [[Tigris]].

The first cities in the southern Levant arose during this period.&lt;ref name="Golden 2009 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "proto-Canaanites" were in regular contact with the other peoples to their south such as [[Egypt]], and to the north [[Asia Minor]] ([[Hurrians]], [[Hattians]], [[Hittites]], [[Luwians]]) and [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]]), a trend that continued through the Iron Age.&lt;ref name="Golden 2009 5" /&gt; The end of the period is marked by the abandonment of the cities and a return to lifestyles based on farming villages and semi-nomadic herding, although specialised craft production continued and trade routes remained open.&lt;ref name="Golden 2009 5" /&gt;

=== Middle Bronze Age (2000–1550) ===
Urbanism returned and the region was divided among small city-states, the most important of which seems to have been Hazor.&lt;ref name="Golden 2009 5–6"&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2009|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many aspects of Canaanite material culture now reflected a Mesopotamian influence, and the entire region became more tightly integrated into a vast international trading network.&lt;ref name="Golden 2009 5–6" /&gt;

As early as [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]]'s reign (c. 2240&amp;nbsp;BC), ''Amurru'' was called one of the "four quarters" surrounding [[Sumer]], along with [[Subartu]]/[[Assyria]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], and [[Elam]].

Amorite dynasties also came to dominate in much of Mesopotamia, including in [[Larsa]], [[Isin]] and founding the state of Babylon in 1894&amp;nbsp;BC. Later on, ''Amurru'' became the Assyrian/Akkadian term for the interior of south as well as for northerly Canaan. At this time the Canaanite area seemed divided between two confederacies, one centred upon [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]], the second on the more northerly city of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] on the Orontes River{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

An Amorite chieftain named [[Sumu-abum]] founded Babylon as an independent [[city-state]] in 1894 BC. One Amorite king of Babylonia, [[Hammurabi]] (1792–1750&amp;nbsp;BC) founded the first [[Babylonian Empire]], which lasted only as long as his lifetime. Upon his death, the Amorites were driven from Assyria, but remained masters of Babylonia until 1595&amp;nbsp;BC, when they were ejected by the Hittites.

The semi-fictional ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]'' describes an Egyptian officer, Sinuhe, conducting military activities in the area of "Upper Retchenu" and "Finqu" during the reign of [[Senusret I]] (c. 1950 BC). The earliest ''bonafide'' Egyptian report of a campaign to "Mentu", "Retchenu" and "Sekmem" ([[Shechem]]) is the [[Sebek-khu Stele]], dated to the reign of [[Senusret III]] (c. 1862 BC).

Around 1650 BC, Canaanites invaded the eastern Delta of Egypt, where, known as the [[Hyksos]], they became the dominant power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|2009|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Egyptian inscriptions, ''Amar'' and ''Amurru'' ([[Amorite]]s) are applied strictly to the more northerly mountain region east of Phoenicia, extending to the [[Orontes River|Orontes]].

Archaeological excavations of a number of sites, later identified as Canaanite, show that prosperity of the region reached its apogee during this Middle [[Bronze Age]] period, under leadership of the city of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], at least nominally tributary to Egypt for much of the period. In the north, the cities of [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]] were [[hegemons]] of important [[Confederation|confederacies]], and it would appear that biblical Hazor was the chief city of another important [[coalition]] in the south.

=== Late Bronze Age (1550–1200) ===

The extent of the Achaean/Mycenaean civilization appears in purple.]]

In the early Late Bronze Age, Canaanite confederacies centered on [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] and [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]], before again being brought into the [[New Egyptian Kingdom|Egyptian Empire]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] Empire. Later still, the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] assimilated the region.

The migrant [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] who appear to have settled in the region included (among others) the [[Amorites]], who had earlier controlled Babylonia. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the ''Amorites'' in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' (Gen. 10:16–18a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Gen. 14:7 ''f''., Josh. 10:5 ''f''., Deut. 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as Num. 21:13, Josh. 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc.tell of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Ashteroth]], east of the Jordan. However, other passages such as Gen. 15:16, 48:22, Josh. 24:15, Judg. 1:34, etc. regard the name ''Amorite'' as synonymous with "Canaanite"; however "Amorite" is never used for the population on the coast.

In the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period.

Under [[Thutmose III]] (1479–1426&amp;nbsp;BC) and [[Amenhotep II]] (1427–1400&amp;nbsp;BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. [[Habiru]] or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king or princeling would pay for their support.

Although Habiru {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as "brigand" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''{{lang|akk|[[Habiru|Habiri]]}}'' (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur III]], their appearance in Canaan appears{{cn|date=June 2018}} to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a [[Maryannu]] aristocracy of horse-drawn [[chariot]]eers, associated with the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] rulers of the [[Hurrians]], known as [[Mitanni]].

The Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group.{{cn|date=June 2018}} One analysis{{which?|date=June 2018}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a [[language isolate]]), though there were a number of Semites and even some [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Luwian]] adventurers amongst their number. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], as a result was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed{{By whom|date= February 2012}} that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abdi-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who, even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]]. [[Akizzi]], governor of Katna ([[Qatna]]?) (near [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru's attempts. In the next reign of the next pharoah ([[Akhenaten]], reigned {{circa}} 1352 to {{circa}} 1335 BC), however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Hadda]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia-Minor-based [[Hittite Empire]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Leo |last=Oppenheim |title=Ancient Mesopotamia: Portrait of a Dead Civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yxOCgAAQBAJ |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226177670 |year=2013 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (reigned {{circa}} 1344–1322 BC)

Egyptian power in Canaan thus suffered a major setback when the Hittites (or Hat.ti) advanced into Syria in the reign of Amenhotep III, and when they became even more threatening in that of his successor, displacing the Amorites and prompting a resumption of Semitic migration. Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.

The Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. [[Etakkama]] wrote thus to the Pharaoh:
:"Behold, [[Biryawaza|Namyawaza]] has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} in the land of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and in [[Upu|Ubi]]. But I will go, and if thy gods and thy sun go before me, I will bring back the cities to the king, my lord, from the Habiri, to show myself subject to him; and I will expel the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}."
Similarly, [[Zimredda (Sidon mayor)|Zimrida]], king of [[Sidon]] (named 'Siduna'), declared, "All my cities which the king has given into my hand, have come into the hand of the Habiri." The king of [[Jerusalem]], [[Abdi-Heba]], reported to the Pharaoh: 
:"If (Egyptian) troops come this year, lands and princes will remain to the king, my lord; but if troops come not, these lands and princes will not remain to the king, my lord."
Abdi-heba's principal trouble arose from persons called [[Iilkili]] and the sons of [[Labaya]], who are said to have entered into a treasonable league with the Habiri. Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,
:"Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}, and my [[Sutean|Suti]] ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands."&lt;ref name="EA189"&gt;El Amarna letter, EA 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central and eastern regions of [[Syria]] and the north western Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] influence waned as a result. Powerful Assyrian kings extracted tribute from Canaanite states and cities from north, east and central Syria as far as the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="roux"&gt;{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Roux |title=Ancient Iraq |isbn=9780141938257 |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=klZX8B_RzzYC |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The King of Assyria [[Arik-den-ili]] (reigned {{circa}} 1307–1296&amp;nbsp;BC), consolidated Assyrian power in the Levant, he defeated and conquered ancient Semitic-speaking peoples of the so-called [[Ahlamu]] group. He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295–1275&amp;nbsp;BC) who continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]], conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. In 1274&amp;nbsp;BC [[Shalmaneser I]] ascended the Assyrian throne.

Ann Killebrew has shown that cities such as [[Jerusalem]] were large and important walled settlements in the 'Pre-Israelite' [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] IIB and the Israelite Iron Age IIC period (c. 1800–1550 and 720–586&amp;nbsp;BC), but that during the intervening [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze]] (LB) and [[Iron Age]] I and IIA/B Ages sites like [[Jerusalem]] were small and relatively insignificant and unfortified towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYS4VEu08h4C |editor1-last=Killebrew |editor1-first=Ann E. |chapter=Biblical Jerusalem: An Archaeological Assessment |editor2-first=Andrew G. |editor2-last=Vaughn |first=Ann E. |last=Killebrew |title=Jerusalem in Bible and Archaeology: The First Temple Period |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after the Amarna period a new problem arose which was to trouble the Egyptian control of southern Canaan (the rest of the region now being under Assyrian control). Pharaoh Horemhab campaigned against ''[[Shasu]]'' (Egyptian = "wanderers") or living in [[nomadic pastoralist]] tribes, who had moved across the [[Jordan]] to threaten Egyptian trade through [[Galilee]] and [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]. [[Seti I]] (c. 1290&amp;nbsp;BC) is said to have conquered these ''[[Shasu]],'' Semitic-speaking nomads living just south and east of the [[Dead Sea]], from the fortress of Taru (Shtir?) to "''Ka-n-'-na''". After the near collapse of the [[Battle of Kadesh]], [[Rameses II]] had to campaign vigorously in Canaan to maintain Egyptian power. Egyptian forces penetrated into [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]], where a permanent fortress garrison (Called simply "Rameses") was established.

Some believe the "Habiru" signified generally all the nomadic tribes known as "Hebrews", and particularly the early [[Israelites]] of the period of the "judges", who sought to appropriate the fertile region for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolfe |first=Robert |title=From Habiru to Hebrews: The Roots of the Jewish Tradition |work=New English Review |url=https://www.newenglishreview.org/Robert_Wolfe/From_Habiru_to_Hebrews%3A_The_Roots_of_the_Jewish_Tradition/ |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was rarely used to describe the ''[[Shasu]]''. Whether the term may also include other related ancient Semitic-speaking peoples such as the [[Moab]]ites, [[Ammon]]ites and [[Edom]]ites is uncertain. It may not be an [[ethnonym]] at all; see the article [[Habiru]] for details.

By the [[Early Iron Age]], the southern Levant came to be dominated by the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]], besides the [[Philistines|Philistine]] city-states on the Mediterranean coast, and the kingdoms of [[Moab]], [[Ammon]] and [[Aram-Damascus]] east of the Jordan River, and [[Edom]] to the south.
The northern Levant was divided into various petty kingdoms, the so-called [[Syro-Hittite states]] and the Phoenician city-states.

The entire region (including all Phoenician/Canaanite and [[Arameans|Aramean]] states, together with [[Israel]], [[Philistia]] and [[Samarra]]) was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] during the 10th and 9th centuries BC, and would remain so for three hundred years until the end of the 7th century BC. Assyrian emperor-kings such as [[Ashurnasirpal II|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Adad-nirari II]], [[Sargon II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] came to dominate Canaanite affairs. The [[Egyptians]], then under a [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]], made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region, but were vanquished by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], leading to an Assyrian invasion and conquest of Egypt and the destruction of the [[Kushite Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] was forced to pay tribute to Assyria. Between 616 and 605 BC the Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter internal civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]] and Persians&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persians"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt; and the [[Scythians]]. The Babylonians inherited the western part of the empire of their Assyrian brethren, including all the lands in Canaan and [[Syria]], together with [[Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. They successfully defeated the Egyptians, who had belatedly attempted to aid their former masters, the Assyrians, and then remained in the region in an attempt to regain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. The Babylonian Empire itself collapsed in 539 BC, and Canaan fell to the Persians and became a part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. It remained so until in 332 BC it was conquered by the [[Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]], later to fall to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the late 2nd century BC, and then [[Byzantium]], until the [[Arab]] Islamic invasion and conquest of the 7th century.&lt;ref name="roux"/&gt;

== Culture ==
Canaan included what today are Lebanon, Israel, northwestern Jordan, and some western areas of Syria.&lt;ref name="JonTubb" /&gt;{{rp|13}} According to archaeologist Jonathan N. Tubb, "[[Ammon]]ites, [[Moabites]], [[Israelites]] and [[Phoenicians]] undoubtedly achieved their own cultural identities, and yet ethnically they were all Canaanites", "the same people who settled in farming villages in the region in the 8th millennium BC."&lt;ref name="JonTubb" /&gt;{{rp|13-14}}

There is uncertainty about whether the name ''Canaan'' refers to a specific [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic-speaking ethnic group]] wherever they live, the homeland of this ethnic group, or a region under the control of this ethnic group, or perhaps any combination of the three.

Canaanite civilization was a response to long periods of stable climate interrupted by short periods of [[climate change]]. During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East—[[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]), the [[Hittites]], and [[Minoan Crete]]—to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in [[Canaanite mythology]] by the struggle between the storm god, variously called [[Teshub]] ([[Hurrian]]) or [[Baal|Ba'al Hadad]] ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Amorite]]/[[Aramean]]) and [[Yam (god)|Ya'a, Yaw]], [[Yahu]] or [[Yam (god)|Yam]], god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local [[horticulture|horticultural products]], along with commercial growing of [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s for wine, and [[pistachio]]s, surrounded by extensive [[grain]] cropping, predominantly [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Harvest in early summer was a season when [[transhumance]] [[nomadism]] was practiced—shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the [[Gezer calendar]] and in the biblical cycle of the year.
[[File:Sarcophagus of Canaanites.jpg|thumb|Canaanite sarcophagi ([[Israel Museum]])]]
Periods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with [[subsistence agricultural]] foodstuffs; and transhumance [[pastoralism]] became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Seters |first=John |year=1987 |title=Abraham in Myth and Tradition |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9781626549104}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the periods of the collapse of [[Akkadian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Hyksos]] invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]], trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree [[Assyria]], withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from [[Kadesh Barnea]], through [[Hebron]], [[Lachish]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethel]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] through [[Galilee]] to [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from [[Eilath]], [[Timna]], [[Edom]] ([[Mount Seir|Seir]]), [[Moab]], [[Ammon]] and thence to the Aramean states of [[Damascus]] and [[Palmyra]]. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and [[Tyrians]] in the case of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]], for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas L. |year=2000 |title=Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written &amp; Archaeological Sources |publisher=Brill Academic |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=RwrrUuHFb6UC |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., [[PPNB]], [[Ghassulian]], [[Uruk]], and the [[Bronze Age]] cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the [[Greco-Roman]] world (as [[Iudaea]] province), and after [[Byzantine]] times, into the Muslim [[Arab]] and proto-Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. [[Western Aramaic]], one of the two [[lingua franca]]s of Canaanite civilization, is still spoken in a number of small Syrian villages, whilst [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] disappeared as a spoken language in about 100&amp;nbsp;AD. A separate [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-infused [[Eastern Aramaic]] is still spoken by the existing [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], northeast Syria and southeast [[Turkey]].

[[Tel Kabri]] contains the remains of a Canaanite city from the Middle [[Bronze Age]] (2000–1550 BC). The city, the most important of the cities in the Western [[Galilee]] during that period, had a palace at its center. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because after the city was abandoned, no other city was built over its remains. It is notable because the predominant extra-Canaanite cultural influence is [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]; Minoan-style frescoes decorate the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remains Of Minoan-Style Painting Discovered During Excavations Of Canaanite Palace |work=ScienceDaily |date=7 December 2009 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091109121119.htm |access-date=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Canaan" is used as a synonym of the [[Promised Land]]; for instance, it is used in this sense in the hymn, ''Canaan's Happy Shore'', with the [[Line (poetry)|line]]s:  "Oh, brothers, will you meet me, (3x)/On Canaan's happy shore," a hymn set to the tune later used in ''[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]''.

=== Hebrew Bible ===
In Biblical usage, the name was confined to the country west of the [[Jordan River]]. Canaanites were described as living  "by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan" ([[Book of Numbers]] 33:51; [[Book of Joshua]] 22:9). Canaan was especially identified with [[Phoenicia]] ([[Book of Isaiah]] 23:11).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Septuagint]] translates "Canaanites" by "Phoenicians", and "Canaan" by the "land of the Phoenicians" ([[Book of Exodus]] 16:35; Book of Joshua 5:12). [http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/C/canaan-canaanites.html "Canaan" article in the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia online]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philistines]], while an integral part of the Canaanite milieu, do not seem to have been ethnic Canaanites, and were listed in the [[Generations of Noah|Table of Nations]] as descendants of [[Mizraim]]; the [[Arameans]], [[Moab]]ites, [[Ammon]]ites, [[Midian]]ites and [[Edom]]ites were also considered fellow descendants of [[Shem]] or [[Abraham]], and distinct from generic Canaanites/[[Amorites#Biblical Amorites|Amorites]]. ''"[[Heth (Bible)|Heth]]"'', representing the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]], is a son of Canaan. The later [[Hittites]] spoke an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] (called [[Hittite language|''Nesili'']]), but their predecessors the [[Hattians]] had spoken a little-known language ([[Hattic language|''Hattili'']]), of uncertain affinities.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2017}}

The [[Horites]], formerly of [[Mount Seir]], were implied to be Canaanite ([[Hivite]]), although unusually there is no direct confirmation of this in the narrative. The [[Hurrians]], based in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], spoke the [[Hurrian language]]. Their language was a [[language isolate]].

In the Bible, the renaming of the [[Land of Canaan]] as the [[Land of Israel]] marks the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Book of Joshua#Entry into the land and conquest .28chapters 2.E2.80.9312.29|conquest]] of the [[Promised Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny |first=Eliezer |last=Schweid |translator-first=Deborah |translator-last=Greniman |year=1985 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn=0-8386-3234-3 |pages=16–17 |quote=... let us begin by examining the kinds of assertions about the land of Israel that we encounter in persuing ''[sic]'' the books of the Bible. ... A third kind of assertion deals with the history of the Land of Israel. Before its settlement by the Israelite tribes, it is called The Land of Canaan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canaan and the Canaanites are mentioned some 160 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]], mostly in the [[Torah#Pentateuch|Pentateuch]] and the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] and [[Book of Judges|Judges]].&lt;ref name="Killebrew 2005 96"&gt;{{harvnb|Killebrew|2005|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Origin myth|ancestor]] called [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] first appears as one of [[Noah]]'s grandsons. He appears during the narrative known as the [[Curse of Ham]], in which Canaan is cursed with perpetual slavery because his father [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] had "looked upon" the drunk and naked Noah. The expression "look upon" at times has sexual overtones in the Bible, as in Leviticus 20:11, "The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness..." As a result, interpreters have proposed a variety of possibilities as to what kind of transgression has been comitted by Cain, including the possibility that maternal incest is implied.&lt;ref name="Stiebert2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johanna Stiebert|title=First-Degree Incest and the Hebrew Bible: Sex in the Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cUDqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|date=20 October 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-26631-6|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[God in Judaism|God]] later promises the land of Canaan to [[Abraham]], and eventually delivers it to [[Abraham's family tree|descendants of Abraham]], the [[Israelites]].&lt;ref name="Killebrew 2005 96" /&gt; The biblical history has become increasingly problematic as the archaeological and textual evidence supports the idea that the early Israelites were in fact themselves Canaanites.&lt;ref name="Killebrew 2005 96" /&gt;

The Hebrew Bible lists borders for the land of Canaan. The [[Book of Numbers]], 34:2, includes the phrase "the land of Canaan as defined by its borders." The borders are then delineated in Numbers 34:3–12. The term "Canaanites" in biblical Hebrew is applied especially to the inhabitants of the lower regions, along the sea coast and on the shores of the Jordan River, as opposed to the inhabitants of the mountainous regions. By the [[Second Temple period]] (530 BC–70 AD),&lt;ref&gt;Figures based purely upon scientific dating and the proclivity among some scholars to bypass Jewish sources. However, Jewish tradition avers that the Second Temple stood for only four-hundred and twenty years, i.e. from 352 BCE – 68 CE. See: Maimondes' Questions &amp; Responsa, ''responsum'' # 389, Jerusalem 1960 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; "Canaanite" in the [[Hebrew language]] had come to be not an ethnic designation, so much as a general synonym for "[[merchant]]", as it is interpreted in, for example, [[Book of Job]] 40:30, or [[Book of Proverbs]] 31:24.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Gesenius]], ''Hebrew Dictionary'' [http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3669&amp;t=KJV]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John N. Oswalt]] notes that "Canaan consists of the land west of the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] and is distinguished from the area east of the Jordan." Oswalt then goes on to say that in Scripture, Canaan "takes on a theological character" as "the land which is God's gift" and "the place of abundance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John N. |last=Oswalt |chapter=&lt;big&gt;כנען&lt;/big&gt; |editor1-first=R.

The Hebrew Bible describes the Israelite conquest of Canaan in the "[[Nevi'im|Former Prophets]]"  (''Nevi'im Rishonim'', &lt;big&gt;{{hebrew|נביאים ראשונים}}&lt;/big&gt; ), viz. the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].

Canaan is the father of [[Sidon#The Biblical Sidon|Sidon]], his firstborn; and of the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]], [[Jebusite]]s, [[Amorite]]s, [[List of minor biblical tribes#Girgashites|Girgashites]], [[Hivite]]s, [[Arqa|Arkites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Sinites|Sinites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Arvadites|Arvadites]], [[List of minor biblical tribes#Zemarites|Zemarites]], and [[List of minor biblical tribes#Hamathites|Hamathites]]. Later the Canaanite clans scattered, and the borders of Canaan reached [across the Mediterranean coast] from [[Sidon]] toward [[Gerar]] as far as [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and then [inland around the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] ] toward [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom, Gomorrah]], [[Admah]] and [[Zeboim (Hebrew Bible)|Zeboiim]], as far as [[Lasha]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Sidon whom the Table identifies as the firstborn son of Canaan has the same name as that of the coastal city of Sidon in [[Lebanon]]. This city dominated the Phoenician coast, and may have enjoyed [[hegemony]] over a number of ethnic groups, who are said to belong to the "Land of Canaan".{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2017}}

Similarly, Canaanite populations are said to have inhabited:
* the Mediterranean coastlands ({{bibleverse|Joshua|5:1|NIV}}), including [[Lebanon]] corresponding to Phoenicia ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|23:11|NIV}}) and the [[Gaza Strip]] corresponding to [[Philistia]] ({{bibleverse|Zephaniah|2:5|NIV}}).
* the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] ({{bibleverse|Joshua|11:3|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Numbers|13:29|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|Genesis|13:12|NIV}}).

The Canaanites ({{Hebrew Name|כנענים|Kna'anim|Kənaʻănîm}}) are said to have been one of seven regional ethnic divisions or "nations" driven out by the [[Israelites]] following [[the Exodus]]. Specifically, the other nations include the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittites]], the Girgashites, the Amorites, the [[Perizzites]], the [[Hivites]], and the [[Jebusites]] ({{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|7:1|NIV}}).

According to the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'', the Israelite conquest of Canaan is attributed to Canaan's steadfast refusal to join his elder brothers in Ham's allotment beyond the [[Nile]], and instead "[[squatting]]" on the eastern shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], within the inheritance delineated for [[Shem]]. Canaan thus incurs a further curse from Noah for disobeying the agreed apportionment of land.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2017}}

One of the [[613 commandments]] (precisely n. 596) prescribes that no inhabitants of the cities of six Canaanite nations, the same as mentioned in 7:1, minus the [[List of minor biblical tribes#G|Girgashites]], were to be left alive.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=February 2017}}

While the Hebrew Bible distinguishes the Canaanites ethnically from the ancient [[Israelites]], modern scholars Jonathan Tubb and [[Mark S. Smith]] have theorized—based on their archaeological and linguistic interpretations—that the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] represented a subset of Canaanite culture.&lt;ref name="JonTubb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MarkSmith" /&gt;

The usage of the names Canaanites and Phoenicians in later books of the Hebrew Bible (such as at the end of the [[Book of Zechariah]], where it is thought{{by whom|date=November 2016}} to refer to a class of merchants or to non-monotheistic worshippers in Israel or neighbouring [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]), as well as in its single independent usage in the [[New Testament]] (where it [[Exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter|alternates with the term "Syrophoenician" in two parallel passages]]).

=== New Testament ===
''Canaan'' ({{Lang-el|Χαναάν}}, ''Chanaán'') is used only three times in the New Testament: twice in [[Acts of the Apostles]] when paraphrasing [[Old Testament]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{BibleVerse|Acts|7:11}} and {{BibleVerse|Acts|13:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once in the [[exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman's daughter]]. The latter story is told by both the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]]; Matthew uses the term ''Chananaia'' ({{Lang-el|Χαναναία}}), where Mark calls the woman ''Syrophoenician'' ({{Lang-el|Συροφοινίκισσα}}).

== Black Africans as descendants of Canaan ==
{{further information|Curse of Ham|Book of Abraham}}
During the [[Atlantic slave trade]], many Christians began teaching that black Africans were descendants of Canaan and used the [[Curse of Ham]] to justify enslaving black Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Braude, "The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, "William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103–142. See also [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1853423 William McKee Evans], "From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swift Superstition"&gt;John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, "Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham", ''American Literary Realism'', vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was especially strong in the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], who canonized the [[Book of Abraham]], which teaches that Canaan was a descendant of Cain, that his descendants settled Africa, and that they were cursed. [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Brigham Young]] both used the Curse of Ham to justify [[Mormonism and slavery|slavery in Mormonism]].&lt;ref name=SmithHam&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate/Volume 2/Number 7/Letter to Oliver Cowdery from Joseph Smith, Jr. (Apr. 1836) | last  = Smith | first = Joseph | year  = 1836 | pages = 290 | quote = As the fact is uncontrovertable, that the first mention we have of slavery is found in the holy bible...'And he said cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren'...the people who interfere the least with the decrees and purposes of God in this matter, will come under the least condemnation before him; and those who are determined to pursue a course which shows an opposition and a feverish restlessness against the designs of the Lord, will learn, when perhaps it is too late for their own good, that God can do his own work without the aid of those who are not dictate by his counsel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Discourses 10c"&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Journal of Discourses/Volume 10/Necessity for Watchfulness, etc. | last  = Young | first = Brigham | year  = 1863 | pages = 248–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also their rationale in denying Africans access to their priesthood until June 1978, at which point their prophet at the time, [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]], announced that as far as priesthood was concerned, the curse was lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng|title=Race and the Priesthood|publisher=[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars do not believe that black Africans are related to the Canaanites based upon race as depicted throughout local and Egyptian arts and Genetics and Physical Anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Van-Seters, John.

==Characteristics==
An anniversary can advertise a firm's staying power and longevity. A report in the ''[[New York Times]]'' explained the marketing logic:

{{Quote|Anniversary campaigns are part of a trend inspired by the economy that could be called comfort marketing, as advertisers invoke misty, water-colored memories of the past to woo consumers into buying products in the present. A major aspect of comfort marketing is what brand managers call authenticity: reminding shoppers who seek value in the provenance of merchandise to suggest a product is worth buying because its quality has been tested for decades.|Stuart Elliott, 2012&lt;ref name=tws2H21/&gt;}}

Marketers choose variables relating to anniversaries&lt;ref&gt;Variables include number of past years to celebrate, place for the celebration, budget, and so forth.&lt;/ref&gt; to meet specific promotional objectives. While the length of time celebrated by an anniversary is often divisible by five, such as the 10th, 15th, 25th,&lt;ref name=tws2H25&gt;{{cite news

==Planning==
Planning an anniversary can take years. In some cases, special marketing consultants and [[event planning|event planners]] have been hired to coordinate the effort. Large corporations typically work closely with their corporate [[advertising agency]] as well as their [[marketing]] and sales departments to plan sometimes elaborate campaigns, often with a special theme to mark the occasion. For example, [[Starbucks]] marked their 40th anniversary with a redesigned [[logo]] and media campaign.&lt;ref name=tws2H11&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]'' celebrated its 50th anniversary with events throughout the year:

{{Quote|So we are 50 years old, and we intend to celebrate. We are planning a series of events for the months ahead—some small and rather personal and sentimental—others on a bigger scale. In all, we hope to reach a lot of people to whom we owe thanks: not only our working colleagues within the company but also the legions of readers and believers who through the years have helped us grow.|Hedley Donovan, Andrew Heiskell for ''Time magazine'', 1972&lt;ref name=tws2H13/&gt;}}

[[Goya Foods]], on its 75th anniversary, donated a million pounds of food to help fight hunger and announced scholarship programs as well as held parties in different locations.&lt;ref name=tws2H14&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Stacy Jones of The Star-Ledger

 |accessdate= 2013-02-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is flexibility in terms of choosing which dates to use when determining an anniversary. The start date is often the month or year when a firm was founded, but this can vary considerably, and exceptions are the rule; for example, [[The Lego Group|Lego]] toys celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; exactly 50 years after the time when the founder's son, [[Godtfred Kirk Christiansen]], filed a patent for the iconic plastic bricks in 1958.&lt;ref name=tws2H16&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2013-02-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulty in measuring success==
Measuring the success of any advertising effort, including an anniversary celebration, can be difficult. Sometimes an anniversary generates negative publicity, such as the tenth anniversary of the merger between [[AOL]] and [[Time Warner]], which was largely seen as a colossal business blunder.&lt;ref name=tws2H22&gt;{{cite news
 |title= 10th Anniversary of the AOL-Time Warner Merger -- regarded by many as a colossal mistake.

 |accessdate= 2013-02-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that corporate anniversaries do not always lead to "happy returns":

{{Quote|Sometimes, when a brand pins all its advertising and marketing on an anniversary, it can give the impression that it doesn't have anything robust to say about its business; that the only way it is different from its competitors is that it has been going longer. ... The problem is, apart from the odd column inch in the press giving the company free PR, it is not immediately obvious what is gained through anniversary celebrations. Telling your customers you are of a certain age creates nostalgia and makes people think about your brand; on the other hand they would probably prefer you to spend money giving them a discount.|Lucy Barrett, 2009&lt;ref name=tws2H24/&gt;}}

'''David Mallet''' (or '''Malloch''') ([[circa|c.]]1705–1765) was a Scottish dramatist.

He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and went to London in 1723 to work as a private tutor. There he became friendly with [[Alexander Pope]], [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]], and other literary figures including [[Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke]].

His best-known work was written in the same year: ''[[William and Margaret]]'', adapted from a traditional ballad.  In 1740, he collaborated with Thomson on a [[masque]], ''Alfred'', which was the vehicle for "[[Rule, Britannia!]]". His other plays and poetry (e.g. ''Amyntor and Theodora''), popular at the time, are largely forgotten, but Bolingbroke's writings were edited and published by Mallet in 1754.

==Life==
Mallet was probably the second son of James Malloch of Dunruchan, a well-to-do tenant farmer on Lord Drummond's [[Perthshire]] estate, a [[Roman Catholic]], and a member of the outlawed [[Clan MacGregor]]. The household suffered during the [[Jacobite Rebellion of 1715]]. Mallet gave his age as 28 in 1733, and was therefore born about 1705. He seems to have been educated at the parish school of [[Crieff]] under [[John Ker (Latin poet)|John Ker]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Mallet, David|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1717 Mallet was acting as janitor in [[Edinburgh High School]]. In 1720 he became resident tutor to the sons of Mr. Home of [[Dreghorn]]; he held the post till 1723, studied at the same time at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1721–2, 1722–3), and formed a friendship with a fellow student, [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] the poet, a future collaborator. In July 1723 he accepted the post of tutor to the sons of the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Duke of Montrose]]. Leaving the university without a degree, he went in August to London, and then to the duke's seat at [[Shawford]], near [[Winchester]]. He lived with the family until 1731, mainly in London and Shawford. In 1726 he received the honorary degree of M.A. from the [[University of Aberdeen]], ostensibly for an English poem in imitation of Ker's ''Donaides''. Early in 1727 he made a continental tour with his pupils. Towards the end of 1731 he left the Montrose family, and went to [[Gosfield]] in [[Essex]], to act as tutor to the stepson of John Knight, to whose wife, formerly Mrs. Newsham, he had been recommended by [[Alexander Pope]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

On 2 November 1733 Mallet, with his pupil, matriculated at [[St. Mary Hall, Oxford]], where he resided fairly regularly till 27 September 1734. On 5 March 1735 he received, at his request, the degree of M.A. from the University of Edinburgh, and on the 15th of that month he graduated B.A., and on 6 April M.A. of the University of Oxford. He was again abroad in 1735.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Mallet came into favour with the opposition, and was appointed, 27 May 1742, under-secretary to the Prince of Wales.  In 1745 he made a tour in Holland.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Mallet was rewarded in 1763 by [[Lord Bute]], to whom he had given fulsome praise, with the post of inspector of exchequer-book in the outports of London, a [[sinecure]] which he held till his death. In the autumn of the following year he joined his wife Lucy in Paris, but ill health compelled him to return to London. He died on Sunday, 21 April 1765 and was buried on 27 April in St. George's cemetery, [[South Audley Street]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Mallet published a ''Pastoral'' in the ''Edinburgh Miscellany'' in 1720; and during his college days produced a number of short pieces, including an imitation of [[John Milton]] entitled ''The Transfiguration'', first published in the ''[[Walter Ruddiman|Edinburgh Magazine]]'' in 1793. Shortly before his engagement with the Montrose family he composed the ballad of ''William and Margaret'' which was published first anonymously in black letter, and then in 1724, in [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]]'s ''Tea-Table Miscellany'', and [[Aaron Hill (writer)|Aaron Hill]]'s ''Plain Dealer'' No. 36. Further poems followed, mostly written for John Ker; and in February 1725 he wrote verses on ''Mira'', the ''Clio'' of his friend Thomson. For Thomson's poem on ''Winter'', published in March 1726, he wrote a dedication to [[Sir Spencer Compton]], and some verses for the second edition He had himself written, early in 1725, a poem on the same subject, which was praised by Thomson; and on his return from the continent he prepared for the press ''The Excursion'', in two books, which he had written in 1726.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

[[File:MALLET(1731) Eurydice - a tragedy in five acts and in verse.jpg|thumbnail|150px]]
On 22 February 1731 Mallet produced his tragedy of ''Eurydice'' at Drury Lane, with a prologue and epilogue by Aaron Hill. It was acted about thirteen times, and was revived in 1759. Mallet showed his appreciation for Pope with his poem on ''Verbal Criticism'' (1733), in which he ridiculed [[Lewis Theobald]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Mallet made more of a reputation with the tragedy of ''Mustapha'', produced at Drury Lane on 13 Feb. 1738–9. The prologue was by Thomson, and the play was dedicated to [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]: like Thomson's ''Edward and Eleonora'', but less openly, it was directed against the king and [[Sir Robert Walpole]]. With [[James Quin]] as Solyman, it ran for fourteen nights. In 1740 Mallet published a short ''Life of Bacon''; shortly afterwards Mallet and Thomson were commanded by the Prince to write the masque of ''Alfred'', to celebrate both the birthday of the [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Princess Augusta]] and the anniversary of George I's accession. It was played in the gardens of [[Cliefden]], before the Prince and Princess of Wales, on Friday, 1 August 1740, with Quin, [[Christiana Horton]], and [[Kitty Clive]] in the leading parts.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

[[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough]] left in 1744 the sum of £1,000 to Mallet and [[Richard Glover (poet)|Richard Glover]], to write a life of her husband; and Mallet, on Glover's refusal, undertook the work. He only did some research. He published, in May 1747, ‘Amyntor and Theodora, or the Hermit.’&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Mallet and Thomson had, through [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton]], support from the Prince of Wales, but then lost it as Lyttelton fell from favour. Mallet then found the patronage of [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], and prepared a new edition of the ''Patriot King'', published in 1749; in it he attacked the memory of Pope for having clandestinely edited and printed the work in 1738. There was a short pamphlet war with Pope's friends. He then edited Bolingbroke's works, 5 vols. in March 1754. [[Samuel Johnson]] remarked on this enterprise that Bolingbroke had "spent his life in charging a gun against Christianity", and "left half-a-crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death".&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1751, three years after the death of Thomson, Mallet published a new version of the masque of 1740. The adaptation was major, with new scenes and songs added. It was acted at Drury Lane on 23 February 1751, with [[David Garrick]] in the title rôle. The masque of ''Britannia'', an appeal to patriotic sentiment on the eve of an outbreak of war with France, followed in 1755. It was produced at Drury Lane on 9 May, when Garrick spoke the prologue as a drunken sailor.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

On 19 January 1763 Mallet's ''Elvira'' was acted at the same venue during the "half-price riots". Garrick took the part of Don Pedro, the last original character in which he was seen; but it provoked a pamphlet of ''Critical Strictures'' by [[James Boswell]] and two fellow Scots. In the intervening years Mallet had written lesser works, including the ballad of ''Edwin and Emma'' (1760), and a partisan indictment by a "Plain Man" against [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]] in 1757.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; An extract from his ''The tragedy of Bowes'' appears in ''[[The Bishoprick Garland 1834 by Sharpe|The Bishoprick Garland 1834]]'' by [[Cuthbert Sharp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bishoprick Garland page 40|url=http://gredos.usal.es/jspui/bitstream/10366/82881/2/SC_CuthbertSharp_ed_Bishoprick_1834.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book==
The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

'''Franz Xaver Gabelsberger''' (9 February 1789 – 4 January 1849, both in [[Munich]]) was a German inventor of a [[shorthand]] writing system, named [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] after him.
[[File:Gabelsberger Shorthand Silver Award Medal.jpg|thumb|left|Gabelsberger Shorthand Silver Award Medal of the [[Hanover]] Stenographen-Verein of 1863, obverse.]]
Gabelsberger, employed as typist by the [[Bavaria]]n government, started to develop a new shorthand system at age of 28. His system was first fully described in the textbook ''Anleitung zur deutschen Redezeichenkunst oder Stenographie'' (1834) and became rapidly used. He is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]] in Munich.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14411">[[Image:Gibson Girl by Charles Dana Gibson.jpg|right|thumb|An iconic Gibson Girl portrait by its creator, [[Charles Dana Gibson]]]]
The '''Gibson Girl''' was the personification of [[Physical attractiveness#Female physical attractiveness|the feminine ideal of physical attractiveness]] as portrayed by the pen-and-ink illustrations of artist [[Charles Dana Gibson]] during a 20-year period that spanned the late 19th and early 20th century in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/gibson-girls-america/ "The Gibson Girl’s America: Drawings by Charles Dana Gibson"] at the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; The artist saw his creation as representing the composite of "thousands of American girls."

==Image==
[[Image:Gibson Girls seaside -cropped- by Charles Dana Gibson.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Gibson Girls at the beach]] The Gibson Girl image that appeared in the 1890s combined elements of older American images of contemporary female beauty, such as the "fragile lady" and the "voluptuous woman". From the "fragile lady" she took the basic slender lines, and a sense of respectability. From the "voluptuous woman" she took a large bust and hips, but was not vulgar or lewd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allan|title=U.S trends in feminine beauty and over-adaptation. |journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=August 1986|volume=22|issue=3|page=287 |doi=10.1080/00224498609551309}}&lt;/ref&gt; as previous images of women with large busts and hips had been depicted. From this combination emerged the Gibson Girl, who was tall and slender, yet with ample bosom, hips and buttocks. She had an exaggerated S-curve torso shape achieved by wearing a [[History of corsets#The Edwardian corset|swan-bill]] [[corset]]. Images of her epitomized the late 19th- and early 20th-century Western preoccupation with youthful features and ephemeral beauty. Her neck was thin and her hair piled high upon her head in the contemporary [[bouffant]], [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], and [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] ("waterfall of curls") fashions. The statuesque, narrow-waisted ideal feminine figure was portrayed as being at ease and stylish.

She was a member of upper middle class society, always perfectly dressed in the latest fashionable attire appropriate for the place and time of day. The Gibson Girl was also one of the new, more athletic-shaped women, who could be found cycling through Central Park, often exercised and was emancipated to the extent that she could enter the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allan|title=U.S trends in feminine beauty and over-adaptation.|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=August 1986|volume=22|issue=3|page=288|doi=10.1080/00224498609551309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Gibson Girl's refined beauty, in spirit, she was calm, independent, confident, and sought personal fulfillment. She could be depicted attending college and vying for a good mate, but she would never have participated in the [[Suffragette|suffrage]] movement.

Taking part in the [[Suffragette|suffrage]] movement was something more associated with the [[New Woman]], another cultural image of women that emerged around the same time as the Gibson Girl. As a more popular version of the New Woman, the Gibson Girl both undermined and sanctioned women's desires for progressive sociopolitical change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Martha. H.|title=Beyond the Gibson Girl: Re-imagining the America New Woman 1895-1915|year=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Woman was the more disconcerting of the two images at the time as she was seen as an example of change and disruption within the old patterns of social order, asking for the right to equal educational and work opportunities as well as progressive reform, sexual freedom and [[suffrage]]. Whilst the Gibson Girl took on many characteristics of the New Woman, she did so without involving herself in politics and thus did not appear to contemporaries at the time to be usurping traditionally masculine roles as the New Woman was deemed to. She therefore managed to stay within the boundaries of feminine roles without too much transgression.

Gibson depicted her as an equal and sometimes teasing companion to men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/swann/beauties/beauties-overview.html American Beauties]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also sexually dominant, for example, literally examining comical little men under a magnifying glass, or, in a breezy manner, crushing them under her feet. Next to the beauty of a Gibson Girl, men often appeared as simpletons or bumblers; and even men with handsome physiques or great wealth alone could not provide satisfaction to her. Gibson illustrated men so captivated by her looks that they would follow her anywhere, attempting to fulfill any desire, even if it was absurd. One memorable drawing shows dumbstruck men following a Gibson Girl's command to plant a young, leafless tree upside-down, roots in the air, simply because she wanted it that way. Most often, a Gibson Girl appeared single and uncommitted. However, a romance always relieved her boredom. Once married, she was shown deeply frustrated if romantic love had disappeared from her life, but satisfied if socializing with girlfriends or happy when doting on her infant child. In drawings such as these there was no hint at pushing the boundaries of women's roles, instead they often cemented the long-standing beliefs held by many from the old social orders, rarely depicting the Gibson Girl as taking part in any activity that could be seen as out of the ordinary for a woman.

[[Image:Love in a Garden, Gibson.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"Love in a Garden"]]
The artist believed that the Gibson Girl represented the beauty of American women:

{{quote|text=I'll tell you how I got what you have called the 'Gibson Girl.' I saw her on the streets, I saw her at the theatres, I saw her in the churches. I saw her everywhere and doing everything. I saw her idling on [[Fifth Avenue]] and at work behind the counters of the stores ... I haven't really created a distinctive type, the nation made the type. What [[Israel Zangwill|Zangwill]] calls the '[[Melting Pot]] of Races' has resulted in a certain [[Culture of the United States|character]]; why should it not also have turned out a certain type of face? ... There isn't any 'Gibson Girl,' but there are many thousands of American girls, and for that let us all thank God.{{r|marshall19101120}}}}

Gibson believed that America's Gibson Girls would become more beautiful:

{{quote|text=They are beyond question the loveliest of all their sex ... In the United States, of course, where natural selection has been going on, as elsewhere, and where, much more than elsewhere, that has been a great variety to choose from. The eventual American woman will be even more beautiful than the woman of to-day. Her claims to that distinction will result from a fine combination of the best points of all those many races [[Demographics of the United States|which have helped to make our population]].&lt;ref name="marshall19101120"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Edward|title=The Gibson Girl Analyzed By Her Originator|url=http://sundaymagazine.org/2010/11/the-gibson-girl-analyzed-by-her-originator/|accessdate=2010-11-21|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1910-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Many women posed for Gibson Girl-style illustrations, including Gibson's wife, Irene Langhorne who may have been the original model, and was a sister of [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Viscountess Nancy (Langhorne) Astor]]. Other models included [[Evelyn Nesbit]], and Minnie Clark.&lt;ref&gt;| url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/fine_lines |accessdate=2017-10-5 | pages=112 |quote=Best known as the face of the original "Gibson Girl," Clark appeared in Charles Dana Gibson's famous and widely emulated illustrations of fashionable, young, middle-class women, images that set the standard for feminine beauty in that period (see number 53). pages/=115 |quote=It is believed that Minnie Clark (life dates unknown) ... served as the original model for the Gibson Girl.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous Gibson Girl was probably the Belgian-American stage actress, [[Camille Clifford]], whose high coiffure and long, elegant gowns that wrapped around her hourglass figure and tightly corseted [[wasp waist]] defined the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 10, 1906 |title=Why Do They Call Me A Gibson Girl? Miss Camille Clifford Singing The Song Which Reached Miss Edna May's Heart |journal=The Bystander |volume=XII |issue=149 |pages=83 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvERAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT32 |accessdate=2009-07-27 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Among the many "Gibson Girl" illustrators were [[Howard Chandler Christy]] whose work celebrating American "beauties" was similar to Gibson's, and [[Harry G. Peter]], who was most famous for his art on [[Wonder Woman]] comics.

In the newly developing art of cinema, although most leading actresses were at the cutting style of the day, the ones who came to embody it best were the [[Biograph girl]]s, [[Florence Lawrence]] and to a more [[ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] side of it, [[Mary Pickford]]. They personified and catapulted the cult of ''the ideal woman'' for the masses beyond American borders. Camille Clifford, a woman known as the "ideal Gibson Girl", posed for various photographers and produced photographs that exemplified the physical characteristics of the Gibson Girl.

Some people{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that the Gibson Girl was the first national beauty standard for American women. Gibson's fictional images of her published in newspapers and magazines during the [[Belle Époque]] were extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Mitchell, John Ames |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=November 15, 1894 |title=Bookishness: The Gibson Girl |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=XXIV |issue=620 |pages=312–313 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bB0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA312 |accessdate=2009-07-27 |quote=Mr. Gibson has a great responsibility on his shoulders, and if he once fully realizes it, it will keep him awake nights.

Large size books ("table albums," they were called), china plates and saucers, ashtrays, tablecloths, pillow covers, chair covers, souvenir spoons, screens, fans, umbrella stands ... all bore the image of Gibson's creations. There was even a wallpaper for bachelor apartments, with the lovely Gibson faces in endless array. A popular turn-of-the-century hobby, pyrography, saw people burning the Gibson Girl into leather and wood; and the image was traced and stitched into handkerchiefs. There were plays, songs, and even a movie based on his creation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Source appears to be a user-maintained blog with no reference authority|date=January 2015}}

By the outbreak of [[World War I]], changing fashions caused the Gibson Girl to fall out of favor as women favored practical clothing compatible with changing times over the elegant dresses, bustle gowns, [[shirtwaist]]s, and terraced, floor-length skirts favored by the Gibson Girl.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The image was not forgotten, however, with the [[USAAF]] [[World War II]]-era SCR-578 (and the similar post-war AN/CRT-3) [[survival radio#The Gibson Girl|survival radio]] transmitters carried by aircraft on over-water operations being given the nickname "Gibson Girl" because of their "hourglass" shape, which allowed them to be held stationary between the legs while the generator handle was turned.&lt;ref&gt;	Dirk Septer,''Lost Nuke: The Last Flight of Bomber 075, Revised Edition'', Heritage House Publishing Co, 2016 {{ISBN|1772031283}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppina Masotti Biggiogero''' (8 August 1894 – 24 October 1977) was an Italian mathematician and historian. Known for her work in [[algebraic geometry]], she also wrote noted histories of mathematicians, like [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]] and [[Luca Pacioli]]. She was a member of the {{ill|Lombard Institute Academy of Science and Letters|it|Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere}} and won both the Bordoni Prize and Torelli Prize for her work.

==Early life==
Giuseppina Biggiogero was born on 8 August 1894 in [[Melegnano]], Italy to Marta (née Massironi) and Biagio Biggiogero.{{sfn|Giordani|Taylor|1958|p=607}}{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} She completed her primary and secondary studies in [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], earning a degree as a teacher in 1912. While continuing her studies at the Carlo Cattaneo Technical Institute, she began teaching elementary school, first in [[Carpiano]] and later in Melegnano.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}}
{{sfn|Strickland|2011|p=37}} At the time that she was studying, the only paths available to enter university were to obtain a high school diploma, which was not typically available to women, or to obtain a degree from a [[liceo scientifico|technical institute]].{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}}{{sfn|Clark|2008|p=168}} In 1916, Biggiogero earned her certificate with a specialty in physics and mathematics.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}} 

Receiving a scholarship to attend the ''[[Polytechnic University of Milan|Politecnico di Milano]]'' in 1917, she quit her teaching post.{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} She initially began her studies in engineering, but in 1918 moved to the mathematics courses.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}} Because the ''Politecnico'' did not offer a specific curriculum for math, she transferred in 1919 to the [[University of Pavia]], where she studied under the instruction of {{ill|Luigi Brusotti|it}}.{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}}{{sfn|Strickland|2011|pp=37–38}} She graduated in 1921, obtaining her diploma for teaching in pure mathematics. Working as an assistant to the professors [[Luigi Berzolari]] and [[Francesco Gerbaldi]],{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}}{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} Biggiogero published two works on [[real algebraic curve]]s, which were recognized with the Bordoni and Torelli prizes.{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}}{{sfn|Strickland|2011|p=38}} Her 1922 book, was titled ''Sulle curve piane, algebriche, reali che presentano massimi d'inclusione''{{sfn|Biggiogero|1922}} and she published ''Gruppi di massimi d'inclusione per curve piane, algebriche, reali, d'ordine n'' in 1923.{{sfn|Biggiogero|1923}}

==Career==
In 1924, eager to work with [[Oscar Chisini]], Biggiogero returned to Milan and was appointed as his assistant and the professor for the descriptive and projective geometry courses at the ''Politecnico di Milano''.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}}{{sfn|Strickland|2011|p=38}} From 1927, she also gave lectures at the Mathematical and Physical Seminary of Milan, which was founded in that year, and taught higher and projective geometry courses at the [[University of Milan]].{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}}{{sfn|Strickland|2011|p=38}} She was assigned as the editor of the mathematical entries in the ''Enciclopedia Italiana'' (Italian Encyclopedia, 1933) and reviewed the first sixteen volumes of the work, focusing on the compilations of [[Federigo Enriques]].{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} In 1939, Biggiogero married [[Arnaldo Masotti]], a fellow academic, who at the time was the professor of Rational Mechanics in the Faculty of Architecture. She was made chair of Geometry at the ''Politecnico'' in 1948 and retained that post until her retirement in 1969.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}} In addition to lecturing on [[descriptive geometry]] in the mathematics department, she taught [[projective geometry]] to the students in the architectural and engineering departments.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}}

Biggiogero's research produced a large body of work on [[algebraic geometry]], including research on the shapes and bundles of algebraic curves, [[tensor|tensorial calculations]], Hessian singularities of curves and the construction of the triple and quadruple planes.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|pp=631–632}} She and Chisini co-published several works together, including two textbooks ''Lezioni di geometria descrittiva'' (Lessons of Descriptive Geometry) published in 1941 and ''Esercizi di geometria descrittiva'' (Exercises of Descriptive Geometry), produced in 1946.{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} As a secondary path, she researched algebraic differentials, studying [[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversals]], including [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's]] and [[Reiss relation|Reiss' theorems]], as well as the [[invariant theory]] of [[Enrico Bompiani]]. She was also one of the first scholars in Italy to study [[integral geometry]]. She published works which summarized the results of [[Morgan Crofton]], [[Henri Lebesgue]], and [[Luis Santaló]], presenting new formulas for determining ovals and [[ellipse]]s.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=632}}

Also concerned with the history of mathematics, Biggiogero published studies on the geometry of the triangle and the tetrahedron, in conjunction with [[Virginio Retali]] for the ''Encyclopedia of Elementary Mathematics''. She wrote a biography of [[Luca Pacioli]] and with her husband produced a study on [[Maria Gaetana Agnesi]] and her works.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=632}} In 1949, she was made a member of the {{ill|Lombard Institute Academy of Science and Letters|it|Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere}} and was also a member of {{ill|Mathesis (organization)|lt=Mathesis|it|Mathesis}}, the Italian Society of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. In 1974,{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}} [[Clifford Truesdell]], editor-in-chief of the ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', dedicated volume 14 to Biggiogero and her husband in recognition of their scholarship.{{sfn|Pisano|Capecchi|2015|p=18}}

==Death and legacy==
Biggiogero died after a lengthy illness in Milan on 24 October 1977.{{sfn|Marchionna|1979|p=631}} Posthumously, a street in her home town of Melegnano was named in her honor.{{sfn|Linguerri|2004}}

'''Hacksilver''' (sometimes referred to as '''hacksilber''') consists of fragments of cut and bent [[silver]] items that were used as [[bullion]] or as [[currency]] by weight in antiquity.

==Use==
Hacksilver was common among the [[Norsemen]] or [[Vikings]], as a result of both their raiding and trade. Hacksilver may also have been used by [[Romans]] in their dealings with [[Picts|Pictish tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Significant' Roman silver hoard found in Fife by teenager | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-40778533 | date=1 August 2017 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=1 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the [[ruble]], the basic unit of modern Russian currency, is derived from the Russian verb рубить ('rubit'), meaning "to chop", from the practice of the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], described by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] visiting the [[Volga Vikings]] in 922.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  An example of the related Viking weighing scale with weights was found on the [[Gigha|Isle of Gigha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk/archive/vikings/weights.html|title=Viking weights|publisher=University of Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hacksilver may be derived from silver tableware, Roman or Byzantine, church plate and silver objects such as [[reliquaries]] or book-covers, and jewellery from a range of areas.  [[Hoard]]s may typically include a mixture of hacksilver, coins, [[ingot]]s and complete small pieces of jewellery.

Hoards of hacksilver are also well known in pre and post-coinage antiquity, in European and Near Eastern contexts. The [[Cisjordan Corpus]] (c.1200-586 BC) is the largest identified concentration of pre-coinage hacksilver hoards, and provides key evidence for the Phoenician and wider Near Eastern roots of the development and proliferation of the earliest silver coinages in the Greek world and western tradition.

The widespread adoption of Greek silver coinages by c. 480 BC appears to have developed first out of cooperative relations between Greeks and Phoenicians, then partly as a competitive, culturally consolidating  response to earlier Phoenician expansion and domination of silver trade, which had been conducted with hacksilver. Within the Cisjordan Corpus, a concentration of hacksilver hoards occurs in a part of southern Phoenicia that was recorded in antiquity as a territory of the Shardana tribes of Sea Peoples associated with Sardinia. Thompson, in her analyses of the hacksilver pieces, relates this textual evidence to lead isotope ratios that have ore signatures matching Sardinian ores. This is the first recognized material evidence linking the two regions in this critical period.&lt;ref&gt;Christine M. Thompson 2011: 'Silver in the age of iron: an overview', in C. Giardino (ed.) Archeometallurgia: dalla conoscenza alla fruizione. Atti del convegno Cavallino, Lecce, 22-25/05/2006 Bari: Edipuglia. 121-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The same hacksilver hoards have provided the first recognized provenance-evidence for far-reaching contact between Europe and Asia related to the prehistoric trafficking of metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = C.M | last2 = Skaggs | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = King Solomon's Silver?

==Hacksilver hoards==

* The 4th or 5th century hoard of [[Traprain Law]] (Traprain Treasure) consists of four silver coins and over 53 pounds of sliced-up Late Roman silver tableware, much of it of very high quality.  Whether this was handed over by Romans to the [[Pict]]ish occupants of the site, or the products of raids on [[Roman Britain]], is unclear.
* The [[Vale of York hoard]] includes over 617 silver coins and hacksilver.
* The [[Cuerdale Hoard]] includes 8,600 items, silver coins and hacksilver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/cuerdale_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: The Cuerdale Hoard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Skaill Hoard]], the largest Viking Age silver hoard found in Scotland, consists of over 100 items, including jewelry, a few coins and assorted hacksilver. The hoard, dated to between 950 and 970, was found in [[Bay of Skaill|Skaill]], Sandwick, Orkney, in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-190-004-111-C|title=National Museums of Scotland - Hacksilver|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/skaillhoard.htm|title=Orkneyjar - The Skaill Viking Hoard in Sandwick, Orkney.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_107/107_114_135.pdf | title=The Viking-age silver and gold hoards of Scandinavian character from Scotland | author=Graham-Campbell, J A |author-link1=James Graham-Campbell| journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland | year=1975–76 | volume=107 | pages=114–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2008}}
'''[[French language|French]]''' is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] (meaning that it is descended primarily from [[Vulgar Latin]]) that evolved out of the [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] spoken in northern France.

The discussion of the history of a language is typically divided into "external history", describing the ethnic, political, social, technological, and other changes that affected the languages, and "internal history", describing the phonological and grammatical changes undergone by the language itself.

==External history==

===Roman Gaul (''Gallia'')===
Before the Roman conquest of what is now France by [[Julius Caesar]] (58–52 BC), much of present France was inhabited by [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] people referred to by the Romans as [[Gaul]]s and [[Belgae]]. Southern France was also home to a number of other remnant linguistic and ethnic groups including [[Iberians]] along the eastern part of the Pyrenees and western Mediterranean coast, remnant [[Ligures]] on the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast and in the [[alps|alpine]] areas, [[Greeks|Greek]] colonials in places such as [[Marseille]] and [[Antibes]],&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Herschel Malmström, ''Geography of Europe: A Regional Analysis''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vascones]] and [[Aquitani]] (Proto-[[Basques]]) in much of the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''The Basques'', Blackwell, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Raftery &amp; Jane McIntosh, ''Atlas of the Celts'', Firefly Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaulish speaking population is held to have continued speaking Gaulish even as considerable Romanization of the local material culture occurred, with Gaulish and Latin coexisting for centuries under Roman rule, and the last attestation of Gaulish deemed credible&lt;ref name=Helix&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Hélix| title=Histoire de la langue française|ISBN=978-2-7298-6470-5|publisher=Ellipses Edition Marketing S.A.|page=7|quote=Le déclin du Gaulois et sa disparition ne s'expliquent pas seulement par des pratiques culturelles spécifiques: Lorsque les Romains conduits par César envahirent la Gaule, au 1er siecle avant J.-C., celle-ci romanisa de manière progressive et profonde. Pendant près de 500 ans, la fameuse période gallo-romaine, le gaulois et le latin parlé coexistèrent; au VIe siècle encore; le temoignage de Grégoire de Tours atteste la survivance de la langue gauloise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been written in the second half of the 6th century about the destruction of a pagan shrine in [[Auvergne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hist. Franc.'', book I, 32 ''Veniens vero Arvernos, delubrum illud, quod Gallica lingua Vasso Galatæ vocant, incendit, diruit, atque subvertit.'' And coming to Clermont [to the [[Arverni]]] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call Vasso Galatæ in the Gallic tongue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtic population of Gaul had spoken [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], which is moderately well attested, with what appears to be wide dialectal variation including one distinctive variety, [[Lepontic language|Lepontic]]. While the French language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] (i.e., a Latinised popular [[Italo-Celtic]] dialect called ''sermo vulgaris''), it was nonetheless influenced by Gaulish.&lt;ref&gt;R. Anthony Lodge, ''French: From Dialect to Standard'' (Routledge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Pellegrini, "Substrata", in ''Romance Comparative and Historical Linguistics'', ed. Rebecca Posner et al. (The Hague: Mouton de Gruyter, 1980), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among these are [[sandhi]] phenomena ([[liaison (French)|liaison]], [[resyllabification]], [[lenition]]), the loss of unstressed syllables, and the vowel system (e.g. raising {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} → {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, fronting stressed {{IPA|/a/}} → {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}} → {{IPA|/ø/}} or {{IPA|/œ/}}).&lt;ref&gt;Henri Guiter, "Sur le substrat gaulois dans la Romania", in ''Munus amicitae. Studia linguistica in honorem Witoldi Manczak septuagenarii'', eds., Anna Bochnakowa &amp; Stanislan Widlak, Krakow, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eugeen Roegiest, ''Vers les sources des langues romanes: Un itinéraire linguistique à travers la Romania'' (Leuven, Belgium: Acco, 2006), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntactic oddities attributable to Gaulish include the intensive prefix ''ro''- ~ ''re''- (cited in the Vienna glossary, 5th century)&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. "trop, très" (Paris: La Différence, 2004), 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. ''luire'' "to glimmer" vs. ''reluire'' "to shine"; related to [[Irish language|Irish]] ''ro''- and  Welsh ''rhy''- "very"), emphatic structures, [[prepositional]] [[periphrastic]] phrases to render verbal aspect, the semantic development of ''oui'' "yes", ''aveugle'' "blind", and so on.

Some sound changes are attested. The sound changes {{IPA|/ps/}} → {{IPA|/xs/}} and {{IPA|/pt/}} → {{IPA|/xt/}} appears in a pottery inscription from [[la Graufesenque]] ([[1st century]]) where the word ''para'''xs'''idi'' is written for ''paro'''ps'''ides''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Yves Lambert]], ''La Langue gauloise'' (Paris: Errance, 1994), 46-7. {{ISBN|978-2-87772-224-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the development -''cs''- → {{IPA|/xs/}} → {{IPA|/is/}} and -''ct''- → {{IPA|/xt/}} → {{IPA|/it/}}, the second common to much of [[Western Romance languages]], also appears in inscriptions, e.g. ''Divicta'' ~ ''Divixta'', ''Rectugenus'' ~ ''Rextugenus'' ~ ''Reitugenus'', and is present in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], e.g. *''seχtan'' → ''saith'' "seven", *''eχtamos'' → ''eithaf'' "extreme". For Romance, compare:
* Latin ''fraxinus'' "ash (tree)" → OFr ''fraisne'' (mod. ''frêne''), [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''fraisse'', [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''freixe'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''freixo'', [[Romansh language|Romansch]] ''fraissen'' (vs. [[Italian language|Italian]] ''frassino'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (dial.) ''frapsin'')
* Latin ''lactem'' "milk" → French ''lait'', Welsh ''llaeth'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''leite'', Cat. ''llet'', [[Piedmontese language|Piemontese]] ''lait'', [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Liguro]] ''leite'' (vs. Italian ''latte'', Occ. ''lach'', [[Lombard language|Lombardo]] ''làcc'', Romansch ''latg'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''leche'').
These two changes sometimes had a cumulative effect in French: Latin ''capsa'' → *''kaχsa'' → ''caisse'' (vs. Italian ''cassa'', Spanish ''caja'') or ''captīvus'' → *''kaχtivus'' → Occ ''caitiu'', OFr ''chaitif''&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; (mod. ''chétif'' "wretched, feeble", cf. Welsh ''caeth'' "bondman, slave", vs. It. ''cattivo'', Sp. ''cautivo'').

In French and adjoining folk dialects and closely related languages, some 200 [[List of French words of Gaulish origin|words of Gaulish origin]] have been retained, most of which pertain to folk life. These include: 
*land features (''bief'' "reach, mill race", ''combe'' "hollow", ''grève'' "sandy shore", ''lande'' "heath");
*plant names (''berle'' "water parsnip", ''bouleau'' "birch", ''bourdaine'' "black alder", ''chêne'' "oak", ''corme'' "service berry", ''gerzeau'' "corncockle", ''if'' "yew", ''vélar/vellar'' "hedge mustard");
*wildlife (''alouette'' "lark", ''barge'' "[[godwit]]", ''loche'' "[[loach]]", ''pinson'' "finch", ''vandoise'' "[[wikt:dace|dace]]", ''vanneau'' "[[lapwing]]");
*rural and farm life, most notably: ''boue'' "mud", ''cervoise'' "ale", ''charrue'' "plow", ''glaise'' "loam", ''gord'' "kiddle, stake net", ''jachère'' "fallow field", ''javelle'' "sheaf, bundle, fagot", ''marne'' "[[marl]]", ''mouton'' "sheep", ''raie'' "lynchet", ''sillon'' "furrow", ''souche'' "tree stump, tree base", ''tarière'' "auger, gimlet", ''tonne'' "barrel";
*some common verbs (''braire'' "to bray", ''changer'' "to change", ''craindre'' "to fear", ''jaillir'' "to surge, gush").;&lt;ref name="MFOG"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://users.skynet.be/sky37816/Mots_gaulois.html
|work=Mots d'origine gauloise
|title=Mots francais d'origine gauloise
|accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*loan translations: ''aveugle'' "blind", from Latin ''ab oculis'' "eyeless", calque of Gaulish ''exsops'' "blind", literally "eyeless"&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvert Watkins]], "Italo-Celtic revisited", in H. Birnbaum, J. Puhvel, ed, ''Ancient Indo-European Dialects'', Berkeley-Los Angeles 1966, p. 29-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lambert 158.&lt;/ref&gt; (vs. Latin ''caecus'' → OFr ''cieu'', It. ''cieco'', Sp. ''ciego'', or ''orbus'' → Occ. ''òrb'', Venetian ''orbo'', Romanian ''orb'').
Other Celtic words were not borrowed directly, but brought in through Latin, some of which had become commonplace in Latin, as for instance ''braies'' "knee-length pants", ''chainse'' "tunic", ''char'' "dray, wagon", ''daim'' "roe deer", ''étain'' "tin", ''glaive'' "broad sword", ''manteau'' "coat", ''vassal'' "serf, knave". Latin quickly took hold among the urban aristocracy for mercantile, official, and educational reasons, but did not prevail in the countryside until some four or five centuries later, since Latin was of little or no social value to the landed gentry and peasantry. The eventual spread of Latin can be attributed to social factors in the Late Empire such as the movement from urban-focused power to village-centered economies and legal serfdom.

===The Franks===
{{See also|History of French#Effect of substrate and superstrate languages|l1=Effect of substrate/superstrate languages}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Romance languages]] --&gt;
From the 3rd century on, [[Western Europe]] was invaded by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from the north and east, and some of these groups settled in [[Gaul]].  In the history of the French language, the most important of these groups are the [[Franks]] in northern France, the [[Alemanni]] in the modern German/French border area ([[Alsace]]), the [[Burgundians]] in the [[Rhône]] (and the [[Saone]]) valley, and the [[Visigoths]] in the [[Aquitaine]] region and Spain.  The [[Frankish language]] had a profound influence on the [[Latin]] spoken in their respective regions, altering both the pronunciation (especially the vowel system phonemes; ''e'', ''eu'', ''u'', short ''o'') and the [[syntax]]. They also introduced a number of new words (''see [[List of French words of Germanic origin]]''). Sources disagree on how much of the vocabulary of modern French (excluding French dialects) comes from Germanic words, ranging from just 500 words (≈1%)&lt;ref&gt;Henriette Walter, Gérard Walter, Dictionnaire des mots d’origine étrangère, Paris, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; (representing loans from ancient Germanic languages: [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and Frankish)&lt;ref name="Catholic Central French"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholiccentral.net/academics/french/history.html

&lt;/ref&gt; to 15% of modern vocabulary (representing all Germanic loans up to modern times: Gothic, Frankish, [[Old Norse]]/Scandinavian, Dutch, German and English)&lt;ref&gt;Walter &amp; Walter 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; to even higher if Germanic words coming from Latin and other Romance languages are taken into account. (Note: According to the [[Académie française]], only 5% of French words come from English.)

Changes in [[lexicon]]/[[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]/[[syntax]]:
* the name of the language itself, ''français'', comes from Old French ''franceis/francesc'' (compare [[Medieval Latin|M.&amp;nbsp;L.]] ''franciscus'') from the Germanic ''frankisc'' "french, frankish" from ''Frank'' ('freeman'). The Franks referred to their land as ''Franko(n)'' which became ''Francia'' in Latin in the 3rd century (at that time, an area in [[Gallia Belgica]], somewhere in modern-day Belgium or the Netherlands). The name ''Gaule'' ("Gaul") was also taken from the Frankish *''Walholant'' ("Land of the Romans/Gauls").
* several terms and expressions associated with their social structure (''baron/baronne, bâtard, bru, chambellan, échevin, félon, féodal, forban, gars/garçon, leude, lige, maçon, maréchal, marquis, meurtrier, sénéchal'').
* military terms (''agrès/gréer, attaquer, bière ["stretcher"], dard, étendard, fief, flanc, flèche, gonfalon, guerre, garder, garnison, hangar, heaume, loge, marcher, patrouille, rang, rattraper, targe, trêve, troupe'').
* colors derived from Frankish and other Germanic languages (''blanc/blanche, bleu, blond/blonde, brun, fauve, gris, guède'').
* other examples among common words include ''abandonner, arranger, attacher, auberge, bande, banquet, bâtir, besogne, bille, blesser, bois, bonnet, bord, bouquet, bouter, braise, broderie, brosse, chagrin, choix, chic, cliché, clinquant, coiffe, corroyer, crèche, danser, échaffaud, engage, effroi, épargner, épeler, étal, étayer, étiquette, fauteuil, flan, flatter, flotter, fourbir, frais, frapper, gai, galant, galoper, gant, gâteau, glisser, grappe, gratter, gredin, gripper, guère, guise, hache, haïr, halle, hanche, harasser, héron, heurter, jardin, jauger, joli, laid, lambeau, layette, lécher, lippe, liste, maint, maquignon, masque, massacrer, mauvais, mousse, mousseron, orgueil, parc, patois, pincer, pleige, rat, rater, regarder, remarquer, riche/richesse, rime, robe, rober, saisir, salon, savon, soupe, tampon, tomber, touaille, trépigner, trop, tuyau'' and many words starting with a hard g (like ''gagner, garantie, gauche, guérir'') or with an aspired h (''haine, hargneux, hâte, haut'')&lt;ref name="TLIF_2"&gt;''[http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlfi.htm Le trésor de la langue française informatisé]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* endings in ''-ard'' (from Frankish ''hard'': ''canard, pochard, richard''), ''-aud'' (from Frankish ''wald'': ''[[crapaud]], maraud, nigaud''), ''-an/-and'' (from old suffix ''-anc, -enc'': ''paysan, cormoran, Flamand, tisserand, chambellan'') all very common [[family name affixes]] for [[French names]].
* endings in ''-ange'' (Eng. ''-ing'', Grm. ''-ung''; ''boulange/boulanger, mélange/mélanger, vidange/vidanger''), diminutive ''-on'' (''oisillon'')
* many verbs ending in ''-ir'' (2nd group, see [[French conjugation]]) such as ''affranchir, ahurir, choisir, guérir, haïr, honnir, jaillir, lotir, nantir, rafraîchir, ragaillardir, tarir'', etc.
* prefix ''mé(s)-'' (from Frankish "''missa-''", as in ''mésentente'', ''mégarde'', ''méfait'', ''mésaventure'', ''mécréant'', ''mépris'', ''méconnaissance'', ''méfiance'', ''médisance'')
* prefix ''for-, four-'' as in ''forbannir, forcené, forlonger, (se) fourvoyer'', etc. from Frankish ''fir-, fur-'' (cf German ''ver-''; English ''for-''). Merged with Old French ''fuers'' "outside, beyond" from Latin ''foris''. Latin ''foris'' was not used as a prefix in Classical Latin, but appears as a prefix in Medieval Latin following the Germanic invasions.
* prefix ''en-'', ''em-'' (which reinforced and merged with Latin ''in-'' "in, on, into") was extended to fit new formations not previously found in Latin. Influenced or calqued from Frankish *''in-'' and *''an-'', usually with an intensive or perfective sense: ''emballer, emblaver, endosser, enhardir, enjoliver, enrichir, envelopper, etc.''
* The syntax shows the systematic presence of a subject pronoun in front of the verb, as in the Germanic languages: ''je vois'', ''tu vois'', ''il voit'', while the subject pronoun is optional – function of the parameter pro-drop – in most other Romance languages (as in Spanish ''veo'', ''ves'', ''ve'').
* The inversion of subject-verb to verb-subject to form the interrogative is characteristic of the Germanic languages but is not found in any of the major Romance languages, except French (cf. ''Vous avez un crayon.'' vs. ''Avez-vous un crayon?'': ''"Do you have a pencil?"'').
* The adjective placed in front of the noun is typical of Germanic languages, it is more frequent in French than in the other major Romance languages and occasionally compulsory (''belle femme'', '' vieil homme'', ''grande table'', ''petite table''); when it is optional, it changes the meaning:  ''grand homme'' ("great man") and ''le plus grand homme'' ("the greatest man") vs ''homme grand'' ("tall man")  and  ''l'homme le plus grand''  ("the tallest man"), ''certaine chose'' vs ''chose certaine''. In [[Walloon language|Walloon]], the order "adjective + noun" is the general rule, as in [[Old French]] and North Cotentin Norman.
* Several words calqued or modeled on corresponding terms in Germanic languages (''bienvenue, cauchemar, chagriner, compagnon, entreprendre, manoeuvre, manuscrit, on, pardonner, plupart, sainfoin, tocsin, toujours'').

The Frankish language had a determining influence on the birth of Old French, which in part explains why Old French is the earliest attested of the Romance languages (e.g. the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]], ''[[Sequence of Saint Eulalia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Cerquiglini]], ''La naissance du français'', Presses Universitaires de France, 2nd Edition 1993, C. III, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The new speech diverged quite markedly from the Latin, with which it was no longer mutually intelligible. The Old Low Frankish influence is also primarily responsible for the differences between the ''langue d'oïl'' and ''langue d'oc'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) as well, because different parts of Northern France remained bilingual in Latin and Germanic for several centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Cerquiglini 53&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding exactly to the places where the first documents in Old French were written. This Germanic language shaped the popular Latin spoken here and gave it a very distinctive character compared to the other future Romance languages. The very first noticeable influence is the substitution of a Germanic stress accent for the Latin melodic accent,&lt;ref&gt;Cerquiglini 26.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in diphthongization, distinction between long and short vowels, the loss of the unaccentuated syllable and of final vowels, e.g. Latin ''decima'' &gt; F ''dîme'' (&gt; E ''dime''. Italian ''decima''; Spanish ''diezmo''); [[Vulgar Latin]] ''dignitate'' &gt; OF ''deintié'' (&gt; E ''dainty''. Occitan ''dinhitat''; Italian ''dignità''; Spanish ''dignidad''); VL ''catena'' &gt; OF ''chaiene'' (&gt; E ''chain''. Occitan ''cadena''; Italian ''catena''; Spanish ''cadena''). On the other hand, a common word like L ''aqua'' &gt; Occitan ''aigue'' became OF ''ewe'' &gt; F ''eau'' 'water' (and ''évier'' sink), likely influenced by the OS or OHG word pronunciation ''aha'' (PG *''ahwo'').

In addition, two new phonemes that no longer existed in Vulgar Latin were added: [h] and [w] (&gt; OF ''g(u)-'', ONF ''w-'' cf. [[Picard language|Picard]] ''w-''), e.g. VL ''altu'' &gt; OF ''halt'' 'high' (influenced by OLF ''*hauh''; ≠ Italian, Spanish ''alto''; Occitan ''naut''); VL ''vespa'' &gt; F ''guêpe'' (ONF ''wespe''; Picard ''wespe'') 'wasp' (influenced by OLF ''*waspa''; ≠ Occitan ''vèspa''; Italian ''vespa''; Spanish ''avispa''); L ''viscus'' &gt; F ''gui'' 'mistletoe' (influenced by OLF ''*wihsila'' 'morello', together with analogous fruits, when they are not ripe; ≠ Occitan ''vesc''; Italian ''vischio''); LL ''vulpiculu'' 'little fox' (from L ''vulpes'' 'fox') &gt; OF ''g[o]upil'' (influenced by OLF ''*wulf'' 'wolf'; ≠ Italian ''volpe''). It is to be noted Italian and Spanish words of Germanic origin borrowed from French or directly from Germanic also retain this [gw] and [g], cf. It, Sp. ''guerra'' 'war'. In these examples, we notice a clear consequence of bilingualism, which frequently alters the initial syllable of the Latin.

There is also the converse example, where the Latin word influences the Germanic one: ''framboise'' 'raspberry' from OLF ''*brambasi'' (cf. OHG ''brāmberi'' &gt; ''Brombeere'' 'mulberry'; E ''brambleberry''; ''*basi'' 'berry' cf. Got. ''-basi'', Dutch ''bes'' 'berry') conflated with LL ''fraga'' or OF ''fraie'' ‘strawberry’, which explains the shift to [f] from [b], and in turn the final ''-se'' of ''framboise'' turned ''fraie'' into ''fraise'' (≠ Occitan ''fragosta'' 'raspberry', Italian ''fragola'' 'strawberry'. Portuguese ''framboesa'' 'raspberry' and Spanish ''frambuesa'' are from French).&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=frambuesa Etymology of ''frambuesa'' (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philology|Philologists]] such as Pope (1934) estimate that still perhaps fifteen percent of the vocabulary of modern French derives from Germanic sources, though the proportion was larger in Old French, as the language was consequently re-Latinised and partly Italianised by clerics and grammarians in the Middle Ages and later. Nevertheless, a large number of words like [[wiktionary:haïr|''haïr'']] "to hate" (≠ Latin ''odiare'' &gt; Italian ''odiare'', Spanish ''odiar'', Occitan ''asirar'') and [[wiktionary:honte|''honte'']] "shame" (≠ Latin ''vĕrēcundia'' &gt; Occitan ''vergonha'', Italian ''vergogna'', Spanish ''vergüenza'') remain common.

[[Urban T. Holmes Jr.]] estimated that German was spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western [[Austrasia]] and [[Neustria]] as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban T. Holmes Jr.]], A. H. Schutz (1938), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jbjX4ebc2lsC&amp;pg=PA29 A history of the French language], p. 29, Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers, {{ISBN|0-8196-0191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some traces of Germanic elements still survive, especially in dialectal French ([[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]], [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Burgundian]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Picard language|Picard]], etc.).

===The Normans and terms from the Low Countries===
In 1204 AD, the [[Duchy of Normandy]] was integrated into the [[Crown lands of France]], and many words were introduced into the French language from [[Norman language|Norman]] of which about 150 words of [[Old Norse|Scandinavian]] origin&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Ridel, ''Les Vikings et les mots'', Editions Errance, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; are still in use. Most of these words have to do with the sea and seafaring: ''abraquer, alque, bagage, bitte, cingler, équiper (to equip), flotte, fringale, girouette, guichet, hauban, houle, hune, mare, marsouin, mouette, quille, raz, siller, touer, traquer, turbot, vague, varangue, varech''. Others pertain to farming and daily life: ''accroupir, amadouer, bidon, bigot, brayer, brette, cottage, coterie, crochet, duvet, embraser, fi, flâner, guichet, haras, harfang, harnais, houspiller, marmonner, mièvre, nabot, nique, quenotte, raccrocher, ricaner, rincer, rogue''.

Likewise, words borrowed from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] deal mainly with trade, or are nautical in nature, but not always so: ''affaler, amarrer, anspect, bar (sea-bass), bastringuer, bière (beer), blouse (bump), botte, bouée, bouffer, boulevard, bouquin, cague, cahute, caqueter, choquer, diguer, drôle, dune, équiper (to set sail), frelater, fret, grouiller, hareng, hère, lamaneur, lège, manne, mannequin, maquiller, matelot, méringue, moquer, plaque, sénau, tribord, vacarme'', as are words from [[Low German language|Low German]]: ''bivouac, bouder, homard, vogue, yole'', and [[English language|English]] of this period: ''arlequin'' (from Italian ''arlecchino'' &lt; Norman ''hellequin'' &lt; OE *''Herla cyning''), ''bateau, bébé, bol'' (sense 2 ≠ bol &lt; Lt. ''bolus''), ''bouline, bousin, cambuse, cliver, chiffe/chiffon, drague, drain, est, groom, héler, merlin, mouette, nord, ouest, potasse, rade, rhum, sonde, sud, turf, yacht''.

===Langue d'oïl===
{{See also|Old French}}

The [[medieval Italian]] poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], in his [[Latin]] ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', classified the Romance languages into three groups by their respective words for "yes": ''Nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil'', "For some say ''oc'', others say ''si'', others say ''oïl''". The ''oïl'' languages{{spaced ndash}}from [[Latin]] ''{{linktext|hoc}} {{linktext|ille}}'', "that is it"{{spaced ndash}}occupied northern France, the ''oc'' languages{{spaced ndash}}from [[Latin]] ''{{linktext|hoc}}'', "that"{{spaced ndash}}southern France, and the ''si'' languages{{spaced ndash}}from [[Latin]] ''{{linktext|sic}}'', "thus"{{spaced ndash}}the [[Italian peninsula|Italian]] and [[Iberian peninsula]]s. Modern linguists typically add a third group within France around [[Lyon]], the "Arpitan" or "[[Franco-Provençal language]]", whose modern word for "yes" is ''ouè''.
[[File:Langues d'oïl.PNG|thumb|The area of ''[[langues d'oïl]]'']]
The [[Gallo-Romance]] group in the north of France, the ''[[langue d'oïl]]'' like [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], and [[Francien]], were influenced by the [[Germanic languages]] spoken by the Frankish invaders. From the time period of [[Clovis I]] on, the Franks extended their rule over northern Gaul.  Over time, the French language developed from either the Oïl language found around [[Paris]] and [[Île-de-France]] (the Francien theory) or from a standard administrative language based on common characteristics found in all Oïl languages (the [[lingua franca]] theory).

''[[Occitan language|Langue d'oc]]'', the languages which use ''oc'' or ''òc'' for "yes", is the language group in the south of France and northern [[Spain]]. These languages, such as [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], have relatively little Frankish influence.

The Middle Ages also saw the influence of other linguistic groups on the dialects of France:

Modern French, principally derived from the ''langue d'oïl'' acquired the word ''si'', used to contradict negative statements or respond to negative questions, from cognate forms of "yes" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''sí''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''sim''), and [[Italian language|Italian]] (''sì'').

From the 4th to 7th centuries, [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-speaking peoples from [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], and [[Wales]] traveled across the [[English Channel]], both for reasons of trade and of flight from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasions of England.  They established themselves in [[Armorica]]. Their language became [[Breton language|Breton]] in more recent centuries, giving French ''bijou'' "jewel" (&lt; Breton ''bizou'' from ''biz'' "finger") and ''menhir'' (&lt; Breton ''maen'' "stone" and ''hir'' "long").

Attested since the time of [[Julius Caesar]], a non-Celtic people who spoke a [[Basque language|Basque]]-related language inhabited the [[Novempopulania]] (''Aquitania Tertia'') in southwestern France, while the language gradually lost ground to the expanding [[Romance language|Romance]] during a period spanning most of the Early Middle Ages. This [[Vasconic languages|Proto-Basque]] influenced the emerging Latin-based language spoken in the area between the [[Garonne]] and the [[Pyrenees]], eventually resulting in the dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] called [[Gascon language|Gascon]]. Its influence is seen in words like ''boulbène'' and ''cargaison''.

[[Scandinavia]]n [[Vikings]] invaded France from the 9th century onwards and established themselves mostly in what would come to be called [[Normandy]]. The [[Normans]] took up the [[oïl languages|langue d'oïl]] spoken there, although [[Norman French]] remained heavily influenced by [[Old Norse]] and its dialects. They also contributed many words to French related to sailing (''mouette, crique, hauban, hune'', etc.) and farming.

After the [[Norman conquest|conquest of England]] in 1066, the [[Normans]]'s language developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]].  Anglo-Norman served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce in England from the time of the conquest until the [[Hundred Years' War]],&lt;ref&gt;Baugh, Cable, "A History of the English Language, 104."&lt;/ref&gt; by which time the use of [[History of the English Language#Period of French Domination|French-influenced English]] had spread throughout English society.

Around this time period, many words from the [[Arabic language]] (or from [[Persian language|Persian]] via Arabic) entered French, mainly indirectly through [[Medieval Latin]], Italian and Spanish. There are words for luxury goods (''élixir, orange''), [[spices]] (''camphre, safran''), trade goods (''alcool, bougie, coton''), sciences (''alchimie, hasard''), and [[mathematics]] (''algèbre, algorithme''). Only after the 19th century development of French colonies in North Africa did French borrow words directly from Arabic (e.g., ''toubib'', ''chouia'', ''mechoui'').

===Modern French===
{{See also|Middle French}}
For the period up to around 1300, some linguists refer to the [[oïl languages]] collectively as [[Old French]] (''ancien français''). The earliest extant text in French is the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] from 842; Old French became a [[literary language]] with the ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' that told tales of the [[paladin]]s of [[Charlemagne]] and the [[hero]]es of the [[Crusade]]s.

The first government authority to adopt Modern French as official was the [[Aosta Valley]] in 1536, three years before [[France]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zigzag-francophonie.eu/ITALIE-Le-Val-d-Aoste La Vallée d'Aoste : enclave francophone au sud-est du Mont Blanc.]&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] in 1539 King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] made French the [[official language]] of administration and court proceedings in France, ousting the [[Latin]] that had been used before then. With the imposition of a standardised chancery dialect and the loss of the declension system, the dialect is referred to as Middle French (''moyen français''). The first grammatical description of French, the ''Tretté de la Grammaire française'' by [[Louis Maigret (grammarian)|Louis Maigret]], was published in 1550. Many of the 700 words &lt;ref&gt;Henriette Walter, ''L'aventure des mots français venus d'ailleurs'', Robert Laffont, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; of modern French that originate from [[Italian language|Italian]] were introduced in this period, including several denoting artistic concepts (''scenario'', ''piano''), luxury items, and food.

Following a period of unification, regulation, and purification, the French of the 17th to the 18th centuries is sometimes referred to as Classical French (''français classique''), although many linguists simply refer to French language from the 17th century to today as [[Modern French]] (''français moderne'').

The foundation of the [[Académie française]] (French Academy) in 1634 by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] created an official body whose goal has been the purification and preservation of the French language.  This group of 40 members is known as the Immortals, not, as some erroneously believe, because they are chosen to serve for the extent of their lives (which they are), but because of the inscription engraved on the official seal given to them by their founder Richelieu—"À l'immortalité" ("to [the] Immortality [of the French language]"). The foundation still exists and contributes to the policing of the language and the adaptation of foreign words and expressions.  Some recent modifications include the change from ''software'' to ''logiciel'', ''packet-boat'' to ''paquebot'', and ''riding-coat'' to ''redingote''.  The word ''ordinateur'' for ''computer'' was however not created by the Académie, but by a linguist appointed by [[IBM]] (see [[:fr:ordinateur]]).

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, France was the leading power of Europe; thanks to this, together with the influence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French was the [[lingua franca]] of educated Europe, especially with regards to the arts, literature, and [[diplomacy]]; monarchs like [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia could both not just speak and write in French, but in most excellent French. The Russian, German and Scandinavian Courts spoke French as their main or official language, regarding their national languages as the language of the peasants.  Spread of French to other European countries was also aided by emigration of persecuted [[Hugenots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When The World Spoke French |author=Marc Fumaroli |translator=Richard Howard |year=2011 |isbn=978-1590173756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the French language established itself permanently in the Americas. There is an academic debate about how fluent in French the colonists of [[New France]] were. While less than 15% of colonists (25% of the women – chiefly ''[[filles du roi]]'' – and 5% of the men) were from the region of [[Paris]] and presumably spoke French, most of the rest came from north-western and western regions of France where regular French was not the primary native language. It is not clearly known how many among those colonists understood French as a second language, and how many among them – who, in overwhelming majority, natively spoke an oïl language – could understand, and be understood by, those who speak French thanks to interlinguistic similarity. In any case, a linguistic unification of all the groups coming from France happened (either in France, on the ships, or in Canada) such that, according to many sources, the then "Canadiens" were all speaking French (King's French) natively by the end of the 17th century, well before the unification was complete in France. Canada's reputation was to speak as good French as Paris did. Today, French is the language of about 10 million people (not counting French-based creoles, which are also spoken by about 10 million people) in the Americas.

Through the Académie, public education, centuries of official control and the role of media, a unified official French language has been forged, but there remains a great deal of diversity today in terms of regional accents and words.  For some critics, the "best" pronunciation of the French language is considered to be the one used in [[Touraine]] (around [[Tours, France|Tours]] and the [[Loire valley]]), but such value judgments are fraught with problems, and with the ever-increasing loss of lifelong attachments to a specific region and the growing importance of the national media, the future of specific "regional" accents is often difficult to predict. The French [[nation-state]], which appeared after the 1789 [[French Revolution]] and [[Napoleon]]'s empire, unified the [[French people]] in particular through the consolidation of the use of the French language. Hence, according to historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]], "the French language has been essential to the concept of 'France', although in 1789 50% of the French people did not speak it at all, and only 12 to 13% spoke it 'fairly' – in fact, even in [[langues d'oïl|oïl language]] zones, out of a central region, it was not usually spoken except in cities, and, even there, not always in the [[faubourgs]] [approximatively translatable to "suburbs"]. In the North as in the South of France, almost nobody spoke French."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hobsbawm]], ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990; {{ISBN|0-521-43961-2}}) chapter II "The popular protonationalism", pp.80–81 French edition ([[Gallimard]], 1992). According to Hobsbawm, the main source for this subject is Ferdinand Brunot (ed.), ''Histoire de la langue française'', Paris, 1927–1943, 13 volumes, in particular volume IX. He also refers to [[Michel de Certeau]], Dominique Julia, Judith Revel, ''Une politique de la langue: la Révolution française et les patois: l'enquête de l'abbé Grégoire'', Paris, 1975. For the problem of the transformation of a minority official language into a widespread national language during and after the [[French Revolution]], see Renée Balibar, ''L'Institution du français: essai sur le co-linguisme des Carolingiens à la République'', Paris, 1985 (also ''Le co-linguisme'', [[PUF]], [[Que sais-je?]], 1994, but out of print) ("The Institution of the French language: essay on colinguism from the [[Carolingian]] to the [[French Republic|Republic]]. Finally, Hobsbawm refers to Renée Balibar and Dominique Laporte, ''Le Français national: politique et pratique de la langue nationale sous la Révolution'', Paris, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobsbawm highlighted the role of [[conscription]], invented by Napoleon, and of the 1880s public instruction laws, which allowed to mix the various groups of France into a [[nationalist]] mold which created the French citizen and his consciousness of membership to a common nation, while the various "[[patois]]" were progressively eradicated.

===Modern issues===
There is some debate in today's France about the preservation of the French language and the influence of English (see [[Franglais]]), especially with regard to international business, the sciences, and popular culture.  There have been laws (see [[Toubon law]]) enacted which require that all print ads and billboards with foreign expressions include a French translation and which require quotas of French-language songs (at least 40%) on the radio.  There is also pressure, in differing degrees, from some regions as well as minority political or cultural groups for a measure of recognition and support for their [[regional language]]s.

Once the key international language in Europe, being the language of diplomacy from the 17th to mid-20th centuries, French lost most of its international significance to English in the 20th century, especially after [[World War II]], with the rise of the United States as a dominant global [[superpower]]. A watershed was when the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ending [[World War I]], was written in both French and English. A small but increasing number of large multinational firms headquartered in France are using English as their working language even in their French operations, and to gain international recognition, French scientists often publish their work in English.  These trends have met some resistance.  In March 2006, President Chirac briefly walked out of an EU summit after [[Ernest-Antoine Seilliere]] began addressing the summit in English.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4840160.stm "Chirac upset by English address,"] [[BBC News]], 24 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  And in February 2007, Forum Francophone International began organising protests against the "linguistic hegemony" of English in France and in support of the right of French workers to use French as their working language.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6341795.stm "French fury over English language,"] [[BBC News]], 8 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

French remains the second most-studied foreign language in the world, after English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIFL|url=http://mydifl.com/languages.htm#French|work=Learn Languages|publisher=Dante Institute of Foreign Languages|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[lingua franca]] in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies ([[Southeast Asia]]), while the language has changed to [[creole language|creole]]s, dialects or pidgins in the French departments in the [[West Indies]], even though people there are still educated in standard French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sain Lucian Creole French|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=acf|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers has increased, especially in [[Africa]].

In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], different laws have promoted the use of French in administration, business and education since the 1970s. [[Bill 101]], for example, obliges every child whose parents did not attend an English-speaking school to be educated in French. Efforts are also made, by the ''[[Office québécois de la langue française]]'' for instance, to make more uniform the variation of French spoken in Quebec as well as to preserve the distinctiveness of [[Quebec French]].

There has been French emigration to the United States of America, Australia and South America, but the descendants of these immigrants have assimilated to the point that few of them still speak French. In the United States of America efforts are ongoing in [[Louisiana]] (''see [[CODOFIL]]'') and parts of [[New England]] (particularly [[Maine]]) to preserve the language there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Organisations|url=http://acim.umfk.maine.edu/cultural_orgs.html|publisher=Maine Acadian Culture Preservation Commission|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===
The [[Vulgar Latin]]{{efn|For the purposes of this article, "Vulgar Latin" refers specifically to the spoken Latin that underlies French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, technically termed ''Proto-Italo-Western-Romance''.}} underlying French and most other Romance languages had seven vowels in stressed syllables ({{IPA|/a ɛ e i ɔ o u/}}, similar to the vowels of American English ''khat pet pate peat caught coat coot'' respectively), and five in unstressed syllables ({{IPA|/a e i o u/}}). Portuguese and Italian largely preserve this system, while Spanish has innovated only in converting {{IPA|/ɛ/}} to {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} to {{IPA|/we/}}, resulting in a simple five-vowel system {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}. In French, however, numerous sound changes resulted in a system with 12-14 [[oral vowel]]s and 3-4 [[nasal vowel]]s (see [[French phonology]]).

Perhaps the most salient characteristic of French vowel history is the development of a strong [[stress accent]] — usually ascribed to the influence of the [[Germanic languages]] — that led to the disappearance of most unstressed vowels and to pervasive differences in the pronunciation of stressed vowels in originally [[open syllable|open]] vs. [[closed syllable]]s (where a closed syllable is a syllable that was followed by two or more consonants in Vulgar Latin, whereas an open syllable was followed by at most one consonant). It is commonly thought that stressed vowels in open syllables were [[vowel length|lengthened]], after which most of the long vowels turned into [[diphthongs]]. The loss of unstressed vowels, particularly those after the stress, ultimately produced the situation in Modern French where the accent is uniformly found on the last syllable of a word. (Ironically, in Modern French the stress accent is quite weak, with little difference between the pronunciation of stressed and unstressed vowels.)

==== Unstressed vowels ====
Vulgar Latin had five vowels in unstressed syllables: {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}. When these occurred word-finally, all were lost in [[Old French]] except for {{IPA|/a/}}, which turned into a [[schwa]] (written ''e''):

{| class="wikitable"
! Latin !! Vulgar Latin !! French
|-
| {{sc|factam}} "done (fem.)" || {{IPA|/fákta/}} || ''faite''
|-
| {{sc|noctem}} "night" || {{IPA|/nɔ́kte/}} || ''nuit''
|-
| {{sc|dīxī}} "I said" || {{IPA|/díksi/}} || ''dis''
|-
| {{sc|octō}} "eight" || {{IPA|/ɔ́kto/}} || ''huit''
|-
| {{sc|factum}} "done (masc.)" || {{IPA|/fáktu/}} || ''fait''
|}

A final schwa also developed when the loss of a final vowel produced a consonant cluster that was (at the time) unpronounceable when word-final, usually consisting of a consonant followed by ''l'', ''r'', ''m'' or ''n'' (VL = Vulgar Latin, OF = Old French):
* {{sc|populum}} "people" &gt; ''peuple''
* {{sc|inter}} "between" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/entre/}} &gt; ''entre''
* {{sc|pater}} "father" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/patre/}} &gt; ''père''{{efn|Note how a final schwa appears even though the ''t'' was eventually lost.}}
* {{sc|asinum}} "donkey" &gt; OF ''asne'' &gt; ''âne''

The final schwa was eventually lost as well, but leaves its mark in the spelling, as well as in the pronunciation of final consonants, which normally remain pronounced if a schwa followed but are often lost otherwise: ''fait'' "done (masc.)" {{IPA|/fɛ/}} vs. ''faite'' "done (fem.)" {{IPA|/fɛt/}}.

Intertonic vowels (i.e. unstressed vowels in interior syllables) were lost entirely, except for ''a'' in a syllable preceding the stress, which (originally) became a schwa (stressed syllable underlined in the Latin examples):
* {{sc|&lt;u&gt;po&lt;/u&gt;pulum}} "people" &gt; ''peuple''
* {{sc|&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;sinum}} "donkey" &gt; OF ''asne'' &gt; ''âne''
* {{sc|&lt;u&gt;pres&lt;/u&gt;byter}} "priest" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/prɛ́sbetre/}} &gt; OF ''prestre'' &gt; ''prêtre''
* {{sc|quattu&lt;u&gt;or&lt;/u&gt;decim}} "fourteen" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/kwattɔ́rdetsi/}} &gt; ''quatorze''
* {{sc|&lt;u&gt;Ste&lt;/u&gt;phanum}} "Stephen" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/estɛ́fanu/}} &gt; OF ''Estievne'' &gt; ''Étienne''
* {{sc|septi&lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt;nam}} "week" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/settemána/}} &gt; ''semaine''
* *{{sc|parabo&lt;u&gt;lā&lt;/u&gt;re}} "to speak" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/parauláre/}} &gt; ''parler''
* {{sc|sacra&lt;u&gt;men&lt;/u&gt;tum}} "sacrament" &gt; OF ''sairement'' &gt; ''serment'' "oath''{{efn|The word has been respelled in Modern French, but the Old French result shows that ''a'' in an intertonic syllable preceding the stress was originally preserved as a schwa.}}
* {{sc|adiū&lt;u&gt;tā&lt;/u&gt;re}} "to help" &gt; ''aider''
* {{sc|disiēiū&lt;u&gt;nā&lt;/u&gt;re}} "to break one's fast" &gt; OF ''disner'' &gt; ''dîner'' "to dine"

==== Stressed vowels ====
As noted above, stressed vowels developed quite differently depending on whether they occurred in an [[open syllable]] (followed by at most one consonant) or a [[closed syllable]] (followed by two or more consonants). In open syllables, the Vulgar Latin mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ e ɔ o/}} all diphthongized, becoming Old French ''ie oi ue eu'' respectively (''ue'' and ''eu'' later merged), while Vulgar Latin {{IPA|/a/}} was raised to Old French ''e''. In closed syllables, all Vulgar Latin vowels originally remained unchanged, but eventually {{IPA|/e/}} merged into {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, while {{IPA|/u/}} became the [[front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/y/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} was raised to {{IPA|/u/}}. (These latter two changes occurred unconditionally, i.e. in both open and closed, stressed and unstressed syllables.)

The following table shows the outcome of stressed vowels in open syllables:

==== Nasal vowels ====
Latin {{sc|n}} that ended up not followed by a vowel after the loss of vowels in unstressed syllables was ultimately absorbed into the preceding vowel, producing a series of [[nasal vowel]]s. The developments are somewhat complex (even more so when a palatal element is also present in the same cluster, as in {{sc|punctum}} "point, dot" &gt; ''point'' {{IPA|/pwɛ̃/}}). There are two separate cases, depending on whether the {{sc|n}} originally stood between vowels or next to a consonant (i.e. whether a preceding stressed vowel developed in an [[open syllable]] or [[closed syllable]] context, respectively). See the article on the [[phonological history of French]] for full details.

==== Long vowels ====
Latin {{sc|s}} before a consonant ultimately was absorbed into the preceding vowel, producing a [[long vowel]] (indicated in Modern French spelling with a [[circumflex]] accent). For the most part, these long vowels are no longer pronounced distinctively long in Modern French (although long ''ê'' is still distinguished in [[Quebec French]]). In most cases, the formerly long vowel is pronounced identically to the formerly short vowel (e.g. ''mur'' "wall" and ''mûr'' "mature" are pronounced the same), but some pairs are distinguished by their quality (e.g. ''o'' {{IPA|/ɔ/}} vs. ''ô'' {{IPA|/o/}}).

A separate, later vowel lengthening operates [[allophonic]]ally in Modern French, lengthening vowels before the final voiced [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v z ʒ ʁ vʁ/}} (e.g. ''pais'' {{IPA|/pɛ/}} "peace" vs. ''pair'' {{IPA|[pɛːʁ]}} "even").

====Effect of palatalized consonants====
Late Vulgar Latin of the French area had a full complement of [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants, and more developed over time. Most of them, if preceded by a vowel, caused a {{IPA|/j/}} sound (a [[Palatal approximant|yod]], as in the words ''you'' or ''yard'') to appear before them, which combined with the vowel to produce a diphthong, eventually developing in various complex ways. A {{IPA|/j/}} also appeared after them if they were originally followed by certain stressed vowels in [[open syllable]]s (specifically, {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}). If the appearance of the {{IPA|/j/}} sound produced a [[triphthong]], the middle vowel dropped out.

Examples, showing the various sources of palatalized consonants:
# From Latin {{sc|e}} or {{sc|i}} in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]:
#* {{sc|bassiāre}} "to lower" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/bassʲare/}} &gt; OF ''baissier'' &gt; ''baisser''{{efn|Here, {{IPA|/j/}} appeared both before and after the palatalized sound, but Old French infinitives in ''-ier'' were later converted to end in ''-er''.}}
#* {{sc|palātium}} "palace" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/palatsʲu/}} &gt; ''palais''
# From Latin {{sc|c}} or {{sc|g}} followed by a [[front vowel]] (i.e. {{sc|e}} or {{sc|i}}):
#* {{sc|pācem}} "peace" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/patsʲe/}} &gt; ''paix''
#* {{sc|cēra}} "wax" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/tsʲera/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/tsjejra/}} &gt; ''cire''{{efn|Stressed {{IPA|/e/}} in an open syllable normally develops to Early Old French ''ei'', later ''oi''. In this case, however, the {{IPA|/j/}} produced by Vulgar Latin {{IPA|/tsʲ/}} produced a triphthong {{IPA|/jej/}}, which simplified to {{IPA|/i/}} by loss of the middle vowel {{IPA|/e/}}.}}
# From Latin sequences such as {{sc|ct}}, {{sc|x}}, {{sc|gr}}:
#* {{sc|factum}} "done" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/fajtʲu/}} &gt; ''fait''
#* {{sc|laxāre}} "to release" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/lajsʲare/}} &gt; OF ''laissier'' &gt; ''laisser'' "to let"{{efn|See note above about ''baisser''.}}
#* {{sc|nigrum}} "black" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/nejrʲu/}} &gt; Early Old French ''neir'' &gt; ''noir''{{efn|The resulting sequence ''ei'' developed the same way as ''ei'' from stressed open {{IPA|/e/}}.}}
#* {{sc|noctem}} "night" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/nɔjtʲe/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/nwɔjtʲe/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/nujtʲe/}} ''nuit''{{efn|VL {{IPA|/ɔ/}} normally becomes diphthongal {{IPA|/wɔ/}} in open syllables, later becoming Old French ''ue''. However, diphthongization of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}} also occurred in closed syllables when a palatalized consonant followed, and the resulting triphthong was simplified by loss of the middle vowel.}}
# From Latin {{sc|c}} or {{sc|g}} followed by {{IPA|/a/}}, when not preceded by a vowel:
#* {{sc|canem}} "dog" &gt; pre-French *{{IPA|/tʃʲane/}} &gt; ''chien''
#* {{sc|carricāre}} "to load" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/karregare/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/kargare/}} &gt; pre-French *{{IPA|/tʃʲardʒʲare/}} &gt; OF ''chargier''
# From Latin consonantal {{sc|i}}:
#* {{sc|pēior}} {{IPA|/pejjor/}} "worse" &gt; Western Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/pɛjrʲe/}} &gt; pre-French *{{IPA|/pjɛjrʲe}} &gt; ''pire''{{efn|Here triphthong reduction produces /i/ by deleting the middle vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.}}
#* {{sc|iacet}} "he lies (on the ground)" &gt; pre-French *{{IPA|/dʒʲatsʲet/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/dʒjajtst/}} &gt; OF ''gist'' &gt; ''gît''{{efn|Here a triphthong results from the combined effects of the two palatalized consonants, and is then reduced to {{IPA|/i/}} by loss of the middle vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.}}

==== Effect of ''l'' ====
During the Old French period, ''l'' before a consonant became ''u'', producing new diphthongs, which eventually resolved into [[monophthongs]], e.g. {{sc|falsam}} "false" &gt; ''fausse'' {{IPA|/fos/}}. See the article on [[phonological history of French]] for details.

===Consonants===
The sound changes involving consonants are less striking than those involving vowels. In some ways, French is actually relatively conservative. For example, it preserves initial ''pl-'', ''fl-'', ''cl-'', unlike Spanish, Portuguese and Italian, e.g. {{sc|plovēre}} "to rain" &gt; ''pleuvoir'' (Spanish ''llover'', Portuguese ''chover'', Italian ''piovere'').

====Lenition====
Consonants between vowels were subject to a process called [[lenition]] (a type of weakening). In French, this was more extensive than in Spanish, Portuguese or Italian. For example, {{IPA|/t/}} between vowels went through the following stages in French: {{IPA|/t/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ð/}} &gt; no sound, whereas in Spanish only the first two changes happened, in Brazilian Portuguese only the first change happened, and in Italian no changes happened. Compare {{sc|vītam}} "life" &gt; ''vie'' with Italian ''vita'', Portuguese ''vida'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[biða]}}. The following table shows the outcomes:

{|class="wikitable"

|-
| {{IPA|/tsʲ/}} || {{IPA|/z/}} || {{sc|potiōnem}} "drink" &gt; VL *{{IPA|/potsʲone/}} &gt; ''poison'' "poison"
|}

==== Palatalization ====
As described [[#Effect of palatalized consonants|above]], Late Vulgar Latin of the French area had an extensive series of [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonants that developed from numerous sources. The resulting sounds tended to eject a /j/ before and/or after them, forming diphthongs that later developed in complex ways.

Latin {{sc|e}} and {{sc|i}} in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] position (i.e., directly followed by another vowel) developed into /j/ in Vulgar Latin and then combined with the preceding consonant to form a [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] consonant. All consonants could be palatalized in this fashion. The resulting consonants developed as follows (sometimes developing differently when they became final as a result of early loss of the following vowel):

|}

{{sc|c}} followed by {{sc|e}} or {{sc|i}} developed into Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/tsʲ/}}, which was [[lenition|lenited]] to *{{IPA|/dzʲ/}} between vowels (later ''-is-''). The pronunciation {{IPA|/ts/}} was still present in Old French, but was subsequently simplified to {{IPA|/s/}}. Examples:
* {{sc|centum}} "hundred" &gt; ''cent''
* {{sc|placēre}} "to please" &gt; ''plaisir'' "pleasure"
* {{sc|pācem}} "peace" &gt; OF ''pais'' &gt; ''paix''

{{sc|g}} followed by {{sc|e}} or {{sc|i}} developed originally into Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|/j/}}, which subsequently became {{IPA|/dʒʲ/}} when not between vowels. The pronunciation {{IPA|/dʒ/}} was still present in Old French, but was subsequently simplified to {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. When between vowels, {{IPA|/j/}} often disappeared. Examples:
* {{sc|gentēs}} "people" &gt; ''gents'' &gt; ''gents''
* {{sc|rēgīna}} "queen" &gt; OF ''reïne'' &gt; ''reine''
* {{sc|quadrāgintā}} "forty" &gt; ''quarante''
* {{sc|legere}} "to read" &gt; pre-French */ljɛjrʲe/ &gt; ''lire''{{efn|See [[#Effect of palatalized consonants|above]].}}

{{sc|c}} and {{sc|g}} when followed by {{sc|a}} and not preceded by a vowel developed into {{IPA|/tʃʲ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒʲ/}}, respectively. The sounds {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} persisted into the Old French period but were subsequently simplified to {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʒ/}}. Examples:
* {{sc|carrum}} "chariot" &gt; ''char''
* {{sc|gambam}} "leg" &gt; ''jambe''
* {{sc|manicam}} "sleeve" &gt; */manka/ &gt; ''manche''
* {{sc|siccam}} "dry (fem.)" &gt; ''sèche''

In various consonant combinations involving {{sc|c}} or {{sc|g}} + another consonant, the {{sc|c}} or {{sc|g}} developed into /j/, which proceeded to palatalize the following consonant. Examples:
* {{sc|factum}} "done" &gt; ''fait''
* {{sc|laxāre}} "to release" &gt; OF ''laissier'' "to let" &gt; ''laisser''
* {{sc|vetulam}} "old" &gt; {{sc|veclam}} &gt; OF ''vieille''
* {{sc|articulum}} "joint" &gt; VL */arteklu/ &gt; ''orteil'' "toe"
* {{sc|vigilāre}} "to keep watch" &gt; OF ''veillier'' &gt; ''veiller''

In some cases, loss of an intertonic vowel led to a similar sequence of /j/ or palatalized consonant + another consonant, which was palatalized in turn. Examples:
* {{sc|medietātem}} "half" &gt; */mejjetate/ &gt; */mejtʲat/ &gt; ''moitié''
* {{sc|cōgitāre}} "to think" &gt;&gt; *{{sc|cūgitāre}} &gt; */kujetare/ &gt; Western Vulgar Latin */kujedare/ &gt; pre-French */kujdʲare/ &gt; OF ''cuidier'' &gt; ''cuider''
* *{{sc|mānsiōnātam}} "household" &gt; OF ''maisniée''
* *{{sc|impēiorāre}} "to worsen" &gt; OF ''empoirier''

====Changes to final consonants====
As a result of the pre-French loss of most final vowels, all consonants could potentially appear word-finally except for {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (which were always followed by at least a schwa, stemming from either a final {{IPA|/a/}} or a [[prop vowel]]). In [[Old French]], however, all underlying [[voiced consonant|voiced]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s and [[fricative]]s were pronounced [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] when word-final. This was clearly reflected in Old French spelling, e.g. the adjectives ''froit'' "cold" (feminine ''froide''), ''vif'' "lively" (feminine ''vive''), ''larc'' "large" (feminine ''large''), and similarly in verbs, e.g. ''je doif'' "I must" vs. ''ils doivent'' "they must", ''je lef'' "I may wash" vs. ''ils levent'' "they (may) wash". Most of these alternations have since disappeared (due partly to morphological reshaping and partly to respelling once most final consonants were lost, as described below), but the adjectival alternation ''vif'' vs. ''vive'' (and similarly for other adjectives in ''-f'') is still present.

Starting in the [[Middle French]] period, most final consonants were gradually lost. This proceeded in stages:
# Loss of final consonants when appearing before another word beginning with a consonant. This stage is preserved in the words ''six'' and ''dix'', pronounced {{IPA|/sis/ /dis/}} standing alone but {{IPA|/si/ /di/}} before a word beginning with a consonant and {{IPA|/siz/ /diz/}} before a word beginning with a vowel. If the word ended in a stressed vowel followed by /s/ (as, for example, in plurals), the same process apparently operated as elsewhere when an /s/ preceded a consonant, with a long vowel resulting. (This situation is still found, for example, in [[Jèrriais]], a dialect of the [[Norman language]], which preserves long vowels and where words ending in a vowel lengthen that vowel in the plural.)
# Loss of final consonants before a pause. This left a two-way pronunciation for most words, with final consonants pronounced before a following vowel-initial word but not elsewhere, and is the origin of the modern phenomenon of [[Liaison (French)|liaison]].
# Loss of final consonants in all circumstances. This process is still ongoing, causing a gradual loss of liaison, especially in informal speech, except in certain limited contexts and fixed expressions.

The final consonants normally subject to loss are {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, sometimes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, rarely {{IPA|/f/}} (e.g. in ''clé'' &lt; earlier and still occasional ''clef''). The consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ʎ/}} were normally preserved, while {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} did not occur (nor did the voiced obstruents {{IPA|/d z b g v ʒ/}}). A more recent countervailing tendency, however, is the restoration of some formerly lost final consonants, as in ''sens'', now pronounced {{IPA|/sɑ̃s/}} but formerly {{IPA|/sɑ̃/}}, as still found in the expressions ''sens dessus dessous'' "upside down" and ''sens devant derrière'' "back to front". The restored consonant may stem either from the liaison pronunciation or the spelling and serves to reduce ambiguity: for example, {{IPA|/sɑ̃/}} is also the pronunciation of ''cent'' "hundred", ''sang'' "blood" and ''sans'' "without" (among others).

==Effect of substrate and superstrate languages==
{{Original research|date=October 2012}}
{{Main article|French grammar}}
French is noticeably different from most other Romance languages. Some of the changes have been attributed to [[substratum|substrate]] influence – i.e., to carry-over effects from Gaulish (Celtic) or [[superstratum|superstrate]] influence from Frankish (Germanic). In practice, it is difficult to say with confidence which sound and grammar changes were due to substrate and superstrate influences, since many of the changes in French have parallels in other Romance languages, or are changes commonly undergone by many languages in the process of development. However, the following are likely candidates.

In [[phonology]]:

* The reintroduction of the consonant {{IPA|/h/}} at the beginning of a word is due to Frankish influence, and mostly occurs in words borrowed from Germanic.  This sound no longer exists in Standard Modern French (it survives dialectally, particularly in the regions of Normandy, Picardy, Wallonia, and Louisiana); however a Germanic ''h'' usually disallows [[Liaison (French)|liaison]]: ''les halles'' {{IPA|/le.al/}}, ''les haies'' {{IPA|/le.ɛ/}}, ''les haltes'' {{IPA|/le.alt/}}, whereas a Latin ''h'' allows liaison: ''les herbes'' {{IPA|/lezɛrb/}}, ''les hôtels'' {{IPA|/lezotɛl/}}.
* The reintroduction of {{IPA|/w/}} in Northern Norman, [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Champenois]], [[Burgundian language (Oïl)|Bourguignon]] and [[Lower Lorraine|Bas-Lorrain]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Allières, ''La formation du Français'', P. U. F.&lt;/ref&gt; is due to Germanic influence. All Romance languages have borrowed Germanic words containing {{IPA|/w/}}, but all languages south of the isogloss – including the ancestor of Modern French ("Central French") – converted this to {{IPA|/ɡw/}}, which usually developed subsequently into {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. English borrowed words both from Norman French (1066 – c. 1200 AD) and Standard French (c. 1200–1400 AD), which sometimes results in doublets such as ''warranty'' and ''guarantee''.
* The occurrence of an extremely strong stress accent, leading to loss of unstressed vowels and extensive modification of stressed vowels (diphthongization), is likely to be due to Frankish influence, and possibly to Celtic influence, as both languages had a strong initial stress (e.&amp;nbsp;g., tela -&gt; TEla -&gt; toile)&lt;ref&gt;Cerquiglini, Bernard. ''Une langue orpheline'', Éd. de Minuit, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt; This feature also no longer exists in Modern French.  However, its influence remains in the uniform final word stress in Modern French – due to the strong stress, all vowels following the stress were ultimately lost.
* Nasalization resulting from compensatory vowel lengthening in stressed syllables due to Germanic and/or Celtic stress accent. Among Romance languages, it occurs primarily in French, Occitan, Arpitan and Portuguese, all with possible Celtic substratums. However scattered dialects of Romance languages, including Sardinian, Spanish and Lombard, also have the phenomenon as an allophonic (though not phonemic) property. Among the four Romance languages where it is prominent beyond divergent dialects, the only one for which it is undebatably phonemic is French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Posner|title=The Romance Languages|pages= 24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The development of front-rounded vowels {{IPA|/y/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, and {{IPA|/œ/}} may be due to Germanic influence, as few Romance languages outside of French have such vowels; however, ''all'' Gallo-Romance languages have them and also share a Germanic influence. At least one sound, {{IPA|/y/}}, exists in today's Celtic languages. A number of other scholars, most famously including Romance linguist Ascoli, have attributed it to the Celtic substratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craddock, Jerry Russell|title=Latin Legacy Versus Substratum Residue|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of the sounds to Celtic influence actually predates the emergence of academic linguistics as early as the 1500s, when it was attested as being called "Gaulish u". Among Romance languages, its distribution strongly correspondent with areas of suspected Celtic substratum: French, Arpitan, Occitan, Romansch and Gallo-Italic dialects, along with some dialects of Portuguese. The change may have occurred around the same time as a similar fronting of long [u] to [y] in the [[Brythonic languages|British Celtic languages]]. On the other hand, there are scholars such as Posner and Meyer-Lübke who, while acknowledging the possibility of Celtic influence, see the development as internally motivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pope, M.K.| title=From Latin to Modern French|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posner. ''Linguistic Change in French''. 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (see above) may be due to Celtic influence: A similar change happened in Celtic languages at about the same time, and the demarcation between Romance dialects with and without this change (the [[La Spezia–Rimini Line]]) corresponds closely to the limit of Celtic settlement in ancient Rome. The lenition also affected later words borrowed from Germanic (e.g. ''haïr'' &lt; ''hadir'' &lt; ''*hatjan''; ''flan'' &lt; *''fladon''; ''(cor)royer'' &lt; *''(ga)rēdan''; etc.), suggesting that the tendency persisted for some time after it was introduced.
* The devoicing of word final voiced consonants in Old French is due to Germanic influence (e.g. ''grant/grande, blont/blonde, bastart/bastarde'').

In other areas:
* Various words may have shifted gender under the influence from words either of the same meaning or similar sound in Gaulish, as a result of the Celtic substrate. A connectionist model predicting shifts in gender assignment for common nouns more accurately predicted historical developments when the Gaulish genders of the same words were considered in the model.  Additionally the loss of the neuter may have been accelerated in French because Gaulish neuters were very hard to distinguish and possibly lost earlier than Latin neuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Maria Polinsky and Ezra Van Everbroeck|title=Develop of Gender Classifications: Modeling the Historical Change from Latin to French|journal=Language|volume=79|number=2|date=June 2003| pages= 365–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, Romanian retains the neuter gender and Italian retains it for a couple words; Portuguese, Sardinian, Catalan, and Spanish also retain remnants of the neuter outside of nouns in demonstrative pronouns and the like though they have lost it for nouns. 
* The development of [[V2 word order|verb-second]] syntax in Old French (where the verb must come in second position in a sentence, regardless of whether the subject precedes or follows) is probably due to Germanic influence.
* The first person plural ending ''-ons'' (Old French ''-omes'', ''-umes'') is likely derived from the Frankish termination ''-ōmês'', ''-umês'' (vs. Latin ''-āmus'', ''-ēmus'', ''-imus'', and ''-īmus''; cf. OHG ''-ōmēs'', ''-umēs'').&lt;ref&gt;Pope, From Latin to modern French, with especial consideration of Anglo-Norman, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of the letter ''k'' in Old French, which was replaced by ''c'' and ''qu'' during the Renaissance, was due to Germanic influence. Typically, ''k'' was not used in written Latin and other Romance languages. Similarly, use of ''w'' and ''y'' was also diminished.
* The impersonal pronoun ''on'' "one, you, they" but more commonly replacing ''nous'' "we" (or "us") in colloquial French (first person plural pronoun, see [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]]) – from Old French ''(h)om'', a reduced form of ''homme'' "man" is a [[calque]] of the Germanic impersonal pronoun ''man'' "one, you, they" reduced form of ''mann'' "man" (cf Old English ''man'' "one, you, they", from ''mann'' "man"; German ''man'' "one, you, they" vs. ''Mann'' "man").
* The expanded use of ''avoir'' "to have" over the more customary use of ''tenir'' "to have, hold" seen in other Romance languages is likely to be due to influence from the Germanic word for "have", which has a similar form (cf. Frankish *''habēn'', Gothic ''haban'', Old Norse ''hafa'', English ''have'').
* The increased use of [[auxiliary verb]]al tenses, especially [[passé composé]], is probably due to Germanic influence. Unknown in Classical Latin, the passé composé begins to appear in Old French in the early 13th century after the Germanic and the Viking invasions. Its construction is identical to the one seen in all other Germanic languages at that time and before: "verb "be" (''être'') + past participle" when there is movement, indication of state, or change of condition; and ""have" (''avoir'') + past participle" for all other verbs. Passé composé is not universal to the Romance language family – only Romance languages known to have Germanic superstrata display this type of construction, and in varying degrees (those nearest to Germanic areas show constructions most similar to those seen in Germanic). Italian, Spanish and Catalan are other Romance languages employing this type of compound verbal tense.
* The heightened frequency of ''si'' ("so") in Old French correlates to [[Old High German]] ''so'' and ''thanne''
* The tendency in Old French to use adverbs to complete the meaning of a verb, as in ''lever sur'' ("raise up"), ''monter en amont'' ("mount up"), ''aller avec'' ("go along/go with"), ''traire avant'' ("draw forward"), etc. is likely to be of Germanic origin
* The lack of a future tense in conditional clauses is likely due to Germanic influence.
* {{citation needed span|text=The reintroduction of a [[vigesimal]] system of counting by increments of 20 (e.g. ''soixante-dix'' "70" lit. "sixty-ten"; ''quatre-vingts'' "80" lit. "four-twenties"; ''quatre-vingt-dix'' "90" lit. "four-twenty-ten") is due to [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] influence, first appearing in Normandy, in northern France. From there, it spread south after the formation of the French Republic, replacing the typical Romance forms still used today in Belgian and Swiss French. The current vigesimal system was introduced by the Vikings and adopted by the Normans who popularised its use (compare Danish ''tresindstyve'', literally 3 times 20, or 60; English ''four score and seven'' for 87).|date=February 2011}} Pre-Roman Celtic languages in Gaul also made use of a vigesimal system, but this system largely vanished early in French linguistic history or became severely marginalised in its range. The Nordic vigesimal system may possibly derive ultimately from the Celtic. Old French also had ''treis vingts'', ''cinq vingts'' (compare Welsh ''ugain'' "20", ''deugain'' "40", ''pedwar ugain'' "80", lit. "four-twenties").

Among other works he wrote:
*''Vida del Brigadier General José Gervasio Artigas fundador de la Nacionalidad Oriental'' (1860)
*''[http://www.archivodeprensa.edu.uy/biblioteca/isidoro_de_maria/textos/bibliografia/montevideo_antiguo_1.pdf Tradiciones y recuerdos. Montevideo antiguo]'', four volumes published between 1887 and 1895
*''Compendio de la Historia de la República Oriental del Uruguay'' (editor).

The '''Jewish Women's Archive''' (JWA) is a national [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to document "Jewish women's stories, elevate their voices, and inspire them to be agents of change."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/aboutjwa|title=Welcome to the Jewish Women’s Archive! {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JWA was founded by Gail Twersky Reimer in 1995 in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]] with the goal of using the [[Internet]] to increase awareness of and provide access to the stories of American Jewish women. JWA makes a growing collection of information, exhibits, and resources available via its website. Its activities include the conception, production and dissemination of:
	
:* Community-based [[oral history]] projects
:* Online exhibitions
:* Original academic research
:* Educational materials including [[curricula]], a poster series and an [[oral history]] guide
:* [[Training Institutes]] for educators working in formal and [[Informal education|informal]] settings
:* [[Documentary film]]

L2R: JWA Founding Director Gail Reimer; Pogrebin; ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' co-founder and Award presenter [[Gloria Steinem]]. Photo: Joan Roth]] Starting in 2010, JWA also began holding an Annual Luncheon in New York City at which it honors three women for their activism and achievements. In 2010 the focus was on the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire|Triangle Fire]] (2010 was the centenary of that tragedy). Honorees included Ruth J. Abram (co-founder of the [[Lower East Side Tenement Museum|Tenement Museum]]), Kate Frucher (attorney and entrepreneur), and journalist [[Lynn Sherr]]. In 2011 the luncheon was titled "Making Trouble / Making History." [[Gloria Steinem]] presented the awards, which were given to Elizabeth A. Sackler (The [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art|Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum]]), [[Rebecca Traister]] (author, ''[[Big Girls Don't Cry (book)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]'', journalist), and [[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]] (author, "Deborah, Golda, and Me," etc., journalist, founding editor, [[Ms. Magazine|"Ms magazine"]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.forward.com/sisterhood-blog/153385/seeing-beauty-in-making-trouble/ |title=Seeing Beauty in 'Making Trouble' |publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major programs and projects==

===Curricula and educational resources===
JWA's most recent curriculum, Living the Legacy, focuses on the role of Jewish women in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and [[labor movement]], seeking to highlight their often-neglected but central role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.jpost.com/content/jewish-womens-archive-launches-cutting-edge-living-legacy-civil-rights-curriculum |title=Jewish Women's Archive launches cutting edge Living the Legacy Civil Rights curriculum &amp;#124; Jerusalem Post - Blogs |publisher=Blogs.jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125233540/http://blogs.jpost.com/content/jewish-womens-archive-launches-cutting-edge-living-legacy-civil-rights-curriculum |archivedate=2010-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional educational resources include 18 "Go &amp; Learn" lesson plans, book and film guides, primary source materials and mother-daughter workshop materials. Previous curricula include Making Our Wilderness Bloom.

===Online encyclopedia===
''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia'', edited by [[Paula Hyman]] and Dalia Ofer, is accessible for free via JWA's website. The encyclopedia features approximately 2,000 articles on the lives and achievements of Jewish women.  Articles are also disseminated via [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/blogs/jewish_techs/tweeting_encyclopedia |title=Tweeting the Encyclopedia |publisher=The Jewish Week |date= |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 2007 JWA produced ''Making Trouble'', a documentary film about three generations of female Jewish comedians and the complexity and challenges of their relationship to comedy, Judaism and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061502289_2.html |title=At Silverdocs, Proud of Their Laugh Lines |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-06-15 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film profiles [[Molly Picon]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Gilda Radner]], and [[Wendy Wasserstein]] as well as contemporary comedians [[Judy Gold]] and [[Jackie Hoffman]].

She is a Professor Emerita in the School of Social Science in the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

Among her publications was the article "[[Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis]]", published in 1986 in the ''[[American Historical Review]].'' This article, "undoubtedly one of the most widely read and cited articles in the journal's history",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2008/0812/0812new5.cfm Robert A. Schneider, American Historical Association, December 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; was foundational in the formation of a field of [[gender history]] within the Anglo-American historical profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S33/89/04A10/index.xml?section=topstories Biographical note, "Princeton awards six honorary degrees", June 5, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She was born Joan Wallach in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Lottie (''née'' Tannenbaum) and Sam Wallach, high school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4776/Scott-Joan-Wallach-1941.html "Wallach Scott, Joan (1941– ). French Social History, History of Gender".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XJSdT_4NWTMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=Joan+Wallach+Scott+1941&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SGJdjOa9SV&amp;sig=vo2YoOLJ5fRYU7BldgnegUDEc4U&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y Jennifer Scanlon, Shaaron Cosner, ''American Women Historians, 1700s-1990s: A Biographical Dictionary'', Greenwood Press, 1996, p. 201.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Before joining the Institute for Advanced Study, Scott taught in history departments at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], [[Northwestern University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and [[Brown University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Joan Wallach Scott {{!}} School of Social Science|url = https://www.sss.ias.edu/faculty/scott|website = www.sss.ias.edu|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Brown University]] she was founding director of the [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women]], and the Nancy Duke Lewis University Professor and professor of history. Scott has written that it was during her time at the Pembroke Center that she first started "to think about theory and gender".&lt;ref name="HM276"&gt;Hughes-Warrington, Marnie. ''Fifty Key Thinkers On History'', London: Routledge (2000), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; She serves on the editorial boards of ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', ''[[Differences (journal)|Differences]]'', ''History and Theory'', ''Redescriptions'' and, since January 2006, the ''[[Journal of Modern History]]''. In 2010, she helped to found ''History of the Present: A Journal of Critical History''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofthepresent.org/ ''History of the Present''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott has also played a major role in the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/pubsres/academe/2005/SO/Feat/scot.htm Joan Wallach Scott on Academic Freedom.]&lt;/ref&gt; as the chair of its Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/2011/03/11/scott-lecture "The Politics of Academic Freedom is the Subject of Joan Wallach Scott's Lecture at the Institute for Advanced Study", Institute for Advanced Study, March 11, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Scott's work has challenged the foundations of conventional historical practice, including the nature of historical evidence and historical experience and the role of narrative in the writing of history. Drawing on a range of philosophical thought, as well as on a rethinking of her own training as a labor historian, she has contributed to a transformation of the field of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/scott/ "Joan W. Scott", Stanford Presidential Lectures in the Humanities and Arts.]&lt;/ref&gt; Her current work focuses on the vexed relationship of the particularity of gender to the universalizing force of democratic politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/honorary-degrees-awarded-at-commencement%E2%80%99s-morning-exercises/ Harvard Honorary Degree Profile of Joan Wallach Scott.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott's work has been mostly concerned with modern French history and with the history of gender.

Reflecting her interest in European working class history, in 1980 Scott co-wrote with the British historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] in an article in ''Past and Present'' entitled "Political Shoemakers".

In her 1986 article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis", Scott argued that studying gender not only explains women's history, but all history as well.

Taking her own advice, Scott has sought to write such "gendered" histories in her books ''Gender and the Politics of History'' and ''Only Paradoxes to Offer: French Feminists and the Rights of Men''.&lt;ref name=HW280&gt;Hughes-Warrington (2000), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1988 book ''Gender and the Politics of History'', Scott expanded upon the themes she had introduced in "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis" to argue that gender was the "knowledge of sexual differences".&lt;ref name=Jackson1075&gt;Jackson, Louise Ainsley "Scott, Joan Wallach", pp. 1075-1076 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn (1999), p. 1075.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Foucault, she adopted his definition of "knowledge" as "the understanding produced by cultures and societies of human relationships".&lt;ref name=Jackson1075/&gt;

In addition to her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis", Scott has published several books, which are widely reprinted and have been translated into several languages, including French, Japanese, Portuguese, and Korean.  Her publications include ''The Glassworkers of Carmaux: French Craftsmen and Political Action in a Nineteenth Century City'' (Harvard University Press, 1974); ''Women, Work and Family'' (coauthored with Louise Tilly) (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1978); ''Gender and the Politics of History'' (Columbia University Press, 1988); ''Only Paradoxes to Offer: French Feminists and the Rights of Man'' (Harvard University Press, 1996); ''Parité: Sexual Difference and the Crisis of French Universalism'' (University of Chicago Press, 2005) and ''The Politics of the Veil'' (Princeton University Press, 2007). Scott has also edited numerous other books and published countless articles. She is also one of the founding editors of the journal ''History of the Present''.

==Awards and honors==

She has received various awards, accolades, and honorary degrees for her work, including the [[American Historical Association]]'s Herbert Baxter Adams Prize, the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize, the Hans Sigrist Award for Outstanding Research in Gender Studies, and the [[Nancy Lyman Roelker Prize]] of the AHA for graduate mentorship. She holds honorary degrees from Brown University, SUNY Stony Brook, The University of Bergen (Norway), Harvard University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/honorary-degree-recipients-and-citations-2007/ Honorary Degree Recipients 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/facts/honorary/ "Honorary Degrees Awarded by Princeton".]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Concordia University]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2016/05/04/concordia-awards-9-new-honorary-doctorates-spring-convocation-2016.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/graduations/honorary/future-honorary-grads|title=Honorary Graduates in 2018|work=The University of Edinburgh|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==

Scott's influence within the Academy has been extensive. She has played an influential role in establishing the careers of a number of prominent academics, winning the prestigious [[Nancy Lyman Roelker Mentorship Award]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/prizes/awarded/RoelkerWinner.htm Past Recipients - Nancy Lyman Roelker Mentorship Award.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the students who completed their dissertations under Scott's supervision are [[Leora Auslander]] at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Mary Louise Roberts (historian)|Mary Louise Roberts]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and [[Dagmar Herzog]] at the [[City University of New York]]. The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University annually awards the Joan Wallach Scott Prize for an outstanding honors thesis in Gender and Sexuality Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Pembroke_Center/instruction/prizes.html Joan Wallach Scott Prize.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Previously married to Donald Scott, a professor of American history at CUNY, she is the mother of [[A. O. Scott]], a film critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the artist Lizzie Scott. She is the niece of actor [[Eli Wallach]] (her father was Eli's brother).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hM4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=wallach+%22a.+o.+scott&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oRXQiciszN&amp;sig=FsM9L7Ih6uJPF7VSuyvGT-91c68&amp;hl=ru&amp;ei=EAhSS5fDDYTc-QampsjVCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wallach%20%22a.%20o.%20scott&amp;f=false "Eli Wallach, BA '36", ''Texas Alcalde'', March/April 2000, p. 28.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3961">'''José Hipólito Raposo''' (13 February 1885 in [[Castelo Branco Municipality|São Vicente da Beira]] &amp;ndash; 26 August 1953) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] politician, writer, lawyer and historian.

==Integralism==
He was educated at the [[University of Coimbra]] before taking up practice as a lawyer.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Part of a [[conservatism|conservative]] [[monarchism|monarchist]] group active within the intelligetsia at the time in 1911 he took a trip to [[Paris]] with his friend [[Alberto Monsaraz]] and whilst there they established contact with ''[[Action Française]]'' with whom they shared many aims.&lt;ref name="Costa"&gt;Antonio Costa Pinto, '[http://analisesocial.ics.ul.pt/documentos/1223461249Q5oNF3qf0Ky91XX0.pdf A formaçãodo integralismo lusitano (1907-17)]'&lt;/ref&gt; He joined with Monsaraz, [[António Sardinha]], [[João do Amaral]] and [[José Adriano Pequito Rebelo]] in relaunching the monarchist journal ''A Nação Portuguesa'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Costa"/&gt; From this basis he became the founder of [[Integralismo Lusitano]] that same year along with Monsaraz and Sardinha.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Klobucka, ''The Portuguese Nun: Formation of a National Myth'', 2000, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Raposo became known as one of the main ideologues of the new group and as a theorist he had a deep influence on [[Plínio Salgado]] who frequently referenced his works.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin &amp; Matthew Feldman, ''Fascism: The "Fascist Epoch"'', 2004, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fascism==
In the early 1920s Raposo also became close to a minor group known as ''Cruzada Non'Alvares'', which was the first group in Portugal to openly endorse [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian fascism]].&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; Like others in the Integralist movement Raposo also keenly watched the development [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista]] but, although he personally had some sympathies towards the cause of [[national syndicalism]], he did not follow the likes of Monsaraz in switching to the new movement.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt; However despite his flirtations with [[fascism]] Raposo, unlike Sardinha, had no truck with the racialist theories associated with [[Nazism]] and similar ideologies and indeed considered the Black African populations of colonies such as [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to be as much Portuguese as himself.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt;

==Later years==
His influence faded following the emergence of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] and his final attempt to push the integralist line, by launching a journal entitled ''Integralismo Lusitano'' with [[Luís de Almeida Braga]] in 1932 was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', 1990, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Having initially been ambivalent in his attitudes towards Salazar, Raposo decided in 1940 that the dictator was ruining Portugal and published a book, ''Amar e Servir'', in which he savaged the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' founder.&lt;ref name="Rees"/&gt;

==Writing==
His 1947 book ''Dona Luísa de Gusmão, duquesa e rainha (1613-1666)'' is still recognised as the standard biography of [[Luisa of Medina-Sidonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dauril Alden, ''The Making of an Enterprise: The Society of Jesus in Portugal'', 1996, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; As a writer he also published [[poetry]], theatre criticism, fiction and essays on the academic traditions of Coimbra University.&lt;ref name="Costa"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">'''Lambert of St-Bertin''' was a French Benedictine chronicler and abbot.

==Biography==
Lambert was born about 1060 of a distinguished family, and, when still young, entered the French [[Benedictine]] [[abbey of St-Bertin]]. He afterwards visited several famous schools in France, having first laid the foundation of his subsequent learning by the study in his own monastery of grammar, theology and music. For some time he filled the office of [[prior]], and in 1095 was chosen [[abbot]] at once by the monks of St-Bertin and by the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of [[St-Omer]]. He was thus drawn into closer relations with [[Cluny]], and instituted through the Cluniac monks many reforms in his somewhat deteriorated monastery. Needless to say, he encountered no little opposition to his efforts, but, thanks to his extraordinary energy, he finally secured acceptance for his views, and rehabilitated the financial position of the monastery. He was a friend of [[St. Anselm]] and exchanged verses, still extant, with the poet [[Reginald of Canterbury]] (ed. Libermann in "Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere Geschichte", XIII, 1888, pp.&amp;nbsp;528; 531-34).  He died on 22 June 1125, at St-Bertin.

==Works==
Even during his lifetime, Lambert was lauded in glowing terms for his great learning by an admirer —not a monk of St-Bertin— in the "Tractatus de moribus Lamberti Abbatis S. Beretini" (ed. Holder-Egger in "[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|Monumenta German. Histor.]] SS.", XV, 2, 946-53). This work mentions several otherwise unknown writings of Lambert, e.g. "Sermones de Vetere Testamento", also studies on [[free will]], the [[Divine prescience]], [[original sin]], origin of the [[soul]] and questions of physical science.
 
Although the two are often confused, he is not identical with [[Lambert of St. Omer|Lambert, the Canon of St. Omer]] who wrote the famous "[[Liber Floridus]]", a kind of encyclopedia of Biblical, chronological, astronomical, geographical, theological, philosophical and natural history subjects, which was completed in 1120.

'''Late modernity''' (or '''liquid modernity''') is the characterization of today's highly developed global [[society|societies]] as the continuation (or [[social development|development]]) of [[modernity]] rather than as an element of the succeeding era known as [[postmodernity]], or the postmodern.

Introduced as 'liquid' modernity by the Polish-British sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]], late modernity is marked by the [[Globalization|global]] capitalist economies with their increasing privatisation of services and by the [[information revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Harris, ''Future Girl'' (2004) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus postmodernity==
[[Social theory|Social theorists]] and [[sociologists]] such as [[Scott Lash]], [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] maintain (against [[postmodernity|postmodernists]]) that modernization continues into the contemporary era, which is thus better conceived as a radical state of late modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Cools et al., ''Safety, Societal Problems and Citizens' Perceptions'' (2010) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; On [[technological change|technological]] and [[social change]]s since the 1960s, the concept of "late modernity" proposes that contemporary societies are a clear continuation of [[modernity|modern]] institutional transitions and cultural developments. Such authors talk about a [[reflexive modernization]] process: in Giddens' words, "social practices are constantly examined and reformed in the light of incoming information about those very practices, thus constitutively altering their character".&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernsocieties.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/seminar-two-classical-modernity-late-modernity/ Giddens, in "Classical modernity and late modernity"] (1990) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity now tends to be self-referring, instead of being defined largely in opposition to traditionalism, as with classical modernity.

Anthony Giddens does not dispute that important changes have occurred since "high" modernity, but he argues that we have not truly abandoned modernity. Rather, the modernity of contemporary society is a developed, radicalized, 'late' modernity—but still modernity, not postmodernity. In such a perspective, postmodernism appears only as a hyper-technological version of modernity.&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi et al., ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 126 and p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
The subject is constructed in late modernity against the backdrop of a fragmented world of competing and contrasting identities&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Craik, ''The Face of Fashion'' (London 1994) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and life-style cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The framing matrix of the late modern personality is the ambiguous way the fluid social relations of late modernity impinge on the individual, producing a reflexive and multiple self.&lt;ref&gt;John Mandalios, ''Civilization and the Human Subject'' (1999) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid modernity==
Zygmunt Bauman, who introduced the idea of liquid modernity, wrote that its characteristics are about the individual, namely increasing feelings of uncertainty and the privatization of [[ambivalence]]. It is a kind of chaotic continuation of modernity, where a person can shift from one social position to another in a fluid manner. Nomadism becomes a general trait of the 'liquid modern' man as he flows through his own life like a tourist, changing places, jobs, spouses, values and sometimes more{{mdash}}such as political or sexual orientation{{mdash}}excluding himself from traditional networks of support, while also freeing himself from the restrictions or requirements those networks impose.

Bauman stressed the new burden of responsibility that fluid modernism placed on the individual{{mdash}}traditional patterns would be replaced by self-chosen ones.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt Bauman, ''Liquid Modernity'' (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Entry into the globalized society was open to anyone with their own stance and the ability to fund it, in a similar way as was the reception of travellers at the old-fashioned [[caravanserai]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a normative mindset with emphasis on shifting rather than on staying{{mdash}}on provisional in lieu of permanent (or 'solid') commitment{{mdash}}which (the new style) can lead a person astray towards a prison of their own [[existential]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Brown, in Neil Corcoran ed, ''Do you, Mr Jones?'' (London 2002) p. 196 and p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronology of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] is usually divided into the following eras:

==Five Stage Classification==

One of the most enduring classifications of archaeological periods &amp; cultures was established in [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]]' 1958 book ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology.'' They divided the archaeological record in the Americas into 5 phases. These are:

*The [[Lithic stage]]
*The [[Archaic stage]]
*The [[Formative stage]]
*The [[Classic stage]]
*The [[Post-Classic stage]]

'''Marcin Bielski''' (or ''Wolski''; 1495 – 18 December 1575) was a [[Poland|Polish]] soldier, historian, [[chronicler]], [[renaissance]] [[satire|satirical]] poet, writer and translator. His son, {{ill|Joachim Bielski|pl|}}, [[royal secretary]] to king [[Sigismund III Vasa]], was also a historian and poet. He was born of noble parentage on the patrimonial estate of [[Biała, Pajęczno County|Biała]] (whence the family name), [[Pajęczno County]], in the Polish province of [[Sieradz]]. His alternate surname ''Wolski'' derives from his estate at Wola. One of two Polish writers of the same name, he was the first to use the Polish language, hence his designation as the father of Polish [[prose]].

==Life==
Bielski was educated at the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]], founded by [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] in 1364, and spent some time with the military governor of that city. He served in the army in the wars against the [[Wallachia]]ns and [[Tatars]], and participated in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] ([[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) in 1531.

He was the author of several works, including:
*''Zywoty Filosofow'' (Lives of the Philosophers, 1535)
*''Kronika Swiata'' (Universal Chronicle, 1550–64), from the earliest time down to his day, divided into six periods. This was the first important [[universal history]] published in the national idiom, and the first attempt at a comprehensive history of Poland, from 550 to 1580; in the second edition (1554) there is a reference to America. After the author's death the work was continued, rearranged, and brought down to the year 1597, under the title of ''Kronika Polska'' (''Chronicle of Poland''; [[:pl:Kronika polska Marcina Bielskiego nowo wydana|pl]]) by his son Joachim (b. 1540; d. 1599), secretary to King [[Sigismund III]]
*''Sprawa Rycerskiego'', a treatise on military art (1569), according to the Greek science of warfare, in eight parts. It contains valuable data about the Polish army and kindred subjects.

After Bielski's death, several satirical poems by him were published:
*''Seym Majowy'' (The May Diet, 1590), descriptive of the degradation of Hungary, and an appeal to his countrymen to emulate a higher standard of life
*''Seym Niewiesci'', (Woman's Council, 1586–95), analytical of the then existing political conditions in Poland
*''Sen Maiowy'' (Dream of a Hermit, 1586)
*''Komedia Justina y Konstanciey'' (Comedy of Justinian and Constantia, 1557)

{{one source|date=December 2010}}
'''Martin Grene''' (1616–1667), was an English Jesuit.

Grene, son of [[George Grene]], probably a member of one of the Yorkshire families of the name, by his wife Jane Tempest, is said by [[Nathaniel Bacon (Jesuit)|Southwell]] to have been born in 1616 at Kilkenny in Ireland, to which country his parents had retired from their native land on account of the persecution; but the provincial's returns of 1642 and 1655 expressly vouch for his being a native of Kent. He was the elder brother of [[Christopher Grene]]. After studying humanities in the [[college of the English Jesuits at St. Omer]], he was admitted to the society in 1638. In 1642 he was a professor in the college at [[Liège|Liege]], and he held important offices in other establishments belonging to the English Jesuits on the continent.

In 1653 he was stationed in Oxfordshire. He was solemnly professed of the four vows on 3 December 1654. After passing twelve years on the mission he was recalled to [[Watten, Nord|Watten]], near [[Saint-Omer]], to take charge of the novices. He died there on 2 October 1667, leaving behind him the reputation of an eminent classic, historian, philosopher, and divine.

His works are: 
*‘An Answer to the Provincial Letters published by the Jansenists, under the name of Lewis Montalt, against the Doctrine of the Jesuits and School Divines,’ Paris, 1659, 8vo. A translation from the French, but with considerable improvements of his own, and with a brief history of Jansenism prefixed. *‘An Account of the Jesuites Life and Doctrine. By M. G.,’ London, 1661, 12mo. This book was a great favourite with the Duke of York, afterwards James II.
*‘Vox Veritatis, seu Via Regia ducens ad veram Pacem,’ manuscript. This treatise was translated into English by his brother, Francis Grene, and printed at Ghent, 1676, 24mo.
*‘The Church History of England,’ manuscript, commencing with the reign of Henry VIII. The first volume of this work was ready for the press when the author died. Grene, who was an accomplished antiquary, communicated to Father Daniello Bartoli much information respecting English catholic affairs, which is embodied in Bartoli's ‘Istoria della Compagnia di Giesu: L'Inghilterra,’ 1667.

Rawandi was from a scholarly family and studied [[Hanafi]] fikh in [[Hamadan|Hamadhan]] from 1174 to 1184.&lt;ref name="Hillenbrand460" /&gt; As a calligrapher, Rawandi was brought to court to craft a ''[[Quran]]'' for [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Toghrul III]] and gained the sultan's favor. After Toghrul's incarceration, Rawandi gained the patronage of Shihab al-Din al-Kashani, who urged him to write the ''Rahat al-sudur''. Rawandi had intended to dedicate his book to [[Süleymanshah II]], but dedicated it to [[Kaykhusraw I]], following the latter's accession as [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kaykhusraw'', Claude Cahen, ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. IV, ed. E. Van Donzel, B. Lewis and CH. Pellat, (Brill, 1997), 816.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the ''Rahat al-sudur'' was translated into Turkish during the reign of [[Murad II]].

==Modern era==
In 1921, the ''Rahat al-sudur'' was published by Muhammad Iqbal.&lt;ref name="Luther15"&gt;''The History of the Seljuq Turks: from the Jāmi al-Tawārīkh : an Ilkhanid Adaptation of the Saljuq nama'', Transl.

#'''[[Voluntary Human Extinction]]''', which seeks a "posthuman future" that in this case is a future ''without humans''.

==Philosophical posthumanism==
Philosopher Ted Schatzki suggests there are two varieties of posthumanism of the philosophical kind:&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"&gt;Schatzki, T.R. 2001.  Introduction: Practice theory, in ''The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory'' eds. Theodore R.Schatzki, Karin Knorr Cetina &amp; Eike Von Savigny. pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

One, which he calls 'objectivism', tries to counter the overemphasis of the subjective or intersubjective that pervades humanism, and emphasises the role of the nonhuman agents, whether they be animals and plants, or computers or other things.&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"/&gt;

A second prioritizes practices, especially social practices, over individuals (or individual subjects) which, they say, constitute the individual.&lt;ref name="ref-schatzki"/&gt;

There may be a third kind of posthumanism, propounded by the philosopher [[Herman Dooyeweerd]].  Though he did not label it as 'posthumanism', he made an extensive and penetrating immanent critique of Humanism, and then constructed a philosophy that presupposed neither Humanist, nor Scholastic, nor Greek thought but started with a different [[religious ground motive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dooy.info/ground.motives.html | title=Ground Motives - the Dooyeweerd Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dooyeweerd prioritized law and meaningfulness as that which enables humanity and all else to exist, behave, live, occur, etc.  "''Meaning'' is the ''being'' of all that has been ''created''," Dooyeweerd wrote, "and the nature even of our selfhood."&lt;ref name="dy-nc"&gt;
Dooyeweerd, H. (1955/1984). A new critique of theoretical thought (Vol. 1). Jordan Station, Ontario, Canada: Paideia Press. P. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Both human and nonhuman alike function subject to a common 'law-side', which is diverse, composed of a number of distinct law-spheres or ''aspects''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dooy.info/2sides.html 'law-side']&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal being of both human and non-human is multi-aspectual; for example, both plants and humans are bodies, functioning in the biotic aspect, and both computers and humans function in the formative and lingual aspect, but humans function in the aesthetic, juridical, ethical and faith aspects too.  The Dooyeweerdian version is able to incorporate and integrate both the objectivist version and the practices version, because it allows nonhuman agents their own subject-functioning in various aspects and places emphasis on aspectual functioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dooy.info/subject.object.html his radical notion of subject-object relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of philosophical posthumanism==
[[Ihab Hassan]], theorist in the [[literary theory|academic study of literature]], once stated:

{{quote|Humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something one must helplessly call posthumanism.&lt;ref name="Hassan 1977"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Ihab Hassan|Hassan, Ihab]] | editor = Michel Benamou, Charles Caramello | title = Performance in Postmodern Culture | publisher = Coda Press | location = Madison, Wisconsin | year = 1977 | chapter = Prometheus as Performer: Toward a Postmodern Culture? | isbn = 978-0-930956-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view predates most currents of posthumanism which have developed over the late 20th century in somewhat diverse, but complementary, domains of thought and practice. For example, Hassan is a known scholar whose theoretical writings expressly address [[postmodernity]] in [[society]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Beyond [[postmodernist]] studies, posthumanism has been developed and deployed by various cultural theorists, often in reaction to problematic inherent assumptions within [[humanistic]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] thought.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;

Theorists who both complement and contrast Hassan include [[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Cybernetics|cyberneticists]] such as [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Warren McCullouch]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Cary Wolfe]], [[Elaine Graham]], [[N. Katherine Hayles]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Peter Sloterdijk]], [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]], [[Evan Thompson]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Douglas Kellner]]. Among the theorists are philosophers, such as Robert Pepperell, who have written about a "[[posthuman condition]]", which is often substituted for the term "posthumanism".&lt;ref name="Badmington 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayles 1999"/&gt;

Posthumanism differs from classical [[humanism]] by relegating [[human]]ity back to [[biocentrism (ethics)|one of many natural species]], thereby rejecting any claims founded on [[anthropocentric]] dominance.&lt;ref name=wolfe&gt;Wolfe, C. (2009). [https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/what-is-posthumanism ''''What is Posthumanism?''''] University of Minnesota Press. Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this claim, humans have no inherent rights to destroy [[nature]] or set themselves above it in [[ethical]] considerations ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. Human [[knowledge]] is also reduced to a less controlling position, previously seen as the defining aspect of the world. [[Human rights]] exist on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and posthuman rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds|journal=Teknokultura|volume=12|issue=2|author=[[Woody Evans|Evans, Woody]]|year=2015|url=http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310|doi=10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations and fallibility of [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] are confessed, even though it does not imply abandoning the [[rationalism|rational]] tradition of [[humanism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Proponents of a posthuman discourse, suggest that innovative advancements and emerging technologies have transcended the traditional model of the human, as proposed by [[Descartes]] among others associated with philosophy of the [[Enlightenment age|Enlightenment period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Badmington|first1=Neil|title=Posthumanism|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405183123_chunk_g978140518312363_ss1-3|publisher=Blackwell Reference Online|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[humanism]], the discourse of posthumanism seeks to redefine the boundaries surrounding modern philosophical understanding of the human. Posthumanism represents an evolution of thought beyond that of the contemporary social boundaries and is predicated on the seeking of truth within a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] context. In so doing, it rejects previous attempts to establish '[[anthropological universal]]s' that are imbued with anthropocentric assumptions.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt;

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] placed posthumanism within a context that differentiated [[humanism]] from [[Enlightenment Thought|enlightenment thought]]. According to Foucault, the two existed in a state of tension: as humanism sought to establish norms while Enlightenment thought attempted to transcend all that is material, including the boundaries that are constructed by humanistic thought.&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt;  Drawing on the Enlightenment’s challenges to the boundaries of humanism, posthumanism rejects the various assumptions of human dogmas (anthropological, political, scientific) and takes the next step by attempting to change the nature of thought about what it means to be human. This requires not only decentering the human in multiple discourses (evolutionary, ecological, technological) but also examining those discourses to uncover inherent humanistic, anthropocentric, normative notions of humanness and the concept of the human.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;

==Contemporary posthuman discourse==
Posthumanistic discourse aims to open up spaces to examine what it means to be human and critically question the concept of "the human" in light of current cultural and historical contexts&lt;ref name=miah /&gt; In her book ''How We Became Posthuman'', [[N. Katherine Hayles]], writes about the struggle between different versions of the posthuman as it continually co-evolves alongside intelligent machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cecchetto|first1=David|title=Humanesis: Sound and Technological Posthumanism|date=2013|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis, MN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such coevolution, according to some strands of the posthuman discourse, allows one to extend their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understandings of real experiences beyond the boundaries of [[embodied cognition|embodied]]  existence. According to Hayles's view of posthuman, often referred to as technological posthumanism, [[visual perception]] and digital representations thus paradoxically become ever more salient. Even as one seeks to extend knowledge by deconstructing perceived boundaries, it is these same boundaries that make knowledge acquisition possible. The use of technology in a contemporary society is thought to complicate this relationship.

[[N. Katherine Hayles|Hayles]] discusses the translation of human bodies into information (as suggested by [[Hans Moravec]]) in order to illuminate how the boundaries of our embodied reality have been compromised in the current age and how narrow definitions of humanness no longer apply. Because of this, according to [[N. Katherine Hayles|Hayles]], posthumanism is characterized by a loss of [[subjectivity]] based on bodily boundaries.&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;  This strand of posthumanism, including the changing notion of subjectivity and the disruption of ideas concerning what it means to be human, is often associated with [[Donna Haraway]]’s concept of the [[cyborg]].&lt;ref name=miah /&gt; However, [[Donna Haraway|Haraway]] has distanced herself from posthumanistic discourse due to other theorists’ use of the term to promote [[Utopianism|utopian]] views of technological innovation to extend the human biological capacity&lt;ref name=gane /&gt; (even though these notions would more correctly fall into the realm of [[transhumanism]]&lt;ref name=miah /&gt;).

While posthumanism is a broad and complex ideology, it has relevant implications today and for the future. It attempts to redefine [[social structures]] without inherently humanly or even biological origins, but rather in terms of [[social system|social]] and [[psychological]] systems where [[consciousness]] and [[communication]] could potentially exist as unique [[Incorporeality|disembodied]] entities. Questions subsequently emerge with respect to the current use and the future of technology in shaping human existence,&lt;ref name=wolfe /&gt; as do new concerns with regards to [[language]], [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[subjectivity]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[justice]] and [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roudavski|first1=Stanislav|last2=McCormack|first2=Jon|title=Post-Anthropocentric Creativity|date=2016|journal=Digital Creativity|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–6|doi=10.1080/14626268.2016.1151442|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with transhumanism==
Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] comments that there is considerable confusion between the two terms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranisch|first1=Robert|title=Post- and Transhumanism: An Introduction|date=January 2014|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269405350|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacFarlane|first1=James|title=Boundary Work: Post- and Transhumanism, Part I, James Michael MacFarlane|url=https://social-epistemology.com/2014/12/23/boundary-work-post-and-transhumanism-part-i-james-michael-macfarlane/|accessdate=25 August 2016|date=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the introduction to their book on post- and transhumanism, Robert Ranisch and Stefan Sorgner address the source of this confusion, stating that posthumanism is often used as an umbrella term that includes both transhumanism and critical posthumanism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although both subjects relate to the future of humanity, they differ in their view of [[anthropocentrism]]. Pramod Nayar, author of ''Posthumanism'', states that posthumanism has two main branches: ontological and critical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Posthumanism|last=K.|first=Nayar, Pramod|isbn=9780745662404|location=Cambridge|oclc=863676564|date = 2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontological posthumanism is synonymous with transhumanism. The subject is regarded as “an intensification of humanism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is posthumanism?|last=Cary.|first=Wolfe|date=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816666157|location=Minneapolis|oclc=351313274}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transhumanism]] retains humanism’s focus on the homo sapien as the center of the world but also considers technology to be an integral aid to human progression. Critical posthumanism, however, is opposed to these views. Critical posthumanism “rejects both human exceptionalism (the idea that humans are unique creatures) and human instrumentalism (that humans have a right to control the natural world).”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These contrasting views on the importance of human beings are the main distinctions between the two subjects. 

Transhumanism is also more ingrained in popular culture than critical posthumanism, especially in science fiction. The term is referred to by Pramod Nayar as "the pop posthumanism of cinema and pop culture."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that all forms of posthumanism, including transhumanism, have more in common than their respective proponents realize.&lt;ref name="Winner 2005"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Langdon Winner|Winner, Langdon]] | editor = Harold Bailie, Timothy Casey| title = Is Human Nature Obsolete?| publisher =M.I.T. Press  | location = Massachusetts Institute of Technology, October 2004| isbn = 978-0262524285 | pages = 385–411 | chapter = Resistance is Futile: The Posthuman Condition and Its Advocates| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linking these different approaches, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] suggests that 'the key political problem is that, in effect, the position allows the human as a category of being to flow down the plughole of history':

{{cquote| 
{{quote|This is ontologically critical. Unlike the naming of ‘postmodernism’ where the ‘post’ does not infer the end of what it previously meant to be human (just the passing of the dominance of the modern) the posthumanists are playing a serious game where the human, in all its ontological variability, disappears in the name of saving something unspecified about us as merely a motley co-location of individuals and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2017 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Alternative Paradigms for Sustainability: Decentring the Human without Becoming Posthuman | title= Reimagining Sustainability in Precarious Times | editor1= Karen Malone|editor2=Son Truong|editor3=Tonia Gray | chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/32388929 | publisher= Ashgate | page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

However, some posthumanists in the [[humanities]] and the [[arts]] are critical of transhumanism (the brunt of Paul James's criticism), in part, because they argue that it incorporates and extends many of the values of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment humanism]] and [[classical liberalism]], namely [[scientism]], according to [[performance art|performance]] philosopher [[Shannon Bell]]:&lt;ref name="Zaretsky 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Zaretsky, Adam|    title = Bioart in Question. Interview.|    year = 2005|    url = http://magazine.ciac.ca/archives/no_23/en/entrevue.htm|    accessdate = 2007-01-28|    deadurl = yes|    archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130115125814/http://magazine.ciac.ca/archives/no_23/en/entrevue.htm|    archivedate = 2013-01-15|    df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote| 
{{quote|[[Altruism]], [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[humanism]] are the soft and slimy [[virtues]] that underpin [[liberal capitalism]]. Humanism has always been integrated into discourses of exploitation: [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], [[neoimperialism]], [[democracy]], and of course, American democratization. One of the serious flaws in [[transhumanism]] is the importation of liberal-human values to the biotechno enhancement of the human. Posthumanism has a much stronger critical edge attempting to develop through enactment new understandings of the [[Self and Others|self and others]], [[essence]], [[consciousness]], [[intelligence]], [[reason]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[intimacy]], [[life]], [[embodied cognition|embodiment]], [[Personal identity|identity]] and the [[Human body|body]].&lt;ref name="Zaretsky 2005"/&gt;}}}}

While many modern leaders of thought are accepting of nature of ideologies described by posthumanism, some are more skeptical of the term. [[Donna Haraway]], the author of [[Cyborg Manifesto|''A Cyborg Manifesto'']], has outspokenly rejected the term, though acknowledges a philosophical alignment with posthumanism. [[Donna Haraway|Haraway]] opts instead for the term of companion species, referring to nonhuman entities with which humans coexist.&lt;ref name=gane&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gane|first1=Nicholas|title=When We Have Never Been Human, What Is to Be Done?: Interview with Donna Haraway|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|date=2006|volume=23|issue=7–8|pages=135–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of race, some argue, are suspiciously elided within the "turn" to posthumanism. Noting that the terms "post" and "human" are already loaded with racial meaning, critical theorist Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues that the impulse to move "beyond" the human within posthumanism too often ignores "praxes of humanity and critiques produced by black people",{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} including [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Aimé Césaire|Aime Cesaire]] to [[Hortense Spillers]] and [[Fred Moten]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} Interrogating the conceptual grounds in which such a mode of “beyond” is rendered legible and viable, Jackson argues that it is important to observe that ''"blackness conditions and constitutes the very nonhuman disruption and/or disruption"'' which posthumanists invite.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=216}} In other words, given that race in general and blackness in particular constitutes the very terms through which human/nonhuman distinctions are made, for example in enduring legacies of [[scientific racism]], a gesture toward a “beyond” actually “returns us to a Eurocentric transcendentalism long challenged”.{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=217}}

The '''problem of the creator of God''' is the controversy regarding the hypothetical [[Causality|cause]] responsible for the [[existence of God]], presuming God exists. A common challenge to [[theism|theistic]] propositions of a [[creator deity]] as a necessary [[first cause|first-cause]] explanation for the [[universe]] is the question: "Who created God?".&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It contests the proposition that the universe cannot exist without a creator by asserting that the creator of the universe must have the same restrictions. This, in turn, may lead to a problem of [[infinite regress]] wherein each newly presumed creator of a creator is itself presumed to have its own creator.

Some faith traditions have such an element as part of their doctrine. [[Jainism and non-creationism|Jainism]] posits that the universe is eternal and has always existed. In [[Mormonism]] it is believed that the God of this Earth was once a mortal human, who had a father of his own. [[Ismailism]] rejects the idea of God as the ''first cause'', due to the doctrine of God's incomparability and source of any existence including [[Abstract and concrete|abstract objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Arzina R. Lalani Degrees of Excellence: A Fatimid Treatise on Leadership in Islam I.B.Tauris 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-857-71202-8}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
[[Rajneesh|Osho]] writes:
{{quote|No, don't ask that. That's what all the religions say — don't ask who created God. But this is strange — why not? If the question is valid about existence, why does it become invalid when it is applied to God? And once you ask who created God, you are falling into a regress absurdum.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Conspiracy: The Path from Superstition to Super Consciousness'', [[Rajneesh|Osho]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Humphreys writes:
{{quote|... if someone were able to provide the explanation, we would be forced to embark upon what philosophers call an infinite regress. Having established who created God, we would then have to answer the question of who created God's creator.&lt;ref&gt;''In God We Doubt'', John Humphrys, 2008. {{isbn|978-0340976739}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The God Book'', Deist [[Michael Arnheim]] writes:
{{quote|The atheist objection is that if God created the universe, who created God? Judging by the number of times that [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] repeats this same point in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', one must assume that he sees this as a killer argument against the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Book'', [[Michael Arnheim]], 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan Lurie writes:
{{quote|If God created the Universe, who created God? That is a dilemma that religious folks desperately try to avoid.” The question, “Who created God?”, has been pondered by theologians for millennia, and the answer is both surprisingly obvious and philosophically subtle...

...whatever one thinks about the beginnings of the Universe, there is “something” at the very origin that was not created. This is an inescapable given a cosmic truth.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Lurie, ''The Rabbi Who Believes in Zeus: Popular Myths About Religion, Faith, and God'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==
Defenders of religion have countered that the question is improper:

{{quote|We ask, “If all things have a creator, then who created God?” Actually, only created things have a creator, so it's improper to lump God with his creation. God has revealed himself to us in the Bible as having always existed.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Husting, ''Doubt Busters'', 2017, p. 20. {{isbn|1387312820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is also argued that the question becomes irrelevant if the Universe is presumed to have circular time instead of linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gabler, ''Slices of a Life'', 2015, Ch. 30 {{isbn|1504960645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born June 3, 1945 in Waterbury, Connecticut, to Norman W. and Anne M. (Richall) Côté, he was educated at The Milford School and graduated in 1963 from [[Amity Regional High School|Amity Regional Senior High School]] in [[Woodbridge, Connecticut|Woodbridge]]. One of two children, Côté had an "adventure-filled" childhood.   Côté's [[Dublin]]-born mother and his [[Québec]]-born grandmother, Gertrude Beaudoin Côté, often read to him. He quickly became fascinated with The [[Harvard Classics]] and read the complete [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] in his teen years. His mother, a part-time journalist, let him use her typewriter, and by the age of twelve, he was typing most of his school papers.

Côté attended [[Butler University]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] where he majored in [[political science]] and [[journalism]] and became passionate about [[photography]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], and writing.  In 1964 he was inducted into [[Sigma Delta Chi]], the national journalism fraternity, and was awarded a scholarship for his work as the university's newspaper photographer.

After college, Côté served six years in the [[United States Air Force]].  He spent a year at [[Mather Air Force Base]], [[California]], and then volunteered to serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. At [[Da Nang Air Base]] he served both as a USAF combat news photographer and as a munitions specialist from 1966 to 1967. He spent his final four years in the military as a photographer at [[Hahn Air Base]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Côté, Richard N.  Interviewed by Cammie Amacher, March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===

For enjoyment, he traveled worldwide and collected 19th century [[engraving]]s and [[painting]]s by contemporary Southern artists.&lt;ref&gt;Côté, Richard N.  Interviewed by Cammie Amacher, March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[right to die]] movement and served as a spokesman for assisted-suicide activist [[George Exoo]].&lt;ref name=Irish&gt;{{cite news|title='Angel of death' or victim of a witch-hunt?|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/angel-of-death-or-victim-of-a-witch-hunt-1.960601|accessdate=2017-09-10|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===

Côté died February 10, 2015, in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], after falling down stairs at his home.  He was 69.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Adam|title=Cote, local author, publisher, dies at 69 |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/features/arts_and_travel/cote-local-author-publisher-dies-at/article_ec40f17e-25e3-56fa-a059-3bf4cf627e3a.html|accessdate=2017-09-10|newspaper=The Post and Courier|date=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing career ==

=== Early career ===

While living in [[Wisconsin]] in the 1970s, he became interested with the history of [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]], first settled by German and Polish immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century. His ability to read German [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] handwriting led to the transcription of numerous volumes of early [[German Lutheran Church|German Lutheran]] church records and tombstones.

After moving to [[South Carolina]] in 1979, he was recruited by the [[South Carolina Historical Society]]. There he spent four years serving as an [[archivist]], [[librarian]], and [[Grant writing|grant writer]]. In 1984 he was recruited to establish a high-precision public records [[microfilm]]ing system for the [[Charleston County, South Carolina|County of Charleston]]. He also researched the lives of 18th- and 19th-century Southern planters, their homes, and their slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Côté, Richard N.  Interviewed by Cammie Amacher, March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s he turned to more contemporary subjects, including [[sexual harassment]] and [[Sexual abuse|abuse]], [[motorcycle gang]]s and [[Drug dealer|drug dealing]], entertainment personalities, the American [[circus]] industry, [[Cult|religious cult]]s, and [[Deprogramming|deprogrammers]]. He also authored or co-authored novels based on family relationships, [[human cloning]], [[politics]], and addiction to [[Psychic medium|psychics]].

=== Gaining Recognition ===

His three biographies,  ''Mary's World: Love, War, and Family Ties in Nineteenth-century Charleston'' (1999); ''Theodosia Burr Alston: Portrait of a Prodigy'' (2002) and ''Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolley Madison'' (2004) brought him national recognition. In 2008, "Strength and Honor" was chosen to be translated into the Braille language for the blind by the Library of Congress.

=== Controversies ===

In 1991, after being commissioned to write a documentary history of the South Carolina State Ports Authority, that agency insisted that all references to the port's early use for the [[slave trade]] be censored, and that local opposition to its expansion be deleted.  Côté demanded that his name be removed from the book. "Agreeing to undertake a scholarly writing project is not the same as agreeing to be a literary whore," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Côté, Richard N.  Interviewed by Cammie Amacher, March 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Côté was hired by National Press Books through his agent, [[Robert Eringer]], to work as a literary collaborator with [[Edward Lee Howard]], a former [[CIA]] spy who defected to [[Russia]] after being accused of providing classified information to the Russians. After intensive research and ten days' interviews with Howard in [[Moscow]], Côté returned and wrote Safe House, an authoritative account of Howard's claim to innocence. Unbeknownst to Côté at the time, Eringer was secretly working for the [[FBI]] and was using him to acquire information the agency could use against Howard.&lt;ref&gt;Eringer, Robert.  Ruse: Undercover with FBI Counterintelligence. Washington D.C.: Potomac Books, Inc., 2008.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===

In 2004, he received the Bobby Gilmer Moss Award in History from the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] for his outstanding contributions to South Carolina history. He has been chosen as a Featured Author by the South Carolina Book Festival; the Carl Sandberg Celebration of Books and Authors in [[Hendersonville, North Carolina]]; the Spoleto Festival of the Arts in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; and the Daughters of the American Revolution Museum, [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;"Meet the Author: Richard N.

'''Richard Nelson Frye''' (January 10, 1920&amp;nbsp;– March 27, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] scholar of [[Iranian people|Iranian]] and [[Central Asia|Central Asian Studies]], and [[Aga Khan]] Professor Emeritus of Iranian Studies at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~turkish/relfaculty.html Richard Nelson Frye, Aga Khan Professor of Iranian-Emeritus Near Eastern Languages &amp; Civilizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iohp/frye.html&lt;/ref&gt; His professional areas of interest were Iranian [[philology]] and the history of [[Iran]] and [[Central Asia]] before 1000 CE.

Born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], to a family of immigrants from [[Sweden]], "Freij" had four children, his second marriage being to an [[Assyrians in Iran|Iranian-Assyrian]] scholar, [[Eden Naby]], from [[Urmia]], [[Iran]] who teaches at [[Columbia University]]. He spoke fluent [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[French language|French]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]],&lt;ref&gt;''Greater Iran'', Mazda Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had extensive knowledge of [[Avestan]], [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], and other Iranian languages and dialects, both extinct and current.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Although Frye is mostly known for his works about [[Iran]], the [[Iranian people]]s and Iranian Central Asia, the scope of his studies was much wider and includes [[Byzantine]], [[Caucasus|Caucasian]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] history, [[Eastern Turkistan]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Assyrian people]], ancient and medieval [[Iranian art]], [[Islamic art]], [[Sufism]], Chinese and Japanese archeology, and a variety of Iranian and non-Iranian languages including [[Avestan]], [[Old Persian]], [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Khotanese language|Khotanese]], and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]], [[New Persian]], [[Arabic]], Turkish, and even Chinese, beside research languages which include French, German, Italian, and Russian.&lt;ref name="iranica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/pages/r-n-frye-2014|title=Richard Nelson Frye (January 10,1920 – March 27, 2014)|last=Yarshater|first=Ehsan|authorlink=Ehsan Yarshater|date=March 31, 2014|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Frye was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He first attended the [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]], where he received a BA in history and philosophy in 1939. He received his MA from [[Harvard University]] in 1940 and his PhD from Harvard in 1946, in [[Asia|Asiatic history]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Frye served with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in [[Afghanistan]] and traveled extensively in the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]]. In 1948 he visited [[Sar Masshad]], and was the first European to find and report the existence of the [[Gur-e Dokhtar]] tomb (meaning "Tomb of the Maiden" in [[Persian language|Persian]].

He returned to Harvard to teach. He was a member of the Harvard faculty from 1948 until 1990. He then became a professor emeritus at Harvard. He also served as faculty, guest lecturer, or visiting scholar at:
* [[Habibiya College]] in [[Kabul]] (1942–44)
* [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt University]] (1959–60)
* [[Hamburg University]] (1968–69)
* [[Pahlavi University]] of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] (1970–76)
* [[University of Tajikistan]] (1990–92).

Professor Frye helped found the Center for Middle Eastern Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/ecmes/features/remapping |title=Crossing Boundaries: Remapping the Study of Middle East History |last=Kafadar |first=Cemal |date=November 22, 2005 |work=Harvard University Center for Middle Eastern Studies |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518044244/http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/ecmes/features/remapping |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at Harvard, the first [[Iranian Studies|Iranian studies]] program in America. He also served as Director of the ''Asia Institute'' in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] (1970–1975), was on the Board of Trustees of the [[Pahlavi University]] at [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] (1974–78), and Chairman, ''Committee on Inner Asian Studies'', at Harvard (1983–89), and as Editor of the ''Bulletin of the Asia Institute'' (1970–1975 and 1987–99).

Among Frye's students were [[Annemarie Schimmel]],&lt;ref&gt;''Greater Iran'', Mazda Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p.193&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleg Grabar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/bigideas/grabar.html Big Ideas. Big Thinkers. Oleg Grabar | Thirteen/WNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Huddle]] (former US Ambassador to [[Tajikistan]]), [[John Limbert]], and [[Michael Crichton]], whose [[Hollywood]] film [[The 13th Warrior]] is loosely based on Frye's translation of [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s account of his travels up the river [[Volga]].&lt;ref&gt;''Greater Iran'', Mazda Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}}  p.90, p.150&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye was also directly responsible for inviting Iranian scholars as distinguished visiting fellows to Harvard University, under a fellowship program initiated by [[Henry Kissinger]]. Examples of such guests include [[Mehdi Haeri Yazdi]] (1923–1999), [[Sadegh Choubak]], [[Jalal al Ahmad]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Greater Iran'', Mazda Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p. 103, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frye as a proponent of Persian culture==
[[Image:Ghavam garden shiraz.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Qavam House]], where the famous ''[[Shiraz University]] Asia Institute'' was founded. Frye headed the institute from 1969 to 1974.]]
Frye felt that [[List of Persia-related topics|Persian civilization]] was under-appreciated by other [[Muslim]]s, and [[Arab]] Muslims in particular. Frye wrote:

{{quote|1=Arabs no longer understand the role of Iran and the Persian language in the formation of Islamic culture. Perhaps they wish to forget the past, but in so doing they remove the bases of their own spiritual, moral and cultural being...without the heritage of the past and a healthy respect for it...there is little chance for stability and proper growth. |2=R. N. Frye|3= ''The Golden Age of Persia'', London: Butler &amp; Tanner Ltd., 1989, page 236}}

In August 1953, shortly before the fall of [[Mosaddegh]], prominent Iranian linguist [[Ali Akbar Dehkhoda]] gave Frye the title: "Irandoost" (meaning "a friend of Iran").&lt;ref&gt;''Greater Iran'', Mazda Publishers, 2005. {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Frye was a long standing supporter of [[Assyrian continuity]]; the historical and ancestral connection between modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and the Ancient Mesopotamians&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aina.org/articles/frye.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

A ceremony was held in Iran on June 27, 2004 to pay tribute to the six-decade endeavors of Professor Frye on his lifetime contribution to [[Iranian Studies]], research work on the [[Persian language]], and the history and culture of [[Iran]].

In his will, Professor Frye expressed his wish to be buried next to the [[Zayandeh River]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. This request was approved by Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/13/africa/ME-GEN-Iran-American-Scholar.php Ahmadinejad allows burial of American professor in Iran], [[The Associated Press]], Published: September 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other American scholars of Iranian Studies, [[Arthur Pope]] and [[Phyllis Ackerman]], are already buried there.
In 2010, a house in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] was gifted by Iranian government to Professor Frye in recognition of his services to Iranian studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.payvand.com/news/10/aug/1093.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2014, the family of Dr. Frye decided to cremate his remains after waiting more than 2 months for official Iranian permission to bury him in Isfahan. His death coincided with growing resentment by Iranian hard-liners over signs of reconciliation with the United States after decades of estrangement. It is not clear what the family intended to do with his ashes. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/world/middleeast/harvard-scholars-body-cremated-after-request-for-burial-in-iran-falters.html Iran: Harvard Scholar’s Body Cremated After Request for Burial in Iran Falters], [[The New York Times]], Published: June 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frye as a public speaker==
Frye was a popular public speaker at numerous Iran-related gatherings. In 2005, he spoke at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], encouraging the Iranians present to cherish their culture and identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/frye-speech.htm Iran Heritage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413153303/http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/frye-speech.htm |date=2005-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parstimes.com/events/frye_gallery.html Professor Richard Nelson Frye Lecture at UCLA Royce Hall&amp;nbsp;– March 13, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he spoke at an architectural conference in Tehran, expressing his dismay at hasty modernization that ignores the beauties of traditional Iranian architectural styles (see [[Architecture of Tehran]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Robert Carl-Heinz Shell''' (31 Jan 1949 - 3 Feb 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=938078&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=71616 |title=Robert Shell: A tribute - NEWS &amp; ANALYSIS |publisher=Politicsweb |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bryan Rostron |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2015/03/02/slavery-scholar-more-feted-abroad |title=Slavery scholar more feted abroad &amp;#124; Opinion &amp; Analysis |publisher=BDlive |date=2015-03-02 |accessdate=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[South African]] author, scholar, and professor of [[African Studies]].  He was born in the [[Cape Province]] of South Africa and lived in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. After the fall of apartheid he returned to South Africa. Toward the end of his life he lived in the [[Western Cape]] with his wife Sandy Rowoldt Shell, who is the head of the African Studies Library at [[University of Cape Town]].

Professor Shell has attended more than 41 international workshops where he has delivered papers on several topics but notably on [[slavery]], Islam and [[HIV/AIDS]]. In September 2004 he delivered the keynote address at the AGM of SANTA (SA National [[Tuberculosis]] Association) in [[Port Elizabeth]], South Africa with a talk entitled “Infectious diseases in South Africa: HIV/AIDS and TB, some statistical trends”. He has also appeared in Washington, D.C., where he addressed both the House Select Committee on African affairs and the House Select Committee on [[International Relations]] on the global Aids [[pandemic]].

== Education ==
Professor Shell obtained his undergraduate and Honours degrees at [[University of Cape Town]] in the 1970s. He then went to the U.S. to complete his master's degree at [[University of Rochester]] and in 1986 he completed his PhD at [[Yale University]]. For his doctoral studies at Yale, completed in 1986, Shell wrote the dissertation entitled “Slavery at the Cape of Good Hope, 1680–1731” under the advisorship of famed South African historian, [[Leonard M. Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historians.org/pubs/dissertations/DissertationDetail2.cfm?DissertationID=21816 |title=Directory of Dissertations |publisher=Historians.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307193007/http://www.historians.org/pubs/dissertations/DissertationDetail2.cfm?DissertationID=21816 |archivedate=7 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
"Robert Shell's account is slightly different. He argues that Christianity's change of heart only applied to [[baptized]] slaves, and the issue of whether [[slaves]] should be baptized was very contentious as late as 1618 when it was raised at the [[Synod of Dort]], the last meeting of Protestant [[theology|theologians]] from Great Britain and the Continent. Although the delegates could not agree on a single policy, Shell maintains, their writings ended or limited the trade in Christian slaves.''[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3843/is_200301/ai_n9233870/pg_2]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">'''Robert Mannyng''' (or '''Robert de Brunne'''; {{c.}} 1275 – c. 1338) was an English chronicler and [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertine]] monk. Mannyng provides a surprising amount of information about himself in his two known works, ''[[Handlyng Synne]]'' and  ''[[Mannyng's Chronicle]]''.  In these two works, Mannyng tells of his residencies at the Gilbertine houses of [[Sempringham]] (near Bourne) and [[Sixhills]], and also at the Gilbertine priory at [[Cambridge]], St Edmund’s.

==Upbringing==
His name, Robert de Brunne, indicates that he came from the place then known as Brunne ([[Bourne, Lincolnshire]]), thirteen kilometres south of [[Sempringham Priory]], the mother house of the [[Gilbertine Order]]. Both places lie on the western edge of the [[Lincolnshire]] [[The Fens|fens]]. He entered the house in 1288, was trained there and moved to Cambridge, probably as part of his training.  He was moved on to Sixhills&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; priory at (TF1787) in the Lincolnshire Wolds near [[Market Rasen]]. He will have spent most of his life at Sempringham, despite the frequent modern assertion that he was a monk of [[Bourne Abbey]]. The latter was an [[Arrouaise (Abbey and Order)|Arrouasian]] house, later regarded as [[Augustinian]].

This interpretation is supported by Mannyng's introduction to ''[[Handlyng Synne]]'', in which he says that he had been at the abbey fifteen years: ten in the time of John Camelton (Hamilton) (the prior at Sempringham from c1298 to 1312), and five winters with Hamilton's successor, John Clyntone. However, he clearly retained an interest in the people of Bourne, as he addressed ''Handlyng Synne'' "to all Christian men under the sun and to good men of Bourne and specially ... the fellowship of Sempringham".

==His works==
''Handlyng Synne'' (1303) is a twelve thousand line devotional or penitential piece, written in [[Middle English]] rhymed couplets, deriving many of its [[Exemplum|exempla]] from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''Manuel des Peches'' of [[William of Waddington]]. 

''[[Mannyng's Chronicle]]'', supposedly completed in 1338, translates [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' for British history from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], before translating [[Piers Langtoft]]'s (Peter of Langtoft) ''Chronicle'' for English and post-Conquest history.&lt;sup id="fn_2_back"&gt;[[#fn 2|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==His legacy==
Mannyng was primarily a historiographer, and his significance lies in his participation in the tri-lingual tradition of writing history.  His work in [[Middle English]] is part of a larger movement at the beginning of the fourteenth century towards the replacement of Latin and Anglo-Norman by written works in Middle English, but is not groundbreaking.  It is as a history writer, in particular, through his indebtedness to the great twelfth century histories of [[Henry of Huntingdon]], [[William of Malmesbury]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], that Mannyng stands out.  His verse is often seen as rather pedestrian; however, in the exempla in ''Handling Synne'', in particular, there is a life and a colour which give vibrancy to the tales and which make the work very entertaining to read—unlike several other contemporary penitential works.

[[File:Artist's Conception of Space Station Freedom - GPN-2003-00092.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic rendition of Space Station Freedom with the STS Orbiter Vehicle]]

The '''Space Exploration Initiative''' was a 1989–1993 [[spaceflight|space]] public policy initiative of the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush administration]].

On July 20, 1989, the 20th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing, [[George H. W. Bush]] — then [[President of the United States]] — announced plans for what came to be known as the '''Space Exploration Initiative''' ('''SEI''').&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/public_papers.php?id=712 |title=Remarks on the 20th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing |date=1989-07-20 |publisher=The George Bush Presidential Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech on the steps of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] he described plans calling for constructing [[Space Station Freedom]], sending humans back to the [[Moon]] "to stay" and ultimately sending [[human mission to Mars|astronauts to explore Mars]]. He proposed not a 10-year [[Apollo program|Apollo]]-style plan, but a long-range continuing commitment based on the three above elements, ending with "a journey into tomorrow – a journey to another planet – a manned mission to Mars." The President noted it was humanity's destiny to explore, and America's destiny to lead. He asked [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dan Quayle]] to lead the [[National Space Council]] in determining what was needed to carry out these missions in terms of money, manpower and technology.

In the event, execution of the initiative was assigned to NASA, but the initiative did not survive long into the administration of the next president, [[Bill Clinton]].

==Background==
In August 1987 a committee chaired by former astronaut Dr. [[Sally Ride]] released a report entitled ''Leadership and America's Future in Space''.&lt;ref&gt;* Hogan, Thor. Mars Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Space Exploration Initiative. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA History Division, Office of External Relations, 2007. Print. history.nasa.gov/sp4410.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Ride Report]]" advocated establishment of a permanent moon base by 2010 and landing a crew on [[Mars]] early in the 21st century.

On January 5, 1988 President [[Ronald Reagan]] approved a revised United States national space policy, which was [[Classified information|classified]]. On February 11 a summary "Fact Sheet" about the policy was publicly released.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/new/policy/nsdd_293.htm |title="Presidential Directive on National Space Policy," January 5, 1988 -- Fact sheet |date=February 11, 1988 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101107/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/new/policy/nsdd_293.htm |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy identified six goals of United States space activities, the last of which was, "to expand human presence and activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system."

In the view of NASA, the July 20, 1989 speech by President Bush, "provided specificity" to that policy goal.&lt;ref name=90dayreport&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/90_day_study.pdf |title=Report of the 90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the Moon and Mars |date=November 1989 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this announcement [[NASA]] Administrator [[Richard Truly]] initiated a study of the options to achieve the President's goals, headed by [[Johnson Space Center]] Director [[Aaron Cohen (Deputy NASA administrator)|Aaron Cohen]]. A report on that study, called, "the 90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the Moon and Mars" (or simply, "the 90-Day Study"), was published by NASA on November 20, 1989.&lt;ref name=90dayreport /&gt;

==Development==
[[File:90-Day-Study Mars Mission Profile Image.png|thumb|Mars mission design]]
The 90-Day Study estimated SEI's long-term cost at approximately 500 billion dollars spread over 20 to 30 years. According to Steve Dick, NASA Chief Historian, the National Academy of Sciences largely concurred with the NASA study, but [[White House]] and Congressional reaction to the NASA plan was hostile, primarily due to the cost estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/seisummary.htm |title=Summary of Space Exploration Initiative |author=Steve Dick |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Democratic members of Congress had almost immediate criticism over Bush's plan. Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Jim Sasser, stated "The President took one giant leap for starry-eyed political rhetoric, and not even a small step for fiscal responsibility. The hard fact is, this Administration doesn't even have its space priorities established for next year, much less for the next century." His fellow Tennessee Senator Al Gore also was quoted expressing his criticism of Bush's plan, saying "By proposing a return to the Moon, with no money, no timetable, and no plan, President Bush offers the country not a challenge to inspire us, but a daydream to briefly entertain us, a daydream about as splashy as a George Lucas movie, with about as much connection to reality." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/us/president-calls-for-mars-mission-and-a-moon-base.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Bush sought international partners, but the program was thought too expensive even for an international endeavor.

In August 1990, Vice President Quayle established an [[Advisory Committee on the Future of the United States Space Program|advisory committee]], often called the "Augustine Commission", which recommended that NASA should focus on space and Earth science, and transition human exploration to a "go-as-you-pay" strategy.

==Ending==
On April 1, 1992 [[Dan Goldin]] became NASA Administrator, and during his tenure near-term human exploration beyond Earth orbit was abandoned, and the "faster, better, cheaper" strategy was applied to space science [[robotic exploration]].

When the White House National Science and Technology Council released their revision of the [[National Space Policy]] in September 1996, it specifically lacked any mention of human space exploration beyond Earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet -- National Space Policy |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/new/policy/nsc_49.htm |date=September 19, 1996 |publisher=National Science and Technology Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101206/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codez/new/policy/nsc_49.htm |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, President Clinton stated on a campaigning trip through the Pacific Northwest that a human mission to Mars was too expensive and instead affirmed America's commitment to a series of less expensive probes,&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGrory, "Clinton Curbs Mars Project: Drops Manned Mission, Backs Robotic Probes," The Boston Globe (20 September 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; thus removing human exploration from the national agenda.

==Projects==

===Space Station===
Construction of [[Space Station Freedom]].

===Lunar Orbiter Missions===
The [[Lunar Orbiter Missions]] would yield further information on the distribution of high-TiO regolith on the whole Moon, through gamma-ray spectroscopy. The purpose was stated to be to provide a detailed geochemical and mineralogical map of the Moon. Global stereo imaging to aid in site selection was also given as a function of the mission.

===Common Lunar Lander program (CLL)===
The [[Common Lunar Lander|CLL]] program would have consisted of a series of Apollo-type missions, mostly robotic. One mission was entitled ''Outpost Site Survey and Resource Assessment'', involving the use of rovers. The site selected was in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] near 15° N 22° E.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Dave. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992seit.proc...49W Artemis program: Rover/Mobility Systems Workshop results.] ''Third SEI Technical Interchange: Proceedings'' p 49-57 (SEE N92-33309 24-12)&lt;/ref&gt; This point is on the boundary between mare material and the ejecta blanket of the huge (45&amp;nbsp;km diameter) crater [[Plinius (crater)|Plinius]], on the east margin of a 25–40&amp;nbsp;km-wide band of material separating the ejecta blanket from highlands to the west.

===First Lunar Outpost program (FLO)===
For establishment of the [[First Lunar Outpost]] (FLO) two possible sites were mentioned: (1) [[Mare Smythii]], which has an equatorial position straddling the eastern terminator of the nearside of the Moon, and (2) the [[Aristarchus Plateau]] at 23° N 48° W.

'''''The End of History and the Last Man''''' is a 1992 book by [[Francis Fukuyama]], expanding on his 1989 essay "The End of History?", published in the international affairs journal ''[[The National Interest]]''.&lt;ref name='endofhistory'&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0884-9382| issue = 16| pages = 3–18| last = Fukuyama| first = Francis| title = The End of History?| journal = The National Interest| date = 1989| jstor = 24027184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Fukuyama argues that the advent{{clarify|date=November 2018}} of [[Western world|Western]] [[liberal democracy]] may signal the endpoint of humanity's [[sociocultural evolution]] and the final form of human government.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the [[Cold War]], or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the [[end of history]] as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.&lt;ref name='endofhistory' /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fukuyama's position contradicts that of [[Karl Marx]], who predicted that [[communism]] would displace [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"This social formation constitutes, therefore, the closing chapter of the prehistoric stage of human society." [[q:Karl Marx#preface|Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy']] (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama himself identifies on some level with Marx, but more strongly with the German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], by way of [[Alexandre Kojève]]. Kojève argued that the progress of history must lead toward the establishment of a "universal and homogenous" state,&lt;ref&gt;Strauss's term, from the Strauss-Kojève correspondence, published in [[Leo Strauss]], ''On Tyranny'' (University of Chicago Press, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt; most likely incorporating elements of liberal or social democracy; but Kojève's emphasis on the necessarily "post-political" character of such a state (and its citizens) makes such comparisons inadequate, and is irreducible to any mere "triumph" of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Kojève, ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel: Lectures on the'' Phenomenology of Spirit, (Basic Books, 1969), "Note to the Second Edition," p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highlights ==
*History should be viewed as an evolutionary process.
*Events still occur at the end of history.
*Pessimism about humanity's future is warranted because of humanity's inability to control technology.
*The end of history means liberal democracy is the final form of government for all nations. There can be no progression from liberal democracy to an alternative system.

===Misinterpretations===
According to Fukuyama, since the [[French Revolution]], democracy has repeatedly proven to be a fundamentally better system (ethically, politically, economically) than any of the alternatives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The most basic (and prevalent) error in discussing Fukuyama's work is to confuse "history" with "events".{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fukuyama claims not that events will stop occurring in the future, but rather that all that will happen in the future (even if [[totalitarianism]] returns) is that democracy will become more and more prevalent in the ''long'' term, although it may suffer "temporary" setbacks (which may, of course, last for centuries).

Some argue{{who|date=December 2010}} that Fukuyama presents "American-style" democracy as the only "correct" political system and argues that all countries must inevitably follow this particular system of government. However, many Fukuyama scholars claim this is a misreading of his work.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Fukuyama's argument is only that in the future there will be more and more governments that use the framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and that contain markets of some sort. Indeed, Fukuyama has stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The End of History'' was never linked to a specifically American model of social or political organization. Following [[Alexandre Kojève]], the Russian-French philosopher who inspired my original argument, I believe that the [[European Union]] more accurately reflects what the world will look like at the end of history than the contemporary United States.  The EU's attempt to transcend sovereignty and traditional power politics by establishing a transnational [[rule of law]] is much more in line with a "post-historical" world than the Americans' continuing belief in [[God]], [[national sovereignty]], and their military.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2007-04-03).  [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/francis_fukuyama/2007/04/the_history_at_the_end_of_hist.html The history at the end of history.] [[The Guardian]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Arguments in favour==
An argument in favour of Fukuyama's thesis is the [[democratic peace theory]], which argues that mature democracies rarely or never go to war with one another. This theory has faced [[democratic peace theory#Criticism|criticism]], with arguments largely resting on conflicting definitions of "war" and "mature democracy". Part of the difficulty in assessing the theory is that democracy as a widespread global phenomenon emerged only very recently in human history, which makes generalizing about it difficult. (See also [[list of wars between democracies]].)

Other major empirical evidence includes the elimination of interstate warfare in South America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe among countries that moved from military dictatorships to liberal democracies.

According to several studies, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total [[war]]fare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.systemicpeace.org/conflicttrends.html |title=Global Conflict Trends |website=Center for Systemic Peace |year=2017 |accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at web.archive.org/web/20080725183848/http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsrgroup.org/human-security-reports/2005/overview.aspx|title=Human Security Report 2005|website=[[Human Security Report Project]]|accessdate=2017-10-05}} &lt;!-- orig source link archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20070622155859/http://www.humansecurityreport.info --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Critics of liberal democracy===
Some have argued against the book due to an ideological disagreement with the concept of liberal democracy.

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized Fukuyama in ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' (1993) as a "come-lately reader" of [[Alexandre Kojève]] "in the tradition of [[Leo Strauss]]", who already described US society in the 1950s as the "realization of communism". According to Derrida, Fukuyama—and the quick celebrity of his book—is but one symptom of the anxiety to ensure the "death of Marx". Fukuyama's celebration of [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[hegemony]] is criticized by Derrida:

{{quote|For it must be cried out, at a time when some have the audacity to neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a liberal democracy that has finally realized itself as the ideal of human history: never have violence, inequality, exclusion, [[famine]], and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the earth and of humanity. Instead of singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] market in the euphoria of the end of history, instead of celebrating the ‘end of ideologies’ and the end of the great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjugated, starved or exterminated on the earth.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"&gt;Derrida, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Derrida goes on to analyze Fukuyama's book as taking part in the intellectual branch of current Western hegemony and the spreading of its "New Gospel": "This end of History is essentially a [[Christian eschatology]]. It is consonant with the current discourse of the Pope on the European community: destined to become a Christian State or Super-State, this community would still belong therefore to some Holy Alliance." He claims that the book uses a "sleight-of-hand trick" of making use of empirical data whenever it seems to suit its message, while appealing to an ideal whenever the empirical data contradicts it. Derrida points out that Fukuyama himself sees the real United States and European Union as imperfect compared to the "ideals" of liberal democracy and the free market. Even the author understands that such ideals are not demonstrated by empirical evidence or ever could be demonstrated empirically. They belong entirely to the realm of philosophy or religion, owing their birth to the Gospels of Philosophy of [[Hegel]]. And yet Fukuyama still uses a movement toward empirical observations, which he himself grants are imperfect and incomplete, to validate an idea that is purely idealistic and transcendent of any empirical reality or possibility.&lt;ref name="Specters of Marx"/&gt;

Certain versions of Marxism can be conceived as "end of history" philosophies. Therefore, Marxists like [[Perry Anderson]] have been among Fukuyama's fiercest critics. Apart from pointing out that capitalist democracies are still riven with poverty, racial tension, and the like, Marxists also reject Fukuyama's reliance on Hegel. According to them, Hegel's philosophy was fatally flawed until Marx "turned it on its head" to create [[historical materialism]]. Fukuyama argues that even though there is poverty, [[racism]], and [[sexism]] in present-day democracies, there is no sign of a major revolutionary movement developing that would actually overthrow capitalism. While Marxists disagree with Fukuyama's claim that ''capitalist'' democracy represents the end of history, they support the idea that the "end of history" will consist of the victory of democracy: [[communism]], in the Marxist view, must necessarily involve a form of [[direct democracy]].

Former [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] argued against "the end of history": he argued his case in his September 2006 address to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|title=Text of Hugo Chávez's address to the United Nations General Assembly, September 2006|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005050541/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0920-22.htm|archivedate=2006-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before that, in August 2006, Fukuyama wrote in response to Chávez's argument, his main point being that ''[[Chavismo]]'' was only possible due to the unique [[oil]] reserves of [[Venezuela]], and thus would not spread.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama. (2006-08-06). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/04/AR2006080401768.html History's Against Him]. [[The Washington Post]]. Retrieved 2008-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist interpretations aside, the economic and social philosophy of Fukuyama can be summarized as Free-Market Libertarian. Although this tends to be an ambiguous word, he uses it in the proper meaning for the time when the book was published. It has been argued that he might even be a Neoconservative on some points but this has been firmly shot down by him and his use of "ideal" systems which is firmly denounced by many Anarcho-Capitalists of the same rote who believe that no government can be good. His moral bent is strikingly similar but he does not identify with the founding fathers while espousing the same form of government to avoid petty debates.

===Radical Islam, tribalism, and the "Clash of Civilizations"===
Various Western commentators have described the thesis of ''The End of History'' as flawed because it does not sufficiently take into account the power of ethnic loyalties and religious fundamentalism as a counter-force to the spread of liberal democracy, with the specific example of [[Islamic fundamentalism]], or radical Islam, as the most powerful of these.

[[Benjamin Barber]] wrote a 1992 article and a 1995 book, ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'', that addressed this theme. Barber described "[[McWorld]]" as a secular, liberal, corporate-friendly transformation of the world and used the word "[[jihad]]" to refer to the competing forces of tribalism and religious fundamentalism, with a special emphasis on Islamic fundamentalism.

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote a 1993 essay, "[[Clash of Civilizations|The Clash of Civilizations]]", in direct response to ''The End of History''; he then expanded the essay into a 1996 book, ''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order''. In the essay and book, Huntington argued that the temporary conflict between ideologies is being replaced by the ancient conflict between civilizations. The dominant civilization decides the form of human government, and these will not be constant. He especially singled out Islam, which he described as having "bloody borders".

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], ''The End of History'' was cited by some commentators as a symbol of the supposed naiveté and undue optimism of the Western world during the 1990s, in thinking that the end of the [[Cold War]] also represented the end of major global conflict. In the weeks after the attacks, [[Fareed Zakaria]] called the events "the end of the end of history", while [[George Will]] wrote that history had "returned from vacation".&lt;ref name="history is still"&gt;[http://englishmatters.gmu.edu/issue6/911exhibit/emails/fukuyama_wsj.htm History Is Still Going Our Way], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 5, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama did discuss radical Islam briefly in ''The End of History''. He argued that [[Islam]] is not an [[imperialist]] force like Stalinism and fascism; that is, it has little intellectual or emotional appeal outside the Islamic "heartlands". Fukuyama pointed to the economic and political difficulties that  [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] face and argued that such states are fundamentally unstable: either they will become democracies with a Muslim society (like  [[Turkey]]) or they will simply disintegrate. Moreover, when [[Islamic state]]s have actually been created, they were easily dominated by the powerful Western states.

In October 2001, Fukuyama, in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' opinion piece, responded to the declarations that the September 11 attacks had disproved his views by stating that "time and resources are on the side of modernity, and I see no lack of a will to prevail in the United States today." He also noted that his original thesis "does not imply a world free from conflict, nor the disappearance of culture as a distinguishing characteristic of societies."&lt;ref name="history is still" /&gt;

In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]'' opinion piece, Fukuyama wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Democracy's only real competitor in the realm of ideas today is radical [[Islamism]]. Indeed, one of the world's most dangerous nation-states today is Iran, run by extremist Shiite mullahs. But as [[Peter Bergen]] pointed out in these pages last week, Sunni radicalism has been remarkably ineffective in actually taking control of a nation-state, due to its propensity to devour its own potential supporters. Some disenfranchised Muslims thrill to the rantings of Osama bin Laden or Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], but the appeal of this kind of medieval Islamism is strictly limited.&lt;ref name="they can only"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202395.html They Can Only Go So Far], Francis Fukuyama, ''The Washington Post'', August 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The resurgence of Russia and China===
Another challenge to the "end of history" thesis is the growth in the economic and political power of two countries, [[Russia]] and [[China]]; China has a [[one-party state]] government, while Russia, though formally a democracy, has been described by some as ''[[de facto]]'' authoritarian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7386448/Dmitry-Medvedevs-Russia-still-feels-the-cold-hand-of-Vladimir-Putin.html Dmitry Medvedev's Russia still feels the cold hand of Vladimir Putin], Andrew Osborn, ''The Daily Telegraph'', March 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azar Gat]], Professor of National Security at [[Tel Aviv University]], argued this point in his 2007  ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article, "The Return of Authoritarian Great Powers", stating that the success of these two countries could "end the end of history".&lt;ref&gt;A. GAT, "The End of the End of History" in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', July/August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gat also discussed radical Islam, but stated that the movements associated with it "represent no viable alternative to modernity and pose no significant military threat to the developed world". He considered the challenge of China and Russia to be the  major threat, since they could pose a viable rival model which could inspire other states.

This view was echoed by [[Robert Kagan]] in his 2008 book, ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams'', whose title was a deliberate rejoinder to ''The End of History''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111002021637/https://literaryreview.co.uk/burleigh_05_08.html Return of the Dog Pack] (review of ''The Return of History and the End of Dreams''), [[Michael Burleigh]], ''Literary Review'', May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2008 ''Washington Post'' opinion piece, Fukuyama also addressed this point. He wrote, "Despite recent authoritarian advances, liberal democracy remains the strongest, most broadly appealing idea out there. Most autocrats, including [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]], still feel that they have to conform to the outward rituals of democracy even as they gut its substance. Even China's [[Hu Jintao]] felt compelled to talk about democracy in the run-up to [[2008 Summer Olympic|Beijing's Olympic Games]]."&lt;ref name="they can only" /&gt;

===Failure of civil society and political decay===
In 2014, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the original essay, "The End of History?", Fukuyama wrote a column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' again updating his hypothesis. He wrote that, while liberal democracy still had no real competition from more authoritarian systems of government "in the realm of ideas", nevertheless he was less idealistic than he had been "during the heady days of 1989." Fukuyama noted the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] and the [[Arab Spring]], both of which seemed to have failed in their pro-democracy goals, as well as the [[democratic backsliding|"backsliding" of democracy]] in countries including [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]] and [[Nicaragua]]. He stated that the biggest problem for the democratically elected governments in some countries was not ideological but "their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services... that are needed to achieve individual opportunity." Though he believed that economic growth, improved government and civic institutions all reinforced one another, he wrote that it was not inevitable that "all countries will... get on that escalator."&lt;ref name="25 years"&gt;{{cite web |title=At the 'End of History' Still Stands Democracy |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/at-the-end-of-history-still-stands-democracy-1402080661 |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Francis |last=Fukuyama |date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Twenty-five years later, the most serious threat to the end-of-history hypothesis isn't that there is a higher, better model out there that will someday supersede liberal democracy; neither Islamist theocracy nor Chinese capitalism cuts it. Once societies get on the up escalator of industrialization, their social structure begins to change in ways that increase demands for political participation. If political elites accommodate these demands, we arrive at some version of democracy.}}

Fukuyama also warned of "political decay," which he wrote could also affect established democracies like the United States, in which corruption and [[crony capitalism]] erode liberty and economic opportunity. Nevertheless, he expressed his continued belief that "the power of the democratic ideal remains immense."&lt;ref name="25 years" /&gt;

Following Britain's [[Brexit|decision to leave]] the [[European Union]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]] in 2016, Fukuyama feared for the future of liberal democracy in the face of resurgent populism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/|title=The man who declared the ‘end of history’ fears for democracy’s future|author=Ishaan Tharoor|date=2017-02-09|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-now-fearful-of-the-very-fate-of-liberal-democracy|title=The man who declared the 'end of history' now fearful of the very fate of liberal democracy|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-02-09|publisher=National Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/america-the-failed-state-donald-trump|title=America: the failed state|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=Jan 2017|publisher=Prospect Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a "post-fact world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/the-emergence-of-a-post-fact-world-by-francis-fukuyama-2017-01?barrier=accessreg|title=The Emergence of a Post-Fact World|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2017-01-12|publisher=Project Syndicate}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "twenty five years ago, I didn't have a sense or a theory about how democracies can go backward. And I think they clearly can." He also warned that America's political rot was infecting the world order to the point where it "could be as big as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet collapse]]".&lt;ref name=prospect /&gt;

Fukuyama has also stated that his thesis was incomplete, but for a different reason: "there can be no end of history without an end of modern natural science and technology" (quoted from ''[[Our Posthuman Future]]''). Fukuyama predicts that humanity's control of its own [[evolution]] will have a great and possibly terrible effect on liberal democracy.

'''''The English Dialect Dictionary''''' ('''''EDD''''') is a [[dictionary]] of English [[dialect]]s, compiled by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] (1855–1930).

==Overview==

''The English Dialect Dictionary, being the complete vocabulary of all dialect words still in use, or known to have been in use during the last two hundred years; founded on the publications of the English Dialect Society and on a large amount of material never before printed'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 6 volumes between 1898 and 1905. Its compilation and printing was funded privately by Joseph Wright, a self-taught [[philology|philologist]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Vol. 1: A-C; Vol. 2: D-G; Vol. 3: H-L; Vol. 4: M-Q; Vol. 5: R-S; Vol. 6: T-Z, supplement, bibliography and grammar. The content was issued progressively as 28 parts intended for binding into the six volumes with publication dates of 1898, 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 &amp; 1905. Vol. 6 includes an invaluable list of writings in dialect arranged by counties.

Due to the scale of the work, 70,000 entries, and the period in which the information was gathered, it is regarded as a standard work in the historical study of dialect. Wright marked annotations and corrections in a cut-up and rebound copy of the first edition; this copy is among Wright's papers in the [[Bodleian Library]] at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/features/0502wright.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A digitized version of the ''EDD'' has been made available by [[Innsbruck University]], free of charge for non-institutional, non-profit purposes. A scanned version of the work made by [[University of Toronto]] Library is currently available through the [[Internet Archive]].

==English Dialect Grammar==

The sixth volume includes the ''English Dialect Grammar'', which was also published separately.  This included 16,000 dialectal forms across two main sections: 'Phonology', which gave a historical description of the development of sounds in dialect; and 'Accidence', which gave details on grammar and especially on morphology.

Among linguists, the Dialect Grammar has been criticised more than the Dialect Dictionary itself.  Wright has been accused of borrowing material from the work of [[Alexander John Ellis]] that he had previously criticised.  Peter Anderson claimed that Wright did Ellis a "disservice" by criticising the methods used in collecting data, but then using almost identical methods in ''English Dialect Grammar'' and taking on much of Ellis's data for his own work.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, Peter M. 1977. "A New Light on Early English Pronunciation".  Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society part 77, vol. 14.32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Peter Anderson and Graham Shorrocks have argued that Wright distorted Ellis's data by using a less precise phonetic notation and using vague geographical areas rather than the precise locations given by Ellis.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. J. ELLIS AS DIALECTOLOGIST: A REASSESSMENT, Historiographia Linguistica 18:2-3 (1991), page 324&lt;/ref&gt;  Helga Koekeritz stated that Wright's information on the Suffolk dialect was almost entirely derived from Ellis,&lt;ref&gt;Helga Koekeritz, ''Phonology of the Suffolk Dialect, Uppsala, 1932, page vii as quoted in Peter Anderson (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and Warren Maguire has made similar comments about Wright's information on the north-east of England whilst also saying that the Grammar did introduce much new material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/EllisAtlas/Maguire2003.pdf |title="Mr. A. J.

The '''Theatre of Cruelty''' ({{lang-fr|Théâtre de la Cruauté}}, also {{lang-fr|Théâtre cruel}}) is a form of theatre originally developed by [[avant-garde]] French playwright, essayist, and theorist [[Henry Becque]].&lt;ref&gt;https://libretheatre.fr/theatre-dhenry-becque/&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Antonin Artaud]], some 50 years later, is also seen as a main contributor to the genre, notably with ''[[The Theatre and its Double]]''. Originally a member of the surrealist movement, Artaud eventually began to develop his own theatrical theories. The Theatre of Cruelty can be seen as a break from traditional Western theatre and a means by which artists assault the senses of the audience, and allow them to feel the unexpressed emotions of the subconscious. While Artaud was only able to produce one play in his lifetime that reflected the tenets of the Theatre of Cruelty, the works of many theatre artists reflect his theories. These artists include [[Jean Genet]], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], and [[Peter Brook]].

==History==
[[Antonin Artaud]] was a member of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] movement in Paris in the 1930s, and was well known as an actor, playwright, and essayist of [[avant-garde]] theatre.&lt;ref name=Wadsworth&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadsworth|first=W.B.|title=The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama|year=2007|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1-4130-1767-3|pages=941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the avant-garde theatre developed in France from 1914-1939 can be seen as a revolt against tradition. Deeply affected by the events of [[World War I]], the artists of the movement felt increasing skepticism of the existing societal structures that had allowed for global warfare.&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;{{cite book|last=Brockett|first=Oscar G.|title=History of Theatre|year=2007|publisher=Perason Education|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-205-47360-1|pages=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Artaud would eventually break away from surrealism, the movement helped to shape his later theories on the Theatre of Cruelty. Led by [[André Breton]], surrealist theatre reflected a belief that the unconscious mind is a source of artistic truth. In his manifesto on surrealism, Breton writes, "pure psychic automatism, by which is intended to express, verbally, in writing, or by other means, the real process of thought. Thought's dictation, in absence of all control exercised by the reason and outside all esthetic or moral preoccupation."&lt;ref name=Brockett /&gt;

In 1926, in association with surrealist playwright [[Roger Vitrac]], Artaud founded the Theatre Alfred Jarry, which only produced non-realistic drama. The theatre lasted only two years.&lt;ref name=Brockett /&gt;  After his work in surrealist theatre, Artaud went on to develop his theories on the Theatre of Cruelty after he was inspired by a [[Balinese dance]] troupe performance that he viewed at the Paris Colonial Exhibit in 1931.  The performance conventions of Balinese dance were different than any Artaud had previously experienced, and he was struck by the intense physicality of the dancers.&lt;ref name=Bali&gt;{{cite web|title=Artaud and the Balinese Theater|url=http://www.balipurnati.com/All_Updates/2007/ARTAUD%202008%20Workshop%20Text.pdf|publisher=Bali Purnati Center of the Arts|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Artaud went on to publish his major work on the Theatre of Cruelty, ''The Theatre and Its Double'', seven years later in 1937.&lt;ref name=Brockett /&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Artaud BNF.jpg|thumb|Antonin Artaud]]

;Defining Artaud's "theatre" and "cruelty"

In his writings on the Theatre of Cruelty, Artaud points to both "theatre" and "cruelty" that are separate from their colloquial meanings. For Artaud, theatre does not merely refer to a staged performance before a passive audience. The theatre is a practice, which "wakes us up. Nerves and heart," and through which we experience, "immediate violent action," that "inspires us with the fiery magnetism of its images and acts upon us like a spiritual therapeutics whose touch can never be forgotten."&lt;ref name=Excess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorelick|first=Nathan|title=Life in Excess: Insurrection and Expenditure in Antonin Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty|journal=Discourse|year=2011|volume=33|issue=2|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, cruelty does not refer to an act of emotional or physical violence. According to scholar Nathan Gorelick, "Cruelty is, more profoundly, the unrelenting agitation of a life that has become unnecessary, lazy, or removed from a compelling force. The Theatre of Cruelty gives expression to everything that is ‘crime, love, war, or madness' in order to ‘unforgettably root within us the ideas of perpetual conflict, a spasm in which life is continually lacerated, in which everything in creation rises up and asserts itself against our appointed rank.'"&lt;ref name=Excess /&gt;

;Break with Western theatre

Artaud felt that the focus of theatre in the west had become far too narrow—primarily examining the psychological suffering of individuals or the societal struggles of specific groups of people. He wanted to delve into the aspects of the subconscious that he believed were often the root cause of human being's mistreatment of one another.&lt;ref name=unspeakable&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vork|first=Robert|title=The Things No One Can Say: The Unspeakable Act in Artaud's Les Cenci|journal=Modern Drama|year=2013|volume=56|issue=3|pages=306–326|doi=10.3138/md.0517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an assault on the audiences' senses, Artaud was convinced that a theatrical experience could help people purge destructive feelings and experience the joy that society forces them to repress. For Artaud, "the theatre has been created to drain abscesses collectively." &lt;ref name=Brockett /&gt;

;Insufficiency of language

Artaud believed that language was an entirely insufficient means to express trauma.  Accordingly, he felt that words should be stripped of meaning and chosen for their phonic elements. According to scholar Robert Vork, "Speech on the Theatre of Cruelty's stage is reduced to inarticulate sounds, cries, and gibbering screams, no longer inviting a subject into being but seeking to preclude its very existence."&lt;ref name=unspeakable /&gt; Somewhat paradoxically, Artaud claims that his characters are able to express things that others are unable to say. Vork claims, "Artaud seems to be suggesting that his play reveals emotions and experiences that we all attempt to proscribe and are unwilling to acknowledge, but which nevertheless occur."&lt;ref name=unspeakable /&gt;

;"Impossible theatre"

Stephen Barber explains that "the Theatre of Cruelty has often been called an 'impossible theatre'—vital for the purity of inspiration which it generated, but hopelessly vague and metaphorical in its concrete detail."  This impossibility has not prevented others from articulating a version of his principles as the basis for explorations of their own. "Though many of those theatre-artists proclaimed an Artaudian lineage," Susie Tharu argues, "the Artaud they invoke is marked by a commitment as ahistorical and [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Original definition|transcendent]] as their own." There is, she suggests, another Artaud and "the tradition he was midwife to." &lt;ref&gt;See Tharu (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions and staging==
Artaud wanted to abolish the stage and auditorium, and to do away with sets and props and masks. He envisioned the performance space as an empty room with the audience seated in the center and the actors performing all around them. The stage effects included overwhelming sounds and bright lights in order to stun the audience's sensibilities and completely immerse them in the theatrical experience.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Pericles|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Modernism|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artaud believed that he could erode an audience's resistance by using these methods, "addressed first of all to the senses rather than to the mind," because, "the public thinks first with all of its senses."&lt;ref name=Brockett /&gt;

In his lifetime, Artaud only produced one play that put the theories of the Theatre of Cruelty into practice. He staged and directed ''Les Cenci'', adapted from the dramatic work of the same title by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], in 1935 at the Théâtre des Folies-Wagram in Paris.&lt;ref name=Things&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vork|first=Robert|title=Things That No One Can Say: The Unspeakable Act in Artaud's Les Cenci|journal=Modern Drama|date=March 13, 2013|volume=56|issue=3|page=1|doi=10.3138/md.0517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The play was neither a commercial or critical success and ran for only 17 performances. Artaud, however, believed that, while he was forced to limit the scope of his vision due to financial constraints, ''Les Cenci'' succeeded in exemplifying the tenets of the Theatre of Cruelty.&lt;ref name=Things /&gt;

==Legacy==
According to scholar [[Pericles Lewis]], the influences of the Theatre of Cruelty can most clearly be seen in the works of [[Jean Genet]], a post World War II playwright. His plays featured ritualized murder and systemic oppression in order to show the negative consequences and suffering caused by political subjugation.&lt;ref name=Cambridge /&gt; In the 1960s, a number of directors began to incorporate Artaud's theories and staging practices in their work, including [[Jerzy Grotowski]] at the Theater Laboratory in Poland.  In England, famed theatre director [[Peter Brook]] experimented with the Theatre of Cruelty in a series of workshops at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC). These experiments are reflected in his direction and staging of RSC's lauded 1966 production of ''[[Marat/Sade]]'', a play with music by [[Peter Weiss]].&lt;ref name=Abilene&gt;{{cite web|title=Theater of Cruelty|url=http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/siryan/academy/theatres/theatre%20of%20cruelty.htm|work=Styles of Performance – Theater of Cruelty|publisher=Abilene Christian University|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Marat/Sade'' uses dramatic devices developed by both Artaud and [[Brecht]] to depict class struggle and human suffering in the midst of changing social structures.

The [[Germany|German]] dramatist [[Heiner Müller]] argues that we have yet to feel or to appreciate fully Artaud's contribution to theatrical culture; his ideas are, Müller implies, 'untimely' :&lt;ref&gt;For the Brecht-Artaud dialogue in postmodern theatre, see Wright (1989), Price (1990), and Howe Kritzer (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;"The emergency is Artaud. He tore literature away from the police, theater away from medicine. Under the sun of torture, which shines equally on all the continents of this planet, his texts blossom. Read on the ruins of Europe, they will be classics."&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1977), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern activist application==
In 2011, a group of geography and sociology professors used the Theatre of Cruelty as a conceptual, experience based technique to explore the agrarian struggle and [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon Basin]]. These professors:
"…suggest that theater, more generally, provides structure for cruel performance, and that violent land conflict, together with forest destruction, constitutes a predictable tragedy of theatrical events. In other words, violent land conflict in Amazonia, with all its terrible implication for people and environment, can be grasped as a theatrical structure with philosophic and material consequences for mind and body."&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] (5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[economics|economist]], [[sociology|sociologist]], [[historian]], [[journalism|journalist]], and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]]. Marx's work in economics laid the basis for the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and has influenced much of subsequent economic thought. He published numerous books during his lifetime, the most notable being ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Marx studied at the [[University of Bonn]] and the [[University of Berlin]], where he became interested in the philosophical ideas of the [[Young Hegelians]]. After his studies, he wrote for a radical newspaper in [[Cologne]], and began to work out his theory of [[dialectical materialism]]. He moved to Paris in 1843, where he began writing for other radical newspapers and met [[Fredrick Engels]], who would become his lifelong friend and collaborator. In 1849 he was exiled and moved to London together with his wife and children where he continued writing and formulating his theories about social and economic activity. He also campaigned for socialism and became a significant figure in the [[International Workingmen's Association]].

Marx's theories about society, economics and politics – collectively known as [[Marxism]] – hold that human societies progress through [[class struggle]]: a conflict between an ownership class that controls production and a dispossessed labouring class that provides the labour for production. He called [[capitalism]] the "dictatorship of the [[bourgeoisie]]," believing it to be run by the wealthy classes for their own benefit; and he predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. He argued that class antagonisms under capitalism between the bourgeoisie and proletariat would eventuate in the working class' conquest of political power in the form of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and eventually establish a classless society, socialism or communism, a society governed by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]]. Along with believing in the inevitability of socialism and communism, Marx actively fought for their implementation, arguing that social theorists and underprivileged people alike should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic change.

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history. Revolutionary socialist governments espousing Marxist concepts took power in a variety of countries in the 20th century, leading to the formation of such socialist states as the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922 and the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.  Many labour unions and workers' parties worldwide are influenced by Marxism, while various theoretical variants, such as  [[Leninism]], [[Stalinism]], [[Trotskyism]], and [[Maoism]], were developed from them. Marx is typically cited, with [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]], as one of the three principal architects of modern [[social science]].
