'''Alan Gaius Ramsay McIntosh''' (* 1942 in Sydney, † August 8, 2016 ) was an Australian mathematician who dealt with analysis ([[harmonic analysis]], [[partial differential equation]]s). He was a high school teacher at the [[Australian National University]] in Canberra.

McIntosh studied at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] with a bachelor's degree in 1962 (as a student he also received the University Medal ) and PhD in 1966 with [[Frantisek Wolf]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], ( Representation of Accretive Bilinear Forms in Hilbert Space by Maximal Accretive Operator ). In Berkeley, he was also a student of Tosio Kato . As a post-doctoral student, he was at the Institute for Advanced Study and from 1967 he taught at [[Macquarie University]] and from 1999 at the Australian National University. In 2014 he became emeritus.

McIntosh was involved in solving the [[Calderon conjecture]] in the theory of [[singular integral operator]]s.

In 2002, he solved with [[Pascal Auscher]], [[Michael T. Lacey]], [[Philippe Tchamitchian]] and Steve Hofmann the open [[Kato root problem]] for [[elliptic differential operator]]s.

He also deals with [[singular integral operator]]s, [[boundary value problem]]s of partial differential equations with applications (such as [[scattering theory]] of the [[Maxwell equations]] in irregular areas), [[spectral theory]] and [[functional calculus]] of operators in [[Banach space]]s, analysis with [[Clifford algebra]]s, barriers for the [[heat kernel equation]] and functional calculus for [[elliptic partial differential operator]]s.

In 1986 he became a member of the [[Australian Academy of Sciences]], whose [[Hannan Medal]] he received in 2015. In 2002 he received the [[Moyal Medal]] from Macquarie University.

The '''Buddhabrot''' is a [[fractal]] rendering technique related to the [[Mandelbrot set]]. Its name reflects its [[pareidolia|pareidolic]] resemblance to classical depictions of [[Gautama Buddha]], seated in a meditation pose with a forehead mark (''[[Tikka (forehead mark)|tikka]]'') and traditional topknot (''[[ushnisha]]'').

==Discovery==

The ''Buddhabrot'' rendering technique was discovered by Melinda Green (then known as Dan Green),&lt;ref&gt;Melinda Green. [http://www.superliminal.com/fractals/bbrot/bbrot.htm The Buddhabrot Technique].&lt;/ref&gt; who later described it in a 1993 [[Usenet]] post to sci.fractals.&lt;ref name=sci/&gt;

Previous researchers had come very close to finding the precise Buddhabrot technique. In 1988, Linas Vepstas relayed similar images&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linas.org/art-gallery/mandel/mandel.html Linas Vepstas' art gallery].&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Cliff Pickover]] for inclusion in Pickover's then-forthcoming book ''Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty''. This led directly to the discovery of [[Pickover stalks]]. However, these researchers did not filter out non-escaping trajectories required to produce the ghostly forms reminiscent of Hindu art. The inverse, "Anti-Buddhabrot" filter produces images similar to no filtering.

Green first named this pattern Ganesh, since an Indian co-worker "instantly recognized it as the god '[[Ganesha]]' which is the one with the head of an elephant."&lt;ref name=sci&gt;Daniel Green. [https://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;selm=18778%40autodesk.COM The deity hiding in the m-set].&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''Buddhabrot'' was coined later by Lori Gardi.&lt;ref name=wn&gt;Western News: The University of Western Ontario’s newspaper. [http://communications.uwo.ca/western_news/PDF/WNews_Dec04_08.pdf Chaos (theory) rules for software developer (PDF, 12MB)], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rendering method==
Mathematically, the Mandelbrot set consists of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the [[complex plane]] for which the [[iteration|iteratively]] defined [[sequence]]

:&lt;math&gt;z_{n+1} = {z_n}^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;

does ''not'' tend to [[infinity]] as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity for &lt;math&gt;z_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''Buddhabrot'' image can be constructed by first creating a 2-[[dimension]]al [[Array data structure|array]] of boxes, each corresponding to a final pixel in the image.  Each box &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i =1,\ldots,m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j = 1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; has size in complex coordinates of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = w/m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta y = h/n&lt;/math&gt; for an image of width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.  For each box, a corresponding counter is initialized to zero.  Next, a random sampling of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; points are iterated through the Mandelbrot function.  For points which '''do''' escape within a chosen maximum number of iterations, and therefore are ''not'' in the Mandelbrot set, the counter for each box entered during the escape to infinity is incremented by 1.  In other words, for each sequence corresponding to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; that escapes, for each point &lt;math&gt;z_n&lt;/math&gt; during the escape, the box that &lt;math&gt;(\text{Re}(z_n), \text{Im}(z_n))&lt;/math&gt; lies within is incremented by 1.  Points which do not escape within the maximum number of iterations (and considered to be in the Mandelbrot set) are discarded.  After a large number of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; values have been iterated, [[Gray scale|grayscale]] shades are then chosen based on the distribution of values recorded in the array. The result is a density plot highlighting regions where &lt;math&gt;z_n&lt;/math&gt; values spend the most time on their way to infinity.

[[File:anti-buddabrot.jpg|thumb|''Anti-Buddhabrot'']]

==Nuances==
Rendering ''Buddhabrot'' images is typically more computationally intensive than standard Mandelbrot rendering techniques. This is partly due to requiring more random points to be iterated than pixels in the image in order to build up a sharp image. Rendering highly zoomed areas requires even more computation than for standard Mandelbrot images in which a given pixel can be computed directly regardless of zoom level. Conversely, a pixel in a zoomed region of a Buddhabrot image can be affected by initial points from regions far outside the one being rendered. Without resorting to more complex [http://www.steckles.com/buddha/ probabilistic techniques], rendering zoomed portions of ''Buddhabrot'' consists of merely cropping a large full sized rendering.

The maximum number of iterations chosen affects the image&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; higher values give sparser more detailed appearance, as a few of the points pass through a large number of pixels before they escape, resulting in their paths being more prominent. If a lower maximum was used, these points would not escape in time and would be regarded as not escaping at all.

Green later realized that this provided a natural way to create color Buddhabrot images by taking three such [[grayscale]] images, differing only by the maximum number of iterations used, and combining them into a single color image using the same method used by astronomers to create [[false color]] images of nebula and other celestial objects. For example, one could assign a 2,000 max iteration image to the red channel, a 200 max iteration image to the green channel, and a 20 max iteration image to the blue channel of an image in an [[RGB color space]]. Some have labelled Buddhabrot images using this technique ''Nebulabrots''.

==Relation to the logistic map==
[[File:Buddhabrot logistic map.jpg|right|thumb|The Buddhabrot and its logistic map.]]
[[File:Buddhabrot logistic map animation tn.gif|right|thumb|link=Image:Buddhabrot_logistic_map_animation.gif|
Animation depicting the Buddhabrot and its logistic map.]]

The relationship between the [[Mandelbrot set]] as defined by the iteration &lt;math&gt;z^2+c&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[logistic map]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda x(1-x)&lt;/math&gt; is well known. The two are related by the quadratic transformation:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_r&amp;=\frac{\lambda(2-\lambda)}{4}\\
c_i&amp;=0\\
z_r&amp;=-\frac{\lambda(2x-1)}{2}\\
z_i&amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The traditional way of illustrating this relationship is aligning the logistic map and the Mandelbrot set through the relation between &lt;math&gt;c_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, using a common x-axis and a different y-axis, showing a one-dimensional relationship.

Melinda Green discovered 'by accident' that the Anti-Buddhabrot paradigm fully integrates the logistic map. Both are based on tracing paths from non-escaping points, iterated from a (random) starting point, and the iteration functions are related by the transformation given above.  It is then easy to see that the Anti-Buddhabrot for &lt;math&gt;z^2+c&lt;/math&gt;, plotting paths with &lt;math&gt;c=(\text{random},0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_0=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, simply generates the logistic map  in the plane &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt;, when using the given transformation. For rendering purposes we use &lt;math&gt;z_0=(\text{random},0)&lt;/math&gt;. In the logistic map, all &lt;math&gt;z_{r0}&lt;/math&gt; ultimately generate the same path.

Because both the Mandelbrot set and the logistic map are an integral part of the Anti-Buddhabrot we can now show a 3D relationship between both, using the 3D axes
&lt;math&gt;\{c_r,c_i,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt;. The animation shows the classic Anti-Buddhabrot with &lt;math&gt;c=(\text{random},\text{random})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_0=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, this is the 2D Mandelbrot set in the plane
&lt;math&gt;\{c_r,c_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, and also the Anti-Buddhabrot with &lt;math&gt;c=(\text{random},0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_0=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, this is the 2D logistic map in the plane &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt;. We rotate the plane &lt;math&gt;\{c_i,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt; around the &lt;math&gt;c_r&lt;/math&gt;-axis, first showing &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,c_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, then rotating 90° to show &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt;, then rotating an extra 90° to show &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,-c_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. We could rotate an extra 180° but this gives the same images, mirrored around the &lt;math&gt;c_r&lt;/math&gt;-axis.

The logistic map Anti-Buddhabrot is in fact a subset of the classic Anti-Buddhabrot, situated in the plane &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;c_i=0&lt;/math&gt;) of 3D &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,c_i,z_r\}&lt;/math&gt;, perpendicular to the plane &lt;math&gt;\{c_r,c_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. We emphasize this by showing briefly, at 90° rotation, only the projected plane &lt;math&gt;c_i=0&lt;/math&gt;, not 'disturbed' by the projections of the planes with non-zero &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;.{{Clear}}

'''Computable functions''' are the basic objects of study in [[recursion theory|computability theory]]. Computable functions are the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of [[algorithm]], in the sense that a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can do the job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete [[model of computation]] such as [[Turing machine]]s or [[register machine]]s. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.
Particular models of computability that give rise to the set of computable functions are the [[Turing-computable function]]s and the [[μ-recursive function]]s.

Before the precise definition of computable function, [[mathematician]]s often used the informal term ''effectively calculable''.   This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. Note that the effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be ''efficiently'' computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases [[exponential growth|exponentially]] (or even [[Tetration|superexponentially]]) with the length of the input. The fields of [[feasible computability]] and [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] study functions that can be computed efficiently.

According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], computable functions are exactly the functions that can be calculated using a mechanical calculation device given unlimited amounts of time and storage space. Equivalently, this thesis states that a function is computable if and only if it has an algorithm.  Note that an algorithm in this sense is understood to be a sequence of steps a person with unlimited time and an unlimited supply of pen and paper could follow.

The [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define an abstract [[computational complexity theory]] on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of determining the complexity of a computable function is known as a [[function problem]].

==Definition==
{{see also|Total Turing machine}}
Computability of a function is an informal notion. One way to describe it is to say that a function is computable if its value can be obtained by an [[effective method|effective procedure]]. With more rigor, a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb N^k\rightarrow\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;
is computable if and only if there is an effective procedure that, given any {{mvar|k}}-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers, will produce the value &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enderton|first1=Herbert|title=A Mathematical Introduction to Logic|date=2002|publisher=Elsevier|location=USA|isbn=0-12-238452-0|page=209|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; In agreement with this definition, the remainder of this article presumes that computable functions take finitely many [[natural numbers]] as arguments and produce a value which is a single natural number.

As counterparts to this informal description, there exist multiple formal, mathematical definitions. The class of computable functions can be defined in many equivalent [[model of computation|models of computation]], including
* '''[[Turing machine]]s'''
* '''[[μ-recursive function]]s'''
* '''[[Lambda calculus]]'''
* '''Post machines''' ('''[[Post–Turing machine]]s''' and '''[[Tag system|tag machines]]''').
* '''[[Register machine]]s'''
Although these models use different representations for the functions, their inputs and their outputs, translations exist between any two models, and so every model describes essentially the same class of functions, giving rise to the opinion that formal computability is both natural and not too narrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enderton|first1=Herbert|title=A Mathematical Introduction to Logic|date=2002|publisher=Elsevier|location=USA|isbn=0-12-238452-0|page=208,262|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, one can formalize computable functions as [[μ-recursive function]]s, which are [[partial function]]s that take finite [[tuple]]s of [[natural number]]s and return a single natural number (just as above).  They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the constant, successor, and projection functions, and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[function composition|composition]], [[Primitive recursive function|primitive recursion]], and the [[μ operator]].

Equivalently, computable functions can be formalized as functions which can be calculated by an idealized computing agent such as a [[Turing machine]] or a [[register machine]]. Formally speaking, a [[partial function]] &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb N^k\rightarrow\mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated if and only if there exists a computer program with the following properties:
# If &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined, then the program will terminate on the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; with the value &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; stored in the computer memory.
# If &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, then the program never terminates on the input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;.

== Characteristics of computable functions ==

{{main|Algorithm}}

The basic characteristic of a computable function is that there must be a finite procedure (an [[algorithm]]) telling how to compute the function.  The models of computation listed above give different interpretations of what a procedure is and how it is used, but these interpretations share many properties.  The fact that these models give equivalent classes of computable functions stems from the fact that each model is capable of reading and mimicking a procedure for any of the other models, much as a [[compiler]] is able to read instructions in one computer language and emit instructions in another language.

[[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] [1977] gives the following characteristics of a procedure for computing a computable function; similar characterizations have been given by Turing [1936], Rogers [1967], and others.
* "There must be exact instructions (i.e. a program), finite in length, for the procedure."
Thus every computable function must have a finite program that completely describes how the function is to be computed.  It is possible to compute the function by just following the instructions; no guessing or special insight is required.
* "If the procedure is given a ''k''-tuple '''x''' in the domain of ''f'', then after a finite number of discrete steps the procedure must terminate and produce ''f('''x''')''."
Intuitively, the procedure proceeds step by step, with a specific rule to cover what to do at each step of the calculation.  Only finitely many steps can be carried out before the value of the function is returned.
* "If the procedure is given a ''k''-tuple '''x''' which is not in its domain of ''f'', then the procedure might go on forever, never halting.  Or it might get stuck at some point (i.e., one of its instructions cannot be executed), but it must not pretend to produce a value for ''f'' at '''x'''."
Thus if a value for ''f('''x''')'' is ever found, it must be the correct value. It is not necessary for the computing agent to distinguish correct outcomes from incorrect ones because the procedure is always correct when it produces an outcome.

Enderton goes on to list several clarifications of these 3 requirements of the procedure for a computable function:&lt;!-- must be enumerated for the "#Church–Turing thesis" below--&gt;
# The procedure must theoretically work for arbitrarily large arguments. It is not assumed that the arguments are smaller than the number of atoms in the Earth, for example.
# The procedure is required to halt after finitely many steps in order to produce an output, but it may take arbitrarily many steps before halting. No time limitation is assumed.
# Although the procedure may use only a finite amount of storage space during a successful computation, there is no bound on the amount of space that is used.  It is assumed that additional storage space can be given to the procedure whenever the procedure asks for it.

To summarise, based on this view a function is computable if: (a) given an input from its domain, possibly relying on unbounded storage space, it can give the corresponding output by following a procedure (program, algorithm) that is formed by a finite number of exact unambiguous instructions; (b) it returns such output (halts) in a finite number of steps; and (c) if given an input which is not in its domain it either never halts or it gets stuck.

The field of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] studies functions with prescribed bounds on the time and/or space allowed in a successful computation.

A set {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} of natural numbers is called '''computable''' (synonyms: '''recursive''', '''decidable''') if there is a computable, total function {{math|''f''}} such that for any natural number {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 1}} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is in {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 0}} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is not in {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}}.

A set of natural numbers is called '''computably enumerable''' (synonyms: '''recursively enumerable''', '''semidecidable''') if there is a computable function {{math|''f''}} such that for each number {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}, {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;)}} is defined [[if and only if]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} is in the set.  Thus a set is computably enumerable if and only if it is the domain of some computable function.  The word ''enumerable'' is used because the following are equivalent for a nonempty subset {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}} of the natural numbers:
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}} is the domain of a computable function.
* {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}} is the range of a total computable function.  If {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}} is infinite then the function can be assumed to be [[injective]].
If a set {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}} is the range of a function {{math|''f''}} then the function can be viewed as an
enumeration of {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}}, because the list {{math|''f''(0), ''f''(1), ...}} will include every element of {{math|&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;}}.

Because each [[finitary relation]] on the natural numbers can be identified with a corresponding set of finite sequences of natural numbers, the notions of '''computable relation''' and '''computably enumerable relation''' can be defined from their analogues for sets.

==  Formal languages ==
{{main|Formal language}}''

In [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory in computer science]], it is common to consider [[formal language]]s.   An '''alphabet''' is an arbitrary set.  A '''word''' on an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet; the same symbol may be used more than once.  For example, binary strings are exactly the words on the alphabet {{math|{0, 1} }}.  A '''language''' is a subset of the collection of all words on a fixed alphabet. For example, the collection of all binary strings that contain exactly 3 ones is a language over the binary alphabet.

A key property of a formal language is the level of difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language.  Some coding system must be developed to allow a computable function to take an arbitrary word in the language as input; this is usually considered routine.  A language is called '''computable''' (synonyms: '''recursive''', '''decidable''') if there is a computable function {{math|''f''}} such that for each word {{math|&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;}} over the alphabet, {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 1}} if the word is in the language and {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 0}} if the word is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language.

A language is '''computably enumerable''' (synonyms: '''recursively enumerable''', '''semidecidable''') if there is a computable function {{math|''f''}} such that {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;)}} is defined if and only if the word {{math|&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;}} is in the language.  The term ''enumerable'' has the same etymology as in computably enumerable sets of natural numbers.

==Examples==

The following functions are computable:

* Each function with a finite [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]; e.g., any finite sequence of natural numbers.
* Each [[constant function]] ''f'' : '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''N''',  ''f''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) := ''n''.
* [[Addition]] ''f'' : '''N'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → '''N''', ''f''(''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;) := ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* The function which gives the list of prime factors of a number.
* The [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers is a computable function.
* [[Bézout's identity]], a linear [[Diophantine equation]]

If ''f'' and ''g'' are computable, then so are: ''f'' + ''g'', [[Multiplication|''f'' * ''g'']], [[Function composition|&lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;]] if
''f'' is [[Unary operation|unary]], max(''f'',''g''), min(''f'',''g''), [[arg max]]{''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'')}  and many more combinations.

The following examples illustrate that a function may be computable though it is not known which algorithm computes it.

* The function ''f'' such that ''f''(''n'') = 1 if there is a sequence of ''at least n'' consecutive fives in the decimal expansion of [[Pi|π]], and ''f''(''n'') = 0 otherwise, is computable. (The function ''f'' is either the constant 1 function, which is computable, or else there is a ''k'' such that ''f''(''n'') = 1 if ''n'' &lt; ''k'' and ''f''(''n'') = 0 if ''n'' ≥ ''k''.  Every such function is computable.  It is not known whether there are arbitrarily long runs of fives in the decimal expansion of π, so we don't know ''which'' of those functions is ''f''.  Nevertheless, we know that the function ''f'' must be computable.)
* Each finite segment of an ''un''computable sequence of natural numbers (such as the [[Busy beaver#The busy beaver function Σ|Busy Beaver function]] ''Σ'') is computable.  E.g., for each natural number ''n'', there exists an algorithm that computes the finite sequence Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(''n'') — in contrast to the fact that there is no algorithm that computes the ''entire'' Σ-sequence, i.e. Σ(''n'') for all ''n''. Thus, "Print 0, 1, 4, 6, 13" is a trivial algorithm to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), Σ(3), Σ(4); similarly, for any given value of ''n'', such a trivial algorithm ''exists'' (even though it may never be ''known'' or produced by anyone) to compute Σ(0), Σ(1), Σ(2), ..., Σ(''n'').

== Church–Turing thesis ==

{{main|Church–Turing thesis}}

The '''Church–Turing thesis''' states that any function computable from a procedure possessing the three properties listed [[#Characteristics of computable functions|above]] is a computable function.  Because these three properties are not formally stated, the Church–Turing thesis cannot be proved.  The following facts are often taken as evidence for the thesis:
* Many equivalent models of computation are known, and they all give the same definition of computable function (or a weaker version, in some instances).
* No stronger model of computation which is generally considered to be [[effectively calculable]] has been proposed.

The Church–Turing thesis is sometimes used in proofs to justify that a particular function is computable by giving a concrete description of a procedure for the computation.  This is permitted because it is believed that all such uses of the thesis can be removed by the tedious process of writing a formal procedure for the function in some model of computation.

== Provability ==

Given a function (or, similarly, a set), one may be interested not only if it is computable, but also whether this can be ''proven'' in a particular proof system (usually [[first-order logic|first order]] [[Peano arithmetic]]). A function that can be proven to be computable is called '''provably total'''.

The set of provably total functions is [[recursively enumerable]]: one can enumerate all the provably total functions by enumerating all their corresponding proofs, that prove their computability. This can be done by enumerating all the proofs of the proof system and ignoring irrelevant ones.

=== Relation to recursively defined functions ===

In a function defined by a [[recursive definition]], each value is defined by a fixed first-order formula of other, previously defined values of the same function or other functions, which might be simply constants. A subset of these is the [[primitive recursive function]]s. Every such function is provably total: For such a [[arity|k-ary]] function ''f'', each value &lt;math&gt;f(n_1, n_2... n_k)&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by following the definition backwards, iteratively, and after finite number of iteration (as can be easily proven), a constant is reached.

The converse is not true, as not every provably total function is primitive recursive. Indeed, one can enumerate all the primitive recursive functions and define a function ''en'' such that for all ''n'', ''m'': ''en''(''n'',''m'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m''), where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the n-th primitive recursive function (for [[arity|k-ary]] functions, this will be set to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''m'',''m''...''m'')). Now, ''g''(''n'') = ''en''(''n'',''n'')+1 is provably total but not primitive recursive, by a [[diagonal lemma|diagonalization]] argument: had there been a ''j'' such that ''g'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, we would have got ''g''(''j'') = ''en''(''j'',''j'')+1 = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; (''j'')+1= ''g''(''j'')+1, a contradiction. (It should be noted that the [[Gödel number]]s of all primitive recursive functions ''can'' be enumerated by a primitive recursive function, though the primitive recursive functions' values cannot).

One such function, which is provable total but not primitive recursive, is [[Ackermann function]]: since it is recursively defined, it is indeed easy to prove its computability (However, a similar diagonalization argument can also be built for all functions defined by recursive definition; thus, there are provable total functions that cannot be defined recursively {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}).

=== Total functions that are not provably total ===

In a [[soundness|sound]] proof system, every provably total function is indeed total, but the converse is not true: in every first-order proof system that is strong enough and sound (including Peano arithmetic), one can prove (in another proof system) the existence of total functions that cannot be proven total in the proof system.

If the total computable functions are enumerated via the Turing machines that produces them, then the above statement can be shown, if the proof system is sound, by a similar diagonalization argument to that used above, using the enumeration of provably total functions given earlier. One uses a Turing machine that enumerates the relevant proofs, and for every input ''n'' calls  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') (where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''n''-th function by ''this'' enumeration) by invoking the Turing machine that computes it according to the n-th proof. Such a Turing machine is guaranteed to halt if the proof system is sound.

== Uncomputable functions and unsolvable problems ==
{{main|List of undecidable problems}}

Every computable function has a finite procedure giving explicit, unambiguous instructions on how to compute it. Furthermore, this procedure has to be encoded in the finite alphabet used by the computational model, so there are only [[countability|countably]] many computable functions. For example, functions may be encoded using a string of bits (the alphabet {{math|&amp;Sigma; {{=}} {0, 1}}}).

The real numbers are uncountable so most real numbers are not computable.  See [[Computable number#Properties|computable number]]. The set of [[finitary]] functions on the natural numbers is uncountable so most are not computable.  Concrete examples of such functions are [[Busy beaver]], [[Kolmogorov complexity]], or any function that outputs the digits of a noncomputable number, such as [[Chaitin's constant]].

Similarly, most subsets of the natural numbers are not computable. The [[halting problem]] was the first such set to be constructed. The [[Entscheidungsproblem]], proposed by [[David Hilbert]], asked whether there is an effective procedure to determine which mathematical statements (coded as natural numbers) are true.  Turing and Church independently showed in the 1930s that this set of natural numbers is not computable.  According to the Church–Turing thesis, there is no effective procedure (with an algorithm) which can perform these computations.

==Extensions of computability==

===Relative computability===

The notion of computability of a function can be [[relative computability|relativized]] to an arbitrary [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s ''A''.  A function ''f'' is defined to be '''computable in ''A''''' (equivalently '''''A''-computable''' or '''computable relative to ''A''''') when it satisfies the definition of a computable function with modifications allowing access to ''A'' as an [[oracle (computability)|oracle]].  As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation.  This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of ''A''.  We can also talk about ''f'' being '''computable in ''g''''' by identifying ''g'' with its graph.

===Higher recursion theory===

[[Hyperarithmetical theory]] studies those sets that can be computed from a [[computable ordinal]] number of iterates of the [[Turing jump]] of the empty set.  This is equivalent to sets defined by both a universal and existential formula in the language of second order arithmetic and to some models of [[Hypercomputation]].  Even more general recursion theories have been studied, such as '''E-recursion theory''' in which any set can be used as an argument to an E-recursive function.

===Hyper-computation===
Although the Church–Turing thesis states that the computable functions include all functions with algorithms, it is possible to consider broader classes of functions that relax the requirements that algorithms must possess.  The field of [[Hypercomputation]] studies models of computation that go beyond normal Turing computation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13644">In [[mathematics]] and [[probability theory]], '''continuum percolation theory''' is a branch of mathematics that extends discrete [[percolation theory]] to [[continuous space]] (often [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}). More specifically, the underlying points of discrete percolation form types of lattices whereas the underlying points of continuum percolation are often randomly positioned in some continuous space and form a type of [[point process]]. For each point, a random shape is frequently placed on it and the shapes overlap each with other to form clumps or components. As in discrete percolation, a common research focus of continuum percolation is studying the conditions of occurrence for infinite or giant components.&lt;ref name="meester1996continuum"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.|last=Meester|title=Continuum Percolation|volume=119|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1996|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"&gt;{{cite book|first1=M.|last1=Franceschetti|first2=R.|last2=Meester|title=Random Networks for Communication: From Statistical Physics to Information Systems|volume=24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shared concepts and analysis techniques exist in these two types of percolation theory as well as the study of [[random graphs]] and [[random geometric graphs]].

==Early history==

In the early 1960s [[Edgar Gilbert]]&lt;ref name="gilbert1961random"/&gt; proposed a mathematical model in wireless networks that gave rise to the field of continuum percolation theory, thus generalizing discrete percolation.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt; The underlying points of this model, sometimes known as the Gilbert disk model, were scattered uniformly in the infinite plane {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} according to a homogeneous [[Poisson process]]. Gilbert, who had noticed similarities between discrete and continuum percolation,&lt;ref name="hall1985continuum"&gt;{{cite journal|first=P.|last=Hall|title=On continuum percolation|journal=The Annals of Probability|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1250–1266|date=1985|doi=10.1214/aop/1176992809}}&lt;/ref&gt; then used concepts and techniques from the probability subject of [[branching processes]] to show that a [[Percolation threshold|threshold value]] existed for the infinite or "giant" component.

==Definitions and terminology==

The exact names, terminology, and definitions of these models may vary slightly depending on the source, which is also reflected in the use of [[point process notation]].

===Common models===

A number of well-studied models exist in continuum percolation, which are often based on homogeneous [[Poisson point process]]es.

====Disk model====

Consider a collection of points {{math|{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} in the plane {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} that form a homogeneous Poisson process {{math|''Φ''}} with constant (point) density {{math|''λ''}}. For each point of the Poisson process (i.e. {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''Φ''}}, place a disk {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with its center located at the point {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If each disk {{math|''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has a random radius {{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (from a common [[Probability distribution|distribution]]) that is [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] of all the other radii and all the underlying points {{math|{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, then the resulting mathematical structure is known as a random disk model.

====Boolean model====

Given a random disk model, if the set union of all the disks {{math|{''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} is taken, then the resulting structure {{math|⋃&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is known as a Boolean–Poisson model (also known as simply the [[Boolean model (probability theory)|Boolean model]]),&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;{{cite book|first1=D.|last1=Stoyan|first2=W. S.|last2=Kendall|first3=J.|last3=Mecke|first4=L.|last4=Ruschendorf|title=Stochastic Geometry and Its Applications|volume=2|publisher=Wiley Chichester|date=1995|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a commonly studied model in continuum percolation&lt;ref name="meester1996continuum"/&gt; as well as [[stochastic geometry]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; If all the radii are set to some common constant, say, {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}}, then the resulting model is sometimes known as the Gilbert disk (Boolean) model.&lt;ref name="balister2008percolation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balister|first1=Paul|last2=Sarkar|first2=Amites|last3=Bollobás|first3=Béla|contribution=Percolation, connectivity, coverage and colouring of random geometric graphs|title=Handbook of Large-Scale Random Networks|pages=117–142|date=2008|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Booleanpercolation.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Percolation in the Boolean–Poisson (constant disk) model.|Simulation of 4 Poisson–Boolean (constant-radius or Gilbert disk) models as the density increases with largest clusters in red.]]

====Germ-grain model====

The disk model can be generalized to more arbitrary shapes where, instead of a disk, a random [[Compact space|compact]] (hence bounded and closed in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) shape {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is placed on each point {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Again, each shape {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has a common [[Probability distribution|distribution]] and [[Independence (probability theory)|independent]] to all other shapes and the underlying (Poisson) point process. This model is known as the germ–grain model where the underlying points {{math|{''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} are the ''germs'' and the random compact shapes {{math|S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the ''grains''. The [[set union]] of all the shapes forms a Boolean germ-grain model. Typical choices for the grains include disks, random [[polygon]] and segments of random length.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

Boolean models are also examples of [[stochastic processes]] known as coverage processes.&lt;ref name="hall1988introduction"&gt;{{cite book|first=P.|last=Hall|title=Introduction to the theory of coverage processes|volume=1|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|date=1988|isbn=}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The above models can be extended from the plane {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to general Euclidean space {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

===Components and criticality===

In the Boolean–Poisson model, disks there can be isolated groups or clumps of disks that do not contact any other clumps of disks. These clumps are known as components. If the area (or volume in higher dimensions) of a component is infinite, one says it is an infinite or "giant" component. A major focus of percolation theory is establishing the conditions when giant components exist in models, which has parallels with the study of random networks. If no big component exists, the model is said to be subcritical. The conditions of giant component criticality naturally depend on parameters of the model such as the density of the underlying point process.

==Excluded area theory==
The excluded area of a placed object is defined as the minimal area around the object into which an additional object cannot be placed without overlapping with the first object. For example, in a system of randomly oriented homogeneous rectangles of length {{math|''l''}}, width {{math|''w''}} and aspect ratio {{math|''r'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''l''|''w''}}}}, the average excluded area is given by:&lt;ref name="LiÖstling2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jiantong|last2=Östling|first2=Mikael|title=Percolation thresholds of two-dimensional continuum systems of rectangles|journal=Physical Review E|volume=88|issue=1|year=2013|issn=1539-3755|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.88.012101|bibcode=2013PhRvE..88a2101L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_r = 2lw\left(1+\frac{4}{\pi^2}\right) + \frac{2}{\pi}\left(l^2+w^2\right) = 2l^2 \left[ \frac{1}{r}\left( 1+\frac{4}{\pi^2} \right) + \frac{1}{\pi} \left( 1+\frac{1}{r^2} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

In a system of identical ellipses with semi-axes {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} and ratio {{math|''r'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}}, and perimeter {{math|''C''}}, the average excluded areas is given by:&lt;ref name="LiÖstling2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Jiantong|last2=Östling|first2=Mikael|title=Precise percolation thresholds of two-dimensional random systems comprising overlapping ellipses|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications|volume=462|year=2016|pages=940–950|issn=0378-4371|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2016.06.020|bibcode=2016PhyA..462..940L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_r = 2\pi ab + \frac{C^2}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

The excluded area theory states that the critical number density (percolation threshold) {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} of a system is inversely proportional to the average excluded area {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{c} \propto A_r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
It has been shown via Monte-Carlo simulations that percolation threshold in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems of rectangles or ellipses is dominated by the average excluded areas and can be approximated fairly well by the linear relation
:&lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{c}-N_{\mathrm{c}0} \propto A_r^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
with a proportionality constant in the range 3.1–3.5.&lt;ref name="LiÖstling2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LiÖstling2016"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:BooleanCellCoverage.svg|thumb|left|alt=Possible coverage model.|A Boolean model as a coverage model in a wireless network.]]
The applications of percolation theory are various and range from material sciences to [[wireless communication]] systems. Often the work involves showing that a type of [[phase transition]] occurs in the system.

===Wireless networks===

Wireless networks are sometimes best represented with stochastic models owing to their complexity and unpredictability, hence continuum percolation have been used to develop [[stochastic geometry models of wireless networks]]. For example, the tools of continuous percolation theory and coverage processes have been used to study the coverage and connectivity of [[sensor network]]s.&lt;ref name="dousse2004latency"&gt;{{cite book|first1=O.|last1=Dousse|first2=P.|last2=Mannersalo|first3=P.|last3=Thiran|contribution=Latency of wireless sensor networks with uncoordinated power saving mechanisms|title=Proceedings of the 5th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking and Computing|pages=109–120|publisher=ACM|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gui2004power"&gt;{{cite book|first1=C.|last1=Gui|first2=P.|last2=Mohapatra|contribution=Power conservation and quality of surveillance in target tracking sensor networks|title=Proceedings of the 10th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking|pages=129–143|publisher=ACM|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main limitations of these networks is energy consumption where usually each node has a battery and an embedded form of energy harvesting. To reduce energy consumption in sensor networks, various sleep schemes have been suggested that entail having a subcollection of nodes go into a low energy-consuming sleep mode. These sleep schemes obviously affect the coverage and connectivity of sensor networks. Simple power-saving models have been proposed such as the simple uncoordinated 'blinking' model where (at each time interval) each node independently powers down (or up) with some fixed probability. Using the tools of percolation theory, a blinking Boolean Poisson model has been analyzed to study the [[latency (engineering)|latency]] and connectivity effects of such a simple power scheme.&lt;ref name="dousse2004latency"/&gt;

In [[computability theory]], '''course-of-values recursion''' is a technique for defining [[number-theoretic function]]s by [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. In a definition of a function ''f'' by course-of-values recursion, the value of ''f''(''n''+1) is computed from the sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle f(1),f(2),\ldots,f(n)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. 

The fact that such definitions can be converted into definitions using a simpler form of recursion is often used to prove that functions defined by course-of-values recursion are [[primitive recursive]]. Contrary to course-of-values recursion, in primitive recursion the computation of a value of a function requires only the previous value; for example, for a [[arity|1-ary]] primitive recursive function ''g'' the value of ''g''(''n''+1) is computed only from ''g''(''n'') and ''n''.

==Definition and examples ==
The factorial function ''n''! is recursively defined by the rules
:&lt;math&gt;0! = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)! = n!(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;
This recursion is a '''primitive recursion''' because it computes the next value (''n''+1)! of the function based on the value of ''n'' and the previous value ''n''! of the function.  On the other hand, the function Fib(''n''), which returns the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]], is defined with the recursion equations
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(0)  = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(1) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Fib(n+2) = Fib(n+1) + Fib(n).&lt;/math&gt;
In order to compute Fib(''n''+2), the last ''two'' values of the Fib function are required. Finally, consider the function ''g'' defined with the recursion equations
:&lt;math&gt;g(0) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n+1) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} g(i)^{n-i}.&lt;/math&gt;
To compute ''g''(''n''+1) using these equations, all the previous values of ''g'' must be computed; no fixed finite number of previous values is sufficient in general for the computation of ''g''.  The functions Fib and ''g'' are examples of functions defined by course-of-values recursion. 

In general, a function ''f'' is defined by '''course-of-values recursion''' if there is a fixed primitive recursive function ''h'' such that for all ''n'', 
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(n,\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Gödel_numbering_for_sequences|Gödel number]] encoding the indicated sequence.
In particular
:&lt;math&gt;f(0) = h(0,\langle\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
provides the initial value of the recursion. The function ''h'' might test its first argument to provide explicit initial values, for instance for Fib one could use the function defined by
:&lt;math&gt;h(n,s)=\begin{cases}n&amp;\text{if }n&lt;2\\ s[n-2]+s[n-1]&amp;\text{if }n\geq2\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s''[''i''] denotes extraction of the element ''i'' from an encoded sequence ''s''; this is easily seen to be a primitive recursive function (assuming an appropriate Gödel numbering is used).

==Equivalence to primitive recursion ==

In order to convert a definition by course-of-values recursion into a primitive recursion, an auxiliary (helper) function is used. Suppose that one wants to have
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(n,\langle f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
To define {{math|''f''}} using primitive recursion, first define the auxiliary '''course-of-values function''' that should satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n) = \langle  f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where the right hand side is taken to be a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]].

Thus &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n)&lt;/math&gt; encodes the first {{math|''n''}} values of {{math|''f''}}. The function &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; can be defined by primitive recursion because &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by appending to &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n)&lt;/math&gt; the new element &lt;math&gt;h(n,\bar{f}(n))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(0) = \langle\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1) = \mathit{append}(n,\bar{f}(n),h(n,\bar{f}(n))),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''append''(''n'',''s'',''x'')}} computes, whenever {{math|''s''}} encodes a sequence of length {{math|''n''}}, a new sequence {{math|''t''}} of length {{math|''n'' + 1}} such that {{math|''t''[''n''] {{=}} ''x''}} and {{math|''t''[''i''] {{=}} ''s''[''i'']}} for all {{math|''i'' &amp;lt; ''n''}}. This is a primitive recursive function, under the assumption of an appropriate Gödel numbering; ''h'' is assumed primitive recursive to begin with. Thus the recursion relation can be written as primitive recursion:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(n+1) = g(n,\bar{f}(n))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is itself primitive recursive, being the composition of two such functions:
:&lt;math&gt;g(i,j) = \mathit{append}(i,j,h(i,j)),&lt;/math&gt;

Given &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt;, the original function {{math|''f''}} can be defined by &lt;math&gt;f(n)=\bar{f}(n+1)[n]&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that it is also a primitive recursive function.

==Application to primitive recursive functions==
In the context of [[primitive recursive function]]s, it is convenient to have a means to represent finite sequences of natural numbers as single natural numbers.  One such method, [[Gödel's encoding]], represents a sequence of positive integers &lt;math&gt;\langle n_0,n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i = 0}^k p_i^{n_i}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the ''i''th prime.  It can be shown that, with this representation, the ordinary operations on sequences are all primitive recursive.  These operations include
*Determining the length of a sequence,
*Extracting an element from a sequence given its index,
*Concatenating two sequences. 
Using this representation of sequences, it can be seen that if ''h''(''m'') is primitive recursive then the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = h(\langle f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(n-1)\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.
is also primitive recursive.

When the sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle n_0,n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to include zeros, it is instead represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{i = 0}^k p_i^{(n_i +1)}&lt;/math&gt;,
which makes it possible to distinguish the codes for the sequences &lt;math&gt;\langle 0 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle 0,0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

== Limitations ==
Not every recursive definition can be transformed into a primitive recursive definition. One known example is [[Ackermann's function]], which is of the form ''A''(''m'',''n'') and is provably not primitive recursive.

Indeed, every new value ''A''(''m''+1, ''n'') depends on the sequence of previously defined values ''A''(''i'', ''j''), but the ''i''-s and ''j''-s for which values should be included in this sequence depend themselves on previously computed values of the function; namely (''i'', ''j'') =  (''m'',''A''(''m''+1,''n'')). Thus one cannot encode the previously computed sequence of values in a primitive recursive way in the manner suggested above (or at all, as it turns out this function is not primitive recursive).

In [[mathematics]], the '''Dedekind numbers''' are a rapidly growing [[integer sequence|sequence of integers]] named after [[Richard Dedekind]], who defined them in 1897. The Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') counts the number of [[Monotone boolean function|monotonic Boolean functions]] of ''n'' variables. Equivalently, it counts the [[Antichain#Integer sequences|number of antichains]] of subsets of an ''n''-element set, the number of elements in a [[free distributive lattice]] with ''n'' generators, or the number of [[abstract simplicial complex]]es with ''n'' elements.

Accurate [[asymptotic expansion|asymptotic]] estimates of ''M''(''n'')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kleitman|Markowsky|1975}}; {{harvtxt|Korshunov|1981}}; {{harvtxt|Kahn|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an exact expression as a [[summation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are known. However '''Dedekind's problem''' of computing the values of ''M''(''n'') remains difficult: no closed-form expression for ''M''(''n'') is known, and exact values of ''M''(''n'') have been found only for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wiedemann|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
A [[Boolean function]] is a function that takes as input ''n'' [[Boolean data type|Boolean variables]] (that is, values that can be either false or true, or equivalently [[bit|binary values]] that can be either 0 or 1), and produces as output another Boolean variable. It is [[monotonic]] if, for every combination of inputs, switching one of the inputs from false to true can only cause the output to switch from false to true and not from true to false. The Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') is the number of different monotonic Boolean functions on ''n'' variables.

An [[antichain]] of sets (also known as a [[Sperner family]]) is a family of sets, none of which is contained in any other set. If ''V'' is a set of ''n'' Boolean variables, an antichain ''A'' of subsets of ''V'' defines a monotone Boolean function ''f'', where the value of ''f'' is true for a given set of inputs if some subset of the true inputs to ''f'' belongs to ''A'' and false otherwise. Conversely every monotone Boolean function defines in this way an antichain, of the minimal subsets of Boolean variables that can force the function value to be true. Therefore, the Dedekind number ''M''(''n'') equals the number of different antichains of subsets of an ''n''-element set.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kahn|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third, equivalent way of describing the same class of objects uses [[lattice theory]]. From any two monotone Boolean functions ''f'' and ''g'' we can find two other monotone Boolean functions ''f'' ∧ ''g'' and ''f'' ∨ ''g'', their [[logical conjunction]] and [[logical disjunction]] respectively. The family of all monotone Boolean functions on ''n'' inputs, together with these two operations, forms a [[distributive lattice]], the lattice given by [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] from the [[partially ordered set]] of subsets of the ''n'' variables with set inclusion as the partial order. This construction produces the [[free distributive lattice]] with ''n'' generators.&lt;ref&gt;The definition of free distributive lattices used here allows as lattice operations any finite meet and join, including the empty meet and empty join. For the free distributive lattice in which only pairwise meets and joins are allowed, one should eliminate the top and bottom lattice elements and subtract two from the Dedekind numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Dedekind numbers count the number of elements in free distributive lattices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Church|1940}}; {{harvtxt|Church|1965}}; {{harvtxt|Zaguia|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dedekind numbers also count (one more than) the number of [[abstract simplicial complex]]es on ''n'' elements, families of sets with the property that any subset of a set in the family also belongs to the family. Any antichain determines a simplicial complex, the family of subsets of antichain members, and conversely the maximal simplices in a complex form an antichain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
For ''n'' = 2, there are six monotonic Boolean functions and six antichains of subsets of the two-element set {''x'',''y''}:
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;false that ignores its input values and always returns false corresponds to the [[empty set|empty antichain]] Ø.
*The [[logical conjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x'',''y''} } containing the single set {''x'',''y''}.
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' that ignores its second argument and returns the first argument corresponds to the antichain { {''x''} } containing the single set {''x''}
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''y'' that ignores its first argument and returns the second argument corresponds to the antichain { {''y''} } containing the single set {''y''}
*The [[logical disjunction]] ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''y'' corresponds to the antichain { {''x''}, {''y''} } containing the two sets {''x''} and {''y''}.
*The function ''f''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true that ignores its input values and always returns true corresponds to the antichain {Ø} containing only the empty set.

== Values ==
The exact values of the Dedekind numbers are known for 0 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 8:

:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}.

The first six of these numbers are given by {{harvtxt|Church|1940}}. ''M''(6) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Ward|1946}}, ''M''(7) was calculated by {{harvtxt|Church|1965}} and {{harvtxt|Berman|Köhler|1976}}, and ''M''(8) by {{harvtxt|Wiedemann|1991}}.

If ''n'' is even, then ''M''(''n'') must also be even.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Yamamoto|1953}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The calculation of the fifth Dedekind number ''M''(5)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7581 disproved a conjecture by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] that ''M''(''n'') is always divisible by (2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)(2''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Church|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summation formula ==
{{harvtxt|Kisielewicz|1988}} rewrote the logical definition of antichains into the following arithmetic formula for the Dedekind numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;M(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2^n}} \prod_{j=1}^{2^n-1} \prod_{i=0}^{j-1} \left(1-b_i^k b_j^k\prod_{m=0}^{\log_2 i} (1-b_m^i+b_m^i b_m^j)\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;b_i^k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th [[bit]] of the number &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,
which can be written using the [[floor function]] as
:&lt;math&gt;b_i^k=\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^i}\right\rfloor - 2\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2^{i+1}}\right\rfloor.&lt;/math&gt;
However, this formula is not helpful for computing the values of ''M''(''n'') for large ''n'' due to the large number of terms in the summation.

== Asymptotics ==
The [[logarithm]] of the Dedekind numbers can be estimated accurately via the bounds
:&lt;math&gt;{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\le \log_2 M(n)\le {n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\left(1+O\left(\frac{\log n}{n}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Here the left inequality counts the number of antichains in which each set has exactly &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/2\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; elements, and the right inequality was proven by {{harvtxt|Kleitman|Markowsky|1975}}.

{{harvtxt|Korshunov|1981}} provided the even more accurate estimates&lt;ref name="z93"&gt;{{harvtxt|Zaguia|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor}\exp a(n)&lt;/math&gt;
for even ''n'', and
:&lt;math&gt;M(n) = (1+o(1)) 2^{n\choose \lfloor n/2\rfloor + 1}\exp (b(n)+c(n))&lt;/math&gt;
for odd ''n'', where
:&lt;math&gt;a(n)={n\choose n/2-1}(2^{-n/2} + n^2 2^{-n-5} - n2^{-n-4}),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b(n)={n\choose (n-3)/2}(2^{-(n+3)/2} + n^2 2^{-n-6} - n2^{-n-3}),&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;c(n)={n\choose (n-1)/2}(2^{-(n+1)/2} + n^2 2^{-n-4}).&lt;/math&gt;
The main idea behind these estimates is that, in most antichains, all the sets have sizes that are very close to ''n''/2.&lt;ref name="z93" /&gt; For ''n'' = 2, 4, 6, 8 Korshunov's formula provides an estimate that is inaccurate by a factor of 9.8%, 10.2%, 4.1%, and -3.3%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K.

[[Image:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first edition]]
The {{lang|la|'''Disquisitiones Arithmeticae'''}} (Latin for "Arithmetical Investigations") is a textbook of [[number theory]] written in Latin&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalebooks.com/book/9780300094732/disquisitiones-arithmeticae ''Disquisitiones Arithmeticae''] at Yalepress.yale.edu&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1798 when Gauss was 21 and first published in 1801 when he was 24. It is notable for having a revolutionary impact on the field of [[number theory]] as it not only turned the field truly rigorous and systematic but also paved the path for modern number theory. In this book Gauss brought together and reconciled results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as [[Fermat]], [[Euler]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] and added many profound and original results of his own.

==Scope==
The ''Disquisitiones'' covers both [[elementary number theory]] and parts of the area of mathematics now called [[algebraic number theory]]. However, Gauss did not explicitly recognize the concept of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], which is central to [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], so he did not use this term. His own title for his subject was Higher Arithmetic. In his Preface to the ''Disquisitiones'', Gauss describes the scope of the book as follows:

{{quote|The inquiries which this volume will investigate pertain to that part of Mathematics which concerns itself with integers.}}

Gauss also states, "When confronting many difficult problems, derivations have been suppressed for the sake of brevity when readers refer to this work." ("Quod, in pluribus quaestionibus difficilibus, demonstrationibus syntheticis usus sum, analysinque per quam erutae sunt suppressi, imprimis brevitatis studio tribuendum est, cui quantum fieri poterat consulere oportebat")

==Contents==
{{see also|Modular arithmetic}}
The book is divided into seven sections, which are:

&lt;ol type="I"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Congruence relation|Congruent]] Numbers in General&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congruences of the First Degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residues of Powers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congruences of the Second Degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms and [[Indeterminate equation|Indeterminate Equations]] of the Second Degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various Applications of the Preceding Discussions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equations Defining [[Circular segment|Sections of a Circle]]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

These sections are subdivided into 366 numbered items, which sometimes state a theorem with proof, or otherwise develop a remark or thought.

Sections I to III are essentially a review of previous results, including [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Wilson's theorem]] and the existence of [[primitive root modulo n|primitive roots]]. Although few of the results in these first sections are original, Gauss was the first mathematician to bring this material together and treat it in a systematic way. He also realized the importance of the property of unique [[factorization]] (assured by the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], first studied by Euclid), which he restates and proves using modern tools.

From Section IV onwards, much of the work is original. Section IV itself develops a proof of [[quadratic reciprocity]]; Section V, which takes up over half of the book, is a comprehensive analysis of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s.  Section VI includes two different [[primality test]]s. Finally, Section VII is an analysis of [[root of unity#Cyclotomic polynomials|cyclotomic polynomials]], which concludes by giving the criteria that determine which regular [[polygon]]s are [[constructible polygon|constructible]] i.e. can be constructed with a compass and unmarked straight edge alone.

Gauss started to write an eighth section on higher order congruences, but he did not complete this, and it was published separately after his death. The eighth section was finally published as a treatise entitled "general investigations on congruences", and in it Gauss discussed congruences of arbitrary degree. It's worth notice since Gauss attacked the problem of general congruences from a standpoint closely related to that taken later by [[Dedekind]], [[Galois]], and [[Emil Artin]]. The treatise paved the way for the theory of function fields over a [[finite field]] of constants. Ideas unique to that treatise are clear recognition of the importance of the
[[Frobenius morphism]], and a version of [[Hensel's lemma]].

The ''Disquisitiones'' was one of the last mathematical works to be written in scholarly [[Latin]] (an English translation was not published until 1965).

==Importance==
Before the ''Disquisitiones'' was published, number theory consisted of a collection of isolated theorems and conjectures. Gauss brought the work of his predecessors together with his own original work into a systematic framework, filled in gaps, corrected unsound proofs, and extended the subject in numerous ways.

The logical structure of the ''Disquisitiones'' ([[theorem]] statement followed by [[Mathematical proof|proof]], followed by [[corollary|corollaries]]) set a standard for later texts. While recognising the primary importance of logical proof, Gauss also illustrates many theorems with numerical examples.

The ''Disquisitiones'' was the starting point for the work of other nineteenth century European mathematicians including [[Ernst Kummer]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] and [[Richard Dedekind]]. Many of the annotations given by Gauss are in effect announcements of further research of his own, some of which remained unpublished. They must have appeared particularly cryptic to his contemporaries; they can now be read as containing the germs of the theories of [[L-function]]s and [[complex multiplication]], in particular.

Gauss' ''Disquisitiones'' continued to exert influence in the 20th century.  For example, in section V, article 303, Gauss summarized his calculations of [[Class number (number theory)|class numbers]] of proper primitive binary quadratic forms, and conjectured that he had found all of them with class numbers 1, 2, and 3.  This was later interpreted as the determination of imaginary quadratic number fields with even discriminant and class number 1,2 and 3, and extended to the case of odd discriminant. Sometimes referred to as the [[class number problem]], this more general question was eventually confirmed in 1986,&lt;ref name=irelandrosen&gt;{{citation | last1 = Ireland | first1 = K. |last2 = Rosen | first2 = M. | title = A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory  | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1993  | location = New York, New York  | pages = 358–361  | isbn = 0-387-97329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the specific question Gauss asked was confirmed by Landau in 1902

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">In [[graph theory]], the '''Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition''' is a partition of the vertices of a [[bipartite graph]] into subsets, with the property that two adjacent vertices belong to the same subset if and only if they are paired with each other in a [[perfect matching]] of the graph. It is named after A. L. Dulmage and [[Nathan Mendelsohn]], who published it in 1958.  A generalization to any graph is the [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]]-Gallai decomposition, using the [[Blossom algorithm]].

==The coarse decomposition==
Let ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''U'',''V'',''E'') be a bipartite graph, and let ''D'' be the set of vertices in ''G'' that are not matched in at least one [[maximum matching]] of ''G''.
Then ''D'' is necessarily an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], so ''G'' can be partitioned into three parts:
*The vertices in ''D'' ∩ ''U'' and their neighbors
*The vertices in ''D'' ∩ ''V'' and their neighbors
*The remaining vertices
Every maximum matching in ''G'' consists of matchings in the first and second part that match all neighbors of ''D'', together with a [[perfect matching]] of the remaining vertices.

==The fine decomposition==
The third set of vertices in the coarse decomposition (or all vertices in a graph with a perfect matching) may additionally be partitioned into subsets by the following steps:
*Find a perfect matching of ''G''.
*Form a [[directed graph]] ''H'' whose vertices are the matched edges in ''G''. For each unmatched edge (''u'',''v'') in ''G'', add a directed edge in ''H'' from the matched edge of ''u'' to the matched edge of ''v''.
*Find the [[strongly connected component]]s of the resulting graph.
*For each component of ''H'', form a subset of the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition consisting of the vertices in ''G'' that are endpoints of edges in the component.

To see that this subdivision into subsets characterizes the edges that belong to perfect matchings, suppose that two vertices ''u'' and ''v'' in ''G'' belong to the same subset of the decomposition, but are not already matched by the initial perfect matching. Then there exists a strongly connected component in ''H'' containing edge ''uv''. This edge must belong to a [[simple cycle]] in ''H'' (by the definition of strong connectivity) which necessarily corresponds to an alternating cycle in ''G'' (a cycle whose edges alternate between matched and unmatched edges). This alternating cycle may be used to modify the initial perfect matching to produce a new matching containing edge&amp;nbsp;''uv''.

An edge ''uv'' of the graph ''G'' belongs to all perfect matchings of ''G'', if and only if ''u'' and ''v'' are the only members of their set in the decomposition. Such an edge exists if and only if the [[matching preclusion]] number of the graph is one.

==Core==
As another component of the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition, Dulmage and Mendelsohn defined the ''core'' of a graph to be the union of its maximum matchings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Applications==
This decomposition has been used to partition meshes in [[finite element analysis]], and to determine specified, underspecified and overspecified equations in systems of nonlinear equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">In [[mathematics]], an '''edge cycle cover''' (sometimes called simply '''cycle cover'''&lt;ref&gt;Cun-Quan Zhang, Integer flows and cycle covers of graphs, Marcel Dekker,1997.&lt;/ref&gt;) of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a set of [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s which are [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] of ''G'' and contain all edges of ''G''. 

If the cycles of the cover have no vertices in common, the cover is called '''vertex-disjoint''' or sometimes simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''. In this case the set of the cycles constitutes a [[spanning subgraph]] of ''G''.

If the cycles of the cover have no edges in common, the cover is called '''edge-disjoint''' or simply '''disjoint cycle cover'''.

==Properties and applications==

===Minimum-Weight Cycle Cover===
For a [[weighted graph]], the Minimum-Weight Cycle Cover Problem (MWCCP) is the problem to find a cycle cover with minimal sum of weights of edges in all cycles of the cover.

For [[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]]less [[planar graph]]s the MWCCP can be solved in [[polynomial time]]. &lt;ref&gt;"Handbook in Graph Theory" (2004) {{isbn|1-58488-090-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;lpg=PA225&amp;dq=%22minimum+weight+cycle+cover%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=VV2JRTVXzz&amp;sig=RPtrYtXXqDFPfXv0OrX0gqLs8GE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPA225,M1 p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double cycle cover==
The [[cycle double cover conjecture]] is an open problem in graph theory stating that in every [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] graph there exists a set of cycles that together cover every edge of the graph twice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cems.uvm.edu/%7Earchdeac/problems/cyclecov.htm "The Cycle Double Cover Conjecture"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goins was born in Los Angeles, his teacher mother Eddi Beatrice Brown being a daughter of [[Marjorie Lee Browne]], the third African-American woman to get a PhD in mathematics.&lt;ref name=browne&gt;[http://www.math.purdue.edu/news/2015/professor-edray-goins-featured-speaker-at-dr-marjorie-lee-browne-colloquium-at-university-of-michigan.php Professor Goins featured speaker at University of Michigan's Dr. Marjorie Lee Browne Colloquium] Department of Mathematics, Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;  He  attended public schools in [[South Los Angeles]] and got his BSc in mathematics and physics in 1994 from [[Caltech]], and his PhD in 1999 on “Elliptic Curves and Icosahedral Galois Representations” from [[Stanford University]], under [[Daniel Bump]] and [[Karl Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=39697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many years on the faculty of [[Purdue University]], in 2018 Goins took up a position at [[Pomona College]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/2017/09/15/why-im-leaving-a-research-i-university-for-a-liberal-arts-college/ Why I’m leaving a Research I University for a Liberal Arts College] American Mathematical Society Blog, Posted on September 15, 2017 by Edray Goins&lt;/ref&gt;. At Pomona, he currently teaches Linear Algebra, aided by his trusty mentor, and future high-school math teacher, Eric Gofen. Goins is highly regarded among students in the class for his precise chalk movements, frequent usage of the word "tilde", and practice of double-underling words, where he first draws a horizontal line from right to left, moves his chalk down, and draws a slightly longer horizontal line from left to right.

His summers have long been focused on engaging underrepresented students in research in the mathematical sciences.  He currently runs the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded [[Research Experience for Undergraduates]] (REU) "Pomona Research in Mathematics Experience (PRiME).”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.purdue.edu/~egoins/prime/PRiME%202016.html PRiME 2016: Purdue Research in Mathematics Experience]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, he is noted for his 2018 essay, "Three Questions: The Journey of One Black Mathematician."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/edray-goins#!tabset_0=2]. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elements of Dynamic''''' is a book published by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in 1878. In 1887 it was supplemented by a fourth part and an appendix. The subtitle is "An introduction to motion and rest in solid and fluid bodies". It was reviewed positively, has remained a standard reference since its appearance, and is now available online as a ''Historical Math Monograph'' from [[Cornell University]].

On page 95 Clifford deconstructed the [[quaternion]] product of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] into two separate "products" of two vectors: [[vector product]] and [[scalar product]], anticipating the complete severance seen in ''[[Vector Analysis]]'' (1901). ''Elements of Dynamic'' was the debut of the term [[cross-ratio]] for a four-[[argument of a function|argument]] function frequently used in geometry.

Clifford uses the term ''twist'' to discuss (pages 126 to 131) the [[screw theory]] that had recently been introduced by [[Robert Stawell Ball]].

==Reviews==
A review in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' explained for prospective readers that [[kinematics]] is the "study of the theory of pure motion". Noting the nature of "progressive training" required for mathematics, the reviewer wondered "For what class of readers is the book designed?"
&lt;ref&gt;[[Philosophical Magazine]], 1878, page 306&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard A. Proctor]] noted in ''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' (33:65) that there are "few errors in the work, and even misprints are few and far between for a treatise of this kind." He did not approve of Clifford’s coining of "odd new words as squirts, sinks, twists, and whirls." Proctor quoted the last sentence of the book: "Every continuous motion of an infinite body may be built up of squirts and vortices."

In a "Sketch of Professor Clifford" in June 1879 the journal ''[[Popular Science]]'' said "It will probably not take high rank as a university text-book, for which it was intended, but is much admired by mathematicians for the elegance, freshness, and originality displayed in the treatment of mathematical problems."&lt;ref&gt;[[Popular Science]], June 1879, pp 258&amp;ndash;64&lt;/ref&gt;

After Clifford had died, and ''Book IV and Appendix'' were published in 1887, the literary magazine 
''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' said "we have here Clifford pure and simple." It explained that he "had entirely shaken off the concept of force as an explanatory cause." It also expressed "the oft-told regret that Clifford did not live to reshape the teaching of elementary dynamics in this country, and we wait somewhat impatiently for his successor in this labour, who seems long in appearing."&lt;ref&gt;The Athenaeum, No. 3116, p 86, July 16, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 [[Alexander Macfarlane]] spoke at [[Lehigh University]] on Clifford. Reviewing ''Elements of Dynamic'' he said&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Macfarlane (1916) ''Lectures on Ten British Mathematicians of the Nineteenth Century'', page 84, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The work is unique for the clear ideas given of the science; ideas and principles are more prominent than symbols and formulae. He takes such familiar words as ''spin, twist, squirt, whirl'', and gives them exact meaning. The book is an example of what he meant by scientific insight,...

In 2004 Gowan Dawson reviewed the situation of the book's publication. On the basis of a letter from [[Lucy Clifford]] to [[Alexander MacMillan (publisher)|Alexander MacMillan]], the publisher, Dawson wrote&lt;ref&gt;Gowan Dawson (2004) "Victorian periodicals and the making of William Kingdon Clifford's posthumous reputation", pages 259 to 284 in ''Science Serialized'', Geoffrey Candor &amp; Sally Shuttleworth editors, [[MIT Press]] {{ISBN|0-262-03318-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Clifford, by the time of his death, had published just a single monograph, ''The Elements of Dynamic'', and that had been rushed through the presses in an incomplete form only during the last months of his life. Clifford's standing as both a leading mathematical specialist and an iconoclastic scientific publicist had instead been forged largely in the pages of the Victorian periodical press...

[[File:ExtremeGaussian.png|thumb|The graph of the function in gray is &lt;math&gt;e^{-\pi z^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, the Gaussian restricted to the real axis. The Gaussian does not have exponential type, but the functions in red and blue are one sided approximations that have exponential type &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In [[complex analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a [[holomorphic function]] is said to be of '''exponential type C''' if its [[bounded growth|growth is bounded]] by the [[exponential function]] ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''C''|''z''|&lt;/sup&gt; for some [[real number|real-valued]] constant ''C'' as |''z''|&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞.  When a function is bounded in this way, it is then possible to express it as certain kinds of convergent summations over a series of other complex functions, as well as understanding when it is possible to apply techniques such as [[Borel summation]], or, for example, to apply the [[Mellin transform]], or to perform approximations using the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]].  The general case is handled by [[Nachbin's theorem]], which defines the analogous notion of '''Ψ-type''' for a general function Ψ(''z'') as opposed to ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Basic idea==

A function ''f''(''z'') defined on the [[complex plane]] is said to be of exponential type if there exist real-valued constants ''M'' and ''τ'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;|f(re^{i\theta})|\le Me^{\tau r}&lt;/math&gt;

in the limit of &lt;math&gt;r\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Here, the [[complex variable]] ''z'' was written as &lt;math&gt;z=re^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that the limit must hold in all directions θ.  Letting τ stand for the [[infimum]] of all such τ, one then says that the function ''f'' is of ''exponential type &amp;tau;''.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sin(\pi z)&lt;/math&gt;. Then one says that &lt;math&gt;\sin(\pi z)&lt;/math&gt; is of exponential type π, since π is the smallest number that bounds the growth of &lt;math&gt;\sin(\pi z)&lt;/math&gt; along the imaginary axis. So, for this example, [[Carlson's theorem]] cannot apply, as it requires functions of exponential type less than π.  Similarly, the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]] cannot be applied either, as it, too, expresses a theorem ultimately anchored in the theory of [[finite difference]]s.

==Formal definition==
A [[holomorphic function]] &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be of '''exponential type''' &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a real-valued constant &lt;math&gt;A_\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;|F(z)|\leq A_\varepsilon e^{(\sigma+\varepsilon)|z|}&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;|z|\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;z\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
We say &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt; is of exponential type if &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt; is of exponential type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;\sigma&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The number

:&lt;math&gt;\tau(F)=\sigma=\displaystyle\limsup_{|z|\rightarrow\infty}|z|^{-1}\log|F(z)|&lt;/math&gt;

is the exponential type of &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[limit superior]] here means the limit of the [[supremum]] of the ratio outside a given radius as the radius goes to infinity. This is also the limit superior of the maximum of the ratio at a given radius as the radius goes to infinity. The limit superior may exist even if the maximum at radius ''r'' does not have a limit as ''r'' goes to infinity. For example, for the function

:&lt;math&gt;F(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{z^{10^{n!}}}{(10^{n!})!}&lt;/math&gt;

the value of

:&lt;math&gt; (\max_{|z|=r} \log|F(z)|) / r&lt;/math&gt;

at &lt;math&gt;r=10^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;(\log 10^{(n-1)!(n-1)-1})/10^{(n-1)!(n-1)-1}&lt;/math&gt; and thus goes to zero as ''n'' goes to infinity,&lt;ref&gt;In fact, even &lt;math&gt;(\max_{|z|=r}\log \log|F(z)|) /(\log r)&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero at &lt;math&gt;r=10^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; as ''n'' goes to infinity.&lt;/ref&gt; but ''F''(''z'') is nevertheless of exponential type 1, as seen by looking at the points &lt;math&gt;z=10^{n!}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Exponential type with respect to a symmetric convex body==

{{harvtxt|Stein|1957}} has given a generalization of exponential type for [[entire function]]s of [[several complex variables]]. 
Suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set|convex]], [[compact element|compact]], and [[symmetric]] subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. It is known that for every such &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; there is an associated [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_K&lt;/math&gt; with the property that

:&lt;math&gt; K=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n : \|x\|_K \leq1\}. &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the unit ball in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_K&lt;/math&gt;. The set

:&lt;math&gt;K^{*}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:x\cdot y \leq 1 \text{ for all }x\in{K}\}&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[polar set]] and is also a [[convex set|convex]], [[compact element|compact]], and [[symmetric]] subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_K = \displaystyle\sup_{y\in K^{*}}|x\cdot y|.&lt;/math&gt;

We extend &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_K&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\|z\|_K = \displaystyle\sup_{y\in K^{*}}|z\cdot y|.&lt;/math&gt;

An entire function &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-complex variables is said to be of exponential type with respect to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a real-valued constant &lt;math&gt;A_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;|F(z)|&lt;A_\varepsilon e^{2\pi(1+\varepsilon)\|z\|_K}&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\mathbb{C}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Fréchet space==
Collections of functions of exponential type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; can form a [[complete space|complete]] [[uniform space]], namely a [[Fréchet space]], by the [[topological space|topology]] induced by the countable family of [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]s

: &lt;math&gt; \|f\|_n = \sup_{z \in \mathbb{C}} \exp \left[-\left(\tau + \frac{1}{n}\right)|z|\right]|f(z)|. &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4323">In [[mathematics]], the '''Fréchet filter''', also called the '''cofinite filter''', on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a special subset of the set's [[power set]]. A member of this power set is in the Fréchet filter if and only if its [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] in the power set is finite. This is of interest in [[topology]], where filters originated, and relates to [[Order theory|order]] and  [[Lattice (order)|lattice theory]] because a set's power set is a [[partially ordered set]] (and more specifically, a lattice) under [[Subset|set inclusion]].

The Fréchet filter is named after the French mathematician [[Maurice Fréchet]] (1878-1973), who worked in topology. It is alternatively called a ''cofinite filter'' because its members are exactly the cofinite sets in a power set.

== Definition ==
The Fréchet filter ''F'' on ''X'' is the set of all subsets ''A'' of ''X'' such that the complement of ''A'' in ''X'' is finite. That is, 

::{{math|big=1|''F'' {{=}} {''A'' &amp;sube; ''X'' : ''X'' &amp;minus; ''A'' is finite}.}}

This makes ''F'' a [[Filter (mathematics)|filter]] on the lattice ('''P'''(''X''), &amp;sube;), the power set of ''X'' with set inclusion, since
# Intersection condition: if two sets are finitely complemented in ''X'', then so is their intersection (since {{math|(''A'' &amp;cap; ''B'')&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;cup; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where ''S''&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the complement of a set ''S'', and 
# Upper-set condition: if a set is finitely complemented in ''X'', then so are its supersets in ''X''.

== Properties ==

If the base set ''X'' is finite, then ''F'' = '''P'''(''X'') since every subset of ''X'', and in particular every complement, is then finite. This case is sometimes excluded by definition or else called the '''improper filter''' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Wilfrid. ''Model Theory''. Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications. Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 265. {{ISBN|978-0-521-06636-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing ''X'' to be finite creates a single exception to the Fréchet filter's being [[Filter (mathematics)#Examples|free]] and [[Filter (mathematics)#General definition|non-principal]] since a filter on a finite set cannot be free and a non-principal filter cannot contain any singletons as members.

If ''X'' is infinite, then every member of ''F'' is infinite since it is simply ''X'' minus finitely many of its members. Additionally, ''F'' is infinite since one of its subsets is the set of all {''x''}&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''x'' &amp;isin; ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is both free and non-principal, excepting the finite case mentioned above, and is included in every free filter. It is also the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] filter of the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal]] of all finite subsets of (infinite) ''X''.

The Fréchet filter is ''not'' necessarily an [[ultrafilter]] (or maximal proper filter). Consider '''P'''('''N'''). The set of even numbers is the complement of the set of odd numbers. Since neither of these sets is finite, neither set is in the Fréchet filter on '''N'''. However, an ultrafilter is free if and only if it includes the Fréchet filter. The existence of free ultrafilters was established by Tarski in 1930, relying on a theorem equivalent to the axiom of choice and is used in the construction of the [[Hyperreal number|hyperreals]] in [[Non-standard analysis|nonstandard analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, J. Sousa and Hoskins, R. F. ''Infinitesimal methods for mathematical analysis''. Mathematics and Applications Series. Horwood Publishing, 2004, p. 53. {{ISBN|978-1-898563-99-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
On the set '''N''' of [[natural number]]s, the set ''B'' = { (''n'',∞) : ''n'' &amp;isin; '''N'''} is a Fréchet [[filter base]], i.e., the Fréchet filter on '''N''' consists of all supersets of elements of ''B''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2453">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[complex analysis]], a '''global analytic function''' is a generalization of the notion of an [[analytic function]] which allows for functions to have multiple [[branch cut|branches]].  Global analytic functions arise naturally in considering the possible [[analytic continuation]]s of an analytic function, since analytic continuations may have a non-trivial [[monodromy]].  They are one foundation for the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s.

==Definition==
The following definition is in {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1979}}, but also found in Weyl or perhaps Weierstrass.  An analytic function in an [[open set]] ''U'' is called a '''function element'''.  Two function elements (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are said to be [[analytic continuation]]s of one another if ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ∅ and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on this intersection.  A '''chain of analytic continuations''' is a finite sequence of function elements (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), …, (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''U''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) such that each consecutive pair are analytic continuations of one another; i.e., (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) is an analytic continuation of (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) for ''i'' = 1, 2, …, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

A '''global analytic function''' is a family '''f''' of function elements such that, for any (''f'',''U'') and (''g'',''V'') belonging to '''f''', there is a chain of analytic continuations in '''f''' beginning at (''f'',''U'') and finishing at (''g'',''V'').

A '''complete''' global analytic function is a global analytic function '''f''' which contains every analytic continuation of each of its elements.

===Sheaf-theoretic definition===
Using ideas from [[sheaf theory]], the definition can be streamlined.  In these terms, a '''complete global analytic function''' is a [[path connected]] sheaf of germs of analytic functions which is ''maximal'' in the sense that it is not contained (as an [[etale space]]) within any other path connected sheaf of germs of analytic functions.

See also [[glossary of commutative algebra]], [[glossary of classical algebraic geometry]], and [[glossary of ring theory]]. For the number-theoretic applications, see [[glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry]].

For simplicity, a reference to the base scheme is often omitted; i.e., a scheme will be a scheme over some fixed base scheme ''S'' and a morphism an ''S''-morphism.

|quote=Algebraic geometry occupied a central place in the mathematics of the last century. The deepest results of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, many of the most important papers of Klein and Poincare belong to this domain. At the end of the last and the beginning of the present century the attitude towards algebraic geometry changed abruptly. ... The style of thinking that was fully developed in algebraic geometry at that time was too far removed from the set-theoretical and axiomatic spirit, which then determined the development of mathematics. ... Around the middle of the present century algebraic geometry had undergone to a large extent such a reshaping process. As a result, it can again lay claim to the position it once occupied in mathematics.

#''f'' factors through ''i'',

This notion is distinct from that of the usual set-theoretic image of ''f'', ''f''(''Y''). For example, the underlying space of ''Z'' always contains (but is not necessarily equal to) the Zariski closure of ''f''(''Y'') in ''X'', so if ''Y'' is any open (and not closed) subscheme of ''X'' and ''f'' is the inclusion map, then ''Z'' is different from ''f''(''Y''). When ''Y'' is reduced, then ''Z'' is the Zariski closure of ''f''(''Y'') endowed with the structure of reduced closed subscheme.

{{term|1=immersion}}

'''Immersions''' {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Y'' → ''X''}} are maps that factor through isomorphisms with subschemes.

Some authors, such as Hartshorne in his book ''Algebraic Geometry'' and Q. Liu in his book ''Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves'', define immersions as the composite of an open immersion followed by a closed immersion. These immersions are immersions in the sense above, but the converse is false. Furthermore, under this definition, the composite of two immersions is not necessarily an immersion. However, the two definitions are equivalent when ''f'' is quasi-compact.&lt;ref&gt;Q. Liu, ''Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves, exercise 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that an open immersion is completely described by its image in the sense of topological spaces, while a closed immersion is not: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A/I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A/J&lt;/math&gt; may be homeomorphic but not isomorphic. This happens, for example, if ''I'' is the radical of ''J'' but ''J'' is not a radical ideal. When specifying a closed subset of a scheme without mentioning the scheme structure, usually the so-called ''reduced'' scheme structure is meant, that is, the scheme structure corresponding to the unique radical ideal consisting of all functions vanishing on that closed subset.

{{defn|1=
Most important properties of schemes are ''local in nature'', i.e. a scheme ''X'' has a certain property ''P'' if and only if for any cover of ''X'' by open subschemes ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e. ''X''=&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', every ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' has the property ''P''. It is usually the case that is enough to check one cover, not all possible ones. One also says that a certain property is ''Zariski-local'', if one needs to distinguish between the [[Zariski topology]] and other possible topologies, like the [[étale topology]].

Consider a scheme ''X'' and a cover by affine open subschemes ''Spec A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Using the dictionary between [[commutative ring|(commutative) rings]] and [[affine scheme]]s local properties are thus properties of the rings ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. A property ''P'' is local in the above sense, iff the corresponding property of rings is stable under [[Localization of a ring|localization]].

For example, we can speak of ''[[noetherian scheme|locally Noetherian]]'' schemes, namely those which are covered by the spectra of [[Noetherian ring]]s. The fact that localizations of a Noetherian ring are still noetherian then means that the property of a scheme of being locally Noetherian is local in the above sense (whence the name). Another example: if a ring is [[reduced ring|reduced]] (i.e., has no non-zero [[nilpotent]] elements), then so are its localizations.

An example for a non-local property is ''separatedness'' (see below for the definition). Any affine scheme is separated, therefore any scheme is locally separated. However, the affine pieces may glue together pathologically to yield a non-separated scheme.

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of local properties of rings, which are applied to schemes. Let ''X'' = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''Spec A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' be a covering of a scheme by open affine subschemes. For definiteness, let ''k'' denote a [[field (mathematics)|field]] in the following. Most of the examples also work with the integers '''Z''' as a base, though, or even more general bases.

The coarse moduli space is not the fundamental object any longer, rather it is only a convenient way to keep track of certain information that is only latent in the moduli functor or moduli stack.

A scheme &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is a [[locally ringed space]], so ''a fortiori'' a [[topological space]], but the meanings of ''point of &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;'' are threefold:

#a point &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; of the underlying topological space;
#a &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;-valued point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;, for any scheme &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;;
#a ''geometric point'', where &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is defined over (is equipped with a morphism to) &lt;math&gt; \textrm{Spec}(K) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], is a morphism from &lt;math&gt; \textrm{Spec} (\overline{K}) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \overline{K} &lt;/math&gt; is an [[algebraic closure]] of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Geometric points are what in the most classical cases, for example [[algebraic varieties]] that are [[complex manifold]]s, would be the ordinary-sense points. The points &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; of the underlying space include analogues of the [[generic point]]s (in the sense of [[Zariski]], not that of [[André Weil]]), which specialise to ordinary-sense points. The &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;-valued points are thought of, via [[Yoneda's lemma]], as a way of identifying &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; with the [[representable functor]] &lt;math&gt; h_{S} &lt;/math&gt; it sets up. Historically there was a process by which [[projective geometry]] added more points (''e.g.'' complex points, [[line at infinity]]) to simplify the geometry by refining the basic objects. The &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;-valued points were a massive further step.

As part of the predominating [[Grothendieck's relative point of view|Grothendieck approach]], there are three corresponding notions of ''fiber'' of a morphism: the first being the simple [[inverse image]] of a point. The other two are formed by creating [[fiber product]]s of two morphisms. For example, a '''geometric fiber''' of a morphism &lt;math&gt; S^{\prime} \to S &lt;/math&gt; is thought of as

:&lt;math&gt; S^{\prime} \times_{S} \textrm{Spec}(\overline{K}) &lt;/math&gt;.

This makes the extension from [[affine scheme]]s, where it is just the [[tensor product of R-algebras]], to all schemes of the fiber product operation a significant (if technically anodyne) result.

As a consequence, a scheme &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is '''separated''' when the diagonal of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; within the ''scheme product'' of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; with itself is a closed immersion. Emphasizing the relative point of view, one might equivalently define a scheme to be separated if the unique morphism &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow \textrm{Spec} (\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; is separated.

Notice that a [[topological space]] ''Y'' is Hausdorff iff the diagonal embedding 
:&lt;math&gt;Y \stackrel{\Delta}{\longrightarrow} Y \times Y&lt;/math&gt;
is closed. In algebraic geometry, the above formulation is used because a scheme which is a Hausdorff space is necessarily empty or zero-dimensional. The difference between the topological and algebro-geometric context comes from the topological structure of the fiber product (in the category of schemes) &lt;math&gt;X \times_{\textrm{Spec} (\mathbb{Z})} X&lt;/math&gt;, which is different from the product of topological spaces.

Any ''affine'' scheme ''Spec A'' is separated, because the diagonal corresponds to the surjective map of rings (hence is a closed immersion of schemes):
:''&lt;math&gt;A \otimes_{\mathbb Z} A \rightarrow A, a \otimes a' \mapsto a \cdot a'&lt;/math&gt;''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2451">In mathematics, the '''Golomb sequence''', named after [[Solomon W. Golomb]] (but also called '''Silverman's sequence'''), is a non-decreasing [[integer sequence]] where ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of times that ''n'' occurs in the sequence, starting with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, and with the property that for ''n'' &gt; 1 each ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the unique integer which makes it possible to satisfy the condition. For example, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 says that 1 only occurs once in the sequence, so ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be 1 too, but it can be, and therefore must be, 2. The first few values are
:1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12 {{OEIS|id=A001462}}.

==Examples==
''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1  &lt;br&gt;
Therefore, 1 occurs exactly one time in this sequence.

''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 &lt;br&gt;
''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2

2 occurs exactly 2 times in this sequence.   &lt;br&gt;
''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 2

3 occurs exactly 2 times in this sequence.

''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 3

4 occurs exactly 3 times in this sequence. &lt;br&gt;
5 occurs exactly 3 times in this sequence.

''a''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 4  &lt;br&gt;
''a''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 5

etc.

==Recurrence==
Colin Mallows has given an explicit [[recurrence relation]] &lt;math&gt;a(1) = 1; a(n+1) = 1 + a(n + 1 - a(a(n)))&lt;/math&gt;.  An [[asymptotic expression]] for ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{2-\varphi}n^{\varphi-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[golden ratio]] (approximately equal to 1.618034).

'''Graphic communication''' as the name suggests is [[communication]] using [[graphic]] elements. These elements include symbols such as [[glyph]]s and [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of [[substrate (printing)|substrate]], color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating [[word]]s and [[image]]s to convey [[data]], [[concept]]s, and [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="GCC08"&gt;[http://teched.vt.edu/GCC/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html Definition of Graphic Communications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306143724/http://www.teched.vt.edu/gcc/HTML/VirtualTextbook/VirtualArticles/DefinitionOfGraphicComm.html |date=2008-03-06 }} GRAPHIC COMM CENTRAL, 2008. Accessed 25 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.&lt;ref name="GCC08"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Graphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as [[drawings]], [[photograph]]s, [[Photographic slide|slide]]s, and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.

Any medium that uses a [[graphics]] to aid in conveying a [[message]], [[Education|instruction]], or an [[idea]] is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the [[drawing]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Goetsch et al. (1999). ''Technical Drawing''. {{ISBN|0-7668-0531-X}}. p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave paintings]] and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period from 40,000–10,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].

== Graphic communication topics ==
=== Graphics ===
[[Graphics]] are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, [[canvas]], computer screen, paper, or stone to [[brand]], inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[line art]], [[graphics|graphs]], [[diagrams]], [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbols]], [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.

=== Communication ===
[[Communication]] is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a [[media (communication)|medium]]. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are [[Sound|auditory]] means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal]], physical means, such as [[body language]], [[sign language]], [[paralanguage]], [[Haptic perception|touch]], [[eye contact]], by using [[writing]]. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and [[convey]] meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding.  This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in [[intrapersonal]] and [[interpersonal]] processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that [[collaboration]] and [[cooperation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Communication |work=office of superintendent of Public instruction |location=Washington |url=http://www.k12.wa.us/CurriculumInstruct/Communications/default.aspx |accessdate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual communication ===
[[Visual communication]] as the name suggests is [[communication]] through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with [[Dimension|two dimensional]] images, it includes: [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], [[typography]], [[drawing]], [[graphic design]], [[illustration]], colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of [[communication]] with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or [[persuade]] a person.  It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference.  There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.  There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like [[gestures]], body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on [[web design]] and graphically oriented usability. [[Graphic designers]] use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.

=== Communication design ===
[[Communication design]] is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how  intermission such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, utilizing [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]].

=== Graphic design ===
The term [[graphic design]] can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to produce the final result.  Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

Common uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design.  For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece.  [[Composition (visual arts)|Composition]] is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.

=== Graphical representation ===
The term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]] representation is commonly defined in three ways.
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''The object:'' The symbol being represented.
# ''Manner:'' The way the symbol is represented.
# ''Means:'' The material that is used to represent it.
The ''means'' of literary representation is [[language]]. The means of graphical representation are [[graphics]]. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.
The purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2727">In [[mathematics]], the '''Haran diamond theorem''' gives a general sufficient condition for a separable extension of a [[Hilbertian field]] to be Hilbertian. 

== Statement of the diamond theorem ==
[[Image:Diamond_theorem.jpg|thumb|right|field diagram of the diamond theorem]]
Let ''K'' be a [[Hilbertian field]] and ''L'' a separable extension of ''K''. Assume there exist two Galois extensions 
''N'' and ''M'' of ''K'' such that ''L'' is contained in the compositum ''NM'', but is contained in neither ''N'' nor ''M''. Then ''L'' is Hilbertian.

The name of the theorem comes from the pictured diagram of fields, and was coined by Jarden.

== Some corollaries ==
=== Weissauer's theorem ===

This theorem was firstly proved using non-standard methods by Weissauer. It was reproved by Fried using standard methods. The latter proof led Haran to his diamond theorem.  

;Weissauer's theorem 
Let ''K'' be a Hilbertian field, ''N'' a Galois extension of ''K'', and ''L'' a finite proper extension of ''N''. Then ''L'' is Hilbertian. 

;Proof using the diamond theorem

If ''L'' is finite over ''K'', it is Hilbertian; hence we assume that ''L/K'' is infinite. Let ''x'' be a primitive element for ''L/N'', i.e., ''L'' = ''N''(''x''). 

Let ''M'' be the Galois closure of ''K''(''x''). Then all the assumptions of the diamond theorem are satisfied, hence ''L'' is Hilbertian.

=== Haran&amp;ndash;Jarden condition ===

Another, preceding to the diamond theorem, sufficient permanence condition was given by Haran&amp;ndash;Jarden:
'''Theorem.''' 
Let ''K'' be a Hilbertian field and ''N'', ''M'' two Galois extensions of ''K''. Assume that neither contains the other. Then their compositum ''NM'' is Hilbertian.

This theorem has a very nice consequence: Since the field of rational numbers, ''Q'' is Hilbertian ([[Hilbert's irreducibility theorem]]), we get that the algebraic closure of ''Q'' is not the compositum of two proper Galois extensions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">The '''Hausdorff paradox''' is a paradox in [[mathematics]] named after [[Felix Hausdorff]]. It involves the [[sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a 2-dimensional sphere in [[Three-dimensional space|''R''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]). It states that if a certain [[Countable set|countable]] subset is removed from ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the remainder can be divided into three disjoint subsets ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' such that ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''B''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''C'' are all [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. In particular, it follows that on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; there is no [[Measure (mathematics)#Generalizations|finitely additive measure]] defined on all subsets such that the measure of congruent sets is equal (because this would imply that the measure of ''B''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;''C'' is simultaneously 1/3 and 2/3 of the non-zero measure of the whole sphere).

The paradox was published in [[Mathematische Annalen]] in 1914 and also in Hausdorff's book, [[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]], the same year. The proof of the much more famous [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] uses Hausdorff's ideas. The proof of this paradox relies on the [[Axiom of choice|Axiom of Choice]]. 

This paradox shows that there is no finitely additive measure on a sphere defined on ''all'' subsets which is equal on congruent pieces. (Hausdorff first showed in the same paper the easier result that there is no ''countably'' additive measure defined on all subsets.) The structure of the [[SO(3)|group of rotations on the sphere]] plays a crucial role here{{snd}} the statement is not true on the plane or the line. In fact, as was later shown by [[Banach]],&lt;ref&gt;
[[Stefan Banach]], [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm4/fm412.pdf "Sur le problème de la mesure"], Fundamenta Mathematicae 4: pp. 7&amp;ndash;33, 1923; Banach, [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm6/fm6127.pdf "Sur la décomposition des ensembles de points en parties respectivement congruentes"], Theorem 16, Fundamenta Mathematicae 6: pp. 244&amp;ndash;277, 1924.

&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible to define an "area" for ''all'' bounded subsets in the Euclidean plane (as well as "length" on the real line) in such a way that congruent sets will have equal "area". (This [[Banach measure]], however, is only finitely additive, so it is not a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] in the full sense, but it equals the [[Lebesgue measure]] on sets for which the latter exists.) This implies that if two open subsets of the plane (or the real line) are [[Banach–Tarski paradox|equi-decomposable]] then they have equal area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21663">The '''Hurst exponent''' is used as a measure of [[Long-range dependency|long-term memory]] of [[time series]]. It relates to the [[autocorrelation]]s of the time series, and the rate at which these decrease as the lag between pairs of values increases.
Studies involving the Hurst exponent were originally developed in [[hydrology]] for the practical matter of determining optimum dam sizing for the [[Nile river]]'s volatile rain and drought conditions that had been observed over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = H.E. | last1 = Hurst | journal = Transactions of American Society of Civil Engineers | volume = 116 | page = 770 | year = 1951 | title = Long-term storage capacity of reservoirs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hurst | first1 = H.E. | last2 = Black | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Simaika | first3 = Y.M. | year = 1965 | title = Long-term storage: an experimental study | publisher = Constable | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Hurst exponent", or "Hurst coefficient", derives from [[Harold Edwin Hurst]] (1880–1978), who was the lead researcher in these studies; the use of the standard notation ''H'' for the coefficient relates to his name also.

In [[fractal geometry]], the '''generalized Hurst exponent''' has been denoted by [[H (disambiguation)|''H'']] or ''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' in honor of both Harold Edwin Hurst and [[Otto Ludwig Holder|Ludwig Otto Hölder]] (1859–1937) by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] (1924–2010).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = B.B. | last1 = Mandelbrot | first2 = J.R. | last2 = Wallis | journal = Water Resour. Res. | volume = 4 | pages = 909–918 | year = 1968 | title = Noah, Joseph, and operational hydrology | doi=10.1029/wr004i005p00909 | bibcode=1968WRR.....4..909M}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H'' is directly related to [[fractal dimension]], ''D'', and is a measure of a data series' "mild" or "wild" randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The (Mis)Behavior of Markets | first = Benoît B. | last = Mandelbrot | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hurst exponent is referred to as the "index of dependence" or "index of long-range dependence". It quantifies the relative tendency of a time series either to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a direction.&lt;ref&gt;Torsten Kleinow (2002)[http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/dissertationen/kleinow-torsten-2002-07-04/PDF/Kleinow.pdf  Testing Continuous Time Models in Financial Markets], Doctoral thesis, Berlin {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A value ''H'' in the range 0.5–1 indicates a time series with long-term positive autocorrelation, meaning both that a high value in the series will probably be followed by another high value and that the values a long time into the future will also tend to be high. A value in the range 0 – 0.5 indicates a time series with long-term switching between high and low values in adjacent pairs, meaning that a single high value will probably be followed by a low value and that the value after that will tend to be high, with this tendency to switch between high and low values lasting a long time into the future. A value of ''H''=0.5 can indicate a completely uncorrelated series, but in fact it is the value applicable to series for which the autocorrelations at small time lags can be positive or negative but where the absolute values of the autocorrelations decay exponentially quickly to zero. This in contrast to the typically [[power law]] decay for the 0.5 &lt; ''H'' &lt; 1 and  0 &lt; ''H'' &lt; 0.5 cases.

==Definition==
The Hurst exponent, ''H'', is defined in terms of the asymptotic behaviour of the [[rescaled range]] as a function of the time span of a time series as follows;&lt;ref name="Qian"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Bo | last1 = Qian | first2 = Khaled | last2 = Rasheed | citeseerx = 10.1.1.137.207 | title = HURST EXPONENT AND FINANCIAL MARKET PREDICTABILITY | conference = IASTED conference on Financial Engineering and Applications (FEA 2004) | pages = 203–209 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractals |last=Feder |first=Jens |year=1988 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |isbn=0-306-42851-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left [ \frac{R(n)}{S(n)} \right ]=C n^H  \text{  as } n \to \infty  \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where;

* &lt;math&gt;R(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Range (statistics)|range]] of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cumulative deviations from the mean, and &lt;math&gt;S(n)&lt;/math&gt; is their [[standard deviation]]
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left [x \right ] \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]]
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the time span of the observation (number of data points in a time series)
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

==Relation to Fractal Dimension==
For self-similar time series,
''H'' is directly related to [[fractal dimension]], ''D'', where 1 &lt; ''D'' &lt; 2, such that ''D'' = 2 - ''H''.  The values of the Hurst exponent vary between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a smoother trend, less volatility, and less roughness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more general time series or multi-dimensional process, the Hurst exponent and fractal dimension
can be chosen independently, as the Hurst exponent represents structure over asymptotically longer
periods, while fractal dimension represents structure over asymptotically shorter periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Rescaled range (R/S) analysis===
To estimate the Hurst exponent, one must first estimate the dependence of the [[rescaled range]] on the time span ''n'' of observation.&lt;ref name="Feder"/&gt; A time series of full length ''N'' is divided into a number of shorter time series of length ''n'' = ''N'', ''N''/2, ''N''/4, ... The average rescaled range is then calculated for each value of ''n''.

For a (partial) time series of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X=X_1,X_2,\dots, X_n \, &lt;/math&gt;, the rescaled range is calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="Qian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder"/&gt;

1. Calculate the [[mean]];

:&lt;math&gt;m=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

2. Create a mean-adjusted series;

:&lt;math&gt;Y_t=X_{t}-m \quad  \text{  for } t=1,2, \dots ,n \,. &lt;/math&gt;

3. Calculate the cumulative deviate series &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_t= \sum_{i=1}^{t} Y_{i} \quad  \text{   for }  t=1,2, \dots ,n \,. &lt;/math&gt;

4. Compute the range &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;;

:&lt;math&gt; R(n) =\operatorname{max}\left (Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_n  \right )-
  \operatorname{min}\left (Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_n  \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

5. Compute the [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;

:&lt;math&gt;S(n)= \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left ( X_{i} - m \right )^{2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

6. Calculate the rescaled range &lt;math&gt;R(n)/S(n)&lt;/math&gt; and average over all the partial time series of length &lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt;

The Hurst exponent is estimated by fitting the [[power law]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} [ R(n)/S(n)] = C n^H&lt;/math&gt; to the data. This can be done by plotting &lt;math&gt;\log[R(n)/S(n)]&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\log n&lt;/math&gt;, and fitting a straight line; the slope of the line gives &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (a more principled approach fits the power law in a maximum-likelihood fashion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aaron Clauset |author2=Cosma Rohilla Shalizi |author3=M. E. J. Newman |year=2009 |title=Power-law distributions in empirical data |journal=SIAM Review |volume=51 |pages=661–703 |arxiv=0706.1062 |doi=10.1137/070710111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Such a graph is called a box plot. However, this approach is known to produce biased estimates of the power-law exponent. For small &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; there is a significant deviation from the 0.5 slope. Anis and Lloyd&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the theoretical (i.e., for white noise) values of the R/S statistic to be:

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} [ R(n)/S(n) ] = \begin{cases} \frac{\Gamma(\frac{n-1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi} \Gamma(\frac{n}{2})}
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \sqrt{\frac{n-i}{i}}, &amp; \text{for }n\le 340 \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n\frac{\pi}{2}}}
    \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} \sqrt{\frac{n-i}{i}}, &amp; \text{for }n&gt;340 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Euler Gamma Function|Euler gamma function]]. The Anis-Lloyd corrected R/S Hurst exponent is calculated as 0.5 plus the slope of &lt;math&gt; R(n)/S(n) - \operatorname{E}[ R(n)/S(n)]&lt;/math&gt;.

===Confidence intervals===

Here &lt;math&gt;M=log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the series length. In both cases only subseries of length &lt;math&gt;n&gt;50&lt;/math&gt; were considered for estimating the Hurst exponent; subseries of smaller length lead to a high variance of the R/S estimates.

==Generalized exponent==

The basic Hurst exponent can be related to the expected size of changes, as a function of the lag between observations, as measured by E(|''X&lt;sub&gt;t+τ&lt;/sub&gt;-X&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For the generalized form of the coefficient, the exponent here is replaced by a more general term, denoted by ''q''.

There are a variety of techniques that exist for estimating ''H'', however assessing the accuracy of the estimation can be a complicated issue. Mathematically, in one technique, the Hurst exponent can be estimated such that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Preis | first1 = T. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Accelerated fluctuation analysis by graphic cards and complex pattern formation in financial markets | url = http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1367-2630/11/9/093024/ | journal = New J.

:''H''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''(''q''),

for a time series

:''g''(''t'') (''t'' = 1, 2,...)

may be defined by the scaling properties of its [[Algebraic structure|structure]] functions ''S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;S_q = \langle |g(t + \tau) - g(t)|^q  \rangle_t \sim \tau^{qH(q)}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' &gt; 0, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the time lag and averaging is over the time window

:&lt;math&gt;t \gg \tau,\,&lt;/math&gt;

usually the largest time scale of the system.

Practically, in nature, there is no limit to time, and thus ''H'' is non-deterministic as it may only be estimated based on the observed data; e.g., the most dramatic daily move upwards ever seen in a stock market index can always be exceeded during some subsequent day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benoît Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot, Benoît B.]], ''The (Mis)Behavior of Markets, A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward'' (Basic Books, 2004), pp. 186-195&lt;/ref&gt;

In the above mathematical estimation technique, the function ''H''(''q'') contains information about averaged generalized volatilities at scale &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; (only ''q'' = 1, 2 are used to define the volatility). In particular, the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exponent indicates persistent (''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ½) or antipersistent (''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ½) behavior of the trend.

For the BRW ([[brown noise]], 1/''f''²) one gets

:''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ½,

and for [[pink noise]] (1/''f'')

:''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.

The Hurst exponent for [[white noise]] is dimension dependent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alex Hansen |author2=Jean Schmittbuhl |author3=G. George Batrouni |year=2001 |title= Distinguishing fractional and white noise in one and two dimensions|journal=Phys. Rev.

:''H&lt;sup&gt;1D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -½ ,  ''H&lt;sup&gt;2D&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -1.

For the popular [[Lévy stable process]]es and [[truncated Lévy process]]es with parameter α it has been found that

:''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''q/α'' for ''q'' &lt; ''α'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 for ''q'' ≥ α.
A method to estimate &lt;math&gt;H(q)&lt;/math&gt; from non-stationary time series is called [[detrended fluctuation analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.W. Kantelhardt|first=E.

When &lt;math&gt;H(q)&lt;/math&gt; is a non-linear function of q the time series is a [[multifractal system]].

===Note===
In the above definition two separate requirements are mixed together as if they would be one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uh.edu/~jmccaul2/ Joseph L McCauley], [http://complex.phys.uh.edu Kevin E Bassler], and Gemunu H. Gunaratne (2008) "Martingales, Detrending Data, and the Efficient Market Hypothesis", ''Physica'', A37, 202, Open access preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.2583 arXiv:0710.2583]&lt;/ref&gt; Here are the two independent,-` requirements: (i) stationarity of the increments, x(t+T)-x(t)=x(T)-x(0) in distribution. this is the condition that yields longtime autocorrelations. (ii) [[Self-similarity]] of the stochastic process then yields variance scaling, but is not needed for longtime memory. E.g., both [[Markov process]]es (i.e., memory-free processes) and [[fractional Brownian motion]] scale at the level of 1-point densities (simple averages), but neither scales at the level of pair correlations or, correspondingly, the 2-point probability density.{{clarify|date=August 2011}}

An efficient market requires a martingale condition, and unless the variance is linear in the time this produces nonstationary increments, x(t+T)-x(t)≠x(T)-x(0). Martingales are Markovian at the level of pair correlations, meaning that pair correlations cannot be used to beat a martingale market. Stationary increments with nonlinear variance, on the other hand, induce the longtime pair memory of [[fractional Brownian motion]] that would make the market beatable at the level of pair correlations. Such a market would necessarily be far from "efficient".

An analysis of economic time series by means of the Hurst exponent using [[rescaled range]] and [[Detrended fluctuation analysis]] is conducted by econophysicist A.F. Bariviera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[http://www.aureliofernandez.net/ Bariviera, A.F.] |year=2011 |title= The influence of liquidity on informational efficiency: The case of the Thai Stock Market|journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications |volume=390 |pages=4426–4432|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2011.07.032|bibcode=2011PhyA..390.4426B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper studies the time varying character of [[Long-range dependency]] and, thus of informational efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">An '''isotropic solid''' is a solid material in which physical properties do not depend on its orientation. It is an example of [[isotropy]] which can also apply to fluids, or other non-material concepts. The properties could be felt or seen such as the [[index of refraction]] or mechanical. For example an isotropic solid will expand equally in all directions when heated.&lt;ref name="Vail2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vail|first=J.M.|title=Topics in the Theory of Solid Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcKSjs1_CTMC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=31 January 2014|date=2003-04-24|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750307291|pages=34–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat will conduct equally well in any direction, and sound will pass at the same speed.&lt;ref name="Vail2003"/&gt; The physics of these solids are much easier to describe. Some examples are glass with random arrangements that average out to uniform, or the [[cubic crystal system]]. The opposite is anisotropic solids. Most crystal structures are actually anisotropic.

Isotropy should not be confused with [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]], which is a property of independence of position. Isotropy of materials also depends on scale. For example, at micro level involving a few crystals, steel is not isotropic. But at macro level, for example a steel rod using in the building construction, steel is isotropic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9055">In [[mathematics]], the '''Jack function'''  is a generalization of the '''Jack polynomial''', introduced by [[Henry Jack]]. The Jack polynomial is a [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]], [[symmetric polynomial|symmetric]] [[polynomial]] which generalizes the [[Schur polynomial|Schur]] and [[Zonal polynomial|zonal]] polynomials, and is in turn generalized by the [[Heckman–Opdam polynomials]] and [[Macdonald polynomial]]s.

==Definition==
The Jack function &lt;math&gt;J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m)&lt;/math&gt; 
of an [[integer partition]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and
indefinitely many arguments &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m&lt;/math&gt; can be recursively defined as 
follows:

; For ''m''=1 : 

: &lt;math&gt;J_{k}^{(\alpha )}(x_1)=x_1^k(1+\alpha)\cdots (1+(k-1)\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

; For ''m''&gt;1:

: &lt;math&gt;J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m)=\sum_\mu
J_\mu^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{m-1})
x_m^{|\kappa /\mu|}\beta_{\kappa \mu}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the summation is over all partitions &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that the '''skew partition''' &lt;math&gt;\kappa/\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a '''horizontal strip''', namely
:&lt;math&gt; 
\kappa_1\ge\mu_1\ge\kappa_2\ge\mu_2\ge\cdots\ge\kappa_{n-1}\ge\mu_{n-1}\ge\kappa_n
&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; must be zero or otherwise &lt;math&gt;J_\mu(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1})=0&lt;/math&gt;) and 
:&lt;math&gt;
\beta_{\kappa\mu}=\frac{
 \prod_{(i,j)\in \kappa} B_{\kappa\mu}^\kappa(i,j)
}{
\prod_{(i,j)\in \mu} B_{\kappa\mu}^\mu(i,j)
},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{\kappa\mu}^\nu(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\kappa_j'-i+\alpha(\kappa_i-j+1)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\kappa_j'=\mu_j'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\kappa_j'-i+1+\alpha(\kappa_i-j)&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. The expressions &lt;math&gt;\kappa'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt; refer to the conjugate partitions of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The notation &lt;math&gt;(i,j)\in\kappa&lt;/math&gt; means that the product is taken over all coordinates &lt;math&gt;(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; of boxes in the [[Young diagram]] of the partition &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

===Combinatorial formula===

In 1997, F. Knop and S. Sahi {{sfn|Knop|Sahi|1997}} gave a purely combinatorial formula for the Jack polynomials &lt;math&gt;J_\mu^{(\alpha )}&lt;/math&gt; in ''n'' variables:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\mu^{(\alpha )} = \sum_{T} d_T(\alpha) \prod_{s \in T} x_{T(s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum is taken over all ''admissible'' tableaux of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda,&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;d_T(\alpha) = \prod_{s \in T \text{ critical}} d_\lambda(\alpha)(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with 

:&lt;math&gt;d_\lambda(\alpha)(s) = \alpha(a_\lambda(s) +1) + (l_\lambda(s) + 1).&lt;/math&gt;

An ''admissible'' tableau of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a filling of the Young diagram &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; with numbers 1,2,…,''n'' such that for any box (''i'',''j'') in the tableau,
* &lt;math&gt;T(i,j) \neq T(i',j)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;i'&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T(i,j) \neq T(i,j-1)&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;j&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i'&lt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

A box &lt;math&gt;s = (i,j) \in \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is ''critical'' for the tableau ''T'' if &lt;math&gt;j &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(i,j)=T(i,j-1).&lt;/math&gt;

This result can be seen as a special case of the more general combinatorial formula for [[Macdonald polynomials]].

==C normalization==

The Jack functions form an orthogonal basis in a space of symmetric polynomials, with inner product:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle f,g\rangle = \int_{[0,2\pi]^n} f \left (e^{i\theta_1},\ldots,e^{i\theta_n} \right ) \overline{g \left (e^{i\theta_1},\ldots,e^{i\theta_n} \right )} \prod_{1\le j&lt;k\le n} \left |e^{i\theta_j}-e^{i\theta_k} \right |^{\frac{2}{\alpha}} d\theta_1\cdots d\theta_n&lt;/math&gt;

This orthogonality property is unaffected by normalization. The normalization defined above is typically referred to as the '''J''' normalization. The '''C''' normalization is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;C_\kappa^{(\alpha)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{\alpha^{|\kappa|}(|\kappa|)!}{j_\kappa} J_\kappa^{(\alpha)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;j_\kappa=\prod_{(i,j)\in \kappa} \left (\kappa_j'-i+\alpha \left (\kappa_i-j+1 \right ) \right ) \left (\kappa_j'-i+1+\alpha \left (\kappa_i-j \right ) \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\alpha=2, C_\kappa^{(2)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;C_\kappa(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and called the [[Zonal polynomial]].

==P normalization==

The ''P'' normalization is given by the identity &lt;math&gt;J_\lambda = H'_\lambda P_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where 

:&lt;math&gt;H'_\lambda = \prod_{s\in \lambda} (\alpha a_\lambda(s) + l_\lambda(s) + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;a_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Young tableau#Arm and leg length|arm and leg length]] respectively. Therefore, for &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1, P_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the usual Schur function.

Similar to Schur polynomials, &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a sum over Young tableaux. However, one need to add an extra weight to each tableau that depends on the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, a formula {{sfn|Macdonald|1995|pp=379}} for the Jack function &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; P_\lambda = \sum_{T} \psi_T(\alpha) \prod_{s \in \lambda}  x_{T(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over all tableaux of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T(s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the entry in box ''s'' of ''T''.

The weight &lt;math&gt; \psi_T(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt; can be defined in the following fashion: Each tableau ''T'' of shape &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as a sequence of partitions 

:&lt;math&gt; \emptyset = \nu_1 \to \nu_2 \to \dots \to \nu_n = \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu_{i+1}/\nu_i&lt;/math&gt; defines the skew shape with content ''i'' in ''T''. Then 

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_T(\alpha) = \prod_i \psi_{\nu_{i+1}/\nu_i}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{\lambda/\mu}(\alpha) = \prod_{s \in R_{\lambda/\mu}-C_{\lambda/\mu} } \frac{(\alpha a_\mu(s) + l_\mu(s) +1)}{(\alpha a_\mu(s) + l_\mu(s) + \alpha)} \frac{(\alpha a_\lambda(s) + l_\lambda(s) + \alpha)}{(\alpha a_\lambda(s) + l_\lambda(s) +1)}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the product is taken only over all boxes ''s'' in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that ''s'' has a box from &lt;math&gt;\lambda/\mu&lt;/math&gt; in the same row, but ''not'' in the same column.

==Connection with the Schur polynomial==

When &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1&lt;/math&gt; the Jack function is a scalar multiple of the [[Schur polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;
J^{(1)}_\kappa(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = H_\kappa s_\kappa(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n),
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
H_\kappa=\prod_{(i,j)\in\kappa} h_\kappa(i,j)=
\prod_{(i,j)\in\kappa} (\kappa_i+\kappa_j'-i-j+1)
&lt;/math&gt;
is the product of all hook lengths of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

If the partition has more parts than the number of variables, then the Jack function is 0:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m)=0, \mbox{ if }\kappa_{m+1}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Matrix argument==
In some texts, especially in random matrix theory, authors have found it more convenient to use a matrix argument in the Jack function. The connection is simple. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix with eigenvalues
&lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m&lt;/math&gt;, then 

:&lt;math&gt;
J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(X)=J_\kappa^{(\alpha )}(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m).
&lt;/math&gt;

Youngs was the son of a missionary. He completed his undergraduate study at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] and received his PhD from [[Ohio State University]] in 1934 under [[Tibor Radó]]. He then taught for 18 years at [[Indiana University]], where for eight years he was chair of the mathematics department. From 1964 he was a professor at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], where he developed the mathematics faculty and was chair of the academic senate of the university.
 
Youngs worked in [[geometric topology]], for example, questions on the Frechét-equivalence of topological maps.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs ''The representation problem for Frechét Surfaces'', Memoirs American Mathematical Society 1951&lt;/ref&gt; He is famous for the [[Heawood conjecture|Ringel–Youngs theorem]] (''i.e.'' Ringel and Youngs's 1968 proof of the Heawood conjecture),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

John Youngs was a consultant for [[Sandia National Laboratories]], the [[Rand Corporation]] and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] as well as a trustee for ''Carver Research Foundation Institute'' in [[Tuskegee]]. In 1946–1947 he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]]. At the University of Santa Cruz a mathematics prize for undergraduates in named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16646">In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions''', also known as the '''Kuhn–Tucker conditions''', are [[first-order condition|first derivative tests]] (sometimes called first-order) [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary conditions]] for a solution in [[nonlinear programming]] to be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]], provided that some [[#Regularity conditions (or constraint qualifications)|regularity condition]]s are satisfied. Allowing inequality constraints, the KKT approach to nonlinear programming generalizes the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which allows only equality constraints. The system of equations and inequalities corresponding to the KKT conditions is usually not solved directly, except in the few special cases where a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] solution can be derived analytically. In general, many optimization algorithms can be interpreted as methods for numerically solving the KKT system of equations and inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Vandenberghe|first2=Lieven|title=Convex Optimization|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge |year=2004|pages=244|isbn=0-521-83378-7|mr=2061575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKT conditions were originally named after [[Harold W. Kuhn]] and [[Albert W. Tucker]], who first published the conditions in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

== Nonlinear optimization problem ==

Consider the following nonlinear [[optimization problem|minimization or maximization problem]]:

:Optimize &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:subject to

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \leq 0, &lt;/math&gt; 
::&lt;math&gt; h_j(x) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the optimization variable, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[objective function|objective]] or [[utility]] function, &lt;math&gt; g_i \ (i = 1, \ldots, m) &lt;/math&gt; are the inequality [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] functions, and &lt;math&gt;h_j \ (j = 1,\ldots,\ell)&lt;/math&gt; are the equality constraint functions. The numbers of inequality and equality constraints are denoted &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

== Necessary conditions ==

Suppose that the [[objective function]] &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint functions &lt;math&gt;g_i : \,\!\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_j : \,\!\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are [[smooth function|continuously differentiable]] at a point &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; is a [[local optimum]] and the optimization problem  satisfies some regularity conditions (see below), then there exist constants &lt;math&gt;\mu_i\ (i = 1,\ldots,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_j\ (j = 1,\ldots,\ell)&lt;/math&gt;, called KKT multipliers, such that

[[File:Inequality constraint diagram.svg|thumb|upright=2|Inequality constraint diagram for optimization problems]]

;Stationarity
: For maximizing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x^*) = \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \nabla h_j(x^*),&lt;/math&gt;
: For minimizing &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;-\nabla f(x^*) = \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \nabla h_j(x^*),&lt;/math&gt;

;Primal feasibility
:&lt;math&gt;g_i(x^*) \le 0, \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_j(x^*) = 0, \text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, \ell \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

;Dual feasibility
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i \ge 0, \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;

;Complementary slackness
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i g_i (x^*) = 0, \text{ for }\; i = 1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;

In the particular case &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., when there are no inequality constraints, the KKT conditions turn into the Lagrange conditions, and the KKT multipliers are called [[Lagrange multipliers]].

If some of the functions are non-differentiable, [[subderivative|subdifferential]] versions of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are available.&lt;ref&gt;

== Regularity conditions (or constraint qualifications) ==
In order for a minimum point &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy the above KKT conditions, the problem should satisfy some regularity conditions; some common examples are tabulated here:

|}

It can be shown that

: LICQ ⇒ MFCQ ⇒ CPLD ⇒ QNCQ

and

: LICQ ⇒ CRCQ ⇒ CPLD ⇒ QNCQ

(and the converses are not true), although MFCQ is not equivalent to CRCQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport
| url         = http://people.ufpr.br/~ademir.ribeiro/ensino/cm721/kkt.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In practice weaker constraint qualifications are preferred since they provide stronger optimality conditions.

== Sufficient conditions ==

In some cases, the necessary conditions are also sufficient for optimality. In general, the necessary conditions are not sufficient for optimality and additional information is necessary, such as the Second Order Sufficient Conditions (SOSC). For smooth functions, SOSC involve the second derivatives, which explains its name.

The necessary conditions are sufficient for optimality if the objective function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of a maximization problem is a [[concave function]], the inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; are continuously differentiable [[convex function]]s and the equality constraints &lt;math&gt;h_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[affine function]]s.

It was shown by Martin in 1985 that the broader class of functions in which KKT conditions guarantees global optimality are the so-called Type 1 '''[[invex function]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. H. |last=Martin |journal=J. Optim. Theory Appl. |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=65–76 |title=The Essence of Invexity |year= 1985 |doi=10.1007/BF00941316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. A. |last=Hanson |title=Invexity and the Kuhn-Tucker Theorem |journal=J. Math. Anal. Appl. |volume=236 |issue=2 |pages=594–604 |year=1999 |doi=10.1006/jmaa.1999.6484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-order sufficient conditions ===

For smooth, [[Nonlinear programming|non-linear optimization]] problems, a second order sufficient condition is given as follows.

The solution &lt;math&gt;x^*, \lambda^*, \mu^*&lt;/math&gt; found in the above section is a constrained local minimum if for the Lagrangian,

:&lt;math&gt; L(x,\lambda,\mu) = f(x) + \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i g_i(x) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j h_j(x) &lt;/math&gt;

then,

:&lt;math&gt;s^T\nabla ^2_{xx}L(x^*,\lambda^*,\mu^*)s \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is a vector satisfying the following,

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ \nabla_x g_i(x^*),  \nabla_x h_j(x^*) \right]^T s = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where only those active inequality constraints &lt;math&gt;g_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to strict complementarity (i.e. where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;) are applied. The solution is a strict constrained local minimum in the case the inequality is also strict.

== Economics ==
{{see also|Profit maximization}}
Often in [[mathematical economics]] the KKT approach is used in theoretical models in order to obtain qualitative results. For example,&lt;ref&gt;Chiang, Alpha C. ''Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics'', 3rd edition, 1984, pp. 750–752.&lt;/ref&gt; consider a firm that maximizes its sales revenue subject to a minimum profit constraint. Letting &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be the quantity of output produced (to be chosen), &lt;math&gt;R(Q)&lt;/math&gt; be sales revenue with a positive first derivative and with a zero value at zero output, &lt;math&gt;C(Q)&lt;/math&gt; be production costs with a positive first derivative and with a non-negative value at zero output, and &lt;math&gt;G_{\min}&lt;/math&gt; be the positive minimal acceptable level of [[Profit (economics)|profit]], then the problem is a meaningful one if the revenue function levels off so it eventually is less steep than the cost function.  The problem expressed in the previously given minimization form is

:Minimize &lt;math&gt; -R(Q)&lt;/math&gt; 
:subject to 
:&lt;math&gt; G_{\min} \le R(Q) - C(Q)  &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; Q \ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

and the KKT conditions are

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} \right) (1+\mu ) - \mu \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q} \right) \le 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; Q \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; Q \left[ \left( \frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} \right) (1+\mu ) - \mu \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q}\right) \right] = 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; R(Q) - C(Q) - G_{\min} \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; \mu \ge 0, \\[5pt]
&amp; \mu [R(Q) - C(Q) - G_{\min}] = 0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;Q = 0&lt;/math&gt; would violate the minimum profit constraint, we have &lt;math&gt;Q &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and hence the third condition implies that the first condition holds with equality. Solving that equality gives

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\text{d} R}{\text{d} Q} = \frac{\mu}{1+ \mu} \left( \frac{\text{d} C}{\text{d} Q} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Because it was given that &lt;math&gt;\text{d} R / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{d} C / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; are strictly positive, this inequality along with the non-negativity condition on &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is positive and so the revenue-maximizing firm operates at a level of output at which [[marginal revenue]] &lt;math&gt; \text{d} R / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; is less than [[marginal cost]] &lt;math&gt; \text{d} C / \text{d} Q&lt;/math&gt; — a result that is of interest because it contrasts with the behavior of a [[profit maximization|profit maximizing]] firm, which operates at a level at which they are equal.

== Value function ==
If we reconsider the optimization problem as a maximization problem with constant inequality constraints:
:&lt;math&gt; \text{Maximize }\; f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{subject to }\ &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \le a_i , h_j(x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The value function is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;V(a_1, \ldots, a_n) = \sup\limits_x f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \text{subject to }\ &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; g_i(x) \le a_i , h_j(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; j \in \{1,\ldots, \ell\}, i\in\{1,\ldots,m\},&lt;/math&gt;

so the domain of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{a \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \text{for some }x\in X, g_i(x) \leq a_i, i \in \{1,\ldots,m\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this definition, each coefficient &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the value function  increases as &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; increases.  Thus if each &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as a resource constraint, the coefficients tell you how much increasing a resource will increase the optimum value of our function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  This interpretation is especially important in economics and is used, for instance, in [[utility maximization problem]]s.

== Generalizations ==

With an extra multiplier &lt;math&gt;\mu_0\geq0&lt;/math&gt;, which may be zero (as long as &lt;math&gt;(\mu_0,\mu,\lambda)\neq0&lt;/math&gt;), in front of &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x^*)&lt;/math&gt; the KKT stationarity conditions turn into

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \mu_0 \,\nabla f(x^*) + \sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \,\nabla g_i(x^*) + \sum_{j=1}^\ell \lambda_j \,\nabla h_j(x^*) = 0, \\[4pt]
&amp; \mu_jg_i(x^*)=0, \quad i=1,\dots,m,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which are called the [[Fritz John conditions]]. This optimality conditions holds without constraint qualifications and it is equivalent to the optimality condition ''KKT or (not-MFCQ)''.

The KKT conditions belong to a wider class of the first-order necessary conditions (FONC), which allow for non-smooth functions using [[subderivative]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21006">'''Kinetic logic''', developed by [[Rene Thomas (science)|René Thomas]], is a Qualitative Modeling approach feasible to model impact, [[feedback]], and the [[wikt:temporal|temporal]] evolution of the variables. It uses symbolic descriptions and avoids continuous descriptions e.g. [[differential equations]].The derivation of the dynamics from the interaction graphs of systems is not easy. A lot of parameters have to be inferred, for differential description, even if the type of each interaction is known in the graph. Even small modifications in parameters can lead to a strong change in the dynamics. Kinetic Logic is used to build [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] models, in which such details of the systems are not required. The information required can be derived directly from the graph of interactions or from a sufficiently explicit verbal description. It only considers the thresholds of the elements and uses logical equations to construct state tables. Through this procedure, it is a straightforward matter to determine the behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., (1973) Boolean formulization of genetic control circuits. Journal of Theoretical Biology. 42 (3): 565–583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following is René Thomas’s formalism for Kinetic Logic :

In a directed graph G = (V, A), we note G− (v) and G+ (v) the set of predecessors and successors of a node v ∈ V respectively.

'''Definition 1:''' A biological regulatory network (BRN) is a tuple G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) where &lt;br /&gt;
(V, A) is a directed graph denoted by G,&lt;br /&gt;
l is a function from V to N,&lt;br /&gt;
s is a function from A to {+, −},&lt;br /&gt;
t is a function from A to N such that, for all u ∈ V, if G+(u) is not empty then {t(u, v) | v ∈ G+(u)} = { 1, . . . , l(u)}.&lt;br /&gt;
K = {Kv | v ∈ V} is a set of maps: for each v ∈ V, Kv is a function from 2G− (v) to {0, . . . , l(v)} such that Kv(ω) ≤ Kv(ω_) for all ω ⊆ ω_ ⊆ G−(v).

The map l describes the domain of each variable v: if l (v) = k, the abstract concentration on v holds its value in {0, 1, . . . , k}. Similarly, the map s represents the sign of the regulation (+ for an activation, − for an inhibition). t (u, v) is the threshold of the regulation from u to v: this regulation takes place iff the abstract concentration of u is above t(u, v), in such a case the regulation is said active. The condition on these thresholds states that each variation of the level of u induces a modification of the set of active regulations starting from u. For all x ∈ [0, . . ., l(u) − 1], the set of active regulations of u, when the discrete expression level of u is x, differs from the set when the discrete expression level is x + 1. Finally, the map Kv allows us to define what is the effect of a set of regulators on the specific target v. If this set is ω ⊆ G− (v), then, the target v is subject to a set of regulations which makes it to evolve towards a particular level Kv(ω).

'''Definition 2''' (States): &lt;br /&gt;
A state μ of a BRN G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) is a function from V to N such that μ (v) ∈ {0 .., l (v)} for all variables v ∈ V. We denote EG the set of states of G.&lt;br /&gt;
When μ (u) ≥ t (u, v) and s (u, v) = +, we say that u is a resource of v since the activation takes place. Similarly when μ (u) &lt; t (u, v) and s (u, v) = −, u is also a resource of v since the inhibition does not take place (the absence of the inhibition is treated as an activation).

'''Definition 3''' (Resource function): &lt;br /&gt;
Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN. For each v ∈ V we define the resource function ωv: EG → 2G− (v) by:
ωv (μ) = {u ∈ G−(v) | (μ(u) ≥ t(u, v) and s(u, v) = +) or (μ (u) &lt; t (u, v) and s (u, v) = −)}.&lt;br /&gt;
As said before, at state μ, Kv (ωv(μ)) gives the level towards which the variable v tends to evolve. We consider three cases,
* if μ(v) &lt; Kv(ωv(μ)) then v can increase by one unit
* if μ(v) &gt; Kv(ωv(μ)) then v can decrease by one unit
* if μ(v) = Kv (ωv (μ)) then v cannot evolve.

'''Definition 4''' (Signs of derivatives): &lt;br /&gt;
Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN and v ∈ V. &lt;br /&gt;
We define αv: EG → {+1, 0, −1} by αv(μ) =&lt;br /&gt;
+1 if Kv (ωv(μ)) &gt; μ(u)&lt;br /&gt;
0 if Kv (ωv(μ)) = μ(u)&lt;br /&gt;
−1 if Kv (ωv(μ)) &lt; μ(u)

The signs of derivatives show the tendency of the solution trajectories.

The state graph of BRN represents the set of the states that a BRN can adopt with transitions among them deduced from the previous rules:

'''Definition 5''' (State graph): &lt;br /&gt;
Let G = (V, A, b, s, t,K) be a BRN. The state graph of G is a directed graph G = (EG, T) with (μ, μ_) ∈ T if there exists v ∈ V such that:&lt;br /&gt;
αv (μ) ≠ 0 and μ’ (v) = μ (v) + αv (μ) and μ (u) = μ’ (u), ∀u ∈ V \ {v}.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., (1978) Logical analysis of systems comprising feedback loops. J Theor Biol.73(4): 631–656.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical Assumptions ===
The critical assumptions of Kinetic Logic are:
# The elements of system have slight effect on each other until they reach a threshold.
# At high levels the effect on each other tends to reach a plateau. So an element is present when greater than the threshold level and absent when it is below the threshold level.&lt;ref&gt;Kupper Z and Hoffman H., (1995) Modeling the Dynamics of Psychosis by Kinetic Logic (4-95). Bern, Switzerland: University of Bern, Department of Social and Community Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steps of Application ==

Following are the steps of Application of Kinetic Logic (Also shown in figure A).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., and D’Ari R., (1990) Biological feedback. FL: CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological Regulatory Network (BRN)===
Keeping the research problem in mind, the behavior of elements in the system and their interactions are studied. Elements of a system can interact positively or negatively, that is, the level of an element may activate or reduce the rate of production of other elements or of itself. These interactions are represented as positive (activation) or negative (inhibition). &lt;br /&gt;
When elements are connected in a topologically circular way, they exert an influence on their own rate of synthesis and they form a feedback loop. A feedback loop is positive or negative according to whether it contains an even or odd number of negative interactions. In a positive loop, each element of the system exerts a positive effect on its own rate of synthesis, whereas in a simple negative loop, each element has a negative effect on its own rate of synthesis. A simple positive feedback loop results in epigenetic regulation and have multiple steady states and a simple negative feedback loop results in homeostatic regulation.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Abstraction:''' A chain of positive interactions is equivalent to a direct positive interaction between the two extreme elements, and any two negative interactions cancel out each other’s effect. In this way, any simple feedback loop can be abridged to a one-element loop, positive or negative according to the number of negative interactions (even or odd) in the original loop. Accordingly, through extensive literature survey and the application of the above-mentioned rules, a BRN is abstracted.

===Logical Variable and Functions===

Logical variables are associated with the elements of the system to describe the state of the system. They consist of the logical values. For example, a system whose state is appropriately described by the levels of substances a, b, and c, each of which can be absent, present at low level, or present at high level are represented by logical values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.&lt;br /&gt;
If a product an acts to stimulate the production of b, it is a positive regulator. In this case, the rate of synthesis of b increases with increasing concentration of a, and makes a curve similar to that shown in figure B.&lt;br /&gt;
There is little effect of a, until it reaches a threshold concentration theta, and at higher concentrations a plateau is reached which shows the maximal rate of synthesis of b. Such a nonlinear, bounded curve is called a sigmoid. It can be suggested that a is "absent" for a &lt; theta and "present" for a &gt; theta. The sigmoid curve can be approximated by the step function, as in figure C.&lt;br /&gt; 
Not only logical variables (x, y, z ...) are associated to the elements, that represent their level (e.g., concentration), but also logical functions (X, Y, Z ...) whose value reflects the rate of synthesis of the element. Thus,&lt;br /&gt;
x = 0 means "gene product absent"&lt;br /&gt;
x = 1 means "gene product present"&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;&lt;br /&gt;
X = 0 means "gene off"&lt;br /&gt;
X = 1 means "gene on"

===Graph of Interactions and Logical Equations===

Kinetic Logic has two forms depending on the following two types of descriptions:

'''Naïve Logical Description'''&lt;br /&gt;
Consider a simple two-element system in which product x activates gene Y and product y represses gene X as shown in figure D. Each variable takes only two values; 0 and 1. In other words,&lt;br /&gt;
X = 1 if y = 0 (X "on” if y absent)&lt;br /&gt;
Y = 1 if x = 1 (Y "on" if x present)&lt;br /&gt;
The logical relation of the system can be written:&lt;br /&gt;                                        
X =y&lt;br /&gt;
Y=x

'''Generalized Kinetic Logic'''&lt;br /&gt;
The naive logical description can be generalized and made to accommodate situations in which some variables take more than two values, without complicating the analysis. Any variable has a number of biologically relevant levels, determined by the number of elements regulated by the product x. There is a specific threshold for each regulatory interaction, so if x regulates n elements, it will have up to n different thresholds.&lt;br /&gt;
For the logical sum, there is a procedure that assigns a specific weight to each term in the logical relation. According to the scale of thresholds of the corresponding variable, the weighted algebraic sum is then discretized, so an n-valued variable is associated with an n-valued function. After discretization the integers of certain weights or sums of weights are called logical parameters. &lt;br /&gt;
Generalized Kinetic Logic, although maintaining the analytic simplicity of the naive description, has certain features in common with the differential description. The generalized logical relations are completely independent of the differential description and can be directly derived from the graph of interactions or from an explicit verbal description. &lt;br /&gt;
Consider an example of two elements in figure E. Using a software, this graph of interactions is drawn as shown in figure F. There are two thresholds assigned to element y: Ѳ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, concerning its interaction with x and Ѳ&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, concerning its interaction with itself. The variable y and function Y have three possible values: 0, 1, and 2. Element x have a single threshold, Ѳ&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, because of the interaction x to +y, so the variable x and function X will be two-valued.

===State Table and State Graph===
The state table of graph of interactions in figure D is shown in figure G. This table states for each state of the variables (x, y) i.e. present or absent, which products are synthesized and which are not synthesized at a significant rate. Consider the state 00/10, in which both of the gene products are absent but gene X is on. As product x is absent but being synthesized so it can be expected that in near future it will be present and the logical value of x will change from 0 to 1. This can be described by the notation  Ō, in which the dash above the digit is due to the fact that variable x is committed to change its value from 0 to 1. Generally, a dash over the figure representing the logical value of a variable each time this value is different from that of the corresponding function. The state just considered can thus be represented as ŌO.

'''Time Delays'''&lt;br /&gt;
The movement of a system from one state to another depends on the time delays. The time delays in systems are short time shifts of arbitrary duration. In view of the relation between a function (gene on or off) and its associated variable (gene product present or absent), the time delays become real entities whose values, far from being arbitrary, reflect specific physical processes (synthesis, degradation, dilution, etc.). The values of the different time delays play an important role in determining the pathway along which the system evolves.

The temporal relation between a logical variable x which is associated with the level of an element and a logical function X which is associated with its evolution can be explained as follows.

Consider a gene that is off (X = 0) for a considerable time, then is switched on (X = 1) by a signal, and then, after some time, it is switched off again (X= 0) by another signal and the product reappears but not immediately until a proper delay tx has elapsed. If a signal switches the gene off temporarily, the product is still present because it also requires a time delay t&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;’. This can be represented graphically as shown in figure H. Using the state table the temporal sequence of states of the system can be represented as shown in figure I.

===Identifying Cycles and Stable Steady States===

'''Cycles'''&lt;br /&gt;
The state table in D can be used to identify the cyclic behavior of the system. We can see that state 01 changes to 00, and 00 changes to 10, 10 changes to 11 and 11 changes back to 01. This represents a cycle as the system starts from the state 01 and returns to the same state. The system keeps oscillating between these states. 
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Deadlocks'''&lt;br /&gt;
Consider another example in which:
X=y&lt;br /&gt;
Y=x&lt;br /&gt;
The state table for the system is shown in figure J. The states that are encircled are stable states, as they do not evolve towards any other state. The logical stable states are defined as those for which the vectors xy . .. and XY ... are equal. When we considered the time delays i.e. from  ŌŌ the system will proceed to state 1 0 or to state 01, according to whether tx &lt; ty or ty &lt; tx, and from ĪĪ the system will proceed to state 10 or to state 0 1 according to whether ty &lt; tx or tx &lt; ty. The state graph representing delays is shown in figure K.&lt;br /&gt;
The sequence of states a system depends on the relative values of the time delays. It is assumed that two delays (or sums of delays) are never exactly equal, therefore that two variables will not change their values at the same instant. But do not exclude the possibility because if this rule is applied rigidly, it could occasionally lead to the loss of interesting pathways.

===Analyzing the Results===
The cycles and the deadlock states identified by this process are then analyzed by comparing them with the invitro and invivo findings. These results can be used to make important predictions about the system. Cyclic behaviors correspond to homeostatic regulations that retain the level of a variable at or near a fixed or optimal value. Deadlocks represent epigenetic regulation in which the concentrations exist between extreme levels.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., and D’Ari R., (1990) Biological feedback. FL: CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first approach for qualitative modeling was based on extreme discretization since all genes could be either on (present) or off (absent).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., (1978) Logical analysis of systems comprising feedback loops. J Theor Biol.73(4): 631–656.&lt;/ref&gt; This Boolean approach was generalized into a multi-valued approach i.e. Kinetic Logic,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., (1991) Regulatory networks seen as asynchronous automata: a logical description. J Theor Biol. 153: 1–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snoussi E., (1989) Qualitative dynamics of a piecewise-linear differential equations: a discrete mapping approach. DSS. 4:189–207.&lt;/ref&gt; in which logical identification of all steady states became possible.&lt;ref&gt;Snoussi E., and Thomas R., (1993) Logical identification of all steady states : the concept of feedback loop characteristic states. Bull Math Biol. 55(5):973–991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Kinetic logic has been employed to study the factors that influence the selection of specific pathway from many different pathways that the system can follow and the factors that lead the system towards stable states and cyclic behaviors. It has been used to reveal the logic that lie behind the functional organization and kinetic behavior of molecules. Model checking techniques have also been applied to models built through kinetic logic, in order to infer their continuous behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ahmad, and O. Roux, “Analysing formal models of genetic regulatory networks with delays,” Int. J. Bioinformatics Research and Applications. vol. 4. pp. 240-262, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinetic logic has been applied on many different types of systems in biology, Psychology and Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Kupper Z and Hoffman H., (1995) Modeling the Dynamics of Psychosis by Kinetic Logic (4-95). Bern, Switzerland: University of Bern, Department of Social and Community Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly Kinetic Logic has been used in modeling the biological networks especially the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Following are the examples in which Kinetic Logic was employed as the modeling formalism:

* To model the dynamics of chronic psychosis and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Kupper Z and Hoffman H., (1995) Modeling the Dynamics of Psychosis by Kinetic Logic (4-95). Bern, Switzerland: University of Bern, Department of Social and Community Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breedlove S.M., Rosenzweig M.R., and Watson N.V., (2010) Biological Psychology (6th Edition): {{ISBN|0878933247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To show that how residence time of the hormone on the receptor can decide the specificity of signaling between the alternative metabolic or mitogenic pathways,&lt;ref&gt;de Jong H., (2002) Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory systems: a literature review.  J Comput Biol. 9(1):67–103.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* To explain the positive (cell proliferation and cytokine production) and negative (anergy induction) signaling of T lymphocytes; to determine how the timing of the binding and intracellular signal-transduction events can influence the properties of receptor signaling and decide the type of cellular response&lt;ref&gt;de Jong H., (2002) Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory systems: a literature review.  J Comput Biol. 9(1):67–103.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* To demonstrate how prion infection proceeds&lt;ref&gt;de Jong H., (2002) Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory systems: a literature review.  J Comput Biol. 9(1):67–103.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To model other biological regulatory networks (BRNs) like toy gene, lambda phage (Ahmad and Roux, 2008), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and circadian rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ahmad, and O. Roux, “Analysing formal models of genetic regulatory networks with delays,” Int. J. Bioinformatics Research and Applications. vol. 4. pp. 240-262, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To reveal the logic that lie behind the functional organization and kinetic behavior of the thioredoxin system &lt;ref&gt;de Jong H., (2002) Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory systems: a literature review.  J Comput Biol. 9(1):67–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tool==
As theoretical analysis through Kinetic Logic is a time consuming process, a tool known as Genotech, for modeling and analysis of BRNs was developed on the basis of Kinetic Logic and has been used for a number of Kinetic Logic-based studies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Ahmad, “Modélisation hybride et analyse des dynamiques des réseaux de régulations biologiques en tenant compte des délais, “ PhD thesis, Ecole Centrale de Nantes, France, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It analyzes behaviors like stable cycles, stable steady states and paths in the state graph (discrete model) of biological systems, accelerating the process of modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R., and D’Ari R., (1990) Biological feedback. FL: CRC Press, Boca Raton.&lt;/ref&gt;  GenoTech is extremely useful as it allows repeated experimentation by automating the whole process. This tool is available on request.

{{nihongo|'''Kunihiko Kodaira'''|小平 邦彦|Kodaira Kunihiko|16 March 1915 &amp;ndash; 26 July 1997}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[mathematician]] known for distinguished work in [[algebraic geometry]] and the theory of [[complex manifold]]s, and as the founder of the Japanese school of algebraic geometers.&lt;ref name = "Kodaira-short"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/alumni/kodaira.html |title=Kunihiko Kodaira (Fields Medal 1954) |last=Miyaoka |first=Yoichi |date= |website=www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp |publisher=The University of Tokyo |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a [[Fields Medal]] in 1954, being the first Japanese national to receive this honour.&lt;ref name = "Kodaira-short"/&gt;

== Early years ==
Kodaira was born in [[Tokyo]]. He graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the [[World War II|war]] years he worked in isolation, but was able to master [[Hodge theory]] as it then stood.  He obtained his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1949, with a thesis entitled ''Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds''. He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo.

== Institute for Advanced Study ==
In 1949 he travelled to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] at the invitation of [[Hermann Weyl]]. At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding [[sheaf theory]] as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]].

In a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with [[Donald C. Spencer]], founding the [[deformation theory]] of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of [[moduli space]]s, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the [[holomorphic tangent bundle]], that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) [[scheme theory]] of [[Grothendieck]]. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as [[G-structure]]s.

In a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the [[classification of algebraic surfaces]] from the point of view of [[birational geometry]] of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of [[elliptic fibration]]s of surfaces over a curve, or in other language [[elliptic curve]]s over [[algebraic function field]]s, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of [[K3 surface]]s as deformations of [[quartic surface]]s in ''P''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and the theorem that they form a single [[diffeomorphism]] class. Again, this work has proved foundational.  (The K3 surfaces were named after [[Ernst Kummer]], [[Erich Kähler]], and Kodaira).

==Later years==
Kodaira left the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] and [[Stanford University]].  In 1967, returned to the [[University of Tokyo]]. He was awarded a [[Wolf Prize]] in 1984/5. He died in [[Kofu]] on 26 July 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">In [[numerical analysis]], the '''Lax equivalence theorem''' is the fundamental theorem in the analysis of [[finite difference method]]s for the numerical solution of [[partial differential equation]]s. It states that for a consistent finite difference method for a [[well-posed]] linear [[initial value problem]], the method is [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] if and only if it is [[Numerical stability#Stability in numerical differential equations|stable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the theorem is that while convergence of the solution of the finite difference method to the solution of the partial differential equation is what is desired, it is ordinarily difficult to establish because the numerical method is defined by a [[recurrence relation]] while the [[differential equation]] involves a [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] function. However, consistency—the requirement that the finite difference method approximate the correct partial differential equation—is straightforward to verify, and stability is typically much easier to show than convergence (and would be needed in any event to show that [[round-off error]] will not destroy the computation). Hence convergence is usually shown via the Lax equivalence theorem.

Stability in this context means that a [[matrix norm]] of the matrix used in the iteration is at most [[unity (mathematics)|unity]], called (practical) Lax–Richtmyer stability.&lt;ref&gt;

*(i) The map &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k B \to AB&lt;/math&gt; induced by &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \mapsto xy&lt;/math&gt; is injective.
*(ii) Any ''k''-basis of ''A'' remains linearly independent over ''B''.
*(iii) If &lt;math&gt;u_i, v_j&lt;/math&gt; are ''k''-bases for ''A'', ''B'', then the products &lt;math&gt;u_i v_j&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent over ''k''.

Note that, since every subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a domain, (i) implies &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k B&lt;/math&gt; is a domain (in particular [[reduced ring|reduced]]). Conversely if ''A'' and ''B'' are fields and either ''A'' or ''B'' is an algebraic extension of ''k'' and &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k B&lt;/math&gt; is a domain then it is a field and ''A'' and ''B'' are linearly disjoint. However there are examples where &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k B&lt;/math&gt; is a domain but ''A'' and ''B'' are not linearly disjoint: for example, ''A''=''B''=''k''(''t''), the field of rational functions over ''k''.

One also has: ''A'', ''B'' are linearly disjoint over ''k'' if and only if subfields of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt;, resp. are linearly disjoint over ''k''. (cf. [[tensor product of fields]])

Suppose ''A'', ''B'' are linearly disjoint over ''k''. If &lt;math&gt;A' \subset A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B' \subset B&lt;/math&gt; are subalgebras, then &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; are linearly disjoint over ''k''. Conversely, if any finitely generated subalgebras of algebras ''A'', ''B'' are linearly disjoint, then ''A'', ''B'' are linearly disjoint (since the condition involves only finite sets of elements.)

A '''machinist calculator''' is a hand-held [[calculator]] programmed with built-in formulas making it easy and quick for [[machinist]]s to establish [[Speeds and feeds|speeds, feeds]] and time without guesswork or conversion charts. Formulas may include [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM), surface feet per minute (SFM), inches per minute (IPM), feed per tooth (FPT). A cut time (CT) function takes the user, step-by-step, through a calculation to determine cycle time (execution time) for a given tool motion. Other features may include a [[metric system|metric]]-English conversion function, a [[stop watch]]/timer function and a standard math calculator. 

This type of calculator is useful for [[machinist]]s, [[programmer]]s, [[inspector]]s, [[estimator]]s, supervisors, and students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15262">'''Mental poker''' is the common name for a set of [[cryptographic]] problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a [[trusted third party]]. The term is also applied to the [[theories]] surrounding these problems and their possible solutions. The name comes from the [[card game]] [[poker]] which is one of the games to which this kind of problem applies. Similar problems described as two party games are Blum's [[Coin_flipping#Telecommunications|flipping a coin over a distance]],  [[Yao's Millionaires' Problem]], and Rabin's [[Oblivious transfer]].

The problem can be described thus: "How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?". (Eliminating the trusted third-party avoids the problem of trying to determine whether the third party can be trusted or not, and may also reduce the resources required.)

In poker, this could translate to: "How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal [[mail]], for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as [[online poker]], where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, this is impossible unless the method used is such that it cannot allow any party to cheat by manipulating or inappropriately observing the electronic "deck".

Several protocols for doing this have been suggested, the first by [[Adi Shamir]], [[Ron Rivest]] and [[Len Adleman]] (the creators of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-encryption protocol).&lt;ref&gt; A. Shamir, R. Rivest, and L. Adleman, "Mental Poker", Technical Report LCS/TR-125, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, April 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; This protocol was the first example of two parties conducting secure computation rather than secure message transmission, employing cryptography; later on due to leaking partial information in the original protocol, this led the definition of [[Semantic security]] by [[Shafi Goldwasser]] and [[Silvio Micali]]. Multi-player mental poker was first given in &lt;ref&gt; [[Moti Yung]]: 
Cryptoprotocols: Subscription to a Public Key, the Secret Blocking and the Multi-Player Mental Poker Game (Extended Abstract). CRYPTO 1984: 439-453.&lt;/ref&gt;
The area has later evolved into what is known as [[Secure multi-party computation]] protocols (for two parties, and multi parties as well).

==Shuffling cards using commutative encryption==
One possible [[algorithm]] for [[shuffle|shuffling]] cards without the use of a trusted third party is to use a [[commutative]] encryption scheme. A commutative scheme means that if some data is encrypted more than once, the order in which you decrypt this data will not matter.

Example: [[Alice and Bob|Alice]] has a [[plaintext]] message. She encrypts this, producing a garbled [[ciphertext]] which she gives then to [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. Bob encrypts the ciphertext again, using the same scheme as Alice but with another [[Key (cryptography)|key]]. When decrypting this double encrypted message, if the encryption scheme is commutative, it will not matter who decrypts first.

===The algorithm===
An algorithm for shuffling cards using commutative encryption would be as follows:

# Alice and Bob agree on a certain "deck" of cards. In practice, this means they agree on a set of numbers or other data such that each element of the set represents a card.
# Alice picks an encryption key A and uses this to encrypt each card of the deck.
# Alice shuffles the cards.
# Alice passes the encrypted and shuffled deck to Bob. With the encryption in place, Bob cannot know which card is which.
# Bob picks an encryption key B and uses this to encrypt each card of the encrypted and shuffled deck.
# Bob shuffles the deck.
# Bob passes the double encrypted and shuffled deck back to Alice.
# Alice decrypts each card using her key A. This still leaves Bob's encryption in place though so she cannot know which card is which.
# Alice picks one encryption key for each card (A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) and encrypts them individually.
# Alice passes the deck to Bob.
# Bob decrypts each card using his key B. This still leaves Alice's individual encryption in place though so he cannot know which card is which.
# Bob picks one encryption key for each card (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.) and encrypts them individually.
# Bob passes the deck back to Alice.
# Alice publishes the deck for everyone playing (in this case only Alice and Bob, see below on expansion though).

The deck is now shuffled.

This algorithm may be expanded for an arbitrary number of players. Players [[Alice and Bob|Carol]], [[Alice and Bob|Dave]] and so forth need only repeat steps 2-4 and 8-10.

During the game, Alice and Bob will pick cards from the deck, identified in which order they are placed in the shuffled deck. When either player wants to see their cards, they will request the corresponding keys from the other player. That player, upon checking that the requesting player is indeed entitled to look at the cards, passes the individual keys for those cards to the other player. The check is to ensure that the player does not try to request keys for cards that do not belong to that player.

Example: Alice has picked cards 1 to 5 in the shuffled deck. Bob has picked cards 6 to 10. Bob requests to look at his allotted cards. Alice agrees that Bob is entitled to look at cards 6 to 10 and gives him her individual card keys A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to A&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Bob decrypts his cards by using both Alice's keys and his own for these cards, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Bob can now see the cards. Alice cannot know which cards Bob has because she does not have access to Bob's keys B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; which are required to decrypt the cards.

===Weakness===
The encryption scheme used must be secure against [[known-plaintext attack]]s: Bob must not be able to determine Alice's original key A (or enough of it to allow him to decrypt any cards he does not hold) based on his knowledge of the unencrypted values of the cards he has drawn. This rules out some obvious commutative encryption schemes, such as simply [[XOR]]ing each card with the key. (Using a separate key for each card even in the initial exchange, which would otherwise [[one-time pad|make this scheme secure]], doesn't work since the cards are shuffled before they're returned.)

Depending on the deck agreed upon, this algorithm may be weak. When encrypting data, certain properties of this data may be preserved from the plaintext to the ciphertext. This may be used to "tag" certain cards. Therefore, the parties must agree on a deck where no cards have properties that are preserved during encryption.

==A Toolbox for Mental Card Games and its Implementation==
Christian Schindelhauer describes sophisticated protocols to both perform and verify a large number of useful operations on cards and stacks of cards in his 1998 paper [SCH98]. The work is concerned with general-purpose operations (masking and unmasking cards, shuffling and re-shuffling, inserting a card into a stack, etc.) that make the protocols applicable to any card game. The [[cryptography|cryptographic protocols]] used by Schindelhauer are based on [[quadratic residue|quadratic residuosity]], and the general scheme is similar in spirit to the above protocol. The correctness of operations can be checked by using [[zero-knowledge proof]]s, so that players don't need to reveal their strategy to verify the game's correctness.

The C++ library libtmcg [STA05] provides an implementation of the Schindelhauer toolbox. It has been used to implement a secure version of the German card game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], achieving modest real-world performance. The game Skat is played by three players with a 32-card deck, and so is substantially less computationally intensive than a poker game in which anywhere from five to eight players use a full 52-card deck.

==A non-shuffling poker protocol==
To date, mental poker approaches based on the standard Alice-Bob protocol (above) don't offer high enough performance for real-time online play. The requirement that each player encrypts each card imposes a substantial overhead. A recent paper by Golle [GOL05] describes a mental poker protocol that achieves significantly higher performance by exploiting the properties of the poker game to move away from the encrypt-shuffle model. Rather than shuffle the cards and then deal as needed, with the new approach, the players generate (encrypted) random numbers on the fly, which are used to select the next card. Every new card needs to be checked against all the cards that have already been dealt to detect duplicates. As a result, this method is uniquely useful in poker-style games, in which the number of cards dealt is very small compared to the size of the whole deck. However, the method needs all cards that have already been dealt to be known to all, which in most poker-style games would beat its very purpose.

The card-generation algorithm requires a cryptosystem with two key properties. The encryption E must be additively [[homomorphic]], so that ''E(c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)+E(c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = E(c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''. Second, collisions must be detectable, without revealing the plaintext. In other words, given ''E(c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and ''E(c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'', it must be possible to answer whether ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', without the players learning any other information (specifically, the identities of ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''). The [[Elgamal encryption]] scheme is just one example of a well-known system with these properties.
The algorithm operates as follows:
# Players initialize an empty list ''L'' that records cards that are in use.
# To deal a card, each player computes a random number ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in {0,...,51}, computes ''E(r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'', and publishes a non-malleable [[commitment scheme|commitment]] to ''E(r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)''
# Players then publish their actual ''E(r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'', and can verify that every player honors its commitment
# Players compute &lt;math&gt;\Pi E(r_i) = E(\Sigma r_i) &lt;/math&gt;, which produces a new encrypted card ''E(r*)'', with &lt;math&gt;r* =  \Sigma r_i&lt;/math&gt;
# Players check if ''E(r*)'' is already in ''L''. If not, ''E(r*)'' is dealt to the appropriate player, and added to ''L''. When cards need to be revealed, they can be jointly decrypted.

In this way, the players need only to compute encryption for the cards that are actually used in the game, plus some overhead for the collisions that is small as long as the number of cards needed is much less than the size of the deck. As a result, this scheme turns out to be 2-4 times faster (as measured by the total number of modular exponentiations) than the best-known protocol [JAK99] that does full shuffling using [[mix network|mix-networks]].

Note that the [[Pseudorandomness|random number generation]] is secure as long as any one player is generating valid random numbers. Even if ''k-1'' players collude to generate the number ''r*'', as long as the ''k''th player truthfully generates a random &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt;, the sum &lt;math&gt;r = r* + r'&lt;/math&gt; is still uniformly random in {0, 51}.

Measured in terms of the number of single-agent encryptions, the algorithm in [GOL05] is optimal when no collisions occur, in the sense that any protocol that is fair to every player must perform at least as many encryption operations. At minimum, every agent must encrypt every card that is actually used. Otherwise, if any agent doesn't participate in the encryption, then that agent is susceptible to being cheated by a coalition of the remaining players. Unknown to the non-encrypting agent, the other agents may share the keys to enable them all to know the values of all the cards. Thus, any approach relying on the agents to perform the encryption must focus on schemes that minimize the effect of collisions if they are to achieve better performance.

==Better performance through increased trust==
Any mental poker protocol that relies on the players to perform the encryption is bound by the requirement that every player encrypt every card that is dealt. However, by making limited assumptions about the trustworthiness of third parties, significantly more efficient protocols may be realized. The protocol for choosing cards without shuffling may be adapted so that the encryption is handled by two or more servers. Under the assumption that the servers are non-colluding, such a protocol is secure.

The basic protocol using two servers is as follows:
# Servers ''S1'' and ''S2'' encrypt and shuffle a deck of cards, and publish a non-malleable commitment to some [[permutation]] of encrypted cards to the players. This can be done with any of several well-understood cryptographic protocols.
# Players compute independent random numbers in {0,...,51}, which are combined to generate a random number in {0,..., 51}, as in [GOL05]
# The random number is used as an index into the random permutation, the appropriate player gains "ownership" of the specified card, and the servers send that player the keys to read the card's value.

In this protocol, servers ''S1'' and ''S2'' must collude if either is to learn the values of any cards. Furthermore, because players ultimately decide which cards are dealt, non-trustworthy servers are unable to influence the game to the extent that is possible in traditional [[online poker]]. The scheme may be extended to allow more servers, (and thus, increased security), simply by including the additional servers in the initial encryption. Finally, step one in the protocol may be done offline, allowing for large numbers of shuffled, encrypted "decks" to be pre-computed and cached, resulting in excellent in-game performance.

'''Michèle Audin''' is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the [[University of Geneva]], the [[University of Paris-Sud]] and most recently at l'Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) in [[University of Strasbourg]], where she performed research notably in the area of [[symplectic geometry]].

Born in 1954, Audin is a former student of l'École normale supérieure de jeunes filles within the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. She earned a [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1984 from the [[University of Paris-Sud]], with a thesis written under the supervision of François Latour. She became a member of the [[Oulipo]] in 2009.

She is the daughter of mathematician [[Maurice Audin]], who died under torture in 1957 in [[Algeria]], after having been arrested by parachutists of General [[Jacques Massu]].  On January 1, 2009, she refused to receive the [[Legion of Honour]], on the grounds that the President of France, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwy Plenel]], [http://www.mediapart.fr/club/blog/edwy-plenel/020109/la-lettre-de-michele-audin-a-nicolas-sarkozy « La lettre de Michèle Audin à Nicolas Sarkozy »], ''[[Mediapart]]'', 2 janvier 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2855">'''Muriel Kennett Wales''' (9 Jun 1913 –  8 August 2009) was an Irish-Canadian mathematician, and is believed to have been the first Irish-born woman to earn a PhD in [[pure mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsireland.ie/blog/2017_02_cm The First Irish Woman with a Doctorate in Maths] Mathematics Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first woman born and brought up in Ireland to get a PhD in mathematical science–as opposed to pure mathematics–was [[Sheila Tinney]], in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She was born Muriel Kennett on 9 June 1913 in [[Belfast]].  In 1914, her mother moved to [[Vancouver]] and soon remarried; henceforth Muriel was known by her mother's new last name, Wales.&lt;ref name=tutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
She was first educated at the [[University of British Columbia]] (BA 1934, MA 1937 with the thesis ''Determination of Bases for Certain Quartic Number Fields'').&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_AwsYAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Muriel+Wales&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIzPLxrrzKAhWBOiYKHS5eDnIQ6AEIHDAA Determination of Bases for Certain Quartic Number Fields]'', University of British Columbia (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 she was awarded the PhD from the [[University of Toronto]] for the dissertation ''Theory Of Algebraic Functions Based On The Use Of Cycles'' under [[Samuel Beatty (mathematician)|Samuel Beatty]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.amazon.com/THEORY-ALGEBRAIC-FUNCTIONS-BASED-CYCLES/dp/B00KJ0XT04/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499130471&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=Muriel+Wales Theory Of Algebraic Functions Based On The Use Of Cycles]'', Pamphlet, Trans [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1944), ASIN: B00KJ0XT04&lt;/ref&gt; (himself the first person to receive a PhD in mathematics in Canada, in 1915).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Beatty.html Samuel Beatty] ''[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]'', University of St Andrews.&lt;/ref&gt;

She spent most of the 1940s working in atomic energy, in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], but by 1949 had retired back to Vancouver where she worked in her step-father's shipping company.&lt;ref name=tutor/&gt;

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|2-sphere wireframe as an [[orthogonal projection]]]]
[[File:Hypersphere coord.PNG|right|thumb|Just as a [[stereographic projection]] can project a sphere's surface to a plane, it can also project the surface of a 4-sphere into 3-space. This image shows three coordinate directions projected to 3-space:
parallels (red), [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] (blue) and hypermeridians (green).
Due to the [[conformal map|conformal]] property of the stereographic projection, the curves intersect each other orthogonally (in the yellow points) as in 4D.
All of the curves are circles: the curves that intersect {{angbr|0,0,0,1}} have an infinite radius (= straight line).]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''{{math|''n''}}-sphere''' is the generalization of the ordinary [[sphere]] to [[n-dimensional space|spaces of arbitrary dimension]].  It is an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[manifold]] that can be embedded in Euclidean {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-space.

The 0-sphere is a pair of points, the 1-sphere is a circle, and the 2-sphere is an ordinary sphere.  Generally, when embedded in an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional Euclidean space, an {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the surface or boundary of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]].  That is, for any [[natural number]] {{math|''n''}}, an {{math|''n''}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} may be defined in terms of an [[embedding]] in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] as the set of points that are at distance {{math|''r''}} from a central point, where the radius {{math|''r''}} may be any [[Positive number|positive]] [[real number]]. Thus, the {{math|''n''}}-sphere would be defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; S^n = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \left\| x \right\| = r \right\} .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular:
*the pair of points at the ends of a (one-dimensional) [[line segment]] is a 0-sphere,
*the [[circle]], which is the one-dimensional circumference of a (two-dimensional) disk in the plane is a 1-sphere,
*the two-dimensional surface of a (three-dimensional) ball in three-dimensional space is a 2-sphere, often simply called a [[sphere]],
*the three-dimensional boundary of a (four-dimensional) 4-ball in four-dimensional Euclidean is a [[3-sphere]], also known as a '''glome'''.

An ''n''-sphere embedded in an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional Euclidean space is called a '''[[hypersphere]]'''.  The {{math|''n''}}-sphere of unit radius is called the '''unit {{math|''n''}}-sphere''', denoted {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, often referred to as ''the'' {{math|''n''}}-sphere.

When embedded as described, an {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the surface or boundary of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]. For {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, the {{math|''n''}}-spheres are the [[simply connected]] {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[manifold]]s of constant, positive [[Constant curvature|curvature]]. The {{math|''n''}}-spheres admit several other topological descriptions: for example, they can be constructed by gluing two {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean spaces together, by identifying the boundary of an [[hypercube|{{math|''n''}}-cube]] with a point, or (inductively) by forming the [[suspension (topology)|suspension]] of an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere.

==Description==

For any [[natural number]] {{math|''n''}}, an {{math|''n''}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} is defined as the set of points in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] that are at distance {{math|''r''}} from some fixed point {{math|'''c'''}}, where {{math|''r''}} may be any [[Positive number|positive]] [[real number]] and where {{math|'''c'''}} may be any point in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional space. In particular:
* a 0-sphere is a pair of points {{math|{''c'' − ''r'', ''c'' + ''r''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, and is the boundary of a line segment (1-ball).
* a [[1-sphere]] is a [[circle]] of radius {{math|''r''}} centered at {{math|'''c'''}}, and is the boundary of a disk (2-ball).
* a [[2-sphere]] is an ordinary 3-dimensional [[sphere]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and is the boundary of an ordinary ball (3-ball).
* a [[3-sphere]] is a sphere in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

===Euclidean coordinates in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-space ===

The set of points in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-space, {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, that define an {{math|''n''}}-sphere, {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, is represented by the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;r^2=\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \left(x_i - c_i\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''c'''}}={{math|(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a center point, and {{math|''r''}} is the radius.

The above {{math|''n''}}-sphere exists in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional Euclidean space and is an example of an {{math|''n''}}-[[manifold]].  The [[volume form]] {{math|''ω''}} of an {{math|''n''}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} (-1)^{j-1} x_j \,dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{j-1} \wedge dx_{j+1}\wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{n+1} = * dr&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∗}} is the [[Hodge star operator]]; see {{harvtxt|Flanders|1989|loc=§6.1}} for a discussion and proof of this formula in the case {{math|''r'' {{=}} 1}}.  As a result,
:&lt;math&gt;dr \wedge \omega = dx_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== {{math|''n''}}-ball ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[n-ball]], a redirect page. --&gt;

{{main|Ball (mathematics)}}

The space enclosed by an {{math|''n''}}-sphere is called an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-[[Ball (mathematics)|ball]]. An {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is [[Closed set|closed]] if it includes the {{math|''n''}}-sphere, and it is [[Open set|open]] if it does not include the {{math|''n''}}-sphere.

Specifically:
* A 1-''ball'', a [[line segment]], is the interior of a 0-sphere.
* A 2-''ball'', a [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]], is the interior of a [[circle]] (1-sphere).
* A 3-''ball'', an ordinary [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]], is the interior of a [[sphere]] (2-sphere).
* A 4-''ball'' is the interior of a [[3-sphere]], etc.

===Topological description===

[[Topology|Topologically]], an {{math|''n''}}-sphere can be constructed as a [[Alexandroff extension|one-point compactification]] of {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space.  Briefly, the {{math|''n''}}-sphere can be described as {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ {∞&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, which is {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space plus a single point representing infinity in all directions.
In particular, if a single point is removed from an {{math|''n''}}-sphere, it becomes [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This forms the basis for [[stereographic projection]].&lt;ref&gt;James W. Vick (1994). ''Homology theory'', p. 60. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume and surface area==
{{see also|Volume of an n-ball}}
&lt;div style="display:block; width:300px; float:right; background-color:#eeeeff; border: solid 1px #cccccc; padding: 10px"&gt;
{{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} are the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of the [[Ball (mathematics)|{{math|''n''}}-ball]] and the surface area of the {{math|''n''}}-sphere embedded in dimension {{math|''n'' + 1}}, respectively, of radius {{math|''R''}}.

The constants {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (for {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1}}, the unit ball and sphere) are related by the recurrences:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_0&amp;=1 &amp; V_{n+1}&amp;=\frac{S_n}{n+1} \\[6pt]
S_0&amp;=2 &amp; S_{n+1}&amp;=2\pi V_n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The surfaces and volumes can also be given in closed form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
S_{n}(R) &amp;= \frac{2\pi^\frac{n+1}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)}R^{n} \\[6pt]
V_n(R) &amp;= \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}R^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Γ''}} is the [[gamma function]]. Derivations of these equations are given in this section. 
&lt;/div&gt;
{{hypersphere_volume_and_surface_area_graphs.svg}}
&lt;div style="overflow-wrap: normal"&gt;&lt;!-- Prevent words from breaking in the middle due to the column being very narrow (e.g. on mobile). --&gt;In general, the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space, and the surface area of the {{math|''n''}}-sphere in {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional Euclidean space, of radius {{math|''R''}}, are proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius, {{math|''R''}} (with different constants of proportionality that vary with {{math|''n''}}). We write {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'') {{=}} ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'') {{=}} ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} for the surface area of the {{math|''n''}}-sphere, both of radius {{math|''R''}}, where {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(1)}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(1)}} are the values for the unit-radius case.&lt;div&gt;

Given the radius {{math|''R''}}, the enclosed volume and the surface area of the {{math|''n''}}-sphere reach a maximum and then decrease towards zero as the dimension {{math|''n''}} increases. In particular, the volume {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} enclosed by the {{math|(''n'' – 1)}}-sphere of constant radius {{math|''R''}} embedded in {{math|''n''}} dimensions reaches a maximum at the dimension {{math|''n''}} satisfying {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;R''}} and {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}} where {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is given in the sidebar to the right; if the last (weak) inequality holds with equality, then the same maximum also occurs at {{math|''n'' + 1}}. Specifically, for unit radius the largest enclosed volume is that enclosed by a 4-dimensional sphere bounding a 5-dimensional ball.

Similarly, the surface area {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'')}} of the {{mvar|''n''}}-sphere of constant radius {{mvar|''R''}} embedded in {{mvar|''n'' + 1}} dimensions reaches a maximum for dimension {{math|''n''}} that satisfies {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;R''}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}} where {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is given in the sidebar to the right; if the last (weak) inequality holds with equality, then the same maximum also occurs at {{math|''n'' + 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loskot|first1=Pavel|title=On Monotonicity of the Hypersphere Volume and Area|journal=Journal of Geometry|date=November 2007|volume=87|issue=1-2|pages=96–98|doi=10.1007/s00022-007-1891-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00022-007-1891-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, for unit radius the largest surface area occurs for the 6-dimensional sphere bounding a 7-dimensional ball.

===Examples===
The 0-ball consists of a single point. The 0-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] is the number of points in a set. So, 
:&lt;math&gt;V_0=1.&lt;/math&gt;
The unit 1-ball is the interval {{math|[−1,1]}} of length 2. So,
:&lt;math&gt;V_1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
The 0-sphere consists of its two end-points, {{math|{−1,1&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. So,
:&lt;math&gt;S_0 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
The unit 1-sphere is the unit circle  in the Euclidean plane, and this has circumference (1-dimensional measure)
:&lt;math&gt;S_1 = 2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
The region enclosed by the unit 1-sphere is the 2-ball, or unit disc, and this has area (2-dimensional measure)
:&lt;math&gt;V_2 = \pi.&lt;/math&gt;
Analogously, in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the surface area (2-dimensional measure) of the unit 2-sphere is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_2 = 4\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
and the volume enclosed is the volume (3-dimensional measure) of the unit 3-ball, given by
:&lt;math&gt;V_3 = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi.&lt;/math&gt;

===Recurrences===
The ''surface area'', or properly the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume, of the {{math|''n''}}-sphere at the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is related to the volume of the ball by the differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n}R^{n}=\frac{dV_{n+1}R^{n+1}}{dR}={(n+1)V_{n+1}R^{n}}&lt;/math&gt;,
or, equivalently, representing the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball as a union of concentric {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere ''[[spherical shell|shells]]'',
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+1} = \int_0^1 S_{n}r^{n}\,dr&lt;/math&gt;
So, 
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+1} = \frac{S_n}{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can also represent the unit {{math|(''n'' + 2)}}-sphere as a union of [[Torus|tori]], each the product of a circle (1-sphere) with an {{math|''n''}}-sphere. Let {{math|''r'' {{=}} cos ''θ''}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}, so that {{math|''R'' {{=}} sin ''θ''}} and {{math|''dR'' {{=}} cos ''θ'' ''dθ''}}. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_{n+2} &amp;= \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}S_1 r . S_n R^n\, d\theta \\[6pt]
&amp;=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}S_1 \cdot S_n R^n\cos\theta\,d\theta\\[6pt]
&amp;=\int_0^1 S_1 \cdot S_n R^n \,dR\\[6pt]
&amp;= S_1 \int_0^1 S_n R^n \,dR\\[6pt]
&amp;= 2\pi V_{n+1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2π ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the equation
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n+1} =  2\pi V_{n}&lt;/math&gt;
holds for all {{math|''n''}}.

This completes our derivation of the recurrences:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_0&amp;=1 &amp; V_{n+1}&amp;=\frac{S_n}{n+1} \\[6pt]
S_0&amp;=2 &amp; S_{n+1}&amp;=2\pi V_n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Closed forms===
Combining the recurrences, we see that
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+2}=2\pi \frac{V_n}{n+2}.&lt;/math&gt;
So it is simple to show by induction on ''k'' that,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_{2k} &amp;= \frac{\pi^k}{k!} \\[6pt]
V_{2k+1} &amp;= \frac{2\left(2\pi\right)^k}{(2k+1)!!} = \frac{2 k! \left(4\pi\right)^k}{(2k+1)!}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|!!}} denotes the [[Factorial#Double factorial|double factorial]], defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} by {{math|1=(2''k'' + 1)!! = 1 × 3 × 5 ... (2''k'' − 1) × (2''k'' + 1)}}.

In general, the volume, in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space, of the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V_n = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Γ''}} is the [[gamma function]], which satisfies {{math|''Γ''({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|π}}}}, {{math|''Γ''(1) {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|''Γ''(''x'' + 1) {{=}} ''xΓ''(''x'')}}.

By multiplying {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{math|''R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;}}, differentiating with respect to {{math|''R''}}, and then setting {{math|R {{=}} 1}}, we get the closed form

:&lt;math&gt;S_{n-1} = \frac{n\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1 \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Other relations===
The recurrences can be combined to give a "reverse-direction" recurrence relation for surface area, as depicted in the diagram:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{n-1} = \frac{n}{2 \pi} S_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:N SpheresVolumeAndSurfaceArea.png|thumb|580px|{{math|''n''}} refers to the dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, which is also the intrinsic dimension of the solid whose volume is listed here, but which is 1 more than the intrinsic dimension of the sphere whose surface area is listed here. The curved red arrows show the relationship between formulas for different {{math|''n''}}. The formula coefficient at each arrow's tip equals the formula coefficient at that arrow's tail times the factor in the arrowhead (where the {{math|''n''}} in the arrowhead refers to the {{math|''n''}} value that the arrowhead points to). If the direction of the bottom arrows were reversed, their arrowheads would say to multiply by {{math|{{sfrac|2π|''n'' − 2}}}}. Alternatively said, the surface area {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the sphere in {{math|''n'' + 2}} dimensions is exactly {{math|2π''R''}} times the volume {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} enclosed by the sphere in {{math|''n''}} dimensions.]]

Index-shifting {{math|''n''}} to {{math|''n'' − 2}} then yields the recurrence relations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_n &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{n} V_{n-2} \\[6pt]
S_{n-1} &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{n-2} S_{n-3}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2}}, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 2π}} and {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} π}}.

The recurrence relation for {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} can also be proved via [[integral|integration]] with 2-dimensional [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_n 
&amp; = \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} V_{n-2}\left(\sqrt{1-r^2}\right)^{n-2} \, r \, d\theta \, dr \\[6pt]
&amp; = \int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi} V_{n-2} \left(1-r^2\right)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}\, r \, d\theta \, dr \\[6pt]
&amp; = 2 \pi V_{n-2} \int_{0}^{1} \left(1-r^2\right)^{\frac{n}{2}-1}\, r \, dr \\[6pt]
&amp; = 2 \pi V_{n-2} \left[ -\frac{1}{n}\left(1-r^2\right)^\frac{n}{2} \right]^{r=1}_{r=0} \\[6pt]
&amp; = 2 \pi V_{n-2} \frac{1}{n} = \frac{2 \pi}{n} V_{n-2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Spherical coordinates==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Spherical coordinate system]] --&gt;

We may define a coordinate system in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space which is analogous to the [[Spherical coordinates|spherical coordinate system]] defined for 3-dimensional Euclidean space, in which the coordinates consist of a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}}, and {{math|''n'' − 1}} angular coordinates {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the angles {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;}} range over {{math|[0,π]}} radians (or over {{math|[0,180]}} degrees) and {{math|''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} ranges over {{math|[0,2π)}} radians (or over {{math|[0,360)}} degrees). If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the Cartesian coordinates, then we may compute {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from {{math|''r'', ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with: 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x_1 &amp;= r \cos(\phi_1) \\
x_2 &amp;= r \sin(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \\
x_3 &amp;= r \sin(\phi_1) \sin(\phi_2) \cos(\phi_3) \\
    &amp;\vdots\\
x_{n-1} &amp;= r \sin(\phi_1) \cdots \sin(\phi_{n-2}) \cos(\phi_{n-1}) \\
x_n &amp;= r \sin(\phi_1) \cdots \sin(\phi_{n-2}) \sin(\phi_{n-1}) .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Except in the special cases described below, the inverse transformation is unique:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
r      &amp;= \sqrt{{x_n}^2 + {x_{n-1}}^2 + \cdots + {x_2}^2 + {x_1}^2} \\[6pt]
\phi_1 &amp;= \arccot \frac{x_{1}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2+\cdots+{x_2}^2}} &amp;&amp;= \arccos \frac{x_{1}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2+\cdots+{x_1}^2}} \\[6pt]
\phi_2 &amp;= \arccot \frac{x_{2}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2+\cdots+{x_3}^2}} &amp;&amp;= \arccos \frac{x_{2}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2+\cdots+{x_2}^2}} \\[6pt]
       &amp;\vdots &amp;&amp;\vdots \\[6pt]
\phi_{n-2} &amp;= \arccot \frac{x_{n-2}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2}} &amp;&amp;= \arccos \frac{x_{n-2}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2+{x_{n-2}}^2}} \\[6pt]
\phi_{n-1} &amp;= 2\arccot \frac{x_{n-1}+\sqrt{x_n^2+x_{n-1}^2}}{x_n} &amp;&amp;= \begin{cases}
    \arccos \frac{x_{n-1}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2}} &amp; x_n\geq 0 \\[6pt]
     2\pi - \arccos \frac{x_{n-1}}{\sqrt{{x_n}^2+{x_{n-1}}^2}} &amp; x_n &lt; 0
\end{cases} \,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where if {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ 0}} for some {{math|''k''}} but all of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are zero then {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} when {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}, and {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} π}} (180 degrees) when {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 0}}.

There are some special cases where the inverse transform is not unique; {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for any {{math|''k''}} will be ambiguous whenever all of {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are zero; in this case {{math|''φ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} may be chosen to be zero.

===Spherical volume element===
Expressing the angular measures in radians, the [[volume element]] in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space will be found from the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} 
\cos(\phi_{1})                                       &amp;-r\sin(\phi_{1})                      &amp;0                                 &amp;0&amp;\cdots    &amp;0 \\
\sin(\phi_{1})\cos(\phi_{2})                       &amp;r\cos(\phi_{1})\cos(\phi_{2})       &amp;-r\sin(\phi_{1})\sin(\phi_{2})&amp;0&amp;\cdots   &amp;0 \\
\vdots                                                 &amp;        \vdots                          &amp; \vdots                           &amp;\ddots &amp;  &amp;\vdots\\
                                                       &amp;                                        &amp;                                  &amp; &amp;       &amp;0    \\
\sin(\phi_{1})\cdots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\cos(\phi_{n-1})&amp;   \cdots                                     &amp;\cdots                                  &amp; &amp;       &amp;-r\sin(\phi_{1})\cdots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\sin(\phi_{n-1})    \\
\sin(\phi_{1})\cdots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\sin(\phi_{n-1})&amp; r\cos(\phi_{1})\cdots\sin(\phi_{n-1})&amp; \cdots                           &amp; &amp;      &amp;r\sin(\phi_{1})\cdots\sin(\phi_{n-2})\cos(\phi_{n-1})
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d^nV &amp; = 
\left|\det\frac{\partial (x_i)}{\partial\left(r,\phi_j\right)}\right|
dr\,d\phi_1 \, d\phi_2\cdots d\phi_{n-1} \\[6pt]
&amp; = r^{n-1}\sin^{n-2}(\phi_1)\sin^{n-3}(\phi_2)\cdots \sin(\phi_{n-2})\,
dr\,d\phi_1 \, d\phi_2\cdots d\phi_{n-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and the above equation for the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball can be recovered by integrating:

: &lt;math&gt;V_n=\int_{\phi_{n-1}=0}^{2\pi} \int_{\phi_{n-2}=0}^\pi \cdots \int_{\phi_1=0}^\pi\int_{r=0}^R d^nV.&lt;/math&gt;

The volume element of the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere, which generalizes the [[area element]] of the 2-sphere, is given by

: &lt;math&gt;d_{S^{n-1}}V = \sin^{n-2}(\phi_1)\sin^{n-3}(\phi_2)\cdots \sin(\phi_{n-2})\, d\phi_1 \, d\phi_2\cdots d\phi_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The natural choice of an orthogonal basis over the angular coordinates is a product of [[Gegenbauer polynomial|ultraspherical polynomials]],

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; {} \quad \int_0^\pi \sin^{n-j-1}\left(\phi_j\right) C_s^{\left(\frac{n-j-1}{2}\right)}(\cos \phi_j)C_{s'}^{\left(\frac{n-j-1}{2}\right)}\left(\cos\phi_j\right) \, d\phi_j \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac{\pi 2^{3-n+j}\Gamma(s+n-j-1)}{s!(2s+n-j-1)\Gamma^2\left(\frac{n-j-1}{2}\right)}\delta_{s,s'}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, 2,... ''n'' − 2}}, and the {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''isφ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the angle {{math|''j'' {{=}} ''n'' − 1}} in concordance with the [[spherical harmonics]].

== Stereographic projection ==

{{main|Stereographic projection}}

Just as a two-dimensional sphere embedded in three dimensions can be mapped onto a two-dimensional plane by a [[stereographic projection]], an {{math|''n''}}-sphere can be mapped onto an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional hyperplane by the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional version of the stereographic projection. For example, the point {{math|[''x'',''y'',''z'']}} on a two-dimensional sphere of radius 1 maps to the point {{math|[{{sfrac|''x''|1 − ''z''}},{{sfrac|''y''|1 − ''z''}}]}} on the {{math|''xy''}}-plane. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] \mapsto \left[\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the stereographic projection of an {{math|''n''}}-sphere {{math|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} of radius 1 will map to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional hyperplane {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} perpendicular to the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}-axis as
:&lt;math&gt;[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n] \mapsto \left[\frac{x_1}{1-x_n},\frac{x_2}{1-x_n},\ldots,\frac{x_{n-1}}{1-x_n}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

== Generating random points ==

=== Uniformly at random on the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere ===

[[File:2sphere-uniform.png|thumbnail|A set of uniformly distributed points on the surface of a unit 2-sphere generated using Marsaglia's algorithm.]]

To generate uniformly distributed random points on the unit {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-sphere (that is, the surface of the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball), {{harvtxt|Marsaglia|1972}} gives the following algorithm.

Generate an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional vector of [[normal distribution|normal deviates]] (it suffices to use {{math|N(0, 1)}}, although in fact the choice of the variance is arbitrary), {{math|'''x''' {{=}} (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}. Now calculate the "radius" of this point:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The vector {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''}}'''x'''}} is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball.

An alternative given by Marsaglia is to uniformly randomly select a point {{math|'''x''' {{=}} (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} in the unit [[hypercube|{{math|''n''}}-cube]] by sampling each {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} independently from the [[continuous uniform distribution|uniform distribution]] over {{math|(–1,1)}}, computing {{math|''r''}} as above, and rejecting the point and resampling if {{math|''r'' ≥ 1}} (i.e., if the point is not in the {{math|''n''}}-ball), and when a point in the ball is obtained scaling it up to the spherical surface by the factor {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''}}}}; then again {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''}}'''x'''}} is uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball.

=== Uniformly at random within the {{math|''n''}}-ball ===
With a point selected uniformly at random from the surface of the unit {{math|(''n'' - 1)}}-sphere (e.g., by using Marsaglia's algorithm), one needs only a radius to obtain a point uniformly at random from within the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball.  If {{math|''u''}} is a number generated uniformly at random from the interval {{math|[0, 1]}} and {{math|'''x'''}} is a point selected uniformly at random from the unit {{math|(''n'' - 1)}}-sphere, then {{math|''u''&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|1|''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt;'''x'''}} is uniformly distributed within the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball.

Alternatively, points may be sampled uniformly from within the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball by a reduction from the unit {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-sphere. In particular, if {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a point selected uniformly from the unit {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-sphere, then {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is uniformly distributed within the unit {{math|''n''}}-ball (i.e., by simply discarding two coordinates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|first1=Aaron R. | last1=Voelker | first2=Jan | last2=Gosmann | first3=Terrence C. | last3=Stewart | title=Efficiently sampling vectors and coordinates from the n-sphere and n-ball | year=2017 | publisher=Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience | url=http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/voelker2017.html | doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.15829.01767/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that if {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, most of the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball will be contained in the region very close to its surface, so a point selected from that volume will also probably be close to the surface.  This is one of the phenomena leading to the so-called [[curse of dimensionality]] that arises in some numerical and other applications.

==Specific spheres==

; 0-sphere : The pair of points {{math|{±''R''&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} with the discrete topology for some {{math|''R'' &gt; 0}}. The only sphere that is not [[path-connected]]. Has a natural Lie group structure; isomorphic to O(1). Parallelizable.
; [[1-sphere]] : Also known as the circle. Has a nontrivial fundamental group. Abelian Lie group structure [[U(1)]]; the [[circle group]]. Topologically equivalent to the [[real projective line]], '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Parallelizable. SO(2) = U(1).
; [[2-sphere]] : Also known as the sphere. Complex structure; see [[Riemann sphere]]. Equivalent to the [[complex projective line]], '''C'''P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. SO(3)/SO(2).
; [[3-sphere]] : Also known as the glome. Parallelizable, Principal U(1)-bundle [[Hopf fibration|over]] the 2-sphere, Lie group structure [[Sp(1)]], where also
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(1) \cong \mathrm{SO}(4)/\mathrm{SO}(3) \cong \mathrm{SU}(2) \cong \mathrm{Spin}(3)&lt;/math&gt;.
; 4-sphere : Equivalent to the [[quaternionic projective line]], '''H'''P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. SO(5)/SO(4).
; 5-sphere : Principal U(1)-bundle over '''C'''P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. SO(6)/SO(5) = SU(3)/SU(2).
; 6-sphere : Almost complex structure coming from the set of pure unit [[octonion]]s. SO(7)/SO(6) = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SU(3). {{See also|6-sphere coordinates}}
; 7-sphere : Topological [[quasigroup]] structure as the set of unit [[octonion]]s. Principal Sp(1)-bundle over ''S''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Parallelizable. SO(8)/SO(7) = SU(4)/SU(3) = Sp(2)/Sp(1) = Spin(7)/''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Spin(6)/SU(3). The 7-sphere is of particular interest since it was in this dimension that the first [[exotic sphere]]s were discovered.
; 8-sphere : Equivalent to the octonionic projective line '''O'''P&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
; 23-sphere : A highly dense [[sphere-packing]] is possible in 24-dimensional space, which is related to the unique qualities of the [[Leech lattice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">[[File:Dominating-set.svg|thumb|upright|The white vertex sets are maximal nonblockers]]
In [[graph theory]], a '''nonblocker''' is a subset of vertices in an [[undirected graph]], all of which are adjacent to vertices outside of the subset. Equivalently, a nonblocker is the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a [[dominating set]].{{r|dffpr}}

The computational problem of finding the largest nonblocker in a graph was formulated by {{harvtxt|Papadimitriou|Yannakakis|1991}}, who observed that it belongs to [[SNP (complexity)#MaxSNP|MaxSNP]].{{r|py}}
Although computing a dominating set is not [[fixed-parameter tractable]] under standard assumptions, the complementary problem of finding a nonblocker of a given size is fixed-parameter tractable.{{r|dffpr}}

In graphs with no [[isolated vertex|isolated vertices]], every maximal nonblocker (one to which no more vertices can be added) is itself a dominating set.{{r|o}}

==Kernelization==
One way to construct a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the nonblocker problem is to use [[kernelization]], an algorithmic design principle in which a polynomial-time algorithm is used to reduce a larger problem instance to an equivalent instance whose size is bounded by a function of the parameter.
For the nonblocker problem, an input to the problem consists of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and a parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and the goal is to determine whether &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has a nonblocker with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; or more vertices.{{r|dffpr}}

This problem has an easy kernelization that reduces it to an equivalent problem with at most &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; vertices. First, remove all isolated vertices from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, as they cannot be part of any nonblocker. Once this has been done, the remaining graph must have a nonblocker that includes at least half of its vertices; for instance, if one [[graph coloring|2-colors]] any [[spanning tree]] of the graph, each color class is a nonblocker and one of the two color classes includes at least half the vertices. Therefore, if the graph with isolated vertices removed still has &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; or more vertices, the problem can be solved immediately. Otherwise, the remaining graph is a kernel with at most &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt; vertices.{{r|dffpr}}

Dehne et al. improved this to a kernel of size at most &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{3}k+3&lt;/math&gt;. Their method involves merging pairs of neighbors of degree-one vertices until all such vertices have a single neighbor, and removing all but one of the degree-one vertices, leaving an equivalent instance
with only one degree-one vertex. Then, they show that (except for small values of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, which can be handled separately) this instance must either be smaller than the kernel size bound or contain a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-vertex blocker.{{r|dffpr}}

Once a small kernel has been obtained, an instance of the nonblocker problem may be solved in fixed-parameter tractable time by applying a [[brute-force search]] algorithm to the kernel. Applying faster (but still exponential) time bounds leads to a time bound for the nonblocker problem of the form &lt;math&gt;O(2.5154^k+n)&lt;/math&gt;. Even faster algorithms are possible for certain special classes of graphs.{{r|dffpr}}

In [[mathematics]], '''nonlinear modelling''' is empirical or semi-empirical [[mathematical model|modelling]] which takes at least some nonlinearities into account. Nonlinear modelling in practice therefore means modelling of phenomena in which independent variables affecting the system can show complex and synergetic nonlinear effects. Contrary to traditional modelling methods, such as [[linear regression]] and basic [[statistical]] methods, nonlinear modelling can be utilized efficiently in a vast number of situations where traditional modelling is impractical or impossible. The newer nonlinear modelling approaches include non-parametric methods, such as [[feedforward neural network]]s, [[kernel regression]], [[Spline (mathematics)|multivariate spline]]s, etc., which do not require a ''priori'' knowledge of the nonlinearities in the relations. Thus the nonlinear modelling can utilize production data or experimental results while taking into account complex nonlinear behaviours of modelled phenomena which are in most cases practically impossible to be modelled by means of traditional mathematical approaches, such as phenomenological modelling.

Contrary to phenomenological modelling, nonlinear modelling can be utilized in processes and systems where the theory is deficient or there is a lack of fundamental understanding on the root causes of most crucial factors on system.  Phenomenological modelling describes a system in terms of laws of nature. Nonlinear modelling can be utilized in situations where the phenomena are not well understood or expressed in mathematical terms. Thus nonlinear modelling can be an efficient way to model new and complex situations where relationships of different variables are not known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">[[Image:Coordinate with Origin.svg|frame|right|The origin of a Cartesian coordinate system]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''origin''' of a [[Euclidean space]] is a special [[Point (geometry)|point]], usually denoted by the letter ''O'', used as a fixed point of reference for the geometry of the surrounding space.

In physical problems, the choice of origin is often arbitrary, meaning any choice of origin will ultimately give the same answer. This allows one to pick an origin point that makes the mathematics as simple as possible, often by taking advantage of some kind of [[Symmetry (geometry)|geometric symmetry]].

==Cartesian coordinates==
In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the origin is the point where the [[Coordinate axis|axes]] of the system intersect.&lt;ref name="madsen"&gt;{{citation|title=Engineering Drawing and Design|series=Delmar drafting series|first=David A.|last=Madsen|publisher=Thompson Learning|year=2001|isbn=9780766816343|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N97zPAvogxoC&amp;pg=PA120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin divides each of these axes into two halves, a positive and a negative semiaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Learning higher mathematics|series=Springer series in Soviet mathematics|first=Lev S.|last=Pontrjagin|authorlink=Lev Pontryagin|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1984|isbn=9783540123514|page=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Points can then be located with reference to the origin by giving their numerical [[coordinates]]—that is, the positions of their projections along each axis, either in the positive or negative direction. The coordinates of the origin are always all zero, for example (0,0) in two dimensions and (0,0,0) in three.&lt;ref name="madsen"/&gt;

==Other coordinate systems==
In a [[polar coordinate system]], the origin may also be called the pole. It does not itself have well-defined polar coordinates, because the polar coordinates of a point include the angle made by the positive ''x''-axis and the ray from the origin to the point, and this ray is not well-defined for the origin itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|first=James Stuart|last=Tanton|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2005|isbn=9780816051243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MfKKMSuthacC&amp;pg=PA400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the origin may be chosen freely as any convenient point of reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Axiomatic Geometry|volume=21|series=Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts|first=John M.|last=Lee|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2013|isbn=9780821884782|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z0xAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the [[complex plane]] can be referred as the point where [[real axis]] and [[imaginary axis]] intersect each other. In other words, it is the complex number [[zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Classical Complex Analysis|series=Chapman &amp; Hall Pure and Applied Mathematics|first=Mario|last=Gonzalez|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=9780824784157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard "Dick" Allen Askey''' (born June 4, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]], known for his expertise in the area of [[special function]]s. The [[Askey–Wilson polynomials]] (introduced by him in 1984 together with [[James A. Wilson]]) are on the top level of the (q)-[[Askey scheme]], which  organizes orthogonal polynomials of (q-)hypergeometric type into a hierarchy. The [[Askey–Gasper inequality]] for [[Jacobi polynomials]] is essential in [[Louis de Branges de Bourcia|de Brange's]] famous proof of the [[Bieberbach conjecture]].

Askey earned a B.A. at [[Washington University]] in 1955, an M.A. at [[Harvard University]] in 1956, and a Ph.D. at [[Princeton University]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=8039}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working as an instructor at Washington University (1958–1961) and [[University of Chicago]] (1961–1963), he joined the faculty of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1963 as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics. He became a full professor at Wisconsin in 1968, and since 2003 has been a professor emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.wisc.edu/oldnews/2004/facdinner.htm Six Retirees Feted at Faculty and Staff Dinner, 2004 Van Vleck Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; Askey was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1969–1970, which academic year he spent at the ''[[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|Mathematisch Centrum]]'' in Amsterdam.
In 1983 he gave an [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/ ICM Plenary and Invited Speakers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052452/http://www.mathunion.org/db/ICM/Speakers/ |date=2012-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Warszawa.
He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999 he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Askey.html Askey biography]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 he became a fellow of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fellows.siam.org/index.php?sort=year&amp;value=2009 SIAM Fellows: Class of 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2012-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012 he received an honorary doctorate&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.siam.org/pipermail/siam-opsf/2013-January/000077.html Honorary doctorates for Andrews, Askey and Berndt]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[SASTRA University]] in [[Kumbakonam]], India.

Askey explained why [[hypergeometric function]]s appear so frequently in mathematical applications: "Riemann showed that the requirement that a differential equation have regular singular points at three given points and every other complex point is a regular point is so strong a restriction that the differential equation is the hypergeometric equation with the three singularities moved to the three given points. Differential equations with four or more singular points only infrequently have a solution which can be given explicitly as a series whose coefficients are known, or have an explicit integral representation. This partly explains why the classical hypergeometric function arises in many settings that seem to have nothing to do with each other. The differential equation they satisfy is the most general one of its kind that has solutions with many nice properties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Askey, R.|author2=Koornwinder, T.H.|author3=Schempp. W.

Askey is also very much involved with commenting and writing on mathematical education at American schools. A well-known article by him on this topic is ''Good Intentions are not Enough''.&lt;ref&gt;Askey, R. (2001).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26955">'''Second-order cybernetics''', also known as the cybernetics of [[cybernetics]], is the recursive application of cybernetics to itself.

(Ed.). (1995). Cybernetics of cybernetics: Or, the control of control and the communication of communication (2nd ed.). Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems. (Original work published: 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the "new cybernetics", the term preferred by [[Gordon Pask]], and is closely allied to [[radical constructivism]], which was developed around the same time by [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, R.

It has been characterised as cybernetics where "circularity is taken seriously".&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, R. (2004). The purpose of second-order cybernetics.

==Cybernetics of cybernetics and the new cybernetics==
Second-order Cybernetics can be abbreviated as '''C2''' or '''SOC''', and is sometimes referred to as the '''cybernetics of cybernetics''', the '''new cybernetics''' or '''second cybernetics'''.&lt;ref name = "GP 01"&gt;Gordon Pask. Introduction Different Kinds of Cybernetics. In Gertrudis van de Vijver (Ed) New Perspectives on Cybernetics. Springer Netherlands. pp 11-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used interchangeably, but can also stress different aspects:
* Most commonly, '''second-order cybernetics''' refers to the practice of cybernetics where cyberneticians understand themselves to be part of the system they study. This is strongly associated with Heinz von Foerster.
* More specifically, and especially where phrased as the '''cybernetics of cybernetics''', it refers to the recursive application of cybernetics to itself and the practice of cybernetics in accordance with its own ideas. This is closely associated with Mead's 1967 address to the American Society for Cybernetics (published 1968)&lt;ref name = "MM 01"&gt;Mead, Margaret. "The Cybernetics of Cybernetics." In Purposive Systems, edited by Heinz von Foerster, John D. White, Larry J. Peterson and John K. Russell, 1-11. New York, NY: Spartan Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; and von Foerster's "Cybernetics of Cybernetics"&lt;ref name = "HVF 01"&gt;von Foerster, Heinz, ed. Cybernetics of Cybernetics: Or, the Control of Control and the Communication of Communication. 2nd ed. Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; book, developed as a course option at the Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL), where Cybernetic texts were analysed according to the principles they put forward.
* Most generally, and especially where referred to as the '''new cybernetics''', it signifies substantial developments in direction and scope taken by the field following the above critiques.&lt;ref name = "GP 01"/&gt;

==Initial development==
Second-order cybernetics took shape during the late 1960s and mid 1970s. The 1967 keynote address to the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC), Margaret Mead, who had been a participant at the Macy Conferences, is a defining moment in its development. She characterised "cybernetics as a way of looking at things and as a language for expressing what one sees".&lt;ref name = "MM 01"/&gt; This paper was social&lt;ref name = "KK 01"&gt;Krippendorff, K. (2008). Cybernetics’s Reflexive Turns. Cybernetics and Human Knowing, 15 (3-4), 173-184. Retrieved from http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/136&lt;/ref&gt; and ecological&lt;ref name = "RG 01"/&gt; in focus, with Mead calling on cyberneticians to assume responsibility for how the social consequences of the language of cybernetics and the development of cybernetic systems.&lt;ref name = "KK 01"/&gt;

Mead's paper concluded with a proposal directed at the ASC itself, that it organise itself in the light of the ideas with which it was concerned. That is, the practice of Cybernetics by the ASC should be subject to Cybernetic critique, an idea returned to specially by Ranulph Glanville in his time as president of the society.&lt;ref name = "RG 02"&gt;Glanville, Ranulph. "Introduction: A Conference Doing the Cybernetics of Cybernetics." Kybernetes 40, no. 7/8 (2011): 952-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Ranulph, ed. Trojan Horses: A Rattle Bag from the 'Cybernetics: Art, Design, Mathematic – a Meta-Disciplinary Conversation' Post-Conference Workshop. Vienna: Edition echoraum, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a title that perhaps emphasised his concerns more than Mead's.&lt;ref name = "RG 01"/&gt; Von Foerster promoted Second-order Cybernetics energetically, developing it as a means of renewal for Cybernetics generally and as what has been called an "unfinished revolution" in science.&lt;ref name = "BCL"&gt;Müller, Albert, and Karl H.

The initial development of second-order cybernetics was consolidated by the mid 1970s in a series of significant developments and publications:
* The 1974 publication of the "Cybernetics of Cybernetics" book, edited by Von Foerster.&lt;ref name="HVF 01"/&gt; This was developed as a course option at the BCL and involved the examination of various texts from Cybernetics according to the principals they proposed. Here von Foerster defined the Cybernetics of Cybernetics as "the control of control and the communication of communication" and differentiated first order cybernetics as "the cybernetics of observed systems" and second order cybernetics as "the cybernetics of observing systems".&lt;ref name = "HVF 01"/&gt;

==Relationship to "first order" cybernetics==
[[Heinz von Foerster]] attributes the origin of second-order cybernetics to the attempts of cyberneticians to construct a model of the mind:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... a brain is required to write a theory of a brain. From this follows that a theory of the brain, that has any aspirations for completeness, has to account for the writing of this theory. And even more fascinating, the writer of this theory has to account for her or himself. Translated into the domain of cybernetics; the cybernetician, by entering his own domain, has to account for his or her own activity. Cybernetics then becomes cybernetics of cybernetics, or ''second-order cybernetics''.&lt;ref&gt;Von Foerster 2003, p.289.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many cyberneticians draw a sharp distinction between first and second order cybernetics, others stress the continuity between the two, and the implicit second order qualities of earlier cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Kline R. R. (2017) The past and the future of second-order cybernetics. In: Riegler A., Müller K. H. &amp; Umpleby S. A. (eds.) New horizons for second-order cybernetics. World Scientific, Singapore: 333–337.

A. (2016). Second-Order Cybernetics as a Fundamental Revolution in Science. Constructivist Foundations 11 (3):455-465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "BS 01"&gt;Sweeting, B. (2016).

[[File:SOCyberntics.png|right|300px|thumb]]
The [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]] contrasted first and second-order cybernetics with this diagram in an interview in 1973.&lt;ref name="oikos"&gt;[http://www.oikos.org/forgod.htm Interview] with Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'', June 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to the [[Macy conferences]], it emphasises the requirement for a participant observer in the second order case:
: ''... essentially your ecosystem, your organism-plus-environment, is to be considered as a single circuit.''&lt;ref name="oikos"/&gt;

In 1992, Pask summarized the differences between the old and the new cybernetics as a shift in emphasis:.&lt;ref name = "AC 03"&gt;Alessio Cavallaro, Annemarie Jonson, Darren Tofts (2003), ''Prefiguring Cyberculture: An Intellectual History'', MIT Press, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, "Marrying the premodern to postmodern: computers and organism after World War II", in: M. Norton. Wise eds. ''Growing Explanations: Historical Perspectives on Recent Science'', p 192.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ... from information to coupling
* ... from the reproduction of "order-from-order" ([[Erwin Schrödinger|Schroedinger]] 1944) to the generation of "order-from-noise" ([[Heinz von Foerster|von Foerster]] 1960)
* ... from transmission of data to conversation
* ... from external to participant observation – an approach that could be assimilated to [[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Varela]]'s concept of [[autopoiesis]].

== Topics ==

=== In biology ===

Some biologists influenced by cybernetic concepts (Maturana and Varela, 1980; Varela, 1979; Atlan, 1979) realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organization mankind discovers in nature – organizations he has not himself invented. The possibility that this new cybernetics could also account for social forms of organization, remained an object of debate among theoreticians on self-organization in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Dupuy, "The autonomy of social reality: on the contribution of systems theory to the theory of society" in: Elias L. Khalil &amp; [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] eds., ''Evolution, Order and Complexity'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In political science ===
In [[political science]] in the 1980s unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political [[actor]]s and subgroups and the practical reflexive consciousness of the subject who produces and reproduces the structure of political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regard to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves.&lt;ref name = "PHJ 88"&gt;Peter Harries-Jones (1988), "The Self-Organizing Polity: An Epistemological Analysis of Political Life by Laurent Dobuzinskis" in: ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' (Revue canadienne de science politique), Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 431–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geyer and van der Zouwen in 1978 discuss a number of characteristics of the merging "new cybernetics". One characteristic of new cybernetics is that it views information as constructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides a new [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the "micro-macro gap". That is, it links the individual with the society. Geyer and van der Zouten also noted that a transition classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics involves a transition form classical problems to new problems. These shifts in the thinking involve, among others a change emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factors which guide the steering decisions. And new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other.&lt;ref name = "KB 94"&gt;[[Kenneth D. Bailey]] (1994), ''Sociology and the New Systems Theory: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis'', p.163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geyer &amp; J. van der Zouwen (1992) recognize four themes in both sociocybernetics and new cybernetics:&lt;ref name = "GZ 92"&gt;R.F. Geyer and G. v.d. Zouwen (1992), "Sociocybernetics", in: ''Cybernetics and Applied Systems'', C.V. Negoita ed. p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;
# An epistemological foundation for science as an observer-observer system. Feedback and feedforward loops are constructed not only between the observer, and the objects that are observed them and the observer. 
# The transition from classical, rather [[mechanistic]] first-order cybernetics to modern, second-order cybernetics, characterized by the differences summarized by [[Gordon Pask]].
# These problem shifts in cybernetics result from a thorough reconceptualization of many all too easily accepted and taken for granted concepts – which yield new notions of stability, temporality, independence, structure versus behaviour, and many other concepts.
# The actor-oriented systems approach, promulgated in 1978 made it possible to bridge the "micro-macro" gap in social science thinking.

=== Organizational cybernetics ===
[[Management cybernetics#Organizational cybernetics|Organizational cybernetics]] is distinguished from [[management cybernetics]]. Both use many of the same terms but interpret them according to another philosophy of systems thinking. Organizational cybernetics by contrast offers a significant break with the assumption of the hard approach. The full flowering of organizational cybernetics is represented by Beer's [[viable system model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. Jackson]] (1991), ''Systems Methodology for the Management Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational cybernetics studies organizational design, and the regulation and self-regulation of organizations from a [[systems theory]] perspective that also takes the social dimension into consideration. Researchers in economics, public administration and political science focus on the changes in institutions, organisation and mechanisms of social steering at various levels (sub-national, national, European, international) and in different sectors (including the private, semi-private and public sectors; the latter sector is emphasised).&lt;ref name="NSM"&gt;[http://www.ru.nl/imr/programmes/programmes/oc/ Organisational Cybernetics]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Nijmegen School of Management, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociocybernetics ===
The reformulation of [[sociocybernetics]] as an "actor-oriented, observer-dependent, self-steering, time-variant" paradigm of human systems, was most clearly articulated by Geyer and van der Zouwen in 1978 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Langman, "The family: a 'sociocybernetic' approach to theory and policy", in: R. Felix Geyer &amp; J. van der Zouwen Eds. (1986), ''Sociocybernetic Paradoxes: Observation, Control and Evolution of Self-Steering Systems'', Sage Publications Ltd, pp 26–43.&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that sociocybernetics is more than just social cybernetics, which could be defined as the application of the general systems approach to social science. Social cybernetics is indeed more than such a one-way knowledge transfer. It implies a feed-back loop from the area of application – the social sciences – to the theory being applied, namely cybernetics; consequently, sociocybernetics can indeed be viewed as part of the new cybernetics: as a result of its application to social science problems, cybernetics, itself, has been changed and has moved from its originally rather mechanistic point of departure to become more actor-oriented and observer-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;R. Felix Geyer &amp; J. van der Zouwen Eds. (1986), ''Sociocybernetic Paradoxes: Observation, Control and Evolution of Self-Steering Systems, Sage Publications Ltd, 248 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, the new sociocybernetics is much more subjective and the sociological approach than the classical cybernetics approach with its emphasis on control. The new approach has a distinct emphasis on steering decisions; furthermore, it can be seen as constituting a reconceptualization of many concepts which are often routinely accepted without challenge.&lt;ref name = "KB 94"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Andrew Pickering]] has criticised second order cybernetics as a form of linguistic turn, moving away from the performative practices he finds valuable in earlier cybernetics.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Andrew. The Cybernetic Brain: Sketches of Another Future.  Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pickering's comments seem to apply specifically to where second order cybernetics has emphasised epistemology and language, for instance in the work of von Foerster, as he approvingly references the work of figures such as Bateson and Pask and the idea of participant observers which fall within the scope of second order cybernetics more broadly considered.

'''Simulink''', developed by [[MathWorks]], is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain [[dynamical systems]]. Its primary interface is a [[visual modeling|graphical block diagramming tool]] and a customizable set of block [[library (computer science)|libraries]]. It offers tight integration with the rest of the [[MATLAB]] environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it.

== Add-on products ==
MathWorks and other third-party hardware and software products can be used with Simulink. For example, [[Stateflow]] extends Simulink with a design environment for developing [[state machines]] and [[Flowchart|flow charts]].

[[MathWorks]] claims that, coupled with another of their products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_3|title=Automatic Code Generation - Simulink Coder|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink can [[automatic code generation|automatically generate]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] for [[real-time computing|real-time]] implementation of systems. As the efficiency and flexibility of the code improves, this is becoming more widely adopted for production systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/pub-archive/1296h/1296%20(Denney).pdf A Software Safety Certification Plug-in for Automated Code Generators: Feasibility Study and Preliminary Design]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/10/general-motors-developed-twomode-hybrid-powertrain-with-mathworks-modelbased-design-cut-24-months-of.html|title=Green Car Congress: General Motors Developed Two-Mode Hybrid Powertrain With MathWorks Model-Based Design; Cut 24 Months Off Expected Dev Time|author=BioAge Media|work=greencarcongress.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being a tool for [[embedded system]] design work because of its flexibility and capacity for quick iteration{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

Simulink Real-Time (formerly known as xPC Target), together with x86-based real-time systems, is an environment for simulating and testing Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.  Another MathWorks product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_5|title=Code Generation - Embedded Coder - Simulink|work=mathworks.com|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supports specific embedded targets.  When used with other generic products,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/products/slhdlcoder?s_cid=wiki_simulink_6 HDL Coder]&lt;/ref&gt; Simulink and [[Stateflow]] can automatically generate [[logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

Simulink Verification and Validation enables systematic verification and validation of models through modeling style checking, [[requirements traceability]] and model coverage analysis. Simulink Design Verifier uses [[formal methods]] to identify design errors like [[integer overflow]], [[division by zero]] and dead logic, and generates test case scenarios for [[model checking]] within the Simulink environment.

[[SimEvents]] is used to add a library of graphical building blocks for modeling queuing systems to the Simulink environment, and to add an event-based simulation engine to the time-based simulation engine in Simulink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation | last=Cassandras| first=Christos | publisher= Springer US | date=2007-11-27 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g82w56/?v=editorial| accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore in Simulink any type of simulation can be done and the model can be simulated at any point in this environment.

Different type of blocks can be accessed using the Simulink library browser. And therefore the benefit could be taken out from this environment efficiently.

In [[geometry]], '''Soddy's hexlet''' is a chain of six [[sphere]]s (shown in grey in Figure 1), each of which is [[tangent]] to both of its neighbors and also to three mutually tangent given spheres.  In Figure 1, these three spheres are shown as a central sphere (red), and two spheres (not shown) above and below the plane the centers of the hexlet spheres lie on.  In addition, the hexlet spheres are tangent to a fourth sphere (blue in Figure 1), which is not tangent to the three others.

According to a [[theorem]] published by [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soddy|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is always possible to find a hexlet for any choice of mutually tangent spheres ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.  Indeed, there is an infinite family of hexlets related by rotation and scaling of the hexlet spheres (Figure 1); in this, Soddy's hexlet is the spherical analog of a [[Steiner chain]] of six circles.&lt;ref name="ogilvy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ogilvy|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with Steiner chains, the centers of the hexlet spheres lie in a single plane, on an ellipse.  Soddy's hexlet was also discovered independently in Japan, as shown by [[Sangaku]] tablets from 1822 in Kanagawa prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rothman|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Soddy's hexlet is a chain of six spheres, labeled ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, each of which is tangent to three given spheres, ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'', that are themselves mutually tangent at three distinct points.   (For consistency throughout the article, the hexlet spheres will always be depicted in grey, spheres ''A'' and ''B'' in green, and sphere ''C'' in blue.)  The hexlet spheres are also tangent to a fourth fixed sphere ''D'' (always shown in red) that is not tangent to the three others, ''A'', ''B'' and ''C''.

Each sphere of Soddy's hexlet is also tangent to its neighbors in the chain; for example, sphere ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is tangent to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  The chain is closed, meaning that every sphere in the chain has two tangent neighbors; in particular, the initial and final spheres, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, are tangent to one another.

==Annular hexlet==
[[Image:Annular Soddy hexlet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Figure 2: An annular hexlet.]]

The annular Soddy's hexlet is a special case (Figure 2), in which the three mutually tangent spheres consist of a single sphere of radius ''r'' (blue) sandwiched between two parallel planes (green) separated by a perpendicular distance 2''r''.  In this case, Soddy's hexlet consists of six spheres of radius ''r'' packed like ball bearings around the central sphere and likewise sandwiched.  The hexlet spheres are also tangent to a fourth sphere (red), which is not tangent to the other three.

The chain of six spheres can be rotated about the central sphere without affecting their tangencies, showing that there is an infinite family of solutions for this case.   As they are rotated, the spheres of the hexlet trace out a [[torus]] (a doughnut-shaped surface); in other words, a torus is the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of this family of hexlets.

==Solution by inversion==
The general problem of finding a hexlet for three given mutually tangent spheres ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' can be reduced to the annular case using [[Inversive geometry|inversion]].  This geometrical operation always transforms spheres into spheres or into planes, which may be regarded as spheres of infinite radius.  A sphere is transformed into a plane if and only if the sphere passes through the center of inversion.  An advantage of inversion is that it preserves tangency; if two spheres are tangent before the transformation, they remain so after.  Thus, if the inversion transformation is chosen judiciously, the problem can be reduced to a simpler case, such as the annular Soddy's hexlet.  Inversion is reversible; repeating an inversion in the same point returns the transformed objects to their original size and position.

Inversion in the point of tangency between spheres ''A'' and ''B'' transforms them into parallel planes, which may be denoted as ''a'' and ''b''.  Since sphere ''C'' is tangent to both ''A'' and ''B'' and does not pass through the center of inversion, ''C'' is transformed into another sphere ''c'' that is tangent to both planes; hence, ''c'' is sandwiched between the two planes ''a'' and ''b''.  This is the annular Soddy's hexlet (Figure 2).  Six spheres ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; may be packed around ''c'' and likewise sandwiched between the bounding planes ''a'' and ''b''.  Re-inversion restores the three original spheres, and transforms ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; into a hexlet for the original problem.  In general, these hexlet spheres ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; have different radii.

An infinite variety of hexlets may be generated by rotating the six balls ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;ndash;''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in their plane by an arbitrary angle before re-inverting them.  The envelope produced by such rotations is the [[torus]] that surrounds the sphere ''c'' and is sandwiched between the two planes ''a'' and ''b''; thus, the torus has an inner radius ''r'' and outer radius 3''r''.  After the re-inversion, this torus becomes a [[Dupin cyclide]] (Figure 3).

[[Image:Cyclide.png|thumb|left|Figure 3: A Dupin cyclide, through which the hexlet spheres rotate, always touching. The cyclide is tangent to an inner sphere, an outer sphere and two spheres above and below the "hole" in the "doughnut".]]

==Dupin cyclide==
The [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of Soddy's hexlets is a [[Dupin cyclide]], an inversion of the [[torus]]. Thus Soddy's construction shows that a cyclide of Dupin is the envelope of a 1-parameter family of spheres in two different ways, and each sphere in either family is tangent to two spheres in same family and three spheres in the other family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coxeter|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was probably known to [[Charles Dupin]], who discovered the cyclides that bear his name in his 1803 dissertation under [[Gaspard Monge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Steiner chains==
[[Image:Steiner chain animation opt.gif|right|thumb|150px|Figure 4: Steiner chain of six circles corresponding to a Soddy's hexlet.]]

The intersection of the hexlet with the plane of its spherical centers produces a [[Steiner chain]] of six circles.

==Parabolic and hyperbolic hexlets==
It is assumed that spheres A and B are the same size.

In any [[ellipse|elliptic]] hexlet, such as the one shown at the top of the article, there are two tangent planes to the hexlet. In order for an elliptic hexlet to exist, the radius of C must be less than one quarter that of A. If C's radius is one quarter of A's, each sphere will become a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] in the journey. The inverted image shows a normal elliptic hexlet, though, and in the [[parabola|parabolic]] hexlet, the point where a sphere turns into a plane is precisely when its inverted image passes through the centre of inversion. In such a hexlet there is only one tangent plane to the hexlet. The line of the centres of a parabolic hexlet is a parabola.

If C is even larger than that, a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] hexlet is formed, and now there are no tangent planes at all. Label the spheres ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; thus cannot go very far until it becomes a plane (where its inverted image passes through the centre of inversion) and then reverses its concavity (where its inverted image surrounds the centre of inversion). Now the line of the centres is a hyperbola.

The limiting case is when A, B and C are all the same size. The hexlet now becomes straight. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is small as it passes through the hole between A, B and C, and grows till it becomes a plane tangent to them. The centre of inversion is now also with a point of tangency with the image of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, so it is also a plane tangent to A, B and C. As ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; proceeds, its concavity is reversed and now it surrounds all the other spheres, tangent to A, B, C, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pushes upwards and grows to become a tangent plane and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; shrinks. ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then obtains ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'s former position as a tangent plane. It then reverses concavity again and passes through the hole again, beginning another round trip. Now the line of centres is a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] hyperbola, where it has collapsed into two straight lines.&lt;ref name="ogilvy"/&gt;

==Sangaku tablets==
[[Image:Sangaku of Soddy's hexlet in Samukawa Shrine.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Replica of [[Sangaku]] at Hōtoku museum in [[Samukawa Shrine]].]]
The Japanese mathematicians analysed the packing problems in which circles and polygons, balls and polyhedrons come into contact and often found the relevant theorems independently before their discovery by Western mathematicians. The [[Sangaku]] about hexlet was made by Irisawa Shintarō Hiroatsu in the school of Uchida Itsumi and dedicated to [[Samukawa Shrine]] in May 1822. The original sangaku has been lost and recorded in the Uchida's book of ''Kokinsankagami'' on 1832. The replica of the sangaku was made from the record and dedicated to Hōtoku museum in Samukawa Shrine on August, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Wasan'' (''Wasan no Jiten'' in Japanese), p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

The sangaku by Irisawa consists of three problems and the third problem relates to Soddy's hexlet: "the diameter of the outer circumscribing sphere is 30 [[cun (unit)|sun]]. The diameters of the nucleus balls are 10 sun and 6 sun each. The diameter of one of the balls in the chain of balls is 5 sun. Then I asked for the diameters of the remaining balls. The answer is 15 sun, 10 sun, 3.75 sun, 2.5 sun and 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8/11 sun."&lt;ref&gt;''Sangaku Collection in Kanagawa prefecture'' (''Kanagawa-ken Sangaku-syû'' in Japanese), pp. 21–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By his answer, the method to calculate the diameters of the balls is written down and can consider it the following formulas to be given in the modern scale. If the ratio of the diameter of the outside ball to the nucleus balls are ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and if the ratio of the diameter to the chain balls are ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. I want to represent c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''c''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; by  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If
:&lt;math&gt;K=\sqrt{3\left( a_1 a_2+a_2 c_1+c_1 a_1- \left( \frac{a_1+a_2+c_1+1}{2} \right)^2 \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
then,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_2&amp;=(a_1+a_2+c_1-1)/2-K \\
c_3&amp;=(3a_1+3a_2-c_1-3)/2-K \\
c_4&amp;=2a_1+2a_2-c_1-2 \\
c_5&amp;=(3a_1+3a_2-c_1-3)/2+K \\
c_6&amp;=(a_1+a_2+c_1-1)/2+K.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.
Then ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. If  ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are the diameters of six balls, then we get the formula:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r_1}+\frac{1}{r_4}=\frac{1}{r_2}+\frac{1}{r_5}=\frac{1}{r_3}+\frac{1}{r_6}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4148">[[File:Volerra function.svg|thumb|400px|right|The first three steps in the construction of Volterra's function.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''Volterra's function''', named for [[Vito Volterra]], is a real-valued function ''V'' defined on the [[real line]] '''R''' with the following curious combination of properties:

* ''V'' is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] everywhere
* The derivative ''V'' &amp;prime; is [[bounded function|bounded]] everywhere
* The derivative is not [[Riemann integration|Riemann-integrable]].

==Definition and construction==
The function is defined by making use of the [[Smith–Volterra–Cantor set]] and "copies" of the function defined by &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 \sin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The construction of ''V'' begins by determining the largest value of ''x'' in the interval [0, 1/8] for which ''f'' &amp;prime;(''x'') = 0.  Once this value (say ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is determined, extend the function to the right with a constant value of ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) up to and including the point 1/8.  Once this is done, a mirror image of the function can be created starting at the point 1/4 and extending downward towards 0.  This function will be defined to be 0 outside of the interval [0, 1/4].  We then translate this function to the interval [3/8, 5/8] so that the resulting function, which we call ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is nonzero only on the middle interval of the complement of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set.  To construct ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f'' &amp;prime; is then considered on the smaller interval [0,1/32], truncated at the last place the derivative is zero, extended, and mirrored the same way as before, and two translated copies of the resulting function are added to ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to produce the function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Volterra's function then results by repeating this procedure for every interval removed in the construction of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set; in other words, the function ''V'' is the limit of the sequence of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

==Further properties==
Volterra's function is differentiable everywhere just as ''f'' (as defined above) is.  One can show that ''f'' &amp;prime;(''x'') = 2''x'' sin(1/''x'') - cos(1/''x'') for ''x'' ≠ 0, which means that in any neighborhood of zero, there are points where ''f'' &amp;prime; takes values 1 and &amp;minus;1. Thus there are points where ''V'' &amp;prime; takes values 1 and &amp;minus;1 in every neighborhood of each of the endpoints of intervals removed in the construction of the [[Smith–Volterra–Cantor set]] ''S''. In fact, ''V'' &amp;prime; is discontinuous at every point of ''S'', even though ''V'' itself is differentiable at every point of ''S'', with derivative 0. However, ''V'' &amp;prime; is continuous on each interval removed in the construction of ''S'', so the set of discontinuities of ''V'' &amp;prime; is equal to ''S''.

Since the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set ''S'' has positive [[Lebesgue measure]], this means that ''V'' &amp;prime; is discontinuous on a set of positive measure. By [[Riemann_integral#Integrability|Lebesgue's criterion for Riemann integrability]], ''V'' &amp;prime; is not integrable. If one were to repeat the construction of Volterra's function with the ordinary measure-0 Cantor set ''C'' in place of the "fat" (positive-measure) Cantor set ''S'', one would obtain a function with many similar properties, but the derivative would then be discontinuous on the measure-0 set ''C'' instead of the positive-measure set ''S'', and so the resulting function would have an integrable derivative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3592">'''Wijsman convergence''' is a variation of [[Hausdorff convergence]] suitable for work with [[unbounded set]]s.
Intuitively, Wijsman convergence is to convergence in the [[Hausdorff metric]] as [[pointwise convergence]] is to [[uniform convergence]].

==History==

The convergence was defined by [[Robert Wijsman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Wijsman
| first = Robert A.
| title = Convergence of sequences of convex sets, cones and functions. II
| journal = Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.

| issue = 1

| jstor = 1994611
}} {{MathSciNet|id=0196599}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same definition was used earlier by [[Zdeněk Frolík]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. Frolík, Concerning topological convergence of sets, Czechoskovak Math. J. 10 (1960), 168–180&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet earlier, Hausdorff in his book ''[[Grundzüge der Mengenlehre]]'' defined so called ''closed limits'';
for [[proper metric space]]s it is the same as Wijsman convergence.

==Definition==

Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') be a metric space and let Cl(''X'') denote the collection of all ''d''-closed subsets of ''X''. For a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' and a set ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Cl(''X''), set

:&lt;math&gt;d(x, A) = \inf_{a \in A} d(x, a).&lt;/math&gt;

A sequence (or net) of sets ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Cl(''X'') is said to be '''Wijsman convergent''' to ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Cl(''X'') if, for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'',

:&lt;math&gt;d(x, A_{i}) \to d(x, A).&lt;/math&gt;

Wijsman convergence induces a [[topology]] on Cl(''X''), known as the '''Wijsman topology'''.

==Properties==

* The Wijsman topology depends very strongly on the metric ''d''. Even if two metrics are uniformly equivalent, they may generate different Wijsman topologies.
* '''Beer's theorem''': if (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') is a [[complete space|complete]], [[separable space|separable]] metric space, then Cl(''X'') with the Wijsman topology is a [[Polish space]], i.e. it is separable and metrizable with a complete metric.
* Cl(''X'') with the Wijsman topology is always a [[Tychonoff space]]. Moreover, one has the '''Levi-Lechicki theorem''': (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') is separable [[if and only if]] Cl(''X'') is either metrizable, [[first-countable space|first-countable]] or [[second-countable space|second-countable]].
* If the pointwise convergence of Wijsman convergence is replaced by uniform convergence (uniformly in ''x''), then one obtains Hausdorff convergence, where the Hausdorff metric is given by

::&lt;math&gt;d_{\mathrm{H}} (A, B) = \sup_{x \in X} \big| d(x, A) - d(x, B) \big|.&lt;/math&gt;

: The Hausdorff and Wijsman topologies on Cl(''X'') coincide if and only if (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''d'') is a [[totally bounded space]].

In [[set theory]], '''Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory''', named after mathematicians [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]], is an [[axiomatic system]] that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a [[theory of sets]] free of paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]].  Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] (AC) included is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated '''ZFC''', where C stands for "choice",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciesielski|1997}}.  "Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (abbreviated as ZFC where C stands for the axiom of Choice"&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ZF''' refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. 

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a [[hereditary set|hereditary]] [[well-founded]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]], so that all [[Entity|entities]] in the [[universe of discourse]] are such sets. Thus the [[axiom]]s of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory refer only to [[pure set]]s and prevent its [[Model theory|model]]s from containing [[urelement]]s (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, [[proper class]]es (collections of [[mathematical object]]s defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a [[universal set]] (a set containing all sets) nor for [[unrestricted comprehension]], thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) is a commonly used [[conservative extension]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes.

There are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the [[axiom of pairing]] says that given any two sets ''a'' and ''b'' there is a new set {''a'', ''b''} containing exactly ''a'' and ''b''. Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the [[von Neumann universe]] (also known as the cumulative hierarchy).

The [[metamathematics]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logical independence]] of the axiom of choice from the remaining ZFC axioms (see [[Axiom of choice#Independence]]) and of the [[continuum hypothesis]] from ZFC.The [[consistency]] of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself.

Formally, ZFC is a [[Many-sorted first-order logic|one-sorted theory]] in [[first-order logic]]. The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] has equality and a single primitive [[binary relation]], [[set membership]], which is usually denoted ∈. The formula ''a'' ∈ ''b'' means that the set ''a'' is a member of the set ''b'' (which is also read, "''a'' is an element of ''b''" or "''a'' is in ''b''").

== History ==

The modern study of [[set theory]] was initiated by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] in the 1870s. However, the discovery of [[Paradoxes of set theory|paradoxes]] in [[naive set theory]], such as [[Russell's paradox]], led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes.

In 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. However, as first pointed out by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and [[cardinal number]]s whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; and the set {Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), &amp;weierp;(&amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)),...}, where Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any infinite set and &amp;weierp; is the power set operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebbinghaus|2007|page=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of Zermelo's axioms invoked a concept, that of a "definite" property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently proposed operationalizing a "definite" property as one that could be formulated as a [[first-order logic|first order theory]] whose [[atomic formula]]s were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the [[axiom schema of specification]] with the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. Appending this schema, as well as the [[axiom of regularity]] (first proposed by [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] in 1917), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by '''ZF'''. Adding to ZF either the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.

== Axioms ==

There are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this see {{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.  The following particular axiom set is from {{harvtxt|Kunen|1980}}. The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of [[first order logic]]. The associated English prose is only intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- **NOTE TO EDITORS** The symbolic axioms are taken from Kunen, and should not be changed without discussion on the talk page.  Making up a new set of axioms is original research. The English descriptions are new here and can be freely changed.  The choice of Kunen instead of Jech or some other author was arbitrary, and is open for discussion on the talk page. --&gt;

All formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only “for emphasis”).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kunen|1980|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the [[domain of discourse]] must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists &amp;mdash; usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, &amp;exist;x(x=x). Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some ''set'' exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called [[free logic]], in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity (below) asserts that an ''infinite'' set exists. This implies that ''a'' set exists and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much.

=== 1. Axiom of extensionality ===
{{Main| Axiom of extensionality}}

Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;

The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. If the background logic does not include equality "=", ''x''=''y'' may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1982|page=138}}, def.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z [z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y] \land \forall w [x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w].&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow \forall w (x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w)],&lt;/math&gt;

which says that if  ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2. Axiom of regularity (also called the Axiom of foundation) ===
{{Main|Axiom of regularity}}

Every non-empty set ''x'' contains a member ''y'' such that ''x'' and ''y'' are [[disjoint sets]].

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x [\exists a ( a \in x) \Rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x))].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|2001|page=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
or in modern notation:
&lt;math&gt;\forall x\,(x \neq \varnothing \rightarrow \exists y \in x\,(y \cap x = \varnothing))&lt;/math&gt; 

This implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] [[rank (set theory)|rank]].

=== 3. Axiom schema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or of restricted comprehension) ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of specification}}

Subsets are commonly constructed using [[set builder notation]]. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the [[Congruence modulo n|congruence modulo]] predicate &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 0 \pmod 2&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \equiv 0 \pmod 2\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the subset of a set ''z'' obeying a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;(''x'') with one free variable ''x'' may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in z : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an [[axiom schema|axiom ''schema'']] because there is one axiom for each &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among &lt;math&gt;x,z,w_1,\ldots,w_n&lt;/math&gt; (''y'' is ''not'' free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z \forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \exists y \forall x [x \in y \Leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi )].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the axiom schema of specification can only construct subsets, and does not allow the construction of sets of the more general form:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This restriction is necessary to avoid [[Russell's paradox]] and its variants that accompany naive set theory with [[unrestricted comprehension]].

In some other axiomatizations of ZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the [[axiom schema of replacement]] and the [[axiom of the empty set]].

On the other hand, the axiom of specification can be used to prove the existence of the [[empty set]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, once at least one set is known to exist (see above). One way to do this is to use a property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; which no set has. For example, if ''w'' is any existing set, the empty set can be constructed as

: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing = \{u \in w \mid (u \in u) \land \lnot (u \in u) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the [[axiom of the empty set]] is implied by the nine axioms presented here.  The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique (does not depend on ''w''). It is common to make a [[definitional extension]] that adds the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to the language of ZFC.

=== 4. Axiom of pairing ===
{{Main|Axiom of pairing}}

If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set which contains ''x'' and ''y'' as elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exists z (x \in z \land y \in z).&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification must be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiom of pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from the axiom schema of replacement, if we are given a set with at least two elements. The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the [[axiom of infinity]], or by the axiom schema of specification and  the [[axiom of the power set]] applied twice to any set.

=== 5. Axiom of union ===
{{Main|Axiom of union}}

The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The axiom of union states that for any set of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; containing every element that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall \mathcal{F} \,\exists A \, \forall Y\, \forall x [(x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F}) \Rightarrow x \in A].&lt;/math&gt;
Although this formula doesn't directly assert the existence of &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the above using the axiom schema of specification:
: &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}:=\{x\in A : \exists Y (x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F})\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== 6. Axiom schema of replacement ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of replacement}}

The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any [[Well-formed formula|formula]] in the language of ZFC whose [[free variable]]s are among &lt;math&gt;x,y,A,w_1,\dotsc,w_n&lt;/math&gt;, so that in particular &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall A\forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \bigl[\forall x ( x\in A \Rightarrow \exists! y\,\phi ) \Rightarrow \exists B \ \forall x \bigl(x\in A \Rightarrow \exists y (y\in B \land \phi)\bigr)\bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the relation &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; represents a definable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; represents its [[domain of a function|domain]], and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a set for every &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of some set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The form stated here, in which &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may be larger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the [[Axiom schema of replacement#Axiom schema of collection|axiom schema of collection]].

=== 7. Axiom of infinity ===
{{Main|Axiom of infinity}}

{| class="infobox"
! colspan=3 style="text-align:center" | First few von Neumann ordinals
|-
| 0
| = {{mset| }}
| = ∅
|-
| 1
| = {{mset| 0 }}

|}

Let &lt;math&gt;S(w)&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; w \cup \{w\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; is some set. (We can see that &lt;math&gt;\{w\}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid set by applying the Axiom of Pairing with &lt;math&gt; x=y=w &lt;/math&gt; so that the set &lt;math&gt;z &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{w\} &lt;/math&gt;). Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''.

: &lt;math&gt;\exists X \left [\varnothing \in X \land \forall y (y \in X \Rightarrow S(y)  \in X)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

More colloquially, there exists a set ''X'' having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set ''X'' satisfying the axiom of infinity is the [[von Neumann ordinal]] ω, which can also be thought of as the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== 8. Axiom of power set ===
{{Main|Axiom of power set}}

By definition a set ''z'' is a [[subset]] of a set ''x'' if and only if every element of ''z'' is also an element of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;(z \subseteq x) \Leftrightarrow ( \forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x)).&lt;/math&gt;

The Axiom of Power Set states that for any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' that  contains every subset of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \forall z [z \subseteq x \Rightarrow z \in y].&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification is then used to define the [[power set]] ''P(x)'' as the subset of such a ''y'' containing the subsets of ''x'' exactly:

: &lt;math&gt;P(x) = \{ z \in y: z \subseteq x  \}&lt;/math&gt;

Axioms '''1&amp;ndash;8''' define ZF. Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which are listed in {{harvtxt|Jech|2003}}. Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the [[axiom of empty set|empty set exists]]. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set ''x'' whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts ''x'' must contain.

The following axiom is added to turn ZF into ZFC:

=== 9. Well-ordering theorem ===
{{Main|Well-ordering theorem}}

For any set ''X'', there is a [[binary relation]] ''R'' which [[wellordering|well-orders]] ''X''.  This means ''R'' is a [[linear order]] on ''X'' such that every nonempty [[subset]] of ''X'' has a member which is minimal under ''R''.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall X \exists R ( R \;\mbox{well-orders}\; X).&lt;/math&gt;

Given axioms '''1–8''', there are many statements {{not a typo|provably}} equivalent to axiom '''9''', the best known of which is the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), which goes as follows. Let ''X'' be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function ''f'' from ''X'' to the union of the members of ''X'', called a "[[choice function]]", such that for all {{math|''Y'' ∈ ''X''}} one has {{math|''f''(''Y'') ∈ ''Y''}}. Since the existence of a choice function when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] is easily proved from axioms '''1–8''', AC only matters for certain [[infinite set]]s. AC is characterized as [[constructive mathematics|nonconstructive]] because it asserts the existence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be "constructed."  Much research{{vague|date=November 2018}} has sought to characterize the definability (or lack thereof) of certain sets{{example needed|date=November 2018}} whose existence AC asserts.

== Motivation via the cumulative hierarchy ==

One motivation for the ZFC axioms is [[the cumulative hierarchy]] of sets introduced by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|1977}}, section&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this viewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage for each [[ordinal number]]. At stage 0 there are no sets yet. At each following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elements have been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, and the set containing the empty set is added at stage 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinman|2005|page=467}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, is known as V. The sets in V can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to each set the first stage at which that set was added to V.

It is provable that a set is in V if and only if the set is [[pure set|pure]] and [[well-founded set|well-founded]]; and provable that V satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, if the class of ordinals has appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set ''x'' is added at stage α, which means that every element of ''x'' was added at a stage earlier than α. Then every subset of ''x'' is also added at stage α, because all elements of any subset of ''x'' were also added before stage α. This means that any subset of ''x'' which the axiom of separation can construct is added at stage α, and that the powerset of ''x'' will be added at the next stage after α. For a complete argument that V satisfies ZFC see {{harvtxt|Shoenfield|1977}}.

The picture of the universe of sets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC and related axiomatic set theories such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (often called NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. The cumulative hierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as [[New Foundations]].

It is possible to change the definition of ''V'' so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsets of the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they are definable in a certain sense. This results in a more "narrow" hierarchy which gives the [[constructible universe]] ''L'', which also satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It is independent from the ZFC axioms whether ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''. Although the structure of ''L'' is more regular and well behaved than that of&amp;nbsp;''V'', few mathematicians argue that&amp;nbsp;''V'' =&amp;nbsp;''L'' should be added to ZFC as an additional "[[axiom of constructibility]]".

== Metamathematics ==

===Virtual classes===

As noted earlier, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly in ZF (and thus ZFC).
An alternative to proper classes while staying within ZF and ZFC is the ''virtual class'' notational construct introduced by {{harvtxt|Quine|1969}}, where the entire construct y &amp;isin; { x | Fx } is simply defined as Fy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Link|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a simple notation for classes that can contain sets but need not themselves be sets, while not committing to the ontology of classes (because the notation can be syntactically converted to one that only uses sets).  Quine's approach built on the earlier approach of {{harvtxt|Bernays|1958}}.  Virtual classes are also used in {{harvtxt|Levy|2002}}, {{harvtxt|Takeuti|1982}}, and in the [[Metamath]] implementation of ZFC.

===Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory===
The axiom schemata of replacement and separation each contain infinitely many instances. {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}} included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms. On the other hand, [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes [[class (set theory)|proper classes]] as well as sets; a set is any class that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent set theories in the sense that any [[theorem]] not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other.

===Consistency===
[[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret [[Robinson arithmetic]] can prove its own consistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in [[general set theory]], a small fragment of ZFC. Hence the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFC itself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC is identified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow from the existence of a weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]], which is unprovable in ZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harbors an unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC were inconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain &amp;mdash; ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of [[naive set theory]]: [[Russell's paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Cantor's paradox]].

{{harvtxt|Abian|LaMacchia|1978}} studied a [[subtheory]] of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using [[model theory|models]], they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are [[non-well-founded set theory|non-well-founded]] models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.

If consistent, ZFC cannot prove the existence of the [[inaccessible cardinal]]s that [[category theory]] requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmented with [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory|Tarski's axiom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarski|1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that axiom turns the axioms of [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom of choice|choice]] ('''7''' − '''9''' above) into theorems.

=== Independence ===

Many important statements are [[Logical independence|independent]] of ZFC (see [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC]]). The independence is usually proved by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], whereby it is shown that every countable transitive [[model theory|model]] of ZFC (sometimes augmented with [[large cardinal axiom]]s) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown to satisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcing automatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concrete statements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC can be proven to hold in particular [[inner model]]s, such as in the [[constructible universe]]. However, some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms.

Forcing proves that the following statements are independent of ZFC:

* [[Continuum hypothesis]]
* [[Diamondsuit|Diamond principle]]
* [[Suslin's problem|Suslin hypothesis]]
* [[Martin's axiom]] (which is not a ZFC axiom)
* [[Axiom of constructibility|Axiom of Constructibility (V=L)]] (which is also not a ZFC axiom).

Remarks:

* The consistency of V=L is provable by [[inner model]]s but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a model of ZFC + V=L.
* The Diamond Principle implies the Continuum Hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis.
* Martin's axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.
* The [[constructible universe]] satisfies the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]], the Diamond Principle, Martin's Axiom and the Kurepa Hypothesis.
* The failure of the [[Kurepa tree|Kurepa hypothesis]] is equiconsistent with the existence of a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].

A variation on the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] can also be used to demonstrate the consistency and unprovability of the [[axiom of choice]], i.e., that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF. The consistency of choice can be (relatively) easily verified by proving that the inner model L satisfies choice. (Thus every model of ZF contains a submodel of ZFC, so that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZFC).) Since forcing preserves choice, we cannot directly produce a model contradicting choice from a model satisfying choice. However, we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel, namely one satisfying ZF but not C.

Another method of proving independence results, one owing nothing to forcing, is based on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]]. This approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined, to prove the existence of a set model of ZFC, in which case Con(ZFC) is true. Since ZFC satisfies the conditions of Gödel's second theorem, the consistency of ZFC is unprovable in ZFC (provided that ZFC is, in fact, consistent). Hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in ZFC. This method can prove that the existence of [[large cardinals]] is not provable in ZFC, but cannot prove that assuming such cardinals, given ZFC, is free of contradiction.

===Proposed additions===
The project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the Continuum Hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as "Gödel's program".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feferman|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or "self-evident", which axioms are the most useful in various domains, and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility; some "[[multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]]" set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt. One school of thought leans on expanding the "iterative" concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms; another school advocates for a tidier, less cluttered universe, perhaps focused on a "core" inner model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolchover|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

: ''For criticism of set theory in general, see [[Set theory#Objections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics|Objections to set theory]]''

ZFC has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak, as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the [[universal set]].

Many mathematical theorems can be proven in much weaker systems than ZFC, such as [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[second-order arithmetic]] (as explored by the program of [[reverse mathematics]]). [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Solomon Feferman]] have both made this point. Some of "mainstream mathematics" (mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory) is beyond Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic, but still, all such mathematics can be carried out in ZC ([[Zermelo set theory]] with choice), another theory weaker than ZFC. Much of the power of ZFC, including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement, is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself.

On the other hand, among [[axiomatic set theories]], ZFC is comparatively weak. Unlike [[New Foundations]], ZFC does not admit the existence of a universal set. Hence the [[universe]] of sets under ZFC is not closed under the elementary operations of the [[algebra of sets]]. Unlike [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK), ZFC does not admit the existence of [[proper class]]es. A further comparative weakness of ZFC is that the [[axiom of choice]] included in ZFC is weaker than the [[axiom of global choice]] included in NBG and MK.

There are numerous [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|mathematical statements undecidable in ZFC]]. These include the [[continuum hypothesis]], the [[Whitehead problem]], and the [[Moore space (topology)|normal Moore space conjecture]]. Some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as [[Martin's axiom]], [[large cardinal axiom]]s to ZFC.  Some others are decided in ZF+AD where AD is the [[axiom of determinacy]], a strong supposition incompatible with choice.  One attraction of large cardinal axioms is that they enable many results from ZF+AD to be established in ZFC adjoined by some large cardinal axiom (see [[projective determinacy]]). The [[Mizar system]] and [[Metamath]] have adopted [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], an extension of ZFC, so that proofs involving [[Grothendieck universe]]s (encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry) can be formalized.
