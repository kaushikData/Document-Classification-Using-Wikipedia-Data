The '''Americas''' (also collectively called '''America'''; {{lang-fr|Amérique}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]/[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''América'') comprise the totality of the continents of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, 2010 by Wiley Publishing, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam Webster dictionary|year=2013|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/america|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a."

Retrieved January 14, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they make up most of the land in Earth's [[western hemisphere]] and comprise the [[New World]].

Along with their [[Lists of islands of the Americas|associated islands]], they cover 8% of [[Earth]]'s total surface area and 28.4% of its land area. The topography is dominated by the [[American Cordillera]], a long chain of mountains that runs the length of the west coast. The flatter eastern side of the Americas is dominated by large river basins, such as the [[Amazon river basin|Amazon]], [[St. Lawrence River]] / [[Great Lakes]] basin, [[Mississippi river basin|Mississippi]], and [[La Plata river basin|La Plata]]. Since the Americas extend {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} from north to south, the climate and ecology vary widely, from the arctic [[tundra]] of [[Northern Canada]], [[Greenland]], and [[Alaska]], to the [[tropical rain forest]]s in [[Central America]] and South America.

Humans first [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settled the Americas]] from [[Asia]] between 42,000 and 17,000 years ago. A second migration of [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene speakers]] followed later from Asia. The subsequent migration of the [[Inuit]] into the [[neoarctic]] around 3500 BCE completed what is generally regarded as the settlement by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

The first known European settlement in the Americas was by the [[Norsemen|Norse]] explorer [[Leif Ericson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml | title = Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher = BBC |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the colonization never became permanent and was later abandoned. The [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] from 1492 to 1502 resulted in permanent contact with European (and subsequently, other [[Old World]]) powers, which led to the [[Columbian exchange]]. Diseases introduced from [[Europe]] and [[West Africa]] [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|devastated the indigenous peoples]], and the European powers [[European colonization of the Americas|colonized the Americas]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780142002100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass [[European emigration|emigration from Europe]], including large numbers of [[indentured servant]]s (and [[Atlantic slave trade|importation of African slaves]]), largely replaced the indigenous peoples.

[[Decolonization of the Americas]] began with the [[American Revolution]] in the 1770s and largely ended with the [[Spanish-American War]] in the late 1890s. Currently, almost all of the population of the Americas resides in independent countries; however, the legacy of the colonization and settlement by Europeans is that the Americas share many common cultural traits, most notably [[Christianity]] and the use of [[Indo-European languages]]: primarily [[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish]], [[North American English|English]], [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese]], [[Canadian French|French]], and to a lesser extent [[Surinamese Dutch|Dutch]].

The Americas are home to over a billion inhabitants, two-thirds of which reside in the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], or [[Mexico]].  It is home to eight [[Megacity|megacities]] ([[Metropolitan area|metropolitan areas]] with ten million inhabitants or more): [[New York City metropolitan area|New York City]] (23.9 million), [[Mexico City metropolitan area|Mexico City]] (21.2 million), [[Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area|São Paulo]] (21.2 million), [[Los Angeles metropolitan area|Los Angeles]] (18.8 million), [[Buenos Aires metropolitan area|Buenos Aires]] (13.8 million), [[Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area|Rio de Janeiro]] (13.0 million), [[Metropolitan Area of Bogotá|Bogotá]] (10.4 million), and [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]] (10.1 million).

{{main|Naming of the Americas}}
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|America is named after Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america-turns-500_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Cartographer Put 'America' on the Map 500 years Ago |work=USA Today |location =Washington, D.C. |date=April 24, 2007 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The name America was first recorded in 1507. [[Christie's]] auction house says a two-dimensional globe created by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] was the earliest recorded use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro.com/ap/us_world/ap-exclusive-oldest-map-to-use-word-america-up-for/article_3ba3260c-d094-55de-add8-8673ca32c92e.html|title=Oldest map to use word 'America' up for sale|last=Lawless|first=Jill|work=[[News and Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 7, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also used (together with the related term ''Amerigen'') in the ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', apparently written by [[Matthias Ringmann]], in reference to South America.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hebert, "The Map That Named America: Library Acquires 1507 Waldseemüller Map of the World" ([https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0309/maps.html]), ''Information Bulletin'', Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; It was applied to both North and South America by [[Gerardus Mercator]] in 1538. America derives from ''Americus'', the [[Latinisation of names|Latin]] version of Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first name. The feminine form ''America'' accorded with the feminine names of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe|Europa]].&lt;ref name=Smiths&gt;Toby Lester, "Putting America on the Map", ''Smithsonian'', 40:9 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, North and South America are generally considered separate continents, and taken together are called ''America''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/america america – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]. Retrieved on January 27, 2008; "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/america dictionary.reference.com america]". Dictionary.com. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Accessed: January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Fee and Janice MacAlpine, ''Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage'' (2008) page 36 says "In Canada, ''American'' is used almost exclusively in reference to the United States and its citizens." Others, including ''The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary'', ''The Canadian Oxford Dictionary'', ''The Australian Oxford Dictionary'' and ''The Concise Oxford English Dictionary'' all specify both the Americas and the United States in their definition of "American".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxfordc"&gt;"America." ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' ({{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}). McArthur, Tom, ed., 1992. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33: "[16c: from the feminine of ''Americus'', the Latinized first name of the explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512). The name ''America'' first appeared on a map in 1507 by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, referring to the area now called Brazil]. Since the 16c, a name of the western hemisphere, often in the plural ''Americas'' and more or less synonymous with ''the New World''. Since the 18c, a name of the United States of America. The second sense is now primary in English:&amp;nbsp;... However, the term is open to uncertainties:&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; or ''the Americas'' in the plural. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally ''the continent of America'' in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular ''America'' in English commonly refers to the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name=oxfordc /&gt;

Historically, in the English-speaking world, the term America used to refer to a single continent until the 1950s (as in Van Loon's Geography of 1937): According to historians Kären Wigen and Martin W. Lewis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lewis-myth.html | title = The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography (Chapter 1) |publisher = University of California Press|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. [...] By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations.}}

This shift did not seem to happen in Romance-speaking countries (including [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], and the Romance-speaking countries of [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]]), where America is still considered a continent encompassing the [[North America]] and [[South America]] [[subcontinent]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/continents.htm | title = The Continents of the World |publisher = nationsonline.org|quote=Africa, the Americas, Antarctica, Asia, Australia together with Oceania, and Europe are considered to be Continents.|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://central-america.org/ | title = CENTRAL AMERICA |publisher = central-america.org|quote=Central America is not a continent but a subcontinent since it lies within the continent America.|accessdate=September 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six or Seven Continents on Earth|url=http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/qt/qzcontinents.htm|accessdate=December 18, 2016|language=English}} "In Europe and other parts of the world, many students are taught of six continents, where North and South America are combined to form a single continent of America.

The [[pre-Columbian era]] incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[Early Modern period]]. The term ''Pre-Columbian'' is used especially often in the context of the great [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations|indigenous civilizations of the Americas]], such as those of [[Mesoamerica]] (the [[Olmec]], the [[Toltec]], the [[Teotihuacano]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], the [[Aztec]], and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]) and the [[Andes]] ([[Tahuantinsuyu|Inca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Cañari]]s).

Many pre-Columbian [[civilization]]s established characteristics and hallmarks which included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and [[Complex society|complex societal hierarchies]]. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and are known only through [[archaeology|archeological]] investigations. Others were contemporary with this period, and are also known from historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the Maya, had their own written records. However, most Europeans of the time viewed such texts as pagan, and much was destroyed in Christian pyres. Only a few hidden documents remain today, leaving modern historians with glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C.

[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] leads expedition to the New World, 1492.]]

Although there had been previous [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|trans-oceanic contact]], large-scale European colonization of the Americas began with the first voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492. The first Spanish settlement in the Americas was [[La Isabela]] in northern [[Hispaniola]]. This town was abandoned shortly after in favor of [[Santo Domingo de Guzmán]], founded in 1496, the oldest American city of European foundation. This was the base from which the Spanish monarchy administered its new colonies and their expansion. On the continent, [[Panama City]] on the Pacific coast of Central America, founded on August 5, 1519, played an important role, being the base for the Spanish conquest of South America. The spread of new diseases brought by Europeans and Africans killed many of the inhabitants of North America and South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornton|first=Russell|year=1997|title=Aboriginal North American Population and Rates of Decline, c.a.

Dobyns}}&lt;/ref&gt; European immigrants were often part of state-sponsored attempts to found colonies in the Americas. Migration continued as people moved to the Americas fleeing [[religious persecution]] or seeking economic opportunities. Millions of individuals were forcibly transported to the Americas as [[slave]]s, prisoners or [[indentured servant]]s.

[[Decolonization of the Americas]] began with the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Haitian Revolution]] in the late 1700s. This was followed by numerous [[Latin American wars of independence]] in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the [[Dominican War of Independence|Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti]], it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the [[Dominican Restoration War]]. The last violent episode of decolonization was the [[Cuban War of Independence]] which became the [[Spanish–American War]], which resulted in the independence of [[Cuba]] in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over [[Puerto Rico]] from Spain to the United States.

Peaceful decolonization began with the purchase by the [[United States]] of [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana from France]] in 1803, [[Adams–Onís Treaty|Florida from Spain]] in 1819, of [[Alaska purchase|Alaska from Russia]] in 1867, and the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies|Danish West Indies from Denmark]] in 1916. [[Canada]] became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and ending with the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] similarly achieved partial independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but was re-absorbed into the United Kingdom in 1934. It was subsequently [[Newfoundland Act|confederated with Canada]] in 1949.

The remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after [[World War II]]. [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] became independent in 1962, and [[Guyana]] and [[Barbados]] both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the [[Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] all became independent of the United Kingdom, and [[Suriname]] became independent of the Netherlands. [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.

The largest mountain ranges are the [[Andes]] and [[Rocky Mountains]]. The [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Cascade Range]] reach similar altitudes as the [[Rocky Mountains]], but are significantly smaller. In North America, the greatest number of [[fourteener]]s are in the United States, and more specifically in the U.S. state of [[Colorado]]. The highest peaks of the Americas are located in the [[List of mountains in the Andes|Andes]], with [[Aconcagua]] of [[Argentina]] being the highest; in North America [[Denali]] (Mount McKinley) in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] is the tallest.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Americas Köppen Map.png|upright=1.1|right|thumb|Climate zones of the Americas in the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.]]
The climate of the Americas varies significantly from region to region. [[Tropical rainforest climate]] occurs in the latitudes of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], American [[cloud forest]]s, Florida and [[Darien Gap]]. In the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Andes]], dry and continental climates are observed. Often the higher altitudes of these mountains are snow-capped.

Southeastern North America is well known for its occurrence of [[tornadoes]] and [[hurricanes]], of which the vast majority of tornadoes occur in the United States' [[Tornado Alley]].&lt;ref name="Science News 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|title=Tornado Alley, USA|last=Perkins|first=Sid|date=May 11, 2002|publisher=[[Science News]]|pages=296–298|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp|archivedate=August 25, 2006|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often parts of the Caribbean are exposed to the violent effects of hurricanes. These weather systems are formed by the collision of dry, cool air from Canada and wet, warm air from the Atlantic.

=== Hydrology ===
With coastal mountains and interior plains, the Americas have several large [[river basin]]s that drain the continents. The largest river basin in North America is that of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], covering the second largest [[Drainage basin|watershed]] on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |title=Mississippi River |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715014306/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mississippi-Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the U.S., most of the [[Great Plains]], and large areas between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. This river is the [[List of rivers by length|fourth longest in the world]] and [[List of rivers by discharge|tenth most powerful in the world]].

In North America, to the east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean, such as the [[Hudson River]], [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]], and [[Savannah River]]. A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into [[Hudson Bay]]; the largest being the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]]. On the west coast of North America, the main rivers are the [[Colorado River]], [[Columbia River]], [[Yukon River]], [[Fraser River]], and [[Sacramento River]].

The Colorado River drains much of the [[Southern Rockies]] and parts of the Great [[Basin and Range Province]]. The river flows approximately {{convert|1450|mi|km|sp=us}} into the [[Gulf of California]],&lt;ref name=largest&gt;{{cite web |last= Kammerer |first= J.C. |title= Largest Rivers in the United States |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/ |publisher= United States Geological Survey |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which over time it has carved out natural phenomena such as the [[Grand Canyon]] and created phenomena such as the [[Salton Sea]]. The Columbia is a large river, {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long, in central western North America and is the most powerful river on the West Coast of the Americas. In the far northwest of North America, the Yukon drains much of the Alaskan peninsula and flows {{convert|1980|mi|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yukoninfo.com/yukonriver/ |title=Yukoninfo.com |publisher=Yukoninfo.com |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from parts of Yukon and the Northwest Territory to the Pacific. Draining to the Arctic Ocean of Canada, the [[Mackenzie River]] drains waters from the Arctic Great Lakes of Arctic Canada, as opposed to the Saint-Lawrence River that drains the Great Lakes of Southern Canada into the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie River is the largest in Canada and drains {{convert|1805200|km2|mi2|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110728 |title=Mackenzie River |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=September 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141110/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110728 |archivedate=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest river basin in South America is that of the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], which has the highest volume flow of any river on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.greatestplaces.org/notes/amazon.htm|title = Greatest Places: Notes: Amazonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second largest watershed of South America is that of the [[Paraná River]], which covers about 2.5 million km².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/greatrivers/samerica/|title=Great Rivers Partnership – Paraguay-Parana|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105102114/http://www.nature.org/wherewework/greatrivers/samerica/ |archivedate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
North America and South America began to develop a shared population of flora and fauna around 2.5 million years ago, when [[continental drift]] brought the two continents into contact via the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Initially, the exchange of biota was roughly equal, with North American genera migrating into South America in about the same proportions as South American genera migrated into North America. This exchange is known as the [[Great American Interchange]]. The exchange became lopsided after roughly a million years, with the total spread of South American genera into North America far more limited in scope than the spread on North American genera into South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ecogeography and the Great American Interchange | last = Webb | first = S. David | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 17 | number = 3 | year = 1991 | publisher = Paleontological Society | jstor=2400869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries and territories ==
{{See also|List of sovereign states and dependent territories in the Americas}}

There are 35 sovereign states in the Americas, as well as an [[Danish Realm|autonomous country]] of [[Denmark]], three [[overseas department]]s of [[France]], three [[Overseas collectivity|overseas collectivities]] of France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outre-mer.gouv.fr/?les-collectivites.html|title=Les Collectivités|publisher=[[Ministère des Outre-Mer]]|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one uninhabited territory of France, eight [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territories]] of the [[United Kingdom]], three [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent countries]] of the [[Netherlands]], three [[Public body (Netherlands)|public bodies]] of the Netherlands, two [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]] of the [[United States]], and one uninhabited territory of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm | title = Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings | date = September 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2012 | publisher = United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
{{Further|List of countries in the Americas by population}}
In 2015 the total population of the Americas was about 985 million people, divided as follows:&lt;ref name=poplistlink group=note /&gt;
* North America: 569 million (includes Central America and the [[Caribbean]])
* South America: 416 million

=== Largest urban centers ===
{{See also|Largest cities in the Americas|List of metropolitan areas in the Americas by population}}

There are three urban centers that each hold titles for being the largest population area based on the three main demographic concepts:&lt;ref name=wider&gt;{{cite web

* [[Urban area]]
:An urban area is characterized by higher population density and vast human features in comparison to areas surrounding it. Urban areas may be cities, towns or conurbations, but the term is not commonly extended to rural settlements such as villages and hamlets. Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization and do not include large swaths of rural land, as do metropolitan areas.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* [[Metropolitan area]]
:Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities ''plus intervening rural land'' that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In accordance with these definitions, the three largest population centers in the Americas are: [[Mexico City]], anchor to the largest metropolitan area in the Americas; New York City, anchor to the largest urban area in the Americas; and São Paulo, the largest city proper in the Americas. All three cities maintain [[Global city#Alpha|Alpha]] classification and large scale influence.

=== Ethnology ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The population of the Americas is made up of the descendants of four large [[ethnic group]]s and their combinations.
* The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], being [[Amerindian]]s, [[Inuit]], and [[Aleut people|Aleuts]].
* Those of European ancestry, mainly Spanish, British and Irish, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Germans|German]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]], Russians and [[Scandinavia]]ns.
* Those of [[Afro-American peoples of the Americas|African]] ancestry, mainly of West African descent.
* [[Asian people|Asians]], that is, those of [[Eastern Asia|Eastern]], [[South Asia|South]], and [[Southeast Asia]]n ancestry.
* [[Mestizo]]s ([[Metis people]] in Canada), those of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry.
* [[Mulatto]]es, people of mixed African and European ancestry.
* [[Zambo]]s (Spanish) or [[Cafuso]]s (Portuguese), those of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry.

The majority of the population live in [[Latin America]], named for its predominant cultures, rooted in [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]] (including the two dominant languages, Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], both [[Romance languages]]), more specifically in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] nations of [[Portugal]] and Spain (hence the use of the term [[Ibero-America]] as a synonym). Latin America is typically contrasted with [[Anglo-America]], where English, a [[Germanic language]], is prevalent, and which comprises Canada (with the exception of [[Canadian French|francophone Canada]] rooted in Latin Europe [France]—see [[Québec]] and [[Acadia]]) and the United States. Both countries are located in North America, with cultures deriving predominantly from [[Anglo-Saxon]] and other [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] roots.

=== Religion ===
{{further|Religion in Latin America|Religion in North America|Christianity in the Americas|Islam in the Americas}}
The most prevalent faiths in the Americas are as follows:
* Christianity (86 percent)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-exec/ | work=Pew | title=Global Christianity }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Roman Catholicism: Practiced by 69 percent&lt;ref name=pewlat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2014/11/13/religion-in-latin-america/|title=2014 Religion in Latin America |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Latin American population, 81 percent&lt;ref name=pewlat /&gt; in Mexico and 61 percent&lt;ref name=pewlat /&gt; in Brazil whose Roman Catholic population of 123 million is the greatest of any nation's; approximately 24 percent of the United States' population&lt;ref name="CIAWFB"&gt;{{cite web | title = United States | work = CIA World Factbook | publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] | date = November 16, 2010 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html | accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 39 percent of Canada's.&lt;ref name="religion2011d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130508/dq130508b-eng.htm?HPA|title=Religions in Canada—Census 2011|publisher=Statistics Canada/Statistique Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Protestantism: Practiced mostly in the United States, where half of the population are Protestant, Canada, with slightly more than a quarter of the population, and Greenland; there is a growing contingent of [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] movements in predominantly Catholic Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1348759.htm|title=The World Today – Catholics faced with rise in Protestantism|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=ABC|location=Australia|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]: Found mostly in the United States (1 percent) and Canada; this Christian group is growing faster than many other Christian groups in Canada and now represents roughly 3 percent of the Canadian population.&lt;ref name="religion2011d" /&gt;
** [[Non-denominational Christianity|Non-denominational Christians]] and other Christians (some 1,000 different Christian denominations and sects practiced in the Americas).

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Indigenous languages of the Americas|Languages of North America|Languages of South America}}
[[File:Languages of the American Continent.png|thumb|right|Languages spoken in the Americas]]

Various [[language]]s are spoken in the Americas. Some are of European origin, others are spoken by indigenous peoples or are the mixture of various idioms like the different creoles.

The most widely spoken language in the Americas is [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/american_languages.htm|title=Official Languages of the Americas and the Caribbean - Nations Online Project|first=klaus kästle -|last=nationsonline.org|website=www.nationsonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant language of [[Latin America]] is Spanish, though the most populous nation in Latin America, [[Brazil]], speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Small enclaves of [[French language|French]]-, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in [[French Guiana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] respectively. [[Haitian Creole]] is dominant in the nation of [[Haiti]], where French is also spoken. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]] are more prominent in Latin America than in [[Anglo-America]], with [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. [[Creole language]]s other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.

The dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in [[Canada]], where it is the predominant language in [[Quebec]] and an official language in [[New Brunswick]] along with English. It is also an important language in [[Louisiana]], and in parts of [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the [[Southwestern United States]], which formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], especially in [[Californio|California]] and [[New Mexico]], where [[New Mexican Spanish|a distinct variety of Spanish]] spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the [[United States]] because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.

The nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.

Most of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as [[Papiamento]], which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], various [[African languages]], and, more recently English. The [[lingua franca]] [[Portuñol]], a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2006|title=Too Close for Comfort?

Because of [[immigration]], there are many communities where other languages are spoken from all parts of the world, especially in the United States, Brazil, [[Argentina]], Canada, [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]] and Uruguay—very important destinations for immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi98/fronterasculturales/datos/cap-pop.html Juan Bialet Massé en su informe sobre "El estado de las clases obreras en el interior del país"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927103010/http://www.oni.escuelas.edu.ar/olimpi98/fronterasculturales/datos/cap-pop.html |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umng.edu.co/www/resources/idsocial.doc SOCIAL IDENTITY Marta Fierro Social Psychologist.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220125802/http://www.umng.edu.co/www/resources/idsocial.doc |date=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:xMNl1h24Z5oJ:www.eclac.org/publicaciones/xml/6/20606/lcg2230e_cap8.pdf+conosur+argentina+chile+y+uruguay+recibieron+inmigrantes+europeos&amp;hl=es&amp;gl=cl&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgPKhHPhWvASrcdlpdyAdXFt6Kh7N5j-HbzcmA8nSVHcnjm1oaGPUs1LqWeMWLJngvABPlFZm0Ho4ZnZzcuFldFPqnh_0NzjP8w6yt5n1Z5M1ff9y4bVv9pITvkAKRfF-VQFl0W&amp;sig=AHIEtbQeK17QYlHRJLx1ktw1G1JkKR2eHA Etnicidad y ciudadanía en América Latina.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish ===
In Spanish, ''América'' is a single continent composed of the [[subcontinent]]s of ''América del Sur'' and ''América del Norte'', the [[land bridge]] of ''América Central'', and the islands of the ''[[Antilles|Antillas]]''. ''Americano'' or ''americana'' in Spanish refers to a person from ''América'' in a similar way that ''europeo'' or ''europea'' refers to a person from ''Europa''. The terms ''sudamericano/a'', ''centroamericano/a'', ''antillano/a'' and ''norteamericano/a'' can be used to more specifically refer to the location where a person may live.

Citizens of the United States of America are normally referred to by the term ''estadounidense'' (rough literal translation: "[[United Statesian]]") instead of ''americano'' or ''americana'' which is discouraged,&lt;ref name=norteamerica&gt;{{cite book | url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltGUIBusDPD?lema=Norteam%E9rica | title=Diccionario panhispánico de dudas:Norteamérica | publisher=Real Academia Española | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=estadosunidos /&gt; and the country's name itself is officially translated as ''Estados Unidos de América'' (United States of America), commonly abbreviated as ''Estados Unidos'' (EEUU).&lt;ref name=estadosunidos&gt;{{cite book | url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/srv/search?id=4EWtRO1VZD6v7sHSpo | title=Diccionario panhispánico de dudas: Estados Unidos | publisher=Real Academia Española | year=2005}} "debe evitarse el empleo de americano para referirse exclusivamente a los habitantes de los Estados Unidos" ("the use of the term ''americano'' referring exclusively to the United States inhabitants must be avoided")&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term ''norteamericano'' (North American) may refer to a citizen of the United States. This term is primarily used to refer to citizens of the United States, and less commonly to those of other North American countries.&lt;ref name=norteamerica /&gt;

=== Portuguese ===
In Portuguese, ''[[:pt:América|América]]''&lt;ref name=AmericaPortBE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/paises-america.htm |title=Países da América |publisher=Brasil Escola |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a single continent composed of ''América do Sul'' (South America), ''América Central'' (Central America) and ''América do Norte'' (North America).&lt;ref name=AmericaME&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mundoeducacao.com/geografia/o-continente-americano.htm |title=América |publisher=Mundo Educação |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be ambiguous, as ''América'' can be used to refer to the United States of America, but is avoided in print and formal environments.&lt;ref name=EstadosUnidosIt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/servicos-do-itamaraty/enderecos-de-consulados-estrangeiros-no-brasil/e/estados-unidos |title=Estados Unidos |publisher=Itamaraty |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222194657/http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/servicos-do-itamaraty/enderecos-de-consulados-estrangeiros-no-brasil/e/estados-unidos |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EstadosUnidosESPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.uol.com.br/time/estadosunidos|title=Estados Unidos|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=March 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330054909/http://espn.uol.com.br/time/estadosunidos|archivedate=March 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French ===
In French the word ''américain'' may be used for things relating to the Americas; however, similar to English, it is most often used for things relating to the United States. ''Panaméricain'' may be used as an adjective to refer to the Americas without ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gdt.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=17571942 | title = panaméricain | publisher = Office québéqois de la langue français | year = 1978 | accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; French speakers may use the noun ''Amérique'' to refer to the whole landmass as one continent, or two continents, ''Amérique du Nord'' and ''Amérique du Sud''. In French, ''Amérique'' is also used to refer to the United States, making the term ambiguous. Similar to English usage, ''les Amériques'' or ''des Amériques'' is used to refer unambiguously to the Americas.

In Dutch, the word ''Amerika'' mostly refers to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadas.nl/sites/default/files/proceedings/2001_03_vanMarle.pdf ''aadas.nl/'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/en/geheugen/pages/collectie/Atlantic+World/Nederlandse+emigratie+naar+Noord-Amerika+in+de+19e+eeuw ''geheugenvannederland.nl'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although the United States is equally often referred to as ''de Verenigde Staten'' ("the United States") or ''de VS'' ("the US"), ''Amerika'' relatively rarely refers to the Americas, but it is the only commonly used Dutch word for the Americas. This often leads to ambiguity; and to stress that something concerns the Americas as a whole, Dutch uses a combination, namely ''Noord- en Zuid-Amerika'' (North and South America).

Latin America is generally referred to as ''Latijns Amerika'' or ''Midden-Amerika'' for Central America.

The adjective ''Amerikaans'' is most often used for things or people relating to the United States. There are no alternative words to distinguish between things relating to the United States or to the Americas. Dutch uses the local alternative for things relating to elsewhere in the Americas, such as ''Argentijns'' for [[Argentine people|Argentine]], etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11802">[[Image:Beets produce-1.jpg|thumb|The red color of beets comes from betalain pigments.]]
'''Betalains''' are a class of red and yellow [[indole]]-derived [[Biological pigment|pigments]] found in plants of the [[Caryophyllales]], where they replace [[anthocyanin]] pigments. Betalains also occur in some higher order fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Strack D, Vogt T, Schliemann W |title= Recent advances in betalain research |journal= [[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]] |volume= 62 |issue= 3 |pages= 247–69 |date= February 2003 |pmid= 12620337 |doi= 10.1016/S0031-9422(02)00564-2 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031942202005642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are most often noticeable in the petals of flowers, but may color the fruits, leaves, stems, and roots of plants that contain them. They include pigments such as those found in [[beets]].

==Description==
[[Image:Gelber und roter Mangold.JPG|thumb|[[Swiss chard]], showing one plant expressing yellow betaxanthins and another expressing red betacyanins.]]
The name "betalain" comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] name of the common beet (''Beta vulgaris''), from which betalains were first extracted. The deep red color of beets, [[bougainvillea]], [[amaranth]], and many [[cactus|cacti]] results from the presence of betalain pigments.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1963"&gt;{{cite book |last= Robinson |first= Trevor | name-list-format = vanc |year=1963 |title=The Organic Constituents of Higher Plants |page=292 |location= Minneapolis |publisher= Burgess Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular shades of red to purple are distinctive and unlike that of anthocyanin pigments found in most plants.

There are two categories of betalains:&lt;ref name="Salisbury 1991"&gt;{{cite book |last= Salisbury |first= Frank B. | first2 = Cleon W. | last2 = Ross | name-list-format = vanc |year=1991 |title=Plant Physiology |edition=4th |pages=325–326 |location= Belmont, California |publisher= Wadsworth Publishing |isbn=0-534-15162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Betacyanins''' include the reddish to violet betalain pigments.  Among the betacyanins present in plants include [[betanin]], [[isobetanin]], [[probetanin]], and [[neobetanin]].
* '''Betaxanthins''' are those betalain pigments which appear yellow to orange.  Among the betaxanthins present in plants include [[vulgaxanthin]], [[miraxanthin]], [[portulaxanthin]], and [[indicaxanthin]].

[[Plant physiology|Plant physiologists]] are uncertain of the function that betalains serve in those plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kimler |first= L. M. | name-list-format = vanc |year=1975 |title=Betanin, the red beet pigment, as an antifungal agent |journal= Botanical Society of America, Abstracts of papers |volume= 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, betalains have been found in fluorescent flowers.&lt;ref name="pmid16163341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gandía-Herrero F, García-Carmona F, Escribano J | title = Botany: floral fluorescence effect | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7057 | pages = 334 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16163341 | doi = 10.1038/437334a | bibcode = 2005Natur.437..334G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
[[Image:Betanin.png|thumb|Chemical structure of [[betanin]].]]
It was once thought that betalains were related to anthocyanins, the reddish pigments found in most plants. Both betalains and anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments found in the [[vacuole]]s of plant cells. However, betalains are structurally and chemically unlike anthocyanins and the two have never been found in the same plant together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colorants |last=Francis |first=F.J. | name-list-format = vanc |year=1999 |publisher=Egan Press |isbn=1-891127-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stafford |first= Helen A. | name-list-format = vanc |title= Anthocyanins and betalains: evolution of the mutually exclusive pathways |journal= Plant Science |volume= 101 |issue= 2 |pages= 91–98 |year= 1994 |issn= 0168-9452 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168945294902445 |doi= 10.1016/0168-9452(94)90244-5 |accessdate= 20 May 2013 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, betalains contain [[nitrogen]] whereas anthocyanins do not.&lt;ref name="Robinson 1963" /&gt;

It is now known that betalains are [[aromatic]] [[indole]] derivatives synthesized from [[tyrosine]]. They are not related chemically to the anthocyanins and are not even [[flavonoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Raven |first= Peter H. | first2 = Ray F. | last2 = Evert | first3 = Susan E. | last3 = Eichhorn | name-list-format = vanc |year=2004 |title=Biology of Plants |edition=7th |page=465 |location= New York |publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company |isbn=0-7167-1007-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each betalain is a [[glycoside]], and consists of a sugar and a colored portion. Their synthesis is promoted by light.&lt;ref name="Salisbury 1991" /&gt;

The most heavily studied betalain is [[betanin]], also called beetroot red after the fact that it may be extracted from red beet roots. Betanin is a [[glucoside]], and hydrolyzes into the sugar [[glucose]] and [[betanidin]].&lt;ref name="Robinson 1963" /&gt; It is used as a food coloring agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonçalves LC, Di Genova BM, Dörr FA, Pinto E, Bastos EL |display-authors=3 | title = Effect of dielectric microwave heating on the color and antiradical capacity of betanin | journal = Journal of Food Engineering | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–55 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition of TFE ([[2,2,2-trifluoroethanol]]) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartoloni FH, Gonçalves LC, Rodrigues AC, Dörr FA, Pinto E, Bastos EL |display-authors=3 | year = 2013 | title = Photophysics and hydrolytic stability of betalains in aqueous trifluoroethanol | journal = Monatshefte für Chemie - Chemical Monthly | volume = 144 | pages = 567–571 | doi = 10.1007/s00706-012-0883-5 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a betanin-[[Europium|europium(III)]] complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in [[bacterial spores]], including ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' and ''[[B. cereus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonçalves LC, Da Silva SM, DeRose PC, Ando RA, Bastos EL |display-authors=3 | title = Beetroot-pigment-derived colorimetric sensor for detection of calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = e73701 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24019934 | pmc = 3760816 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0073701 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...873701G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important betacyanins are [[amaranthine (pigment)|amaranthine]] and [[isoamaranthine]], isolated from species of ''[[Amaranthus]]''.

Among the flowering plant [[Order (biology)|order]] Caryophyllales, most members produce betalains and lack anthocyanins. Of all the [[Family (biology)|families]] in the Caryophyllales, only the Caryophyllaceae (carnation family) and [[Molluginaceae]] produce anthocyanins instead of betalains.&lt;ref name="Cronquist 1981" /&gt; The limited distribution of betalains among plants is a [[synapomorphy]] for the Caryophyllales, though their production has been lost in two families.

Betanin is commercially used as a natural [[food dye]]. It can cause [[beeturia]] (red urine) and red feces in some people who are unable to break it down. The interest of the food industry in betalains has grown since they were identified by ''[[in vitro]]'' methods as [[antioxidant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Escribano J, Pedreño MA, García-Carmona F, Muñoz R | year = 1998 | title = Characterization of the antiradical activity of betalains from ''Beta vulgaris'' L. roots | journal = Phytochem.

[[File:Continental models-Australia.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Animated, colour-coded map showing the various continents and regions. [[Boundaries between the continents of Earth|Depending on the convention and model]], some continents may be consolidated or subdivided: for example, [[Eurasia]] is most often subdivided into [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] (red shades), while [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] are sometimes recognised as [[Americas|one American continent]] (green shades).]]

A '''continent''' is one of several very large [[Land#Land mass|landmasses]] of the [[world]]. Generally identified by [[convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area to smallest, they are: [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Antarctica]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|archivedate=2009-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629180448/http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/}} "Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Asia and Europe are considered a single continent, Eurasia."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geology|Geologically]], the continents largely correspond to areas of [[continental crust]] that are found on the [[plate tectonics|continental plates]]. However, some areas of continental crust are [[submerged continent|regions covered with water]] not usually included in the list of continents.  [[Zealandia]] is one such area (see [[#Submerged continents|submerged continents]] below).

Islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the [[Pacific Ocean]] are grouped together with the [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] to form a geopolitical region called ''[[Oceania]]''.

== Definitions and application ==
[[File:Dymaxion map unfolded-no-ocean.png|thumb|right|A [[Dymaxion map]] shows land masses with minimal shape distortion.]]

By convention, "continents are understood to be large, continuous, discrete masses of land, ideally separated by expanses of water."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=21}}  Several of the seven conventionally recognized continents are not discrete landmasses separated completely by water. The criterion "large" leads to arbitrary classification: [[Greenland]], with a surface area of {{convert|2166086|sqkm}} is considered the world's largest island, while Australia, at {{convert|7617930|sqkm}} is deemed the smallest continent.

[[Earth]]'s major landmasses all have coasts on a single, continuous [[World Ocean]], which is divided into a number of principal [[ocean]]ic components by the continents and various geographic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]".

=== Extent ===
The most restricted meaning of ''continent'' is that of a continuous&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]] ; "continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2006) ''The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. Oxford University Press; "continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2005) ''The [[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. (Ed.) [[Erin McKean]]. Oxford University Press; "continent [2, n] 4 a" (1996) ''[[Webster's Dictionary#WebsThird New International|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]''. [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]] ; "continent" (2007) ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved 14 January 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; area of land or mainland, with the coastline and any land boundaries forming the edge of the continent. In this sense the term ''[[continental Europe]]'' (sometimes referred to in Britain as "the Continent") is used to refer to mainland Europe, excluding [[island]]s such as [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Malta]] and [[Iceland]], and the term ''continent of Australia'' may refer to the [[Australia (continent)|mainland of Australia]], excluding [[Tasmania]] and [[New Guinea]]. Similarly, the ''[[contiguous United States|continental United States]]'' refers to the 48 contiguous states and the [[District of Columbia]] in central North America and may include [[Alaska]] in the northwest of the continent (the two being separated by [[Canada]]), while excluding [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Guam]] in the oceans.

From the perspective of [[geology]] or [[physical geography]], ''continent'' may be extended beyond the confines of continuous dry land to include the shallow, submerged adjacent area (the [[continental shelf]])&lt;ref&gt;"continent [2, n] 6" (1996) ''[[Webster's Dictionary#Webster's Third New International|Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged]]''. [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]]. "a large segment of the earth's outer shell including a [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] continent and the adjacent continental shelf"&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[island]]s on the shelf ([[Island#Continental islands|continental islands]]), as they are structurally part of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monkhouse |first=F. J. |author2=John Small |title=A Dictionary of the Natural Environment |year=1978 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |id= |pages= 67–68 |quote=structurally it includes shallowly submerged adjacent areas (continental shelf) and neighbouring islands }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this perspective, the edge of the continental shelf is the true edge of the continent, as shorelines vary with changes in sea level.&lt;ref name=Ollier&gt;[[Cliff Ollier|Ollier, Cliff D.]] (1996). Planet Earth. In Ian Douglas (Ed.), ''Companion Encyclopedia of Geography: The Environment and Humankind''. London: Routledge, p. 30. "Ocean waters extend onto continental [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] at continental shelves, and the true edges of the continents are the steeper continental slopes. The actual shorelines are rather accidental, depending on the height of sea-level on the sloping shelves."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the islands of Great Britain and Ireland are part of Europe, while Australia and the island of New Guinea together form a continent.

[[File:Island nations.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of [[island country|island countries]]: these states are often grouped geographically with a neighboring continental landmass.]]

As a [[social constructionism|cultural construct]], the concept of a continent may go beyond the continental shelf to include [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]] and continental fragments. In this way, Iceland is considered part of Europe and [[Madagascar]] part of Africa. Extrapolating the concept to its extreme, some geographers group the [[Australian Plate|Australian continental plate]] with other islands in the Pacific into one continent called [[Oceania]]. This divides the entire land surface of Earth into continents or quasi-continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |page=40 |ps=: "The joining of Australia with various Pacific islands to form the quasi continent of Oceania ... "}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation ===
{{Main|Boundaries between the continents of Earth}}
{{See also|List of transcontinental countries}}

The ideal criterion that each continent is a discrete landmass is commonly relaxed due to historical conventions. Of the seven most globally recognized continents, only Antarctica and Australia are completely separated from other continents by the ocean. Several continents are defined not as absolutely distinct bodies but as "''more or less'' discrete masses of land".{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=35}} Asia and Africa are joined by the [[Isthmus of Suez]], and North and South America by the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In both cases, there is no complete separation of these landmasses by water (disregarding the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Panama Canal]], which are both narrow and shallow, as well as being artificial). Both these [[isthmus]]es are very narrow compared to the bulk of the landmasses they unite.

North America and South America are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model. However, they may also be viewed as a single continent known as America or the [[Americas]]. This viewpoint was common in the United States until World War II, and remains prevalent in some Asian six-continent models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |loc=Chapter 1 |ps=: "While it might seem surprising to find North and South America still joined into a single continent in a book published in the United States in 1937, such a notion remained fairly common until World War II. [...] By the 1950s, however, virtually all American geographers had come to insist that the visually distinct landmasses of North and South America deserved separate designations."}}&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the more common vision in Latin American countries, Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Greece, where they are taught as a single continent.

The criterion of a discrete landmass is completely disregarded if the continuous landmass of Eurasia is classified as two separate continents: Europe and Asia. Physiographically, Europe and South Asia are peninsulas of the Eurasian landmass. However, Europe is widely considered a continent with its comparatively large land area of {{convert|10180000|sqkm}}, while South Asia, with less than half that area, is considered a subcontinent. The alternative view—in geology and geography—that Eurasia is a single continent results in a six-continent view of the world. Some view separation of Eurasia into Asia and Europe as a residue of [[Eurocentrism]]: "In physical, cultural and historical diversity, [[China]] and [[India]] are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. [...]."{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=? }} However, for historical and cultural reasons,{{which|date=May 2017}} the view of Europe as a separate continent continues in several categorizations.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

If continents are defined strictly as discrete landmasses, embracing all the contiguous land of a body, then Africa, Asia, and Europe form a single continent which may be referred to as [[Afro-Eurasia]]. This produces a four-continent model consisting of Afro-Eurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia.

When sea levels were lower during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, greater areas of continental shelf were exposed as dry land, forming [[land bridge]]s. At those times [[Australia (continent)|Australia–New Guinea]] was a single, continuous continent. Likewise, the Americas and Afro-Eurasia were joined by the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]]. Other islands such as Great Britain were joined to the mainlands of their continents. At that time there were just three discrete continents: Afro-Eurasia-America, Antarctica, and Australia-New Guinea.

== Other divisions ==

=== Supercontinents ===
Aside from the conventionally known continents, the scope and meaning of the term ''continent'' varies. [[Supercontinent]]s, largely in evidence earlier in the geological record, are landmasses that comprise more than one [[craton]] or continental core. These have included [[Laurasia]], [[Gondwana]], [[Vaalbara]], [[Kenorland]], [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]], [[Rodinia]], and [[Pangaea]].

=== Subcontinents ===
Certain parts of continents are recognized as subcontinents, especially the large peninsulas separated from the main continental landmass by geographical features. The most notable examples are the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{citation |last=Baldwin |first=James A. |chapter=Continents |editor=R. W. McColl |title=Encyclopedia of World Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&amp;pg=PA215 |date=14 May 2014 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-7229-3 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Cone]] of South America and [[Alaska|Alaskan peninsula]] of North America are other examples.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"/&gt;

In many of these cases, the "subcontinents" concerned are on different [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] from the rest of the continent, providing a geological justification for the terminology.&lt;ref name="Molnar2015"&gt;{{citation|last=Molnar|first=Peter|title=Plate Tectonics: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FbuUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116|date=26 March 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104396-3}}

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greenland]], generally reckoned as the [[List of islands by area|world's largest island]] on the northeastern periphery of the [[North American Plate]], is sometimes referred to as a subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Nares Strait and the drift of Greenland: a conflict in plate tectonics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9prkteX0EdsC&amp;pg=PA32|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-87-635-1150-6|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FarmerCook2013"&gt;{{citation|last1=Farmer|first1=G.

=== Submerged continents ===
Some areas of [[continental crust]] are largely covered by the sea and may be considered [[submerged continent]]s. Notable examples are [[Zealandia]], emerging from the sea primarily in [[New Zealand]] and [[New Caledonia]], and the almost completely submerged [[Kerguelen Plateau]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]].

=== Microcontinents ===
Some islands lie on sections of continental crust that have rifted and drifted apart from a main continental landmass. While not considered continents because of their relatively small size, they may be considered [[continental fragment|microcontinents]]. [[Madagascar]], the largest example, is usually considered an island of Africa but has been referred to as "the eighth continent" from a {{clarify|text=biological perspective|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hillstrom | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Collier Hillstrom | first2 =Laurie | title = Africa and the Middle East: a continental overview of environmental issues | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, CA | year = 2003 | page = 50 | isbn = 978-1-57607-688-0 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XxIk9zTm_e8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Botanical continents ===
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|"Botanical continents" defined by the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]].]]

"Continents" may be defined differently for specific purposes. The [[Biodiversity Information Standards]] organization has developed the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]], used in many international plant databases. This scheme divides the world into nine "botanical continents". Some match the traditional geographical continents, but some differ significantly. Thus the Americas are divided between Northern America (Mexico northwards) and Southern America (Central America and the Caribbean southwards) rather than between North America and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brummitt |first=R.K. |year=2001 |title=World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions: Edition 2 |publisher=International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases For Plant Sciences (TDWG) |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/tdwg/TDWG_geo2.pdf |accessdate = 2006-11-27 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Strabo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|The Ancient Greek geographer [[Strabo]] holding a globe showing ''Europa'' and ''Asia'']]

=== Early concepts of the Old World continents ===
The term "continent" translates Greek {{lang|grc|ἤπειρος}}, properly   "landmass, terra firma", the proper name of [[Epirus]] and later especially used of Asia (i.e. [[Asia Minor]]),&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (1940), s.v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=h)/peiros ἤπειρος]. The English noun was introduced in the mid-16th century, shortened from ''continent land'' (15th century), adapted from Latin ''terra continens'' "continuous landmass".&lt;/ref&gt;
The first distinction between continents was made by [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] mariners who gave the names Europe and Asia to the lands on either side of the waterways of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]] strait, the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]] strait and the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name=Toynbee&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee, Arnold J.]] (1954). ''A Study of History''. London: Oxford University Press, v. 8, pp. 711–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The names were first applied just to lands near the coast and only later extended to include the hinterlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the division was only carried through to the end of navigable waterways and "...&amp;nbsp;beyond that point the Hellenic geographers never succeeded in laying their finger on any inland feature in the physical landscape that could offer any convincing line for partitioning an indivisible Eurasia ..."&lt;ref name=Toynbee/&gt;

Ancient Greek thinkers subsequently debated whether Africa (then called ''Libya'') should be considered part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea was the center of the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south.{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997 |pp=21–22}} The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the [[Rioni River]] (known then as the ''Phasis'') in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and along the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]] (known then as the ''Tanais'') in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tozer |first=H. F. |title=A History of Ancient Geography |year=1897 |publisher=University Press |location=Cambridge |page= 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the [[Nile]] River. [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]]. Translated by George Rawlinson (2000). ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories of Herodotus of Halicarnassus]]'' [http://www.omphaloskepsis.com/ebooks/pdf/hrdts.pdf].

"I cannot conceive why three names ... should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one,"&lt;/ref&gt; a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.

[[Eratosthenes]], in the 3rd century BC, noted that some geographers divided the continents by rivers (the Nile and the Don), thus considering them "islands". Others divided the continents by [[isthmus]]es, calling the continents "peninsulas". These latter geographers set the border between Europe and Asia at the isthmus between the Black Sea and the [[Caspian Sea]], and the border between Asia and Africa at the isthmus between the [[Red Sea]] and the mouth of [[Lake Bardawil]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]].

[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[T and O map]] showing the three continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]]—Asia to Sem ([[Shem]]), Europe to Iafeth ([[Japheth]]), and Africa to Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]]).]]

Through the Roman period and the [[Middle Ages]], a few writers took the [[Isthmus of Suez]] as the boundary between Asia and Africa, but most writers continued to consider it the Nile or the western border of Egypt (Gibbon){{citation needed|date=October 2014}}. In the Middle Ages, the world was usually portrayed on [[T and O map]]s, with the T representing the waters dividing the three continents. By the middle of the 18th century, "the fashion of dividing Asia and Africa at the Nile, or at the Great Catabathmus [the boundary between Egypt and [[Libya]]] farther west, had even then scarcely passed away".&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Farley Brewer (1884). "Researches in the Cyrenaica". ''The American Journal of Philology'', 5 (1) p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European arrival in the Americas ===
[[Christopher Columbus]] sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] in 1492, sparking a period of European exploration of the [[Americas]]. But despite four voyages to the Americas, Columbus never believed he had reached a new continent—he always thought it was part of Asia.

In 1501, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Gonçalo Coelho]] attempted to sail around what they considered the southern end of the Asian mainland into the [[Indian Ocean]], passing through [[Fernando de Noronha]]. After reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed a long way further south along the coast of [[South America]], confirming that this was a land of continental proportions and that it also extended much further south than Asia was known to.&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year= 1961 | pages = 106–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; On return to Europe, an account of the voyage, called ''Mundus Novus'' ("New World"), was published under Vespucci's name in 1502 or 1503,&lt;ref name=formisano1&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio, pp. xx–xxi. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although it seems that it had additions or alterations by another writer.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel1&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). ''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 77–79. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of who penned the words, ''Mundus Novus'' credited Vespucci with saying, "I have discovered a continent in those southern regions that is inhabited by more numerous people and animals than our Europe, or Asia or Africa",&lt;ref name=formisano2&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio, p. 45. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first known explicit identification of part of the Americas as a continent like the other three.

Within a few years, the name "New World" began appearing as a name for South America on world maps, such as the Oliveriana (Pesaro) map of around 1504–1505. Maps of this time though, still showed [[North America]] connected to Asia and showed South America as a separate land.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel1/&gt;

[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|''Universalis Cosmographia'', Waldseemüller's 1507 world map—the first to show the Americas separate from Asia]]

In 1507 [[Martin Waldseemüller]] published a world map, ''[[Waldseemüller map|Universalis Cosmographia]]'', which was the first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small inset map above the main map explicitly showed for the first time the Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named "America" after Amerigo Vespucci's first name.&lt;ref name=Zerubavel2&gt;Zerubavel, Eviatar (2003). ''Terra Cognita: The Mental Discovery of America''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, pp. 80–82. {{ISBN|0-7658-0987-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the map, the word "America" was placed on part of South America.

=== The word ''continent'' ===
From the 16th century the English noun ''continent'' was derived from the term ''continent land'', meaning continuous or connected land&lt;ref name=oed&gt;"continent n." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; and translated from the Latin ''terra continens''.&lt;ref&gt;"continent&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; n." (2006) ''The [[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th edition revised. (Ed.) Catherine Soanes and Angus Stevenson. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The noun was used to mean "a connected or continuous tract of land" or [[mainland]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; It was not applied only to very large areas of land—in the 17th century, references were made to the ''continents'' (or mainlands) of [[Isle of Man]], [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]] and in 1745 to [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The word ''continent'' was used in translating Greek and Latin writings about the three "parts" of the world, although in the original languages no word of exactly the same meaning as ''continent'' was used.{{sfnp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=29}}

While ''continent'' was used on the one hand for relatively small areas of continuous land, on the other hand geographers again raised Herodotus's query about why a single large landmass should be divided into separate continents. In the mid-17th century, [[Peter Heylin]] wrote in his ''Cosmographie'' that "A Continent is a great quantity of Land, not separated by any Sea from the rest of the World, as the whole Continent of Europe, Asia, Africa." In 1727, [[Ephraim Chambers]] wrote in his ''Cyclopædia,'' "The world is ordinarily divided into two grand continents: the [[Old World|old]] and the [[New World|new]]." And in his 1752 atlas, [[Emanuel Bowen]] defined a continent as "a large space of dry land comprehending many countries all joined together, without any separation by water. Thus Europe, Asia, and Africa is one great continent, as America is another."&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Emanuel. (1752). ''A Complete Atlas, or Distinct View of the Known World''. London, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the old idea of Europe, Asia and Africa as "parts" of the world ultimately persisted with these being regarded as separate continents.

=== Beyond four continents ===
From the late 18th century, some geographers started to regard North America and South America as two parts of the world, making five parts in total. Overall though, the fourfold division prevailed well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lewis30&gt;{{harvp|Lewis &amp; Wigen, The Myth of Continents|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans discovered [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] in 1606, but for some time it was taken as part of Asia. By the late 18th century, some geographers considered it a continent in its own right, making it the sixth (or fifth for those still taking America as a single continent).&lt;ref name=lewis30/&gt; In 1813, [[Samuel Butler (schoolmaster)|Samuel Butler]] wrote of Australia as "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]], an immense island, which some geographers dignify with the appellation of another continent" and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was just as equivocal some decades later.&lt;ref&gt;"continent n. 5. a." (1989) ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd edition. [[Oxford University Press]]. "the great island of Australia is sometimes reckoned as another [continent]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctica]] was sighted in 1820 during the [[First Russian Antarctic Expedition]] and described as a continent by [[Charles Wilkes]] on the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1838, the last continent identified, although a great "Antarctic" (antipodean) landmass had been anticipated for millennia. An 1849 atlas labelled Antarctica as a continent but few atlases did so until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E.

From the mid-19th century, atlases published in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent. However, it was still not uncommon for American atlases to treat them as one continent up until World War II.&lt;ref name=lewis32&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E.

From the 1950s, most U.S. geographers divided the Americas into two continents.&lt;ref name=lewis32/&gt; With the addition of Antarctica, this made the seven-continent model. However, this division of the Americas never appealed to [[Latin America]]ns, who saw their region spanning an {{lang|es|América}} as a single landmass, and there the conception of six continents remains dominant, as it does in scattered other countries.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Some geographers regard Europe and Asia together as a single continent, dubbed ''[[Eurasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Some geographers list only six continents, combining Europe and Asia into Eurasia. In parts of the world, students learn that there are just five continents: Eurasia, Australia, Africa, Antarctica, and the Americas.''{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/faq/geography.html#continents|title=How many continents are there?|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the world is divided into six continents, with North America and South America considered separate continents.

{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
{{further|Continental crust|Plate tectonics}}
Geologists use the term ''continent'' in a different manner from geographers. In geology a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock]], largely of [[granite|granitic]] composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable [[Precambrian]] "shield", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a [[craton]]. The craton itself is an [[accretion (geology)|accretionary]] complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of [[subduction]], [[continental collision]] and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger minimally deformed [[sedimentary rock]] covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or [[river delta|deltaic]] [[sediment]]s. Beyond the margin, there is either a [[continental shelf]] and drop off to the [[basalt]]ic [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]] or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary does not have to be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in that so much of the continental areas are "high and dry"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences|last = Kominz|first = Michelle A.|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = San Diego|pages = 2609|chapter = Sea level variations over geologic time|url = http://www.curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter10/Ency_Oceans/Sea_Level_Variations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|The tectonic plates underlying the continents and oceans]]

Some argue that continents are accretionary crustal "rafts" that, unlike the denser basaltic crust of the ocean basins, are not subjected to destruction through the plate tectonic process of subduction. This accounts for the great age of the rocks comprising the continental cratons. By this definition, Eastern Europe, India and some other regions could be regarded as continental masses distinct from the rest of Eurasia because they have separate ancient shield areas (i.e. [[East European craton]] and [[Indian craton]]). Younger mobile belts (such as the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Himalayas]]) mark the boundaries between these regions and the rest of Eurasia.

There are many [[Continental fragment|microcontinents, or continental fragments]], that are built of continental crust but do not contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of [[Gondwana]] or other ancient cratonic continents: [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], which includes [[Geography of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]]; [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]]; the northern [[Mascarene Plateau]], which includes the [[Seychelles]]. Other islands, such as several in the [[Caribbean Sea]], are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, and there is no clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The [[Kerguelen Plateau]], for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a microcontinent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |title=UT Austin scientist plays major rule in study of underwater "micro-continent" |publisher=Utexas.edu |accessdate=2012-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103165732/http://www.utexas.edu/opa/news/99newsreleases/nr_199905/nr_continent990528.html |archivedate= 3 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/353277.stm |title=Sci/Tech &amp;#124; 'Lost continent' discovered |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-05-27 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas volcanic [[Geography of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]] are not. The [[British Isles]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Borneo]], and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] are margins of the [[Laurasia]]n continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.

[[Plate tectonics]] offers yet another way of defining continents. Today, Europe and most of Asia constitute the unified [[Eurasian Plate]], which is approximately coincident with the geographic Eurasian continent excluding India, Arabia, and far eastern Russia. India contains a central shield, and the geologically recent [[Himalaya]] mobile belt forms its northern margin. North America and South America are separate continents, the connecting [[isthmus]] being largely the result of [[volcano|volcanism]] from relatively recent subduction tectonics. North American continental rocks extend to Greenland (a portion of the [[Canadian Shield]]), and in terms of plate boundaries, the North American plate includes the easternmost portion of the Asian landmass. Geologists do not use these facts to suggest that eastern Asia is part of the North American continent, even though the plate boundary extends there; the word continent is usually used in its geographic sense and additional definitions ("continental rocks," "plate boundaries") are used as appropriate.

The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna formed during a period of 2.0–1.8 billion years ago and broke up about 1.5–1.3 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Guochun |last2=Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |date=November 2002 |title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |pages=125–162 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825202000739 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z.  |date=November 2004 |title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |pages=91–123 |accessdate=2013-01-08 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825204000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supercontinent [[Rodinia]] is thought to have formed about 1 billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago. The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called [[Pangaea]]; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).

A '''current meter''' is [[oceanography|oceanographic]] device for [[flow measurement]] by mechanical ([[rotor current meter]]), tilt ([[Tilt Current Meter]]), acoustical ([[ADCP]]) or electrical means.

==Different reference frames==
In [[physics]], one distinguishes different [[Frame of reference|reference frames]] depending on where the [[Observer (special relativity)|observer]] is located, this is the basics for
the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]] in [[fluid dynamics]]: The observer can be either in the [[Moving frame]] (as for a [[Lagrangian drifter]]) or in a [[Rest frame|resting frame]]. 
* '''[[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrangian]] current meters''' measure the displacement of an [[oceanography|oceanographic]] [[Drifter (floating device)|drifter]], an unmoored [[buoy]] or a non-anchored ship's actual position to the position predicted by [[dead reckoning]].
* '''[[Leonhard Euler|Eulerian]] current meters''' measure [[Ocean current|current]] passing a resting current meter.

==Measurement principles==

[[File:Buoy for deploying Roberts Radio Current Meter - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|A buoy deploying a Roberts radio current meter, c. 1960]]

=== Mechanical ===
Mechanical current meters are mostly based on counting the rotations of a propeller and are thus [[rotor current meter]]s. A mid-20th-century realization is the [[Ekman current meter]] which drops balls into a container to count the number of rotations. The Roberts radio current meter is a device mounted on a moored [[buoy]] and transmits its findings via radio to a servicing vessel. [[Savonius]] current meters rotate around a vertical axis in order to minimize error introduced by vertical motion.&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;C. Reid Nichols, Robert G. Williams, ''Encyclopedia of Marine Science'' (2008), Infobase Publishing,

===Acoustic ===
There are two basic types of acoustic current meters: Doppler and Travel Time. Both methods use a ceramic transducer to emit a sound into the water.

Doppler instruments are more common.  An instrument of this type is the [[Acoustic Doppler current profiler]] (ADCP), which measures the [[water current]] [[velocity field|velocities]] over a depth range using the [[Doppler effect]] of [[sound waves]] scattered back from particles within the water column. The ADCPs use the traveling time of the sound to determine the position of the moving particles. Single-point devices use again the Doppler shift, but ignoring the traveling times. Such a single-point Doppler Current Sensor (DCS) has a typical velocity range of 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;cm/s. The devices are usually equipped with additional optional sensors.

Travel time instruments determine water velocity by at least two acoustic signals, one up stream and one down stream.  By precisely measuring the time to travel from the emitter to the receiver, in both directions, the average water speed can be determined between the two points.  By using multiple paths, the water velocity can be determined in three dimensions.

Travel time meters are generally more accurate than Doppler meters, but only record the velocity between the transducers.  Doppler meters have the advantage that they can determine the water velocity at a considerable range, and in the case of an ADCP, at multiple ranges.

===Electromagnetic Induction===
This novel approach is for instance employed in the [[Florida Strait]] where [[electromagnetic induction]] in [[Submarine communications cable|submerged telephone cable]] is used to estimate the through-flow through the gateway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duchez|first=Aurélie|title=Monitoring the MOC at 26.5°N|url=http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/rapidmoc/|publisher=National Oceanography Centre, Southampton|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the complete setup can be seen as one huge current meter. The physics behind: Charged particles (the ions in seawater) are moving with the [[ocean current]]s in the magnetic field of the Earth which is perpendicular to the movement. Using [[Faraday's law of induction]] (the third of [[Maxwell's equations]]), it is possible to evaluate the variability of the averaged horizontal flow by measuring the induced electric currents.  The method has a minor vertical weighting effect due to small conductivity changes at different depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meinen|first=Christopher S.|title=Florida Current Transport - Project Background|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/floridacurrent/background.php|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Metereological Laboratory at NOAA|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tilt current meter diagram.png|thumbnail|Tilt Current Meter Operating Principle]]

=== Tilt ===
Tilt current meters operate under the drag-tilt principle and are designed to either float or sink depending on the type. A floating tilt current meter typically consists of a sub-surface buoyant housing that is anchored to the sea floor with a flexible line or tether. A sinking tilt current is similar, but the housing is designed such that the meter hangs from the attachment point. In either case, the housing tilts as a function of its shape, buoyancy (negative or positive) and the water velocity. Once the characteristics of a housing is known, the velocity can be determined by measuring the angle of the housing and direction of tilt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/epd/ocean/MainPage/tilt/shtcm.html&lt;/ref&gt; The housing contains a [[data logger]] that records the orientation (angle from vertical and compass bearing) of the Tilt Current Meter. Floating tilt current meters are typically deployed on the bottom with a lead or concrete anchor but may be deployed on lobster traps or other convenient anchors of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100914102112.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Sinking tilt current meters may be attached to an [[Mooring (oceanography)|oceanographic mooring]], floating dock or fish pen.  Tilt current meters have the advantage over other methods of measuring current in that they are generally relatively low-cost instruments and the design and operation is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7098135&lt;/ref&gt;  The low-cost of the instrument may allow researchers to use the meters in greater numbers (thereby increasing spatial density) and/or in locations where there is a risk of instrument loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6461979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depth correction==
Current meters are usually deployed within an [[Mooring (oceanography)|oceanographic mooring]] consisting of an anchor weight on the ground, a mooring line with the instrument(s) connected to it and a floating device to keep the mooring line more or less vertical. Like a kite in the wind, the actual shape of the mooring line will not be completely straight, but following a so-called (half-)[[catenary]].
Under the influence of [[water current]]s (and [[wind]] if the top buoy is above the sea surface) the shape of the mooring line can be determined and by this the actual depth of the instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewey|first=Richard K.|title=Mooring Design &amp; Dynamics - A Matlab Package for Designing and Testing Oceanographic Moorings And Towed Bodies|url=http://canuck.seos.uvic.ca/rkd/mooring/|publisher=Centre for Earth and Ocean Research, University of Victoria|accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewey|first=Richard K.|title=Mooring Design &amp; Dynamics—a Matlab® package for designing and analyzing oceanographic moorings|journal=Marine Models|date=1 December 1999|volume=1|issue=1-4|pages=103–157|doi=10.1016/S1369-9350(00)00002-X|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136993500000002X|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the currents are strong (above 0.1 [[Metre per second|m/s]]) and the mooring lines are long (more than 1 [[km]]), the instrument position may vary up to 50 [[m]].

'''Don L. Johnson''' (March 18, 1927 – January 20, 2006) was an outdoor writer from Wisconsin. His career included [[nature writing]], investigative reporting on environmental issues, and traditional outdoor writing about hunting, fishing, and related pursuits.

== Early life ==
Born March 18, 1927, Johnson grew up in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]], but spent much of his boyhood on family farms in [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]] and [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] counties, hunting and fishing.&lt;ref name=DunnCounty2006/&gt;  He graduated from [[Nathan Hale High School (Wisconsin)|Nathan Hale High School]] in West Allis, then served with the U.S. Navy in combat forces in the South Pacific during [[World War II]]. In 1949, he married Lorraine Senn.  The couple had a son, Douglas, and a daughter, Lynn.  He attended the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where he studied conservation and journalism and where he met [[Aldo Leopold]]. After graduating, he worked for several newspapers in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota.

In 1962, Johnson joined ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' as the newspaper's outdoor writer, a post he held until 1984. During those years, Johnson reported on hunting, fishing, and wildlife throughout Wisconsin. He also reported on conservation issues, including an exposé of mercury pollution in the [[Wisconsin River]] and a series on pesticide pollution.  In 1966, Johnson wrote a series of investigative reports about high concentrations of [[DDT]] in state waters. Despite threats of lawsuits and demands by chemical companies that he be fired, Johnson kept pursuing environmental stories. The series played a key role in making Wisconsin the first state to ban DDT, which ultimately led to a national ban.&lt;ref&gt;Don L. Johnson. "Finally, the DDT Story", ''Dunn County News'', September 17, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another series, Johnson challenged the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] as it tried to ditch and drain the [[Cache River (Arkansas)|Cache River]] bottomlands in [[Arkansas]], for which he received an award from the Arkansas Wildlife Federation.

Johnson also took notes on his nature hikes, which he crafted into vignettes, many published in the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' during the years that he worked as outdoor writer for that newspaper. In November 2005, a collection of his nature essays was published, titled ''Summer's Song and Other Essays''.

Johnson left the ''Sentinel'' in 1984, but continued to write, freelancing articles and photographs to magazines. He published a 1995 book ''Grouse &amp; Woodcock: A Gunner's Guide''.

== Personal life and death ==
Johnson was an adventurer who hiked, hunted, fished, and photographed in such far-flung places as Africa, Cuba, the Andes, the Amazon, Mexico, the Yukon, and Alaska.

Johnson died on January 20, 2006, after a struggle with both [[Parkinson's disease]] and cancer.&lt;ref name=MJS2006/&gt;

'''Energy in Japan''' refers to [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption, import and export in [[Japan]]. The country's primary energy consumption was 477.6 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]] in 2011, a decrease of 5% over the previous year.&lt;ref name="BP2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laohamutuk.org/DVD/docs/BPWER2012report.pdf|title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=BP|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country lacks significant domestic reserves of [[fossil fuel]], except [[coal]], and must import substantial amounts of [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], and other energy resources, including [[uranium]]. Japan relied on oil imports to meet about 84 percent of its energy needs in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx|title=Nuclear Power in Japan|last=|first=|date=2016|website=World Nuclear Association|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was also the first [[Coal mining|coal]] importer in 2010, with 187 [[Megatonne#Derived units|Mt]] (about 20% of total world coal import), and the first [[natural gas]] importer with 99 [[bcm]] (12.1% of world total gas import).&lt;ref name=IEA20116&gt;IEA Key World Energy Statistics [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2011/key_world_energy_stats.pdf 2011], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf 2010], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2009/key2009.pdf 2009], [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/key2006.pdf 2006] [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] October, crude oil p.11, coal p. 13 gas p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

While Japan had previously relied on nuclear power to meet about 30% of its electricity needs, after the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] all nuclear reactors have been progressively shut down for safety concerns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Ōi Nuclear Power Plant]]'s reactor No. 3 was eventually restarted on 2 July 2012.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48034288/ns/world_news-asia_pacific#.T_DZPuge4XM |title=Japan restarts first reactor since Fukushima – World news – Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2012-01-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2013 the plant was shut down in order for [[Ōi Nuclear Power Plant]] to undergo safety inspections and pass legal checks in order to reopen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-24099022|title=Japan halts last nuclear reactor at Ohi|last=|first=|date=15 September 2013|website=BBC|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, 2015 and November 1, 2015 the two reactors at the [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]] restarted. Following the Fukushima disaster, the general public has opposed the use of nuclear energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/japan-restarts-second-nuclear-reactor-despite-public-opposition|title=Japan restarts second nuclear reactor despite public opposition|last=|first=|date=15 October 2015|website=The Guardian|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/opposition-to-nuclear-energy-grows-in-japan/a-36110302|date= 21 October 2016|access-date= 4 October 2017|title=Opposition to nuclear energy grows in Japan|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Electricity Production in Japan.svg|thumb|right|400px|Electricity production in Japan by source.]]
Japan's rapid industrial growth since the end of [[World War II]] doubled the nation's energy consumption every five years into the 1990s. During the 1960–72 period of accelerated growth, energy consumption grew much faster than GNP, doubling Japan's consumption of world energy. By 1976, with only 3% of the world's population, Japan was consuming 6% of global energy supplies.

Compared with other nations, electricity in Japan is relatively expensive,&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110906i1.html Utilities have monopoly on power]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 6 September 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and, since the loss of nuclear power after the earthquake and tsunami disaster at Fukushima, the cost of electricity has risen significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nakamoto |first=Michiyo |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bf0affbc-7d5f-11e1-bfa5-00144feab49a.html#axzz1vnj3MoWo |title=Tepco faces revolt over price rise |publisher=FT.com |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
In 1950 coal supplied half of Japan's energy needs, [[hydroelectricity]] one-third, and oil the rest. By 2001 the contribution of oil had increased to 50.2% of the total, with rises also in the use of nuclear power and natural gas. Japan now depends heavily on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy demand.&lt;ref name=EIA2012 /&gt;

Japan currently produces about 10% of its electricity from renewable sources. The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan set the renewable share goal to be 24% by 2030. In the next 15 years, Japan intends on investing $700 billion into renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/others/basic_plan/pdf/4th_strategic_energy_plan.pdf|title=4th Strategic Energy Plan|last=|first=|date=April 2014|website=Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One initiative the Japanese government has implemented in order to boost the amount of renewable energy produced and purchased in Japan is the feed-in tariff scheme. The scheme encourages companies to invest in renewable energy by providing set prices for various types of renewable energy. The initiatives appear to be working, as renewable energy generation capacity now stands at 26.2 GW, compared to 20.9 GW in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/energy_burst_japan|title=Renewable Energy Burst in Japan|last=Takase|first=Kae|date=27 May 2014|website=Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2018, Japan's government pledged to increase [[renewable energy]] sources from 15% to 22-24% including wind and solar by 2030. [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]] will provide 20% of the country's energy needs as an emissions-free energy source. This will help Japan meet climate change commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan aims for 24% renewable energy but keeps nuclear central|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-07-japan-aims-renewable-energy-nuclear.html| publisher=Phys.org|date=July 3, 2018| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703120614/https://phys.org/news/2018-07-japan-aims-renewable-energy-nuclear.html|archivedate=July 3, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil===
In the wake of the two oil crises of the 1970s ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]), Japan made efforts to diversify energy resources in order to increase [[energy security|security]]. Japan's domestic oil consumption dropped slightly, from around {{convert|5.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of oil per day in the late 1970s to {{convert|4.9|Moilbbl|m3}} per day in 1990. While the country's use of oil declined, its consumption of nuclear power and [[LNG|Natural gas]] rose substantially. Several Japanese industries, including electric power companies and [[steelmaking|steelmakers]], switched from [[petroleum]] to coal, most of which is imported.

The state stockpile equals about 92 days of consumption and the privately held stockpiles equal another 77 days of consumption for a total of 169 days or {{convert|579|Moilbbl|m3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Security in East Asia |publisher= Institute for the Analysis of Global Security|date=2004-08-13 |url=http://www.iags.org/n0813042.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Energy Security Initiative |publisher= Asia Pacific Energy Research Center |date= 2002-01-01 |url= http://www.ieej.or.jp/aperc/2002pdf/OilStocks2002.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060620092529/http://www.ieej.or.jp/aperc/2002pdf/OilStocks2002.pdf |archivedate= 2006-06-20 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese SPR is run by the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jogmec.go.jp/english/index.html |title=Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation |publisher=JOGMEC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil demand has been waning in Japan, especially leading up to and since the [[Tohoku earthquake]] in 2011.
While oil consumption was over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) for decades, this had declined to 3.22 million bpd by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editorial|first1=Reuters|title=UPDATE 1-Japan 2017 thermal coal imports hit record, LNG up for...|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL4N1PJ1DT|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=AF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
As of 2016, both India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India beats Japan in oil use, only next to US, China|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/india-beats-japan-in-oil-use-only-next-to-us-china/articleshow/52659580.cms|work=The Economic Times|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas - SEDS - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url=https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/data.php?incfile=/state/seds/sep_use/total/use_tot_TXa.html&amp;sid=TX|website=www.eia.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; have overtaken Japan in oil consumption.

Following Eisenhower's [[Atoms for Peace]] speech, the United States helped Japan develop their nuclear power program. When Japan decided to embark on the nuclear power field, it imported technology from the [[United States]] and obtained uranium from [[Canada]], [[France]], [[South Africa]], and [[Australia]]. The first nuclear reactor was commissioned in 1966, from then to 2010, 54 more nuclear reactors had opened, with total generation capacity of 48,847 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fepc.or.jp/english/nuclear/power_generation/plants/|title=Nuclear Power Plants in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=The Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of nuclear power generation to total electricity production increased from 2% in 1973 to around 30% in March 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the 1980s, Japan's nuclear power program was strongly opposed by [[environmental group]]s, particularly after the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in the United States. In the 2000s, Japan had a few  of the modern [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]], including some of the first new advanced [[Generation III reactor]]s. At  [[Rokkasho, Aomori]] a facility was built to enrich nuclear fuel, deal with nuclear waste, and recycle spent nuclear fuel.

After the 2011 earthquake and tsunami some nuclear reactors were damaged, causing much uncertainty and fear about the release of radioactive material, as well as highlighting the ongoing concerns over seismic design standards (see [[Nuclear power in Japan#Seismicity|Nuclear power in Japan §Seismicity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110922x3.html Current nuclear debate to set nation's course for decades]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 23 September 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 5 May 2012 Japan shut down the last nuclear reactor, the first time there has been no nuclear power production since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/05/japan-shuts-down-last-nuclear-reactor | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Batty | title=Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor | date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 16 June Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda ordered the restart of [[Ōi Nuclear Power Plant|Ōi nuclear plant]]'s reactors number 3 and 4, saying that people's livelihood needs to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-Ohi_reactors_cleared_for_restart-1806124.html |title=Ohi reactors cleared for restart |publisher=World-nuclear-news.org |date=2012-06-18 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ōi nuclear plant's reactor No. 3 was restarted on 2 July,&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; and No. 4 began operation on 21 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/oi-nuclear-plant-s-no-4-reactor-begins-generating-power_788863.html |title=Oi nuclear plant's No 4 reactor begins generating power |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2013 the [[Ōi Nuclear Power Plant|Ōi nuclear plant]] was shut down in order to have extensive safety inspections performed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By late 2015, both of the [[Sendai Nuclear Power Plant]]'s reactors had reopened and restarted producing nuclear energy. Other nuclear plants, such as the [[Takahama Nuclear Power Plant]], have received permission to reopen, and other nuclear reactors are beginning the process of restarting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/12/24/four-nuclear-reactors-to-reopen-in-japan|title=Four nuclear reactors to reopen in Japan|last=|first=|date=24 December 2015|website=Euronews|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, the Japanese government released an energy proposal that includes the revival of nuclear power to account for Japan's energy needs. The proposal calls for an increase of about 20% in nuclear energy by 2030.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This reverses a decision by the previous Democratic Party, the government will re-open nuclear plants, aiming for "a realistic and balanced energy structure".

===Natural gas===
Because domestic natural gas production is minimal, rising demand is met by greater imports. Japan's main LNG suppliers in 1987 were [[Indonesia]] (51.3%), [[Malaysia]] (20.4%), [[Brunei]] (17.8%), [[United Arab Emirates]] (7.3%), and the [[United States]] (3.2%).

The new Japanese LNG strategy published in May 2016 envisages the creation of a liquid market and an international LNG hub in Japan. This promises to radically change the traditional JCC (crude oil) based pricing system in Japan, but also potentially in the Pacific Basin as a whole. But the path to hub creation and hub pricing in the early 2020s envisaged by the Strategy will not be straightforward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Jonathan|year=2016|title=The new Japanese LNG strategy : a major step towards hub-based gas pricing in Asia|url=https://www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/new-japanese-lng-strategy-major-step-towards-hub-based-gas-pricing-asia/|journal=Oxford Energy Comment|publisher=Oxford Institute for Energy Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroelectricity===
{{main article|Hydroelectricity in Japan}}
The country's main renewable energy source is hydroelectricity, with an installed capacity of about 27 GW and a production of 69.2 TWh of electricity in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hydroelectricity#World hydroelectric capacity]]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of September 2011, Japan had 1,198 small hydropower plants with a total capacity of 3,225 MW. The smaller plants accounted for 6.6 percent of Japan's total hydropower capacity. The remaining capacity was filled by large and medium hydropower stations, typically sited at large dams. Cost per kilowatt-hour for power from smaller plants was high at ¥15–100, hindering further development of the energy source.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110929f1.html Small hydropower plants keep it local]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 September 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power in Japan}}
Japan was the world's second largest producer of [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic electricity]] in the early 2000s, although solar was a very minor contribution to the total at that time. The country was overtaken by [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] in 2005, a year in which Japan had 38% of the world supply compared to Germany's 39%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/science/20070510TDY03003.htm Japan lags behind Europe in solar power]. ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun|The Daily Yomiuri]]'', published 2007-05-10, accessed 2007-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110924f1.html Despite headwinds, solar energy making progress, advocates say]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 24 September 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since then, Japan had been slow to increase solar capacity compared to other countries until 2012.

On 1 July 2012, after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, new tariffs for renewable energy were introduced by the Japanese government. 
The tariffs, set at ¥42 per kWh over the next 20 years to solar power producers, were among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe, Chisaki, ([[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]), "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nb20120704n3.html Japan to become No. 2 solar market]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 July 2012, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120529i1.html New feed-in tariff system a rush to get renewables in play]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 May 2012, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
With the incentives in place, Japan added 1,718 MW of solar power in 2012. By the end of the year, Japan's total solar capacity was 7.4 GW.&lt;ref name="19june"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/18/japan-solar-energy-fukushima-nuclear-renewable-abe|title=After Fukushima, Japan beginning to see the light in solar energy|last=Harlan|first=Chico|date=19 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Japan has seen sustained growth of solar PV capacity after 2012, reaching a cumulative installed capacity of 34 GW by the end of 2015, generating 3.5% of the national electricity consumption in that year.

===Wind power===
{{Main article|Wind power in Japan}}
Japan had 1,807 wind turbines with a total capacity of 2440 MW as of September 2011. Lack of locations with constant wind, environmental restrictions, and emphasis by power utilities on fossil and nuclear power hinders the employment of more wind power in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110928f1.html Wind power quest faces stability, regulatory hurdles]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 September 2011, p. 3.  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been estimated that Japan has the potential for 144 GW for onshore wind and 608 GW of offshore wind capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-26/ge-says-japan-has-more-potential-to-harness-wind-energy | work=Bloomberg | first=Chisaki | last=Watanabe | title=GE Says Japan Has More Potential to Harness Wind Power | date=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal energy===
{{main article|Geothermal power in Japan}}
Of other renewable energy sources, Japan has partially exploited [[Geothermal power|geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/geothermalenergy/4117746/Japan-taps-into-power-of-volcanoes-with-geothermal-energy-plants.html# | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Danielle | last=Demetriou | title=Japan taps into power of volcanoes with geothermal energy plants | date=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country had six geothermal power stations with a combined capacity of 133 megawatts in 1989.  By 2011, the country had 18 geothermal plants.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110927f1.html Geothermal trove lies mostly untapped despite energy crisis]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27 September 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has the third largest geothermal reserves in the world, and geothermal energy in particular is being heavily focused on as a source of power following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent shutdown of all nuclear reactors. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is currently exploring over 40 locations to see if geothermal energy plants would be compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-3/features/geothermal/is-japan-the-next-boom-market-for-the-geothermal-energy-industry.html|title=Is Japan the Next Boom Market for the Geothermal Energy Industry?|last=Cichon|first=Meg|date=29 May 2015|website=Renewable Energy World|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste and biomass energy===
As of September 2011, Japan had 190 generators attached to municipal waste units and 70 independent plants using [[biomass]] fuel to produce energy. In addition, 14 other generators were used to burn both coal and biomass fuel. In 2008, Japan produced 322 million tons of biomass fuel and converted 76% of it into energy.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Eric, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/09/30/national/with-backing-biomass-can-help-meet-energy-needs/#.WW-RI4iGNhE With backing, biomass can help meet energy needs]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 30 September 2011, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean energy===
In 2012, the government announced plans to build experimental [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]] plants in coastal areas.  Construction on the projects, the locations for which have not been determined, would begin in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "Wave, wind power project planned", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 March 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electricity==
{{Main article|Electricity sector in Japan}}
[[File:Power Grid of Japan.svg|thumb|Map of [[Electricity distribution in Japan|Japan's electricity distribution network]], showing incompatible systems between regions.]]
[[File:20040905 jpower sakuma 02.jpg|thumb|The Sakuma Frequency Converter Station]]
In 2014, [[Japan]] ranked fifth in the world by electricity production, after the [[United States]], [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[India]] with 934 TWh produced during that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2233rank.html|title=Electricity – Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=The World Factbook|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of per capita electricity consumption, the average person in Japan consumed 8,459 kWh in 2004 compared to 14,240 kWh for the average American. In that respect it ranked 18th among the countries of the world. Its per capita electricity consumption increased by 21.8% between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="JPELECTPCP2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/ranks/electricity_consumption_per_capita_2004.html |title=Electricity Consumption Per Capita 2004 – Country Rankings |publisher=Allcountries.org |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had 282 GW of total installed electricity generating capacity in 2010, the third largest in the world behind the United States and China. However, after the damage by the 2011 earthquake, capacity is estimated to be around 243 GW in mid-2011.&lt;ref name="EIA2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://205.254.135.7/EMEU/cabs/Japan/pdf.pdf|title=Japan|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|work=Country Analysis Briefs|accessdate=2 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the world's largest users of solar energy, in fourth place behind Germany, Italy, and China. With 53 active nuclear power generating reactor units in 2009, that year Japan ranked third in the world in that respect, after the United States (104 reactors) and France (59).&lt;ref name="JPNUCLEL2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/nuclear_power_reactors_by_country_2009.html |title=Nuclear Power Plants by Country 2009 |publisher=Photius.com |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost one quarter (24.93%) of its electricity production [[Nuclear power in Japan|was from nuclear plants]], compared to 76.18% for [[Nuclear power in France|France]] and 19.66% for the United States.&lt;ref name="JPNUCLPCT2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/ranks/nuclear_share_electricity_generation_by_country_2009.html |title=Nuclear Share in Electricity Generation by Country 2008 |publisher=Allcountries.org |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and the subsequent [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], all plants eventually shut down in May 2012 and [[Ōi Nuclear Power Plant]] was restarted and operational between June 2012 and September 2013.

Since the generation disruption caused by the Fukushima disaster, rapid steps have been made to [[Electricity market|liberalize the electricity supply market]].&lt;ref name="eurotechnology-2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eurotechnology.com/japan-energy/japans-electricity/ |title=Japan electricity markets: structural changes and liberalization |newspaper=Eurotechnology Japan |year=2014 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meti-2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/electricity_and_gas/electric/electricity_liberalization/what/ |title=What does liberalization of the electricity market mean? |publisher=METI |work=Agency for Natural Resources and Energy |year=2013 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this was done in Japan is through the feed-in-tariff scheme. This was announced in 2012 as a direct consequence of the Fukushima disaster. The feed-in-tariff scheme encourages utility operators and companies to purchase and invest in renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meti.go.jp/english/policy/energy_environment/renewable/pdf/summary201207.pdf|title=Feed-in Tariff Scheme in Japan|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry|publisher=|access-date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] set prices for various renewable energy sources to encourage the production and consumption of renewable energy. In April 2016 domestic and small business customers became able to select from over 250 [[Electricity retailing|supplier companies competitively selling electricity]]. Also wholesale electricity trading on the [[Japan Electric Power Exchange]] has been encouraged.&lt;ref name="bl-20160328"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-28/japan-s-power-market-opening-challenges-entrenched-players-q-a |title=Japan's Power Market Opening Challenges Entrenched Players: Q&amp;A |author=Stephen Stapczynski, Emi Urabe |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 March 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jt-20160407"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/04/07/national/electricity-market-shake-mainly-benefiting-tokyo-kansai/ |title=Electricity market shake-up mainly benefiting Tokyo and Kansai |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=7 April 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National grid{{anchor|Electrical power supply}}===
Unlike most other industrial countries, Japan doesn't have a single [[Electric power transmission|national grid]] but instead has separate eastern and western grids. The standard voltage at power outlets is 100 V, but the grids operate at different frequencies: 50&amp;nbsp;Hz in Eastern Japan and  60&amp;nbsp;Hz in Western Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2225.html |title=Electricity in Japan |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grids are connected together by 3 [[frequency changer|frequency converter stations]] ([[Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter|Higashi-Shimizu]], [[Shin Shinano Frequency Converter Station|Shin Shinano]] and [[Sakuma Frequency Converter Station|Sakuma]]), but these can only handle 1 GW in total.&lt;ref name=cw20110321 /&gt; A converter station also exists at [[Minami-Fukumitsu]].  The [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] resulted in 11 reactors being taken offline with a loss of 9.7GW.&lt;ref name=cw20110321 /&gt; The 3 converter stations did not have the capacity to transfer enough power from Japan's western power grid to significantly help the eastern grid.

The two grids were originally developed by separate companies. Tokyo Electric Light Co was established in 1883 which also established electric power in [[Japan]]. In 1885 demand had grown enough that TELCO bought generation equipment from [[AEG]] of [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=cw20110321&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9214758/A_legacy_from_the_1800s_leaves_Tokyo_facing_blackouts|title=A legacy from the 1800s leaves Tokyo facing blackouts|last=Williams|first=Martyn|date=18 March 2011|work=[[Computerworld]]|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The same happened in the western parts of Japan with [[General Electric]] being the supplier to Osaka Electric Lamp.&lt;ref name=cw20110321 /&gt; GE's equipment used the US standard 60&amp;nbsp;Hz while AEG's equipment used the European standard of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=cw20110321 /&gt;

{{See also|Global warming|Kyoto Protocol}}
In 2014 Japan was the 6th largest [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|producer of carbon emissions]]. In 2013 Japan ranked 28 in the [[list of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita]].

In 2007, the BBC reported that Japan was having difficulty in meeting its 6% reduction target under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] partly because Japanese businesses were already very energy efficient.&lt;ref name="BBC070524"&gt;{{cite news 
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6688279.stm  
|title=Japan eyes 50% greenhouse gas cut 
|work=BBC 
|date= 2007-05-24 
|accessdate= 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in May 2007, the former Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]] said that world emissions should be reduced by 50% by 2050. He expected Japan to play a leading role in such an effort. "We must create a new framework which moves beyond the Kyoto Protocol, in which the entire world will participate in emissions reduction," Abe said.&lt;ref name="BBC070524" /&gt;

However, since the events of the Tohoku earthquake, carbon emissions from energy production have increased to near record levels, with 1227Mt released from energy production as opposed to the Kyoto Protocol target of 1136Mt (8% reduction from 1235Mt), just a 0.6% decrease in energy production emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancedglobaltrading.com/japans-co2-emissions-to-hit-record-high-this-year/&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of gas and coal to make up for lost nuclear capacity increased {{CO2}} production by over 3% despite an electrical demand drop of nearly 15%.

[[File:Heracura.jpg|thumb|Figurine dating from the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. found in Stuttgart, Germany]]
'''Erecura''' or '''Aerecura''' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|k|jʊər|ə}} (also found as ''Herecura'' or ''Eracura'')&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Jufer &amp; Thierry Luginbühl. ''Les dieux gaulois : répertoire des noms de divinités celtiques connus par l'épigraphie, les textes antiques et la toponymie.'' Paris: Editions Errance, 2001. {{ISBN|2-87772-200-7}}. pp. 18, 40, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; was a goddess worshipped in ancient times, often thought to be [[Celt]]ic in origin, mostly represented with the attributes of [[Proserpina]] and associated with the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[underworld]] god [[Dis Pater]], as on an altar from Sulzbach.&lt;ref name="beck136"&gt;[[#beck|Beck]] (2009), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; She appears with Dis Pater in a statue found at [[Oberseebach]], [[Switzerland]], and in several magical texts from Austria, once in the company of [[Cerberus]] and once probably with [[Ogmios]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#egger|Egger]] (1962-63), I.84-85; I.276-79; II.24-33.&lt;/ref&gt; A further inscription to her has been found near [[Stuttgart]], Germany. Besides her [[chthonic]] symbols, she is often depicted with such attributes of fertility as the [[cornucopia]] and apple baskets.&lt;ref name="lendering"/&gt; She is depicted in a seated posture, wearing a full robe and bearing trays or baskets of fruit, in depictions from Cannstatt&lt;ref name="beck135"/&gt; and Sulzbach.&lt;ref name="beck136"/&gt; Miranda Green calls Aericura a "[[Gaulish]] [[Hecuba]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#green|Green]] (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; while Noémie Beck characterizes her as a "land-goddess" sharing both underworld and fertility aspects with Dis Pater.&lt;ref name="beck137"/&gt;

Representations of Erecura are most commonly found in the [[Danube|Danubian]] area of [[Southern Germany]] and [[Slovenia]], but they also occur in Italy, Great Britain, and France. Her inscriptions are concentrated in [[Stuttgart]] and along the [[Rhine]]. Several monuments in honour of Erecura occur in cemeteries or other funereal contexts.&lt;ref name="beck137"/&gt; [[Jona Lendering]] notes the similarity between her iconography and that of [[Nehalennia]], who was worshipped in [[Germania Inferior]],&lt;ref name="lendering"/&gt; while Beck sees no significant difference between her attributes and those of the [[Matres and Matronae]].&lt;ref name="beck135"/&gt; Geographically, the areas in which Erecura and Dis Pater were worshipped appear to be in complementary distribution with those where the cult of [[Sucellus]] and [[Nantosuelta]] is attested, and Beck suggests that these cults were functionally similar although iconographically distinct.&lt;ref name="beck137"&gt;[[#beck|Beck]] (2009), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

A male deity called [[Arecurius]] or Aericurus is named on an altar-stone in [[Northumberland]], England,&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood and R.P. Wright. ''The Roman Inscriptions of Britain'' (RIB), Vol. 1:  The Inscriptions on Stone. RIB 1123. See also the relevant page of [http://www.roman-britain.org/places/corstopitum.htm roman-britain.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820145944/http://www.roman-britain.org/places/corstopitum.htm |date=August 20, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; although Beck cautions that "this inscription is quite uncertain, and it might be a misreading of [[Mercury (god)|Mercurio]]".&lt;ref name="beck135"/&gt;
__NOTOC__

==Etymology==

The [[wikt:theonym|theonym]] is of unclear origin. It has been connected with Latin ''aes, aeris'' 'copper, bronze, money, wealth', ''era'' 'mistress' and the name of the Greek goddess [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#egger|Egger]] (1962), I.84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Many different Latinised forms of this goddess’s name occur: ''Aeraecura'' at [[Perugia]]; ''Aerecura'' at [[Mainz]], [[Xanten]], [[Aquileia]] and [[Roşia Montană]]; ''Aericura'' at [[:de:Sulzbach (Malsch)|Sulzbach, Malsch]], ''Eracura'' in [[:de:Mautern an der Donau|Mautern, Austria]], ''Ercura'' at [[:de:Fliehburg|Fliehburg]], ''Erecura'' at [[:de:Cannstatt|Cannstatt]], [[Tongeren]] and [[Aube|Belley in Aube]]; ''Heracura'' at [[Stockstadt am Rhein]], ''Herecura'' at [[:de:Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt|Cannstatt]], [[Freinsheim]] and [[Rottenburg am Neckar]], where the form ''Herequra'' is also found.&lt;ref name="inventaire"&gt;Lajoye, Patrice; ''Inventaire des divinités celtiques de l’Antiquité'', Caen: Société de Mythologie Française. Available at [http://www.arbre-celtique.com/approfondissements/divinites/inventaire-div/div_liste.php?nomloc=%28tous%29 L’Arbre Celtique].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The alternation between the initial [[H]] and [[A]] may be due to the letters' similar shape in the [[History of the Latin alphabet|classical Latin capitals]] ordinarily used in [[Epigraphy|epigraphic inscriptions]] in the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#green|Green]] (2004), pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since less literate members of the [[Roman Empire]]’s community sometimes misinterpreted the [[phoneme|phonemic value]] of a given letter.&lt;ref&gt;This is also apparent in the inscriptions to [[Belatucadrus]]. [[#green|Green]] (2004), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; A name of the form {{IPA|*/aireˈkura/}} or {{IPA|*/(h)eːreˈkura/}} appears to underlie the alternations ''Aeraecura'' ~ ''Aerecura'' ~ ''Aericura'' ~ ''Eracura'' ~ ''Ercura'' ~ ''Erecura'' ~ ''Heracura'' ~ ''Herecura'' ~ ''Herequra''. 

Though the goddess herself may be [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], it is open to question whether the name is of [[Celtic languages|Celtic origin]] or even [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. Lendering considers her cult to be of [[Illyria]]n origin, spreading from [[Aquileia]] and only reaching the Danubian and Rhenish border regions through the Roman troops deployed there.&lt;ref name="lendering"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/religion/herecura/ |author=Jona Lendering |title=Herecura |website=Livius.org |accessdate=2015-05-28 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck considers the name to be of Germanic origin.&lt;ref name="beck135"&gt;[[#beck|Beck]] (2009), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Gendarmerie Force''' ('''EUROGENDFOR''' or '''EGF''') is a European intervention force with militarised police functions and specialisation in crisis management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiep.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/E-reader-FIEP-Seminarbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;Giovanni Arcudi &amp; Michael E. Smith (2013), [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2012.747511 The European Gendarmerie Force: a solution in search of problems?], ''European Security'', 22:1, 1-20, DOI: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09662839.2012.747511 10.1080/09662839.2012.747511]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EGF was launched by an agreement in 2006 between five [[Member State of the European Union|member states]] of the [[European Union]] (EU): [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], and [[Spain]]. [[Romania]] joined in 2009; [[Poland]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=poland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zw.wp.mil.pl/en/253.html|title=European Gendarmerie Force|accessdate=2013-12-31|publisher=[[Żandarmeria Wojskowa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status is enshrined in the '''Treaty of Velsen''' of 18 October 2007.&lt;ref name=treatytext&gt;Eurogendfor.org, [http://www.eurogendfor.org/eurogendfor-library/download-area/official-texts/establishing-the-eurogendfor-treaty Treaty establishing the European Gendarmerie Force], accessed on January 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters are located in [[Vicenza]], Italy.

The EGF is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], CSDP); it is for instance not a [[Permanent Structured Cooperation#Projects|project]] of the [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] (PESCO) of the CSDP. The EGF may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a ''multinational force'' in accordance with article 42.3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU).

==History==
The [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Defence Minister]] [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]] first proposed the force in September 2003. Alliot-Marie and the [[Italian Minister of Defence|Italian Defense Minister]] [[Antonio Martino]] presented the idea at the Meeting of [[European Union]] Defense Ministers in October 2003. The implementation agreement was finally signed by defence ministers of the five participating countries on 17 September 2004 in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands. On 23 January 2006, the EGF was officially inaugurated during a military ceremony in the Gen. Chinotto barracks in Vicenza.

The EGF was declared fully operational on 20 July 2006, following the High Level Interministerial meeting in Madrid, Spain, and its second successful Command Post exercise (CPX), which took place between 19–28 April 2006. The first CPX was held at the National Gendarmerie Training Center in Saint Astier, France in June 2005.

After [[Romania]]'s accession to the European Union, the [[Jandarmeria Română|Romanian Gendarmerie]] sought permanent observer status with the European Gendarmerie Force, as a first step towards full membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jandarmeriaromana.ro/pagini/ci_polEuro3.html ''Politica europeană - Forţa de Jandarmerie Europeană'' (European Policy - European Gendarmerie Force)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830220141/http://www.jandarmeriaromana.ro/pagini/ci_polEuro3.html |date=2007-08-30 }}, Romanian Gendarmerie website, accessed on January 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2009, the Romanian Gendarmerie became a full member of the European Gendarmerie Force.&lt;ref&gt;Eurogendfor.eu, [http://www.eurogendfor.eu/ EGF News], accessed on March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] [[Military Gendarmerie]] was originally a partner force and, on 10 October 2006, Poland indicated it would like to join the EGF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200610/10/eng20061010_310452.html|title=People's Daily Online  -- Poland expresses readiness to join European Gendarmerie Force|first=|last=english@peopledaily.com.cn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Poland applied for full membership in EGF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zw.wp.mil.pl/pl/53.html|title=..:: Żandarmeria Wojskowa - Komenda Główna ŻW :: EGF ::..|first=made by Marcin Kuhiwczak &amp; Piotr Makuracki|last=Rydzyk|date=2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was granted in 2011.&lt;ref name=poland/&gt;

==Missions==
*Since December 2009, the EGF has taken part in the NATO [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) training operation of the [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]]. As of June 2010, 276 members of the EGF (among which 124 French gendarmes), from France, Spain, Netherlands, Poland and Portugal are training the [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] (ANCOP) officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, while the initial mission was planned to be around 400 to 500 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.nordeclair.fr/France-Monde/Monde/2009/06/12/des-gendarmes-picards-bientot-en-afghani.shtml Des gendarmes picards bientôt en Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727112807/http://www.nordeclair.fr/France-Monde/Monde/2009/06/12/des-gendarmes-picards-bientot-en-afghani.shtml |date=2011-07-27 }}, Nord Éclair, 12 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They are training them in ANCOP training centers but are also accompanying, advising and helping them during their missions in P-[[OMLT]] (Police Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/cr-cafe/09-10/c0910077.asp (French) report from the commission on Foreign matters of the French Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_la_une/toute_l_actualite/affaires-europeennes/gendarmes-en-afghanistan/view (French), "Gendarmes in Afghanistan", French Internals affairs Ministry website&lt;/ref&gt; where their military experience (even if the mission is strictly speaking civilian since it is "formation") will be useful. As of May 2010, it had trained 50 officers and 250 non-commissioned officers of the ANCOP, and the then French Minister of Defense Brice Hortefeux announced that 40 more French gendarmes would be sent to help this mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_la_une/toute_l_actualite/affaires-europeennes/deplacement-afghanistan/view (French)  "Brice Hortefeux honours the contribution of French policemen and gendarmes to the Afghan police training", French Internals affairs Ministry website&lt;/ref&gt;

*In early 2010, the EGF was deployed to [[Haiti]] to help with post-relief security efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = European gendarmes to beef up Haiti security | url = http://www.euronews.net/2010/01/25/earthquate-in-haiti-european-gendarmes-to-beef-up-haiti-security | publisher = euronews  | date =  | accessdate = 3 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Eurogendfor members.svg|thumb|right|EGF members.]]
The EGF is based in [[Vicenza]], in northeastern Italy, and has a core of 800 to 900 members ready to deploy within 30 days.

An additional 2,300 reinforcements are available on standby.

Germany does not take part, as its constitution does not permit the use of military forces for police services. In 2004, Peter Struck, Minister of Defense at the time, clarified that the legal foundation for militarised police forces is different from the expectations underlying the EGF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/article/184304/des-gendarmes-europeens-en-renfort.html "Des gendarmes européens en renfort"], 17/09/2004&lt;/ref&gt; The paramilitary [[Bereitschaftspolizei]] units of the Länder states have no standing patrol order like the [[German Federal Police]]. Germany did not sign the Treaty of Velsen on the EGF or any subsequent accord.&lt;ref&gt;DerStandard.at, [http://derstandard.at/1389857860322/Welche-Befugnisse-hat-die-Europaeische-Gendarmerietruppe-EGF Welche Befugnisse hat die Europäische Gendarmerietruppe?], accessed on February 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is a tight integration of police forces based on the [[Prüm Treaty]]. Originally the Prüm Treaty regulated access to police databases of neighboring countries but it was used multiple times as the legal foundation to exchange [[riot police]] equipment and personnel with the participating countries (Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium). In 2008 the Prüm Treaty was naturalised as EU law, allowing countries access to police forces regulated under EU law (based on the [[Schengen Agreement]]). The European Police Forces Training of 2009 (EUPFT 2009) was run in Vicenza (home of EGF headquarters) and the EUPFT 2010 on anti-riot tactics was run in Lehnin in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/Home/06__Presse/BUNDESPOLIZEI-kompakt/Bundespolizei__kompakt-Ausgabe__2010-02,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Bundespolizei_kompakt-Ausgabe_2010-02.pdf "Von Vicenza nach Lehnin"], Bundespolizei kompakt (German federal police journal), February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/blogs/8/147676|title=Bundespolizei lädt zum Häuserkampf|first=Matthias|last=Monroy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with EU defence policy==
The EGF is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]], CSDP); it is for instance not a [[Permanent Structured Cooperation#Projects|project]] of the [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] (PESCO) of the CSDP. The EGF may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a ''multinational force'' in accordance with article 42.3 of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU).

The '''European Regulators' Group for Electricity and Gas (ERGEG)''' is an advisory group to the [[European Commission]] on [[internal energy market]] issues in Europe. ERGEG was set up by the European Commission to assist the Commission in consolidating a single EU market for electricity and gas. ERGEG’s members are the heads of the national energy regulatory authorities in the EU’s 28 Member States.

==Foundation and Mission==
ERGEG was set up by the European Commission (Decision of 11 November 2003 2003/796/EC) as its advisory body on internal energy market issues. It is made up of the national energy regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. Its purpose is to facilitate a consistent application, in all Member States, of the provisions set out in Internal Market in Electricity Directive|Directive 2003/54/EC, Directive 2003/55/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, as well as of possible future EU legislation in the field of electricity and gas”.
With the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) fully operational (since March 2011), ERGEG was dissolved by the European Commission (Commission Decision of 16 May 2011 repealing Decision 2003/796/EC) with effect from 1 July 2011. All past works relating to ERGEG activity (documents, reports, public consultations etc.) can be found on this website of the [http://www.energy-regulators.eu European Energy Regulators].

==Objectives and Functions==
The role and aim of the ERGEG was to advise and assist the European Commission in ensuring the creation and smooth functioning of the internal energy market in Europe.  
ERGEG facilitates consultation, coordination and cooperation of national energy regulators contributing to a consistent application, in all Member States, of EU energy legislation.
In advising the European Commission ERGEG worked transparently and was committed to best regulatory practice in terms of conducting its public consultations and engaging with stakeholders.

==From ERGEG to ACER==
Since March 2011, a new organisation, the [[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators]] (ACER) became fully operational. ACER was established following the entry into force of [[Third Energy Package|third energy liberalisation legislative package (3rd Package)]] on 3 September 2009, has been assigned a series of tasks and responsibilities in relation to Europe’s electricity and gas markets. ACER is a European Community body with legal personality, funded by the EU budget, with a staff of around 50 persons. With ACER fully operational, ERGEG was formally dissolved by the European Commission, with effect from 1 July 2011.

==ERGEG's work==
Some examples of what ERGEG, the energy regulators’ advisory group to the European Commission, did in practice:

* '''ERGEG Regional Initiatives'''
One of ERGEG’s flagship projects was the Regional Initiatives, which it launched with the European Commission’s backing in Spring 2006, in an effort to speed up the integration of Europe’s national energy markets. The ERGEG Regional Initiatives establish 7 electricity and 3 regional gas markets in Europe as an intermediate step to the creation of a single, competitive EU market in electricity and gas.  Since 2011, ACER takes over responsibility for the Regional Initiatives.
* '''Monitoring compliance with existing rules'''
ERGEG carried out extensive monitoring of compliance with  rules (e.g. transparency, access, and implementation of consumer rights) and advised the European Commission accordingly. To assist in the practical implementation of the principles set out in the current energy laws, ERGEG developed Guidelines of Good Practice (GGPs) in certain areas. ERGEG GGPs are voluntary guidelines (i.e. not legally enforceable) which are developed in consultation with stakeholders. 
* '''Advising the European Commission on legislative proposals'''
ERGEG advised and assisted the European Commission in the preparation of draft implementing measures in the field of electricity and gas. For example, ERGEG provided significant input to the European Commission in the preparation of its third energy liberalisation legislative package proposals (September 2007).

==Members==
ERGEG members were the national energy regulatory authorities of the 28 EU Member States. The European Commission is represented at a high level. The energy regulators of the countries who are candidates for accession to the EU and the countries of the European Economic Area (EEA) participated in ERGEG meetings as Observers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17184">A '''hydrological code''' or '''hydrologic unit code''' is a sequence of numbers or letters that identify a hydrological feature like a [[river]], river [[Reach (geography)|reach]], [[lake]], or area like a [[drainage basin]] (also called watershed (in North America)) or catchment.

One system, developed by [[Arthur Newell Strahler|Strahler]], known as the [[Strahler number|Strahler stream order]], ranks streams based on a hierarchy of tributaries. Each segment of a stream or river within a river network is treated as a node in a tree, with the next segment downstream as its parent. When two first-order streams come together, they form a second-order stream. When two second-order streams come together, they form a third-order stream, and so on.

Another example is the system of assigning IDs to watersheds devised by [[:pt:Otto Pfafstetter|Otto Pfafstetter]], known as the [[Pfafstetter Coding System]] or the Pfafstetter System. Drainage areas are delineated in a hierarchical fashion, with "level 1" watersheds at continental scales, subdivided into smaller level 2 watersheds, which are divided into level 3 watersheds, and so on. Each watershed is assigned a unique number, called a Pfafsetter Code, based on its location within the overall drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap1008/p1008.htm Watershed Topology - The Pfafstetter System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710202642/http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap1008/p1008.htm |date=2011-07-10 }}, by Jordan Furnans and Francisco Olivera&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
A comprehensive coding system is in use in Europe. This system codes from the ocean to the so-called primary catchment. The system determines a set of oceans or [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] systems identified by a letter. These systems are subdivided into a maximum of 9 seas. The seas are numbered 1 to 9. Seas lying far from the ocean, for example the [[Black Sea]] receive a higher number. The seas are delimited using the so-called definitions made by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] in 1953. The coasts of these seas are defined clockwise from north west to south east from the strait where the sea connects to the ocean or the other seas.

Subsequently every watershed along this coast is assigned a number using the [[Pfafstetter Coding System]]. This implies that the four largest watersheds are selected and receive numbers 2,4,6, or 8. The watersheds in between the large systems receive numbers 3, 5, and 7. Numbers 1 and 9 are used for the small watersheds on the edges of the strait. The smaller systems can subsequently be numbered recursively or kept together for grouping purpose.
Landmasses (Continent and Islands) are also numbered in a logical manner, along a clock-wise oriented sea. For Europe containing many inner seas this feature helps to read the relative location of a hydrological object in the sea.

==United States==
The [[United States Geological Survey]] created a hierarchical system of hydrologic units originally called [[Water Resource Region|regions]], sub-regions, accounting units, and cataloging units. Each unit was assigned a unique '''Hydrologic Unit Code''' (HUC). As first implemented the system had 21 regions, 221 subregions, 378 accounting units, and 2,264 cataloging units.&lt;ref name="USGS HUCs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seaber, Paul R., F.

The table below describes the system's hydrologic unit levels and their characteristics, along with example names and codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) Facts |publisher= [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] |url= http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/facts.html}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original delineation of units, down to subbasins (cataloging units), was done using 1:250,000 [[Scale (map)|scale]] maps and data. The newer delineation work on watersheds and subwatersheds was done using 1:24,000 scale maps and data.  As a result, the subbasin boundaries were changed and adjusted in order to conform to the higher resolution watersheds within them. Changes to subbasin boundaries resulted in changes in area sizes. Therefore, older data using "cataloging units" may differ from newer, higher resolution data using "subbasins".&lt;ref name="WBDstandard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/pdf/tm11-a3.pdf|title=Federal guidelines, requirements, and procedures for the national Watershed Boundary Dataset: U.S. Geological Survey Techniques and Methods 11–A3|last=|first=|date=|year=2009|website=|publisher=[[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] and [[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions (1st level hydrologic units) are geographic areas that contain either the [[Drainage basin|drainage area]] of a major river, such as the Missouri region, or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers, such as the Texas–Gulf region. Each subregion includes the area drained by a river system, a [[Reach (geography)|reach]] of a river and its tributaries in that reach, a [[Endorheic basin|closed basin]] or basins, or a group of streams forming a coastal drainage area.&lt;ref name=HUmaps&gt;{{cite web |title= Hydrologic Unit Maps, U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2294 |last1= Seaber |first1= Paul R. |last2= Kapinos |first2= F.

[[Image:HUC subregions.png|thumb|right|A map of the "subregion hydrologic unit boundaries. Note this updated map updates boundaries to include the ocean as well as the portions of the basins that cross international boundaries.]]

The hierarchy was designed and the units subdivided so that almost all the subbasins (formerly called cataloging units) are larger than {{convert|700|sqmi|km2}}. Larger closed basins were subdivided until their subunits were less than 700 square miles.&lt;ref name=HUmaps/&gt; The 10-digit watersheds were delineated to be between 40,000 and 250,000 acres in size, and the 12-digit subwatersheds between 10,000 and 40,000 acres.&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt; In addition to the hydrologic unit codes, each hydrologic unit was assigned a name corresponding to the unit's principal hydrologic feature or to a cultural or political feature within the unit.&lt;ref name=HUmaps/&gt;
The boundaries of the hydrologic units usually correspond to drainage basins with some exceptions; for example, subregion 1711, called "Puget Sound", includes all U.S. drainage into not only Puget Sound but also the [[Strait of Georgia]], [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], and the [[Fraser River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wa.water.usgs.gov/data/wuse/huc.names.txt |title= List Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs) - USGS Washington |publisher= [[USGS]] |accessdate= 19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, region and subregion boundaries end at the U.S. international boundary.&lt;ref name=HUmaps/&gt;

In general, hydrologic units were delineated such that all surface drainage within each unit converges at a single outlet point—a type of hydrologic unit called a "classic hydrological unit". It was not always possible to delineated units in this way while adhering to the size and subdivision standards of the system. There are several "non-classic" types of drainage areas, each requiring special criteria for delineation and subdivision.&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt;

"Remnant areas" occur along coasts where individual streams are too small for the given subdivision type. Such remnants were combined into a single unit if they were adjacent and could be combined. These "composite" units are called "frontal units". They are non-classic because they have more than one outlet.&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt;

For example, the coastal area along [[Puget Sound]] between [[Seattle]] and [[Mukilteo, Washington|Mukilteo]], is delineated at the finest "subwatershed" level as "Shell Creek-Frontal Puget Sound", HUC 171100190203. This hydrologic unit includes numerous small streams that drain directly to Puget Sound, including [[Pipers Creek (Seattle)|Pipers Creek]] and [[Boeing Creek]]. As a consequence of the smallest "subwatershed" being non-classic, every higher level unit containing it are also non-classic "frontal" units—"Lunds Gulch-Frontal Puget Sound" (HUC 17110019), "Puget Sound" (HUC 171100 and 1711), and "Pacific Northwest Region" (HUC 17).&lt;ref name=WBD&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed Boundary Dataset|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]], National Cartography and Geospatial Center|url=http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/|accessdate=September 4, 2010}} [[ArcExplorer]] [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data viewer.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Noncontributing areas" are drainage areas within a hydrologic unit that do not drain to the unit's outlet. They can be caused by such things as potholes and [[Kettle (landform)|kettles]], closed basins, [[Dry lake|playas]], and [[cirque]]s. If a noncontributing area is large enough, it was designated as a hydrologic unit of its own. The largest such example is the [[Great Basin]], designated a hydrologic unit the Region level. When a noncontributing area was not large enough to be designated a hydrologic unit, it was merged into the surrounding or bordering larger hydrologic unit.&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt; Special decisions were required for "semiconfined basins" that contribute flow to another area in wet years but become noncontributing in dry years—[[Goose Lake (Oregon-California)|Goose Lake]], for example. The USGS instructed the people doing the delineation work to take extra care in the case of semiconfined basins and to seek assistance from others, but to ultimately make their own decision on whether the semiconfined basin should be designated a noncontributing area or not. Another special case occurs when noncontributing areas very small and dispersed, or scattered throughout a drainage area. These were considered part of the encompassing hydrologic unit. In short, noncontributing areas cannot be subject to strict criteria for delineating, and methods vary from state to state, landform type to type, and special cases. The effect of noncontributing areas on specific hydrologic units is explained in [[metadata]] as best it can.&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt;

The Goose Lake example illustrates how USGS hydrologic units do not always conform strictly to drainage basins. Despite being part of the Upper Sacramento River basin (or accounting unit), HUC 180200, and the Sacramento River subregion, HUC 1802, the Goose Lake subbasin (or cataloging unit), HUC 18020001, was defined as a closed basin during the watershed and subwatershed delineation process.&lt;ref name=WBD/&gt; Therefore, the area of the Sacramento River subregion and the Upper Sacramento River basin, as published by the USGS ({{convert|27600|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7650|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} respectively), are too large by at least the size of the Goose Lake subbasin/cataloging unit, {{convert|1080|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |url= http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html |accessdate= 16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-classic drainage issues that have an effect on hydrologic unit delineation and subdivision include [[reservoir]]s, diverted waters ranging from small irrigation [[ditch]]es to [[interbasin transfer]]s, islands, and coastal areas with large [[tidal range]]s. The 5th and 6th level hydrologic units, called "watersheds" and "subwatersheds", were assigned one of seven attribute codes to indicate drainage type: standard (classic, one outlet), closed basin (no outlet), frontal (multiple outlets), water (predominately water with adjacent land areas), island (one or more islands and adjacent water), and unclassified (an area that cannot be defined or does not fit one of the other types).&lt;ref name=WBDstandard/&gt;

The [[natural environment]] includes complete [[ecological unit]]s that function as [[nature|natural]] systems without massive [[people|human]] intervention, including all [[vegetation]], animals, [[microorganisms]], [[soil]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[atmosphere]] and [[natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]] that occur within their boundaries. Also part of the natural environment is universal natural [[natural resource|resources]] and [[physical phenomena]] that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as [[air]], [[water]], and [[climate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6032">'''Industrial resources (minerals)''' are geological materials which are mined for their commercial value, which are not fuel (fuel minerals or [[mineral fuels]]) and are not sources of metals ([[metal]]lic minerals) but are used in the industries based on their physical and/or chemical properties.&lt;ref name="Kogel et al"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22industrial+mineral%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22industrial%20mineral%22&amp;f=false |title=Industrial Minerals &amp; Rocks: Commodities, Markets, and Uses |publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration  |year=2006 |isbn=9780873352338 |editors=Kogel J.E., Trivedi N.C., Barker J.M. &amp; Krukowski S.T. |edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They are used in their natural state or after [[beneficiation]] either as raw materials or as additives in a wide range of applications.

==Examples and applications==
Typical examples of industrial rocks and minerals are [[limestone]], [[clay]]s, [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[diatomite]], [[kaolin]], [[bentonite]], [[silica]], [[barite]], [[gypsum]], and [[talc]].
Some examples of applications for industrial minerals are [[construction]], [[ceramic]]s, [[paints]], [[electronics]], [[filtration]], [[plastics]], [[glass]], [[detergents]] and [[paper]].

In some cases, even organic materials ([[peat]]) and industrial products or by-products ([[cement]], [[slag]], [[silica fume]]) are categorized under industrial minerals, as well as metallic compounds mainly utilized in non-metallic form (as an example most of the titanium is utilized as an oxide TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  rather than Ti metal). 

In some cases, organic substances (such as peat) can be loosely categorized as industrial resources/minerals. This case, however, violates the technical definition of a "mineral."  A substance must be a mineral before it may be categorized as an industrial mineral. Peat is a geologic substance mined for its economic value but that does not mandate that it be referred to as a mineral or as an industrial mineral.

The evaluation of raw materials to determine their suitability for use as industrial minerals requires technical test-work, mineral processing trials and end-product evaluation; free to download evaluation manuals are available for the following industrial minerals: limestone, [[flake graphite]], [[diatomite]], [[kaolin]], [[bentonite]] and construction materials. These are available from the [[British Geological Survey]] external link 'Industrial Minerals in BGS' with regular industry news and reports published in [[Industrial Minerals magazine]].

The '''Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation''' ('''IHME''') is a research institute working in the area of [[global health]] statistics and impact evaluation at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle. The Institute is headed by Dr. [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], a physician and health economist, and professor at the [[University of Washington Department of Global Health]], which is part of the [[School of Medicine]]. IHME's goal, as stated on the Institute's website, is "to identify the best strategies to build a healthier world. By measuring health, tracking program performance, finding ways to maximize health system impact, and developing innovative measurement systems, IHME provides a foundation for informed decision-making that ultimately will lead to better health globally" IHME (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Heath Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/research|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IHME conducts research and trains scientists, policymakers, and the public in health metrics concepts, methods, and tools. Its mission includes judging the effectiveness and efficacy of health initiatives and national health systems. IHME's work seeks to be complementary to the [[United Nations]]' work in the [[World Health Organization]] in that it shares many tasks but is independent from member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNiel|first1=Donal|title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=New York Times|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Seattle institute aims to help cure world-health data disorder|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-institute-aims-to-help-cure-world-health-data-disorder/|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle Times|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHME gathers health-related data from all available sources. It develops innovative analytical tools to track trends in mortality, diseases, and risk factors, and capsulizes many of its research findings in data visualizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Visualizations|url=http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates interventions such as vaccines, malaria control policies, cancer screenings, and birth care. To enable researchers to replicate IHME's work and to foster new research, IHME created the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) where methods and results are cataloged and freely accessible. IHME is also committed to expanding the field of health metrics by training students at the post-baccalaureate and post-graduate levels.

==History==

IHME was launched in June 2007 based on a core grant of $105 million primarily funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its earliest projects was to produce new estimates of mortality rates, which were published in ''The Lancet'' in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CJL|last2=Laakso|first2=T|last3=Shibuya|first3=K|last4=Lopez|first4=AD|title=Can we achieve Millennium Development Goal 4?

==Research==
IHME also has launched policy reports on a wide range of topics, including a June 2010 report on child and maternal mortality. The findings were updated in 2014. In 2009, IHME launched its series of Financing Global Health policy reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravishankar|first1=N|last2=Gubbins|first2=P|last3=Cooley|first3=RJ|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Michaud|first5=CM|last6=Jamison|first6=DT|last7=Murray|first7=CJL|title=Financing of global health: tracking development assistance for health from 1990 to 2007|journal=The Lancet|date=20 June 2009|volume=373|pages=2113–2124|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60881-3|pmid=19541038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=C|last2=Schneider|first2=MT|last3=Gubbins|first3=P|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Jamison|first5=D|last6=Murray|first6=CJL|title=Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=17 April 2010|volume=375|pages=1375–1387|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60233-4|pmid=20381856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial report led to meetings with staff from the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and with a task force appointed by US President Barack Obama to guide the funding of his new Global Health Initiative. Annual updates have been published since then.

Recent publications have included estimations of causes of death worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-age-sex-specific-all-cause-and-cause-specific}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incidence of HIV, TB, and malaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-incidence-and-mortality-hiv-tuberculosis-and-malaria |date=July 2014 |first1=Christopher J.L. |last1=Murray |first2=Theo |last2=Vos |first3=Alan |last3=Lopez |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as obesity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-regional-and-national-prevalence-overweight-and-obesity-children-and-adults}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2960460-8/abstract|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60460-8|volume=384|year=2014|pages=766–781 | last1 = Ng | first1 = Marie|pmc=4624264}}&lt;/ref&gt; cigarette smoking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996- 2012|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/cigarette-smoking-prevalence-us-counties-1996-2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temporal trends in ischemic heart disease mortality in 21 world regions, 1980-2010: the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/temporal-trends-ischemic-heart-disease-mortality-21-world-regions-1980-2010-global}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small area estimation of diabetes rates in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srebotnjak|first1=T|last2=Mokdad|first2=AH|last3=Murray|first3=CJL|title=A novel framework for validating and applying standardized small area measurement strategies|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=29 September 2010|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/8/1/26|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-8-26|volume=8|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also worked with other organizations on projects. For example, IHME researchers helped create the 2010 WHO World Malaria Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO: World Malaria Report 2010|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating all the estimates for insecticide-treated nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260|year=2010}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; IHME has also collaborated on country-level research projects, including a partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help create a health surveillance system to track disease trends and inform policy. 
There is a list of publications at IHME's website.

===Global Burden of Disease===
{{further|Global Burden of Disease Study}}

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2010, a worldwide consortium of 500 researchers, coordinated by IHME measured the impact of more than 290 health conditions and 67 health risk factors worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The story of GBD 2010: a "super-human" effort|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2962174-6/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBD enterprise produced estimates in 21 regions around the world for disability-adjusted life years by age and sex for the past two decades. Part of this research has involved conducting in-person surveys in several countries and gathering health information through a website survey. The team created a cause of death database that includes 60 years of data, or almost 800 million deaths. To illustrate the findings, IHME released a suite of interactive data visualizations, which are available to the public.

The aim is to allow policymakers and other decision-makers to "compare the effects of different diseases – such as cancer versus depression – that kill people prematurely and cause ill health," to show disease trends over time, and to inform policy, IHME states on its website.

It has been labeled "the most comprehensive review of the state of humanity's health ever undertaken."&lt;ref name="2013_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Gates, UW teaming up on massive health study|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/gates-uw-teaming-up-on-massive-health-study/ |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and China are among the countries working with IHME to generate subnational burden of disease estimates at the county and province levels.

In January 2014, IHME began releasing updates to the work, called the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2013. The work generated over 1 billion estimates of health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GBD History|url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBD estimates are now being updated annually.

Some of the findings have been controversial. In 2012, IHME researchers estimated 1.2 million people died from malaria in 2010, double the WHO's estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New estimates of malaria deaths: concern and opportunity|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960169-X/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60169-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelland|first1=Kate|title=Analysis: Health by numbers: A statistician's challenge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-statistics-idUSBRE84D0KD20120514 |accessdate=January 25, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease Control Priorities Network===

{{further|Disease Control Priorities Project}}

The Disease Control Priorities Network project generates cost-effectiveness estimates for a range of health interventions. A team of demographers, statisticians, economists, and other experts are studying how to improve the allocation of resources among interventions, technologies, hospitals, and other service delivery platforms. They are working in multiple countries, including the US, India, and South Africa.
Their cost-effectiveness work has revealed some hidden connections. For example, a 2010 report showed improving girls' education in poor countries is the most effective way to reduce child mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=18 September 2010|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was a surprise for some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Paul|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effort launched in 2011 called Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) involves collecting evidence and analyzing data to improve the cost-effectiveness and equity of health systems in Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Uganda, and Zambia. The project examines four components that affect health care delivery: access (to health facilities), bottlenecks (limitations on the supply side), costs, and equity (across populations). The work includes in-depth facility surveys and inventories across a range of service delivery platforms; additional data is collected in countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens through exit interviews and chart extraction.

A 2013 report concluded that neonatal and maternal mortality in Ghana could be best improved not with sophisticated maternity care but with better transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel time to maternity care and its effect on utilization in rural Ghana: a multilevel analysis|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/travel-time-maternity-care-and-its-effect-utilization-rural-ghana-multilevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population Health Metrics Research Consortium project===
The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium created new methods for tracking health intervention coverage in low-resource settings. The methods have been used to measure mortality, causes of death, and incidence of major illnesses where data are incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Health Metrics Research Consortium gold standard verbal autopsy validation study: design, implementation, and development of analysis datasets|url=https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/population-health-metrics-research-consortium-gold-standard-verbal-autopsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers collected data in India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Tanzania.

IHME's work on estimating mortality has been at times controversial. In 2009, IHME published a study on maternal mortality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=MC|last2=Foreman|first2=KJ|last3=Naghavi|first3=M|last4=Ahn|first4=SY|last5=Wang|first5=M|last6=Makela|first6=SM|last7=Lozano|first7=R|last8=Lopez|first8=AD|last9=Murray|first9=CJL|title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5|journal=The Lancet|date=8  May 2010|volume=375|pages=1609–1623|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60518-1|pmid=20382417}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some advocacy groups tried to suppress – worried that results showing a decline in mortality would make it harder to fund-raise. The WHO also initially disagreed with the new results, but later revised their estimates in agreement with those of IHME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria Control Policy Assessment project===

The Malaria Control Policy Assessment project evaluates the effectiveness of malaria-control interventions in Uganda and Zambia by analyzing their effect on child mortality and producing estimates at the national and local levels.

===United States public health research===

IHME conducts US research, including estimates of mortality, life expectancy, risk factors, health disparities, and disease prevalence. IHME has compiled national and local health trends and integrated multiple data sources to monitor disparities in chronic diseases.

A 2013 report, the State of US Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of US Health: Innovations, Insights, and Recommendations from the Global Burden of Disease Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/policy-report/state-us-health-innovations-insights-and-recommendations-global-burden-disease-study|website=IHME}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at trends in premature deaths due to injury or disease, and demonstrated the major health threat stemming from behavioral risk factors such as poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. It concluded that dietary factors cause more deaths each year than cancer or smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The State of US Health, 1990-2010 Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors|journal=JAMA|date=10 July 2013|volume=310|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1710486|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.13805|pages=591–608|pmid=23842577|pmc=5436627 | last1 = Murray | first1 = CJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results included life expectancy trends broken down by state and county.

First Lady Michelle Obama cited the research in her campaign to improve Americans' diets and increase their level of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Diet Important For Increasing Years of Healthy Life, New Study Says|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/blog/2013/07/11/healthy-diet-important-increasing-years-healthy-life-new-study-says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in the journal Population Health Metrics in June 2011 showed that life expectancy was rising in some poorer US counties – especially in the South&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=SC|last2=Levin-Rector|first2=A|last3=Ezzati Murray CJL.|first3=M|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Falling behind: life expectancy in US counties from 2000 to 2007 in an international context|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=15 June 2011|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/9/1/16|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-9-16|volume=9|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a surprising result which was widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pallarito|first1=Karen|title=Life expectancy in U.S. trails top nations|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/15/life.expectancy.united.states/|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=CNN|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research projects include the Salud Mesoamérica 2015 Initiative, which focuses on inequalities in health outcomes and access in southern Mexico and Central America; Gavi Full Country Evaluations, which evaluates immunization programs in Bangladesh, India, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia; and HealthRise, a partnership with Medtronic Philanthropy to evaluate programs targeting diabetes and heart disease, and sponsor small grants to make improvements.

In 2014, IHME announced the establishment of the University of Washington Center for Demography and Economics of Aging, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). It is one of 14 NIA Demography Centers at leading universities and policy organizations around the United States.

===Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx)===

In March 2011, IHME launched the Global Health Data Exchange (or GHDx), which indexes and hosts information about microdata, aggregated data, and research results with a focus on health-related and demographic datasets. At launch, the site listed about 1,000 datasets; as of 2015, there are more than 30,000. As part of a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), GHDx includes 35 years of CDC data on child and maternal health. GHDx uses the Drupal 7 open source content management system and Apache SOLR for search. The site includes visualization and GIS tools, and has been noted by the health and global health communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dam|first1=Andrew|title=Institute launches global health data clearinghouse|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2011/04/institute-launches-global-health-data-clearinghouse/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree Programs==
IHME offers two types of global health fellowships, plus master's degrees and PhD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Programs in Health Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthdata.org/get-involved/degree-programs|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Inter-American Development Bank; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health; Medtronic Philanthropy; and the National Institute on Aging have also contributed funding through project grants and contracts.

==Reception==

Initially, some within the [[World Health Organization]] had criticized IHME for trying to do the work that WHO already does. There had also been tension between [[UNICEF]] and IHME because a report from the latter showed "lackluster progress" on child death rates.&lt;ref name="2008_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The 2010 Global Burden of Disease report was criticized for its lack of transparency of methods and data as well as its use of complex statistical methods to fill in data gaps when reliable statistics were unavailable. Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], called for more transparency. The report was also criticized for its use of [[Verbal autopsy|verbal autopsies]] because many diseases have similar symptoms, leading to potential mistakes.&lt;ref name="2013_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/verbal-autopsy |title=Verbal Autopsy (VA) |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Rudan and Kit Yee Chan argue that the emergence of IHME introduced competition to the field of global health metrics, which was previously a field where WHO maintained a monopoly: "The GBD initiative has emerged as a well-organised and rapidly growing collaboration that is now seriously challenging WHO's role in generating global health estimates".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3406781/RudanComment2013GBD.pdf |first1=Igor |last1=Rudan |first2=Kit Yee |last2=Chan |title=Global health metrics needs collaboration and competition |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62006-7 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=385 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudan and Chan also note that IHME "struggled to generate support, legitimacy, and acceptable for their findings" after publishing the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, due to concerns of lack of transparency, as well as the existence of parallel estimates of disease burden from WHO.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

The World Health Organization did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2013 expanded collaboration and increased transparency but "[fell] short of allowing full independent replication of all results".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

An '''ionic liquid''' ('''IL''') is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] in the [[liquid]] state. In some contexts, the term has been restricted to salts whose [[melting point]] is below some arbitrary temperature, such as {{convert|100|C}}. While ordinary liquids such as [[water]] and [[gasoline]] are predominantly made of [[electric charge|electrically neutral]] [[molecules]], ionic liquids are largely made of [[ion]]s and short-lived ion pairs. These substances are variously called '''liquid electrolytes''', '''ionic melts''', '''ionic fluids''', '''fused salts''', '''liquid salts''', or '''ionic glasses'''.

Ionic liquids are described as having many potential applications.  They are powerful [[solvent]]s and [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] fluids ([[electrolyte]]s).  Salts that are liquid at near-ambient temperature are important for [[electric battery]] applications, and have been considered as [[sealant]]s due to their very low [[vapor pressure]].

Any salt that melts without [[pyrolysis|decomposing]] or vaporizing usually yields an ionic liquid. [[Sodium chloride]] (NaCl), for example, melts at {{convert|801|C}} into a liquid that consists largely of [[sodium]] cations ({{chem|Na|+}}) and chloride anions ({{chem|Cl|-}}). Conversely, when an ionic liquid is cooled, it often forms an [[ionic solid]]&amp;mdash;which may be either [[crystal]]line or [[glass]]y.

The [[ionic bond]] is usually stronger than the [[Van der Waals force]]s between the molecules of ordinary liquids. For that reason, common salts tend to melt at higher temperatures than other solid molecules. Some salts are liquid at or below [[room temperature]].  Examples include compounds based on the 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) cation and include: [[1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride|EMIM:Cl]], EMIM [[dicyanamide]], ({{chem|C|2|H|5}})({{chem|CH|3}}){{chem|C|3|H|3|N|2|+}}·{{chem|N(CN)|2|-}}, that melts at {{convert|−21|C}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Low viscosity ionic liquids based on organic salts of the dicyanamide anion | author = D.

Low-temperature ionic liquids can be compared to [[ionic solution]]s, liquids that contain both ions and neutral molecules, and in particular to the so-called [[deep eutectic solvent]]s, mixtures of ionic and non-ionic solid substances which have much lower melting points than the pure compounds.  Certain mixtures of nitrate salts can have melting points below 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=4K_IAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=7588694 Mixture of nitrate salts with m.p. below 100 deg C]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ionic liquid" in the general sense was used as early as 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Viscosity of Pure Liquids. II. Polymerised Ionic Melts | journal = [[Trans. Faraday Soc.]] | volume = 39 | date = 1943 | pages = 59–67 | author = R. M. Barrer | doi = 10.1039/tf9433900059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tawny crazy ant then exudes its own venom, [[formic acid]], and self-grooms with it, an action which de-toxifies the Fire ant venom. The mixed venoms chemically react with one another to form an ionic liquid, the first naturally occurring IL to be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2014 | title = On the Formation of a Protic Ionic Liquid in Nature | url = | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 53 | issue = 44 | pages = 11762–11765 | doi = 10.1002/anie.201404402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
The discovery date of the "first" ionic liquid is disputed, along with the identity of its discoverer. [[Ethanolamine|Ethanolammonium]] nitrate (m.p.&amp;nbsp;52–55&amp;nbsp;°C) was reported in 1888 by S. Gabriel and J. Weiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ueber einige Abkömmlinge des Propylamins | journal = [[Chemische Berichte|Ber.]] | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | date = 1888 | pages = 2669–2679 | author = S. Gabriel | author2 = J. Weiner | doi = 10.1002/cber.18880210288}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest truly room temperature ionic liquids was [[ethylammonium nitrate]] ({{chem|C|2|H|5}}){{chem|NH|3|+}}·{{chem|NO|3|-}} (m.p.&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;°C), reported in 1914 by [[Paul Walden]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Walden (1914), Bull. Acad. Sci. St. Petersburg, pages 405-422.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, ionic liquids based on alkyl-substituted [[imidazolium]] and [[pyridinium]] cations, with [[halide]] or tetrahalogenoaluminate anions, were developed as potential electrolytes in batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Electrochemical scrutiny of organometallic iron complexes and hexamethylbenzene in a room temperature molten salt | author = H. L. Chum | author2 = V. R. Koch | author3 = L. L. Miller| author4 = R. A. Osteryoung | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | date = 1975 | volume = 97 | pages = 3264–3265 | doi = 10.1021/ja00844a081 | issue = 11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Dialkylimidazolium chloroaluminate melts: a new class of room-temperature ionic liquids for electrochemistry, spectroscopy and synthesis | author = J. S. Wilkes | author2 = J. A. Levisky | author3 = R. A. Wilson| author4 = C. L. Hussey | journal = [[Inorg. Chem.]] | date = 1982 | volume = 21 | pages = 1263–1264 | doi = 10.1021/ic00133a078 | issue = 3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the imidazolium halogenoaluminate salts, their physical properties&amp;mdash;such as [[viscosity]], [[melting point]], and [[acidity]]&amp;mdash;could be adjusted by changing the [[alkyl]] [[substituent]]s and the imidazolium/pyridinium and halide/halogenoaluminate ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Potentiometric investigation of dialuminium heptachloride formation in aluminum chloride-1-butylpyridinium chloride mixtures | author = R. J. Gale | author2 = R. A. Osteryoung | journal = [[Inorganic Chemistry (journal)|Inorganic Chemistry]] | date = 1979 | volume = 18 | pages = 1603–1605 | doi = 10.1021/ic50196a044 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two major drawbacks for some applications were moisture sensitivity and [[acidity]] or basicity. In 1992, Wilkes and Zawarotko obtained ionic liquids with 'neutral' [[weakly coordinating anion]]s such as [[hexafluorophosphate]] ({{chem|PF|6|-}}) and [[tetrafluoroborate]] ({{chem|BF|4|-}}), allowing a much wider range of applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilkes J. S. |author2=Zaworotko M. J. | doi = 10.1039/c39920000965 | title =  Air and water stable 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium based ionic liquids| url = | journal = Chemical Communications | year = 1992 | issue = 13| pages = 965–967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many classical IL's are hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate salts,  [[bistriflimide]] {{chem|[(CF|3|SO|2|)|2|N]|-}} are also popular.

==Characteristics==
Ionic liquids are often moderate to poor conductors of electricity, non-ionizing (e.g., non-polar), highly viscous and frequently exhibit low [[vapor pressure]]. Their other properties are diverse: many have low combustibility, are thermally stable, with wide liquid regions, and favorable [[solvation|solvating properties]] for a range of polar and non-polar compounds. Many classes of [[chemical reaction]]s, such as [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s and [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]]s, can be performed using ionic liquids as solvents. IL's can serve as solvents for [[biocatalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Cofactor-dependent enzyme catalysis in functionalized ionic solvents | author = Adam J. Walker | author2 = Neil C. Bruce | last-author-amp = yes | journal = [[Chemical Communications]] | date = 2004 | volume =  2004 | pages = 2570–1 | doi = 10.1039/b410467f | pmid = 15543284 | issue = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miscibility of ionic liquids with water or organic [[solvents]] varies with side chain lengths on the cation and with choice of [[anion]]. They can be functionalized to act as [[acid]]s, [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, or [[ligand]]s, and are precursors salts in the preparation of [[stable carbene]]s. They have recently been found to hydrolyse, affording acidic or basic media in the aqueous milieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Aqueous Brønsted-Lowry Chemistry of Ionic Liquid Ions | author = Gordon W.

[[File:Commonly used cations.png|thumb|Cations commonly found in ionic liquids.]]

Despite their extremely low vapor pressures (≈10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; Pa at 25˚C), some ionic liquids can be [[distill]]ed under vacuum conditions at temperatures near 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The distillation and volatility of ionic liquids | author = Martyn J.

The solubility of different species in imidazolium ionic liquids depends mainly on polarity and hydrogen bonding ability. Saturated [[aliphatic]] compounds are generally only sparingly [[soluble]] in ionic liquids, whereas [[olefin]]s show somewhat greater solubility, and [[aldehyde]]s can be completely miscible. This can be exploited in biphasic catalysis, such as [[hydrogenation]] and [[hydrocarbonylation]] processes, allowing for relatively easy separation of products and/or unreacted substrate(s). Gas solubility follows the same trend, with [[carbon dioxide]] gas showing exceptional solubility in many ionic liquids. [[Carbon monoxide]] is less soluble in ionic liquids than in many popular organic solvents, and hydrogen is only slightly soluble (similar to the solubility in water) and may vary relatively little between the more common ionic liquids. Different analytical techniques have yielded somewhat different absolute solubility values.

==Room temperature varieties==

Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) consist of bulky and asymmetric organic [[cations]] such as 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-alkylpyridinium, ''N''-methyl-''N''-alkylpyrrolidinium and [[ammonium]] ions.

There are also many potential uses of ionic liquids with simple non-halogenated organic anions such as [[formate]], alkylsulfate, alkylphosphate or [[glycolate]]. The melting point of 1-butyl-3-methyl[[imidazolium]] [[tetrafluoroborate]] is about {{convert|−80|C}} and it is a colorless liquid with high [[viscosity]] at room temperature. If a highly asymmetric cation is combined with a highly asymmetric anion, formed ionic liquid may not freeze down to very low temperatures (down to −150&amp;nbsp;°C) and the glass transition temperature was detected below −100&amp;nbsp;°C in the case of ionic liquids with N-methyl-N-alkylpyrrolidinium cations and fluorosulfonyl-trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (FTFSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reiter|first=Jakub|title=Fluorosulfonyl-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ionic liquids with enhanced asymmetry|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|date=2 Sep 2012|volume=15|pages=2565–2571|doi=10.1039/c2cp43066e|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/cp/c2cp43066e|accessdate=2012-12-12|bibcode = 2013PCCP...15.2565R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is a common impurity in ionic liquids as it can be absorbed from the atmosphere and influences the transport properties of RTILs, even at relatively low concentrations.

In many synthetic processes using transition metal catalysts, metal nanoparticles play an important role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Applications of Functionalized Ionic Liquids | author = X. Li | author2 =  D.

==Low temperature varieties==
Low temperature ionic liquids (below 130&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin|K]]) have been proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter [[liquid mirror telescopes|spinning liquid mirror]] telescope to be based on the Earth's moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = E.

Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms the reflective surface. Low volatility is important in lunar vacuum conditions to prevent evaporation.

==Poly(ionic liquid)s==
Polymerized ionic liquids, poly(ionic liquid)s or polymeric ionic liquids, all abbreviated as PIL is the polymeric form of ionic liquids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = A. Eftekhari | author2 = O. Seddiki | title = Synthesis and Properties of Polymerized Ionic Liquids | date = 2017 | journal = European Polymer Journal | volume = 90 | pages = 245–272 | doi = 10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2017.03.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have half of the ionicity of ionic liquids since one ion is fixed as the polymer moiety to form a polymeric chain. PILs have a similar range of applications, comparable with those of ionic liquids but the polymer architecture provides a better chance for controlling the ionic conductivity. They have extended the applications of ionic liquids for designing smart materials or solid electrolytes. 

== Magnetic ionic liquids ==
Magnetic ionic liquids can be synthesized by incorporating [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] elements into ionic liquid molecules. One example is [[1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate]].

==Commercial applications==
A liquid tetraalkyl[[phosphonium]] iodide is a solvent for tributyltin iodide, which functions as a catalyst to rearrange the monoepoxide of [[butadiene]].  This process was commercialized as a route to [[2,5-Dihydrofuran|2,5-dihydrofuran]], but later discontinued&lt;ref&gt;G. Wytze Meindersma, Matthias Maase and André B. Haan "Ionic Liquids" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2007, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.l14_l01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential applications==

===Gas handling===
ILs have been considered for a variety of industrial applications.  Their properties of low vapor pressure, thermal stability, and solvation for a wide variety of compounds and gases make them attractive in gas storage and handling applications. [[Air Products]] uses ILs instead of pressurized cylinders as a transport medium for reactive gases such as [[trifluoroborane]], [[phosphine]] and [[arsine]]. The gases are dissolved in the liquids at or below atmospheric pressure and are easily withdrawn from the containers by applying a vacuum.  Gas manufacturer [[The Linde Group|Linde]] exploits the low solubility of [[hydrogen]] in ILs to compress the gas up to 450 bar in [[hydrogen station|filling stations]] by using an [[ionic liquid piston compressor]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The IL [[1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride]] has been investigated for separating hydrogen from [[ammonia borane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Material Matters |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/etc/medialib/docs/Aldrich/Brochure/al_material_matters_v2n2.pdf |format=PDF |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=2007 |pages=6–9 |title=Recent Developments on Hydrogen Release from Ammonia Borane |author=A.

ILs and [[amine]]s have been investigated for capturing [[carbon dioxide]] {{chem|CO|2}} and [[gas sweetening|purifying natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/cen/87/i28/toc/toc_i28.html C&amp;E News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barghi S.H. |author2=Adibi M. |author3=Rashtchian D. | year = 2010 | title = An experimental study on permeability, diffusivity, and selectivity of CO2 and CH4 through &amp;#91;bmim&amp;#93;&amp;#91;PF6&amp;#93; ionic liquid supported on an alumina membrane: Investigation of temperature fluctuations effects | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738810005144 | journal = Journal of Membrane Science | volume = 362 | issue = | pages = 346–352 | doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2010.06.047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mota-Martinez M.

===Coal processing===
ILs, especially imidazolium-based ILs have been found effective in pretreatment of coal before use in applications such as pyrolysis and gasification. Pretreatment with ionic liquids causes 'swelling' of the coal structure, allowing better gasification.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Pharmaceuticals===
Recognizing that approximately 50% of commercial pharmaceuticals are organic salts, ionic liquid forms of a number of pharmaceuticals have been investigated.  Combining a pharmaceutically active cation with a pharmaceutically active anion leads to a Dual Active ionic liquid in which the actions of two drugs are combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Crystalline vs. Ionic Liquid Salt Forms of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: A Position Paper | author =  J.

ILs can extract specific compounds from plants for pharmaceutical, nutritional and cosmetic applications, such as the [[antimalarial]] drug [[artemisinin]] from the plant ''[[Artemisia annua]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Natural Products| url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/np060375j | volume = 69 | date = 2006 | pages = 1653–1664 | title = Comparative assessment of technologies for extraction of artemisinin| author = A.Lapkin| author2 = P.K.

===Cellulose processing===
The dissolution of [[cellulose]] by ILs has attracted interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Dissolution of Cellose with Ionic Liquids | author =  Richard P. Swatloski | author2 =  Scott K. Spear | author3 =  John D. Holbrey | author4 =  Robin D.

The dissolution of cellulose&amp;ndash;based materials like [[tissue paper]] waste, generated in chemical industries and at research laboratories, in room temperature IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, bmimCl and the recovery of valuable compounds by [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]] from this cellulose matrix was studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Electrochimica Acta]] | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | date = 2007 | pages = 1911–1919 | title = Treatment of tissue paper containing radioactive waste and electrochemical recovery of valuables using ionic liquids | author = Ch.

Representative products are glucose esters, [[sorbitol]], and alkylgycosides.&lt;ref name="Synthesis of glucose esters from cellulose in ionic liquids"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatyev|first=Igor|author2=Charlie Van Doorslaer |author3=Pascal G.N.

===Nuclear fuel reprocessing===
The IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride has been investigated as a non-aqueous electrolyte media for the recovery of [[uranium]] and other metals from spent [[nuclear fuel]] and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;P.

===Solar thermal energy===
ILs are potential heat transfer and storage media in [[solar thermal energy]] systems. Concentrating solar thermal facilities such as [[parabolic trough]]s and [[solar power tower]]s focus the sun's energy onto a receiver which can generate temperatures of around {{convert|600|C}}. This heat can then generate electricity in a steam or other cycle. For buffering during cloudy periods or to enable generation overnight, energy can be stored by heating an intermediate fluid. Although nitrate salts have been the medium of choice since the early 1980s, they freeze at {{convert|220|C}} and thus require heating to prevent solidification. Ionic liquids such as [[C4mim|{{chem|C|4|mim}}]][{{chem|BF|4}}] have more favorable liquid-phase temperature ranges (-75 to 459&amp;nbsp;°C) and could therefore be excellent liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[International Solar Energy Conference]] | date = 2001 | pages = 445–451 | title = Novel ionic liquid thermal storage for solar thermal electric power systems | author = Banqui Wu | author2 = Ramana G. Reddy | author3 = Robin D. Rogers | last-author-amp = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste recycling===
ILs can aid the recycling of synthetic goods, plastics, and metals.  They offer the specificity required to separate similar compounds from each other, such as separating [[polymer]]s in [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] streams. This has been achieved using lower temperature extraction processes than current approaches&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioniqs.com/applications_plastics.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312011018/http://www.bioniqs.com/applications_plastics.php|date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could help avoid incinerating plastics or dumping them in landfill.

===Batteries===
ILs can replace water as the electrolyte in [[Metal–air electrochemical cell|metal-air batteries]]. ILs are attractive because of their low vapor pressure, increasing battery life by drying more slowly. Furthermore, ILs have an [[electrochemical window]] of up to six volts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ionic-liquid materials for the electrochemical challenges of the future| author = Michel Armand| author2 = Frank Endres| author3 = Douglas R. MacFarlane| author4 = Hiroyuki Ohno| author5 =  Bruno Scrosati| last-author-amp = yes| journal = [[Nature Materials]] | date = 2009 | volume = 8  | pages = 621–629 | doi = 10.1038/nmat2448|url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v8/n8/full/nmat2448.html | pmid = 19629083 | issue = 8|bibcode = 2009NatMa...8..621A }}&lt;/ref&gt; (versus 1.23 for water) supporting more energy-dense metals. Energy densities from 900-1600 watt-hours per kilogram appear possible.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispersing agent===
ILs can act as [[dispersing agent]]s in [[paint]]s to enhance finish, appearance and drying properties.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are the TEGO brand dispersers by [[Evonik]], used in their Pliolite brand paints.&lt;/ref&gt; ILs are used for dispersing [[nanomaterial]]s at IOLITEC.

===Carbon capture===
{{Main article|Ionic liquids in carbon capture}}
Ionic liquids have been proposed as an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] in [[carbon capture]]. They have various advantages over traditional absorbents, such as the currently dominant amine-based technologies. [[1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate]] is one example of a proposed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbent.

=== Tribology ===
Some ionic liquids have been shown to reduce friction and wear in basic [[Tribology|tribological]] testing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bermúdez|first=María-Dolores|last2=Jiménez|first2=Ana-Eva|last3=Sanes|first3=José|last4=Carrión|first4=Francisco-José|date=2009-08-04|title=Ionic Liquids as Advanced Lubricant Fluids|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/8/2888|journal=Molecules|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=2888–2908|doi=10.3390/molecules14082888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minami|first=Ichiro|date=2009-06-24|title=Ionic Liquids in Tribology|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/6/2286|journal=Molecules|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=2286–2305|doi=10.3390/molecules14062286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somers|first=Anthony E.|last2=Howlett|first2=Patrick C.|last3=MacFarlane|first3=Douglas R.|last4=Forsyth|first4=Maria|date=2013-01-21|title=A Review of Ionic Liquid Lubricants|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-4442/1/1/3|journal=Lubricants|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.3390/lubricants1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Feng|last2=Liang|first2=Yongmin|last3=Liu|first3=Weimin|date=2009-08-19|title=Ionic liquid lubricants: designed chemistry for engineering applications|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=b817899m|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|language=en|volume=38|issue=9|doi=10.1039/b817899m|issn=1460-4744}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their polar nature makes them candidate [[Lubricant|lubricants]] for [[Tribotronics|tribotronic]] applications. While the comparatively high cost of ionic liquids currently prevents their use as neat lubricants, adding ionic liquids in concentrations as low as 0.5 wt% may significantly alter the lubricating performance of conventional base oils. Thus, the current focus of research is on using ionic liquids as additives to lubricating oils, often with the motivation to replace widely used, ecologically harmful [[Oil additive|lubricant additives]]. However, the claimed ecological advantage of ionic liquids has been questioned repeatedly and is yet to be demonstrated from a [[Life-cycle assessment|lifecycle]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petkovic|first=Marija|last2=Seddon|first2=Kenneth R.|last3=Rebelo|first3=Luís Paulo N.|last4=Pereira|first4=Cristina Silva|date=2011-02-22|title=Ionic liquids: a pathway to environmental acceptability|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C004968A|journal=Chem.

==Safety==
Ionic liquids'  low volatility effectively eliminates a major pathway for environmental release and contamination. However, this property is distinct from toxicity. Ionic liquids' aquatic toxicity is as severe as or more so than many current solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Acute toxicity of ionic liquids to the zebrafish (Danio rerio) | author = C Pretti | author2 = C Chiappe | author3 = D Pieraccini| author4 = M Gregori | author5 = F Abramo| author6 = G Monni | author7 = L Intorre | last-author-amp = yes | journal = [[Green Chem.]] | date = 2006 | volume = 8  | pages = 238–240 | doi = 10.1039/b511554j | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D.

Balancing [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]] reductions against waterway spills (via waste ponds/streams, etc.) requires further research. Ionic liquids' substituent diversity simplifies the process of identifying compounds that meet safety requirements.

[[Ultrasound]] can degrade solutions of imidazolium-based ionic liquids with [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[acetic acid]] to relatively innocuous compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Ultrasonic chemical oxidative degradations of 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids and their mechanistic elucidations | author = Xuehui Li | author2 = Jinggan Zhao | author3 = Qianhe Li| author4 = Lefu Wang | author5 = Shik Chi Tsang | last-author-amp = yes | journal = [[Dalton Trans.]] | date = 2007 | doi = 10.1039/b618384k| page = 1875| issue = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite low [[vapor pressure]] many ionic liquids are [[combustion|combustible]] and therefore require careful handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Combustible ionic liquids by design: is laboratory safety another ionic liquid myth? | display-authors =  7 | author =  Marcin Smiglak | author2 =  W.

'''''Journey to the Center of the Earth''''' (shortened as '''JCOE''') is an [[Action game]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] based on the movie: [[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 Hollywood film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D]] and is developed by American studio Human Soft and published by [[THQ]].&lt;ref name="1up's preview of Journey to the Center of the Earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/search?st=Journey+to+the+Center+of+the+Earth|title=1up's preview of Journey to the Center of the Earth|publisher=1up|accessdate=2008-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522142929/http://www.1up.com/do/search?st=Journey+to+the+Center+of+the+Earth|archivedate=2011-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN's preview of Journey to the Center of the Earth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/objects/142/14246945.html|title=IGN's look at Journey to the Center of the Earth |publisher=IGN|pages=One|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journey to the Center of the Earth'' will allow the player to play as the three [[main characters]] of the movie: Trevor, Sean and Hannah as they journey to and through the center of the earth.&lt;ref name="IGN's preview of Journey to the Center of the Earth"/&gt; In the game the player will navigate their way through the center of the [[Earth]] in an attempt to escape.

== Gameplay ==

== Reception ==
{{Video game reviews
| IGN = 3.5&lt;ref name="IGN's review of Journey to the Center of the Earth"/&gt;
}}
[[IGN]] simply noted that "it's [the game] freaking terrible, and there's not even a console version to go play instead." IGN mainly criticized the game because there was only a version to play for the Nintendo DS and not on another platform. IGN also criticized the recordings of the game, saying that "The [[voice acting]] and [[sound effects]] for Center of the Earth are so horrendously bad that they literally made me [[LOL]]."&lt;ref name="IGN's review of Journey to the Center of the Earth"/&gt;

The '''koala''' (''Phascolarctos cinereus'', or, inaccurately, '''koala bear'''{{efn|''Koala bear'' is a common term outside of Australia, though koalas are [[marsupial]]s, not [[bear]]s.}}) is an [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[marsupial]] native to [[Australia]]. It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] representative of the family [[Phascolarctidae]] and its closest living relatives are the [[wombat]]s, which comprise the family Vombatidae.&lt;ref name=msw3_b&gt;{{MSW3 Diprotodontia | id = 11000002 | pages = 43-44 | heading = Suborder Vombatiformes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[South Australia]]. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of {{convert|60|–|85|cm|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|4|–|15|kg|0|abbr=on}}. [[Pelage]] colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate [[subspecies]], but this is disputed.

Koalas typically inhabit open [[eucalypt]] woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely [[Sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and [[maternal bond|bonding]] exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males [[animal communication|communicate]] with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from [[scent gland]]s located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' [[pouch (marsupial)|pouches]], where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as [[Marsupial#Early development|joeys]], are fully [[weaning|weaned]] around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various [[pathogen]]s, such as [[Chlamydiaceae]] bacteria and the [[koala retrovirus]], as well as by [[bushfire]]s and droughts.

Koalas were hunted by [[Indigenous Australians]] and depicted in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|myths]] and [[cave art]] for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist [[George Perry (naturalist)|George Perry]]. Botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] wrote the first detailed scientific [[species description|description]] of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist [[John Gould]] illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a [[National symbols of Australia|symbol of Australia]]. Koalas are listed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable.&lt;ref name=envirogov&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/koala |title=Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) Listing |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Department of the Environment and Energy |publisher=Australian Government |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale [[culling]]s in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. [[Animal sanctuary|Sanctuaries]] were established, and [[species translocation|translocation]] efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is [[habitat destruction]] caused by agriculture and [[urbanisation]].

==Etymology==
The word koala comes from the [[Sydney Language|Dharug]] ''gula''. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the [[English orthography]] as "oo" (in spellings such as ''coola'' or ''koolah''), it was changed to "oa", possibly in error.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite book |first=R. M. W. |last=Dixon |first2=B. |last2=Moore |first3=W. S. |last3=Ramson |first4=M. |last4=Thomas |year=2006 |title=Australian Aboriginal Words in English: Their Origin and Meaning |edition=2nd |page=65|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-554073-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the koala's supposed resemblance to a [[bear]], it was often miscalled the koala bear, particularly by early settlers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leitner, G. |author2=Sieloff, I. |year=1998 |title=Aboriginal words and concepts in Australian English |journal=World Englishes |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=153–69|doi=10.1111/1467-971X.00089}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genus|generic]] name, ''[[Phascolarctos]]'', is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''phaskolos'' "pouch" and ''arktos'' "bear". The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''cinereus'', is [[Latin]] for "ash coloured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Latin Gem Dictionary |first=D.

The koala was given its generic name ''Phascolarctos'' in 1816 by French zoologist [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Blainville, H. |title=Prodrome d'une nouvelle distribution systématique du règne animal |journal=Bulletin de la Société Philomáthique, Paris |year=1816 |volume=8 |pages=105–24 |language=French |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4439803}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would not give it a specific name until further review. In 1819, German zoologist [[Georg August Goldfuss]] gave it the [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] ''Lipurus cinereus''. Because ''Phascolarctos'' was published first, according to the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], it has [[Principle of Priority|priority]] as the official name of the genus.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; French naturalist [[Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest]] proposed the name ''Phascolartos fuscus'' in 1820, suggesting that the brown-coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones. Other names suggested by European authors included ''Marodactylus cinereus'' by Goldfuss in 1820, ''P.&amp;nbsp;flindersii'' by [[René Primevère Lesson]] in 1827, and ''P.&amp;nbsp;koala'' by [[John Edward Gray]] in 1827.&lt;ref name="Moyal p.45"&gt;Moyal, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA45 45].&lt;/ref&gt;

The koala is classified with [[wombat]]s (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including [[Palorchestes|marsupial tapirs]], [[Thylacoleonidae|marsupial lions]] and [[Diprotodontidae|giant wombats]]) in the suborder [[Vombatiformes]] within the order [[Diprotodontia]].&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite book|author=Long, J.

===Genetics and variations===
Traditionally, three distinct [[subspecies]] have been recognised: the [[Queensland]] koala (''P.&amp;nbsp;c. adustus'', [[Oldfield Thomas|Thomas]] 1923), the [[New South Wales]] koala (''P.&amp;nbsp;c.&amp;nbsp;cinereus'', Goldfuss 1817), and the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] koala (''P.&amp;nbsp;c.&amp;nbsp;victor'', [[Ellis Le Geyt Troughton|Troughton]] 1935). These forms are distinguished by [[pelage]] colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull.&lt;ref name=Martin7&gt;Martin and Handasyde, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houlden 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Houlden, B.

The koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt diet, which is of low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in [[dietary fibre]].&lt;ref name=Jackson76/&gt; The animal's [[dentition]] consists of the incisors and [[cheek teeth]] (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] before being passed to the highly [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusped]] molars, where they are shredded into small pieces.&lt;ref name=Martin46/&gt; Koalas may also store food in their [[cheek pouch]]es before it is ready to be chewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lee, A.

Unlike kangaroos and eucalyptus-eating possums, koalas are [[Hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]], and their digestive retention can last for up to 100 hours in the wild, or up to 200 hours in captivity.&lt;ref name=Martin46/&gt; This is made possible by the extraordinary length of their [[caecum]]—{{convert|200|cm|in|-1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter—the largest proportionally of any animal.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  Koalas can select which food particles to retain for longer fermentation and which to pass through. Large particles typically pass through more quickly, as they would take more time to digest.&lt;ref name=Martin46&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 46–49.&lt;/ref&gt; While the hindgut is proportionally larger in the koala than in other herbivores, only 10% of the animal's energy is obtained from fermentation. Since the koala gains a low amount of energy from its diet, its [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] is half that of a typical mammal,&lt;ref name=Jackson76&gt;Jackson, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; although this can vary between seasons and sexes.&lt;ref name=Martin46/&gt; The koala conserves water by passing relatively dry faecal pellets high in undigested fibre, and by storing water in the caecum.&lt;ref name="Tyndale-Biscoe p. 231"/&gt;

The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without ''panting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Koalas hug trees to keep cool|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/06/koalas-hug-trees-to-keep-cool|accessdate=18 November 2014|website=[[Australian Geographic]]|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27684863|title=Koalas hug trees to lose heat|first=Victoria|last=Gill|date=4 June 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs dangling.&lt;ref name=Jackson93/&gt; During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy.&lt;ref name=Martin39/&gt; On windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest.

Koalas are asocial animals and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours. In Victoria, [[home range]]s are small and have extensive overlap, while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less.&lt;ref name=Jackson98&gt;Jackson, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Koala society appears to consist of "residents" and "transients", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and [[Dominance (ethology)|dominate]] others with their larger body size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ellis, W.

These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats.&lt;ref name=vocal/&gt; Young koalas squeak when in distress. As they get older, the squeak develops into a "squawk" produced both when in distress and to show aggression. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low grunt with its mouth closed. Koalas make numerous facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward. During screams, the lips retract and the ears are drawn back. Females bring their lips forward and raise their ears when agitated.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 102–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agonistic behaviour]] typically consists of squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other.&lt;ref name="aggression"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, M.|year=1980|title=Behaviour of the Koala, ''Phascolarctos cinereus'' (Goldfuss), in captivity VI*. Aggression|journal=Australian Wildlife Research|volume=7|issue=2|pages=177–90|doi=10.1071/WR9800177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme situations, a male may try to displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or to move to the end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnant and [[lactation|lactating]] females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close.&lt;ref name=aggression/&gt; In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Moyal p.191"/&gt;

===Reproduction and development===
[[File:Koala and joey.jpg|thumb|left|Mother with joey on back]]
Koalas are seasonal breeders, and births take place from the middle of spring through the summer to early autumn, from October to May. Females in [[oestrus]] tend to hold their heads further back than usual and commonly display [[tremor]]s and [[spasm]]s. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to assess which is dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA192 192].&lt;/ref&gt;

The koala's  [[gestation]] period lasts 33–35 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gifford, A. |author2=Fry, G. |author3=Houlden, B. A. |author4=Fletcher, T. P. |author5=Deane, E. M. |title=Gestational length in the koala, ''Phascolarctos cinereus'' |journal=Animal Reproduction Science |year=2002 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=261–66 |doi=10.1016/S0378-4320(02)00010-6 |pmid=11943495}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a female gives birth to a single [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]  (although twins occur on occasion). As with all marsupials, the young are born while at the [[embryo|embryonic stage]], weighing only {{convert|0.5|g|2|abbr=on}}. However, they have relatively well-developed lips, forelimbs, and shoulders, as well as functioning [[respiratory system|respiratory]], [[digestion|digestive]], and [[urinary system]]s. The joey crawls into its mother's pouch to continue the rest of its development.&lt;ref name="Martin and Handasyde 60 61"&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other marsupials, the koala does not clean her pouch.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

A female koala has two teats; the joey attaches itself to one of them and suckles for the rest of its pouch life.&lt;ref name="Martin and Handasyde 60 61"/&gt; The koala has one of the lowest milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mammal. The female makes up for this by [[lactation|lactating]] for as long as 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; At seven weeks of age, the joey's head grows longer and becomes proportionally large, [[Biological pigment|pigmentation]] begins to develop, and its sex can be determined (the [[scrotum]] appears in males and the pouch begins to develop in females). At 13 weeks, the joey weighs around {{convert|50|g|abbr=on}} and its head has doubled in size. The eyes begin to open and fine fur grows on the forehead, [[nape]], shoulders, and arms. At 26 weeks, the fully furred animal resembles an adult, and begins to poke its head out of the pouch.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the young koala approaches six months, the mother begins to prepare it for its eucalyptus diet by predigesting the leaves, producing a faecal pap that the joey eats from her [[cloaca|cloacum]]. The pap is quite different in composition from regular faeces, resembling instead the contents of the caecum, which has a high concentration of bacteria. Eaten for about a month, the pap provides a supplementary source of protein at a transition time from a milk to a leaf diet.&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale-Biscoe, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KqtlPZJ9y8EC&amp;pg=PA235 235].&lt;/ref&gt; The joey fully emerges from the pouch for the first time at six or seven months of age, when it weighs {{convert|300|–|500|g|abbr=on}}. It explores its new surroundings cautiously, clinging to its mother for support. By nine months, it weighs over {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} and develops its adult fur colour. Having permanently left the pouch, it rides on its mother's back for transportation, learning to climb by grasping branches.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, it spends more time away from its mother, and at 12 months it is fully weaned, weighing around {{convert|2.5|kg|abbr=on}}. When the mother becomes pregnant again, her bond with her previous offspring is permanently severed. Newly weaned young are encouraged to disperse by their mothers' aggressive behaviour towards them.&lt;ref name="M&amp;H pp.66-69"/&gt;
[[File:Koala Foetus Almost At Birth.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A young joey, preserved at Port Macquarie Koala Hospital]]
Females become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at about three years of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison, males reach sexual maturity when they are about four years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis, W.  A. H. |author2=Bercovitch, F. B. |title=Body size and sexual selection in the koala |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |year=2011 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1229–35 |doi=10.1007/s00265-010-1136-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they can produce sperm as early as two years.&lt;ref name="M&amp;H pp.66-69"&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual maturity.&lt;ref name="Tobey 2009"/&gt; Because the offspring have a long dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale-Biscoe, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and mortality===
Koalas may live from 13 to 18 years in the wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more hazardous lives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males.&lt;ref name=Martin71/&gt; Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lanyon, J. M. |author2=Sanson, G. D. |year=1986|title=Koala (''Phascolarctos cinereus'') dentition and nutrition. II. Implications of tooth wear in nutrition|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=209|issue=2|pages=169–81|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koalas have few predators; [[dingo]]s and large [[Pythonidae|pythons]] may prey on them, while [[birds of prey]] (such as [[powerful owl]]s and [[wedge-tailed eagle]]s) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external [[parasite]]s, other than [[tick]]s in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer [[mange]] from the [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulcers]] from the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium ulcerans]]'', but neither is common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless.&lt;ref name=Martin71/&gt; These include the [[tapeworm]] ''[[Bertiella obesa]]'', commonly found in the intestine, and the [[nematode]]s ''[[Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus]]'' and ''[[Durikainema phascolarcti]]'', which are infrequently found in the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spratt, D.

Koalas can be subject to [[pathogen]]s such as [[Chlamydiaceae]] bacteria,&lt;ref name=Martin71&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 71–75.&lt;/ref&gt; which can cause [[keratoconjunctivitis]], [[urinary tract infection]], and [[reproductive tract infection]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[koala retrovirus]] (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) which is similar to [[AIDS]] in humans. [[Disease prevalence|Prevalence]] of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stoye, J. P. |title=Koala retrovirus: A genome invasion in real time |journal=Genome Biology |volume=7 |pages=241 |year=2006 |doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-11-241 |pmid=17118218 |issue=11 |pmc=1794577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animals are vulnerable to [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]] due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt trees.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handsyde, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches, where it is vulnerable to intense heat and flames. Bushfires also fragment the animal's habitat, which restricts their movement and leads to population decline and loss of genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA209 209–11].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dehydration]] and overheating can also prove fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the koala is vulnerable to the [[Effects of climate change in Australia|effects of climate change]]. [[Global climate model|Models]] of [[climate change in Australia]] predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala's range will shrink in the east and south to more [[mesic habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adams-Hosking, C. |author2=Grantham, H.

For example, a severe [[1979–83 Eastern Australian drought#1980|drought in 1980]] caused many ''Eucalyptus'' trees to lose their leaves. Subsequently, 63% of the population in southwestern Queensland died, especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites by older, dominant koalas, and recovery of the population was slow.&lt;ref name="Tyndale-Biscoe p. 234"/&gt; Later, this population declined from an estimated mean population of 59,000 in 1995 to 11,600 in 2009, a reduction attributed largely to hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts in most years between [[2000s Australian drought|2002 and 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seabrook, L. |author2=McAlpine, C. |author3=Baxter, G. |author4=Rhodes, J. |author5=Bradley, A. |author6=Lunney, D. |title=Drought-driven change in wildlife distribution and numbers: A case study of koalas in south west Queensland |journal=Wildlife Research |year=2011 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=509–24 |doi=10.1071/WR11064}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another predicted negative outcome of climate change is the effect of elevations in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric {{CO2}} levels]] on the koala's food supply: increases in {{CO2}} cause ''Eucalyptus'' trees to reduce protein and increase [[tannin]] concentrations in their leaves, reducing the quality of the food source.&lt;ref name="Foden 2009"&gt;{{cite report |author1=Foden, W. |author2=Stuart, S.

===History===
[[File:Koalo.jpg|thumb|upright|George Perry's illustration in his 1810 ''Arcana'' was the first published image of the koala.]]
The first written reference of the koala was recorded by John Price, servant of [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. Price encountered the "cullawine" on 26 January 1798, during an expedition to the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, B. |title=Koalas: The Little Australians We'd All Hate to Lose |year=1996 |publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service |page=13 |isbn=978-0-644-09697-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his account was not published until nearly a century later in ''[[Historical Records of Australia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA8 8].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, French-born explorer [[Francis Louis Barrallier]] encountered the animal when his two Aboriginal guides, returning from a hunt, brought back two koala feet they were intending to eat. Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes to Hunter's successor, [[Philip Gidley King]], who forwarded them to [[Joseph Banks]]. Similar to Price, Barrallier's notes were not published until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA9 9–10].&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of the first capture of a live "koolah" appeared in ''[[Sydney Gazette|The Sydney Gazette]]'' in August 1803.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sydney Gazette'', 21 August 1803, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a few weeks Flinders' astronomer, [[James Inman]], purchased a specimen pair for live shipment to [[Joseph Banks]] in England. They were described as 'somewhat larger than the Waumbut ([[Wombat]])'. These encounters helped provide the impetus for King to commission the artist [[John Lewin]] to paint watercolours of the animal. Lewin painted three pictures, one of which was subsequently made into a [[printmaking|print]] that was reproduced in [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''The Animal Kingdom'' (first published in 1827) and several European works on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA12 12–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] was the first to write a detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now [[Mount Kembla]] in the [[Illawarra]] region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator [[Ferdinand Bauer]] drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown's work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum (Natural History)]] in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's koala watercolours were not published until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA16 16–28].&lt;/ref&gt; British surgeon [[Everard Home]] included details of the koala based on eyewitness accounts of [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]], who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QGT47L1cbLIC&amp;pg=PA33 33–36].&lt;/ref&gt; Home, who in 1808 published his report in the journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Home, E. |title=An account of some peculiarities in the anatomical structure of the wombat, with observations on the female organs of generation |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1808 |volume=98 |pages=304–12 |url=https://archive.org/stream/philtrans02276790/02276790#page/n0/mode/2up |doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the animal the scientific name ''Didelphis coola''.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published image of the koala appeared in [[George Perry (naturalist)|George Perry's]] (1810) natural history work ''Arcana''.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perry called it the "New Holland Sloth" on account of its perceived similarities to the Central and South American tree-living mammals of genus ''[[Bradypus]]''. His disdain for the koala, evident in his description of the animal, was typical of the prevailing early 19th-century British attitude about the primitiveness and oddity of Australian fauna:&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the eye is placed like that of the Sloth, very close to the mouth and nose, which gives it a clumsy awkward appearance, and void of elegance in the combination&amp;nbsp;... they have little either in their character or appearance to interest the Naturalist or Philosopher. As Nature however provides nothing in vain, we may suppose that even these torpid, senseless creatures are wisely intended to fill up one of the great links of the chain of animated nature&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Perry, G. |title=Koalo, or New Holland Sloth |journal=Arcana; or the Museum of Natural History |page=109 |url=https://archive.org/stream/arcanaormuseumof00perr#page/n109/mode/2up|publisher=London : Printed by George Smeeton for James Stratford |year=1811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Phascolarctus cinereus 2 Gould.jpg|thumb|upright|Natural history illustrator John Gould popularised the koala with his 1863 work ''The Mammals of Australia''.]]

Naturalist and popular artist [[John Gould]] illustrated and described the koala in his three-volume work ''[[The Mammals of Australia]]'' (1845–63) and introduced the species, as well as other members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 87–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative anatomist [[Richard Owen]], in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the [[Zoological Society of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Owen, R. |title=Richard Owen, esq., in the chair |journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London |year=1836 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=109–13 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30570836 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1836.tb01376.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; English naturalist [[George Robert Waterhouse]], curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives ''[[Diprotodon]]'' and ''[[Nototherium]]'', which had been discovered just a few years before.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Gerard Krefft]], curator of the [[Australian Museum]] in Sydney, noted [[evolution]]ary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 ''The Mammals of Australia''.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 103–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first living koala in Britain arrived in 1881, purchased by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, [[William Alexander Forbes]], the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a [[washstand]] fell on it and it was unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal pp. 105–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish [[Embryology|embryologist]] [[William Hay Caldwell|William Caldwell]]—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the [[platypus]]—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caldwell, H. |title=On the arrangement of the embryonic membranes in marsupial mammals |journal=Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science |year=1884 |volume=s2–24 |issue=96 |pages=655–58 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s2-24/96/655.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used the new information to convincingly place the koala and the [[monotreme]]s into an evolutionary time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], visited the [[Koala Park Sanctuary]] in [[Sydney]] in 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17133871 |title=At Koala Park |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 – 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=28 November 1934 |accessdate=14 May 2013 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "intensely interested in the bears". His photograph, with [[Noel Burnet]], the founder of the park, and a koala, appeared in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. After [[World War II]], when [[Tourism in Australia|tourism to Australia]] increased and the animals were exported to zoos overseas, the koala's international popularity rose. Several political leaders and members of royal families had their pictures taken with koalas, including [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Harry]], [[Crown Prince Naruhito]], [[Crown Princess Masako]], [[Pope John Paul II]], US President [[Bill Clinton]], Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], South African President [[Nelson Mandela]],&lt;ref name=Jackson155/&gt; Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], and Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.cbc.ca/1.2838468.1416272810!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/world-leaders-meet-a-koala.jpg |title=world-leaders-meet-a-koala.jpg 620×349 pixels |newspaper=I.cbc.ca |date=  |accessdate= 25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The koala is well known worldwide and is a major draw for Australian zoos and wildlife parks.  It has been featured in advertisements, games, cartoons, and as soft toys.&lt;ref name=Jacksonintro&gt;Jackson, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; It benefited the national tourism industry by over an estimated billion Australian dollars in 1998, a figure that has since grown.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, half of visitors to Australia, especially those from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, sought out zoos and wildlife parks; about 75% of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala at the top of their list of animals to see.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; According to biologist Stephen Jackson: "If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most closely associated with Australia, it's a fair bet that the koala would come out marginally in front of the kangaroo".&lt;ref name=Jacksonintro/&gt; Factors that contribute to the koala's enduring popularity include its child-like body proportions and [[Teddy bear|teddy bear-like]] face.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The koala is featured in the [[Dreamtime]] stories and [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|mythology]] of indigenous Australians. The [[Tharawal people]] believed that the animal helped row the boat that brought them to the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people from other parts of the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a [[game (food)|game animal]] and the length of its intestines.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. [[Bidjara language|Bidjara]]-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The animal is also depicted in [[Petroglyph|rock carvings]], though not as much as some other species.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European settlers in Australia considered the koala to be a prowling [[sloth]]-like animal with a "fierce and menacing look".&lt;ref name="Jackson pp.142-22"/&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century, the koala's reputation took a more positive turn, largely due to its growing popularity and depiction in several widely circulated children's stories.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; It is featured in [[Ethel Pedley]]'s 1899 book ''[[Dot and the Kangaroo]]'', in which it is portrayed as the "funny native bear".&lt;ref name="Jackson pp.142-22"&gt;Jackson, pp. 142–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Norman Lindsay]] depicted a more [[anthropomorphic]] koala in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' cartoons, starting in 1904. This character also appeared as Bunyip Bluegum in Lindsay's 1918 book ''[[The Magic Pudding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous fictional koala is [[Blinky Bill]]. Created by [[Dorothy Wall]] in 1933, the character appeared in several books and has been the subject of films, TV series, merchandise, and a 1986 environmental song by [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]].&lt;ref name=Jackson149/&gt; The first [[Postage stamps and postal history of Australia|Australian stamp]] featuring a koala was issued by the Commonwealth in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; A television ad campaign for Australia's national airline [[Qantas]], starting in 1967 and running for several decades, featured a live koala (voiced by [[Howard Morris]]), who complained that too many tourists were coming to Australia and concluded "I hate Qantas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eBEQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0IwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3697,2152784&amp;dq=qantas+koala+commercial&amp;hl=en|title=Teddy will be missed|date=15 March 1976|work=Boca Raton News|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has been ranked among the greatest commercials of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drewbabb.com/100-greatest-commercials/commercials-page-five.htm |title=100 greatest TV spots of all time |work=Drew Babb &amp; Associates |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113105530/http://www.drewbabb.com/100-greatest-commercials/commercials-page-five.htm |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "Ode to a Koala Bear" appears on the [[B-side]] of the 1983 [[Paul McCartney]]/[[Michael Jackson]] duet single ''[[Say Say Say]]''.&lt;ref name=Jackson149&gt;Jackson, pp. 149–52.&lt;/ref&gt; A koala is the main character in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show]]'' and [[Nippon Animation]]'s ''[[Noozles]]'', both of which were animated cartoons of the early 1980s. Food products shaped like the koala include the [[Caramello Koala]] chocolate bar and the bite-sized cookie snack [[Koala's March]]. [[Dadswells Bridge]] in Victoria features a tourist complex shaped like a giant koala,&lt;ref name=Jackson155&gt;Jackson, pp. 155–58.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Queensland Reds]] rugby team has a koala as its mascot.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Platinum Koala]] coin features the animal on the reverse and Elizabeth II on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platinum Australian Koala|publisher=Goldline.com|accessdate=28 March 2013|url=http://www.goldline.com/coins-platinum-australian-koala|date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drop bear]] is an imaginary creature in contemporary [[Australian folklore]] featuring a predatory, carnivorous version of the koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in [[tall tale]]s designed to scare [[Tourism in Australia|tourists]]. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious [[marsupial]]s that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.&lt;ref&gt;David Wood, "[http://www.countrynews.com.au/story.asp?TakeNo=200505025048382 Yarns spun around campfire]", in ''Country News'', byline, 2 May 2005, accessed 4 April 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510144619/http://www.countrynews.com.au/story.asp?TakeNo=200505025048382 |date=10 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ag-tdb-vj&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/00049182.2012.731307|title=Indirect Tracking of Drop Bears Using GNSS Technology|year=2012|last1=Janssen|first1=Volker|journal=[[Australian Geographer]]|volume=43|issue=4|pages=445–452|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/82194|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seal|first1=Graham|title=Great Australian Stories: Legends, Yarns and Tall Tales|date=2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=9781458716811|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUEzm_xj3loC&amp;pg=PA136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation issues===
While the koala was previously classified as [[least-concern species|Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List|Red List]], it was uplisted to [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal to include the koala in the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]].&lt;ref name="Price 2012"/&gt; In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the [[Australian Koala Foundation]] argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures is based on a misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.&lt;ref name="abc120430"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-30/koala-listed-as-vulnerable/3980216/?site=sydney |title=Koalas added to threatened species list |date=30 April 2012 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Phascolarctos cinereus peau de koala.jpg|thumb|Koala skins were widely traded early in the 20th century.]]
Koalas were hunted for food by Aboriginals. A common technique used to capture the animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark to the end of a long, thin pole, so as to form a [[noose]]. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick ([[waddy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered [[taboo]] to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;
The koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 121–28.&lt;/ref&gt; largely for its thick, soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for use in rugs, coat linings, [[muff (handwarmer)|muffs]], and as trimming on women's garments.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive [[culling]]s occurred in Queensland in 1915, 1917, and again in 1919, when over one million koalas were killed with guns, poisons, and nooses. The public outcry over these cullings was probably the first wide-scale [[Environmental issues in Australia|environmental issue]] that rallied Australians. Novelist and social critic [[Vance Palmer]], writing in a letter to ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', expressed the popular sentiment: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The shooting of our harmless and lovable native bear is nothing less than barbarous&amp;nbsp;... No one has ever accused him of spoiling the farmer's wheat, eating the squatter's grass, or even the spreading of the prickly pear. There is no social vice that can be put down to his account&amp;nbsp;... He affords no sport to the gun-man&amp;nbsp;... And he has been almost blotted out already from some areas."&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Despite the growing movement to protect native species, the poverty brought about by the drought of 1926–28 led to the killing of another 600,000 koalas during a one-month [[hunting|open season]] in August 1927.&lt;ref name="qldhistory"&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Queensland |author=Evans, R. |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87692-6 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Frederick Lewis, the Chief Inspector of Game in Victoria, said that the once-abundant animal had been brought to near extinction in that state, suggesting that only 500–1000 remained.&lt;ref name="ley196412"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[File:A364, Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, Queensland, Australia, koala, 2007.png|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Scent gland on the chest of an adult male - Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary]]
The first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane's [[Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary]] and Sydney's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 157–59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, [[David Fleay]], curator of Australian mammals at the [[Melbourne Zoo]], established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala. This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at [[Healesville Sanctuary]] and the [[David Fleay Wildlife Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 159–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1870, koalas have been introduced to several coastal and offshore islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. Their numbers have significantly increased,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 163–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers, [[browsing (herbivory)|overbrowsing]] has become a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Lewis initiated a program of large-scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions, with the intent of eventually returning them to their former range. For example, in 1930–31, 165 koalas were [[Species translocation|translocated]] to [[Quail Island (Victoria)|Quail Island]]. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944.  The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;Moyal, pp. 166–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry has forced the use of translocation and [[Sterility (physiology)|sterilisation]], instead.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 184–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panneaux koala kangourou.jpg|thumb|Road sign depicting a koala and a kangaroo]]
One of the biggest [[wikt:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] threats to the koala is [[habitat destruction]] and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]]. In coastal areas, the main cause of this is [[urbanisation]], while in rural areas, habitat is cleared for agriculture. Native forest trees are also taken down to be made into wood products.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Handasyde, pp. 104–07.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Australia ranked fifth in the world by deforestation rates, having cleared {{convert|564,800|ha}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, pp. 220–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of the koala has shrunk by more than 50% since European arrival, largely due to fragmentation of habitat in Queensland.&lt;ref name="McGregor 2013"/&gt; The koala's "vulnerable" status in Queensland and New South Wales means that developers in these states must consider the impacts on this species when making building applications.&lt;ref name=abc120430/&gt; In addition, koalas live in many [[protected area]]s.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

While urbanisation can pose a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present.&lt;ref name="Holtcamp 2007"/&gt; Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: [[roadkill|collisions with vehicles]] and attacks by domestic dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year.&lt;ref name="Foden 2009"/&gt; Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitation centres]].&lt;ref name="Holtcamp 2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Holtcamp, W.|date=5 January 2007|title=Will Urban Sprawl KO the Koala?|publisher=National Wildlife|accessdate= 22 March 2013|url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Animals/Archives/2007/Will-Urban-Sprawl-KO-the-Koala.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 30-year [[retrospective cohort study|retrospective study]] performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre,  [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] (usually resulting from a motor vehicle accident or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of [[chlamydia infection|''Chlamydia'' infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Griffith, J.

The following is a list of '''Minnesota weather records''' [[Surface weather observation|observed]] at various stations across the state during the last 100 years. [[Minnesota]] is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Upper Midwest]]ern region of the [[United States]].  Due to its location in the northern plains of the United States its [[Climate of Minnesota|climate]] is one of extremes.  Minnesota's history of nearly continuous [[meteorology|meteorological]] record keeping stretches back nearly two centuries to 1819 when [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]] was settled.  By 1871 the first official [[Federal government of the United States|government]] observations were taking place in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] and by the early 20th century most statewide stations that exist today were in operation.&lt;ref name=almanac&gt;{{cite book  | last = Seeley   W.  | first = Mark  | title = Minnesota Weather Almanac  | publisher = [[Minnesota Historical Society]] press  | year = 2006  | isbn = 0-87351-554-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = History of the NWS in the Twin Cities  | publisher = [[National Weather Service (United States)|National Weather Service]] - Twin Cities  | date = November 9, 2005  | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mpx/history/index.php  | accessdate = 2007-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This page refers only to birds that have gone extinct since the of birds known only from fossils, see [[List of fossil bird genera]]. For birds extinct in Late Quaternary prehistoric times and usually known from specimens not completely fossilized, see [[List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species]].''

Over 190 species of [[bird]]s have become [[Extinction|extinct]] since 1500, and the rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by [[Hawaii]], where 30% of all known recently extinct bird [[taxa]] originally lived. Other areas, such as [[Guam]], have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced [[brown tree snake]].

Currently there are approximately 10,000 living species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.

Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular, are most at risk. The disproportionate number of [[Rallidae|rails]] in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in [[List of Late Quaternary prehistoric bird species]].

The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the [[San Benedicto rock wren]] is possibly the most extreme example&amp;mdash;its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); for many Pacific birds that became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century, because the islands on which they lived were only rarely visited by scientists.

* West Coast spotted kiwi, ''Apteryx occidentalis'' (South Island, New Zealand, c.&amp;nbsp;1900)
*:A doubtful form known from a single bird; may be a [[little spotted kiwi]] subspecies or a hybrid between that species and the [[rowi]].

===[[Anseriformes]]===
[[Image:Camptorynchus labradoriusNHDP078CB.jpg|thumb|[[Labrador duck]]]]
[[Duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s
* [[Crested shelduck]], ''Tadorna cristata'' (Northeast Asia, late 20th century?)
*:A [[Relict (biology)|relict species]] from Northeast Asia. Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]] due to recent unconfirmed reports.
* [[Réunion shelduck]], ''Alopochen kervazoi'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)
* [[Mauritian shelduck]], ''Alopochen mauritianus'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.1695)
* [[Amsterdam duck]], ''Anas marecula'' (Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)
* Saint Paul Island duck, ''Anas sp.'' (Saint Paul Island, South Indian Ocean, c.1800)
*: Only known by a painting from 1793. Might be identical with the Amsterdam Island duck or a distinct species or subspecies.
* [[Mauritian duck]], ''Anas theodori'' (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, late 1690s)
* [[Mariana mallard]], ''Anas oustaleti'' (Marianas, West Pacific, 1981)
* [[Finsch's duck]], ''Chenonetta finschi'' from New Zealand possibly survived to 1870
* [[Pink-headed duck]], ''Rhodonessa caryophyllacea'' (East India, Bangladesh, North Myanmar, 1945?)– a reclassification into the genus Netta is recommended but not generally accepted.
*:Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]]; recent surveys have failed to rediscover it.
* Réunion pochard, ''Aythya'' cf. ''innotata'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.1690s)
*:A bone of a pochard found on Réunion seems to resolve the reports of ''canards'' other than the [[Mauritian duck]] having occurred on the island. The taxonomic status of this form cannot be resolved until more material is found, however.
* [[Labrador duck]],  ''Camptorhynchus labradorius'' (Northeast North America, c. 1880)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/factsheet/22680418|title=Labrador Duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) - BirdLife species factsheet|website=datazone.birdlife.org|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[pile-builder megapode]], ''Megapodius molistructor'' may have survived on New Caledonia to the late 18th century as evidenced by descriptions of the bird named ''"Tetrao australis"'' and later ''"Megapodius andersoni"''.
* The [[Viti Levu scrubfowl]], ''Megapodius amissus'' of [[Viti Levu]] and possibly [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], [[Fiji]], may have survived to the early 19th or even the 20th century as suggested by circumstantial evidence.
* Raoul Island scrubfowl, ''Megapodius'' sp. (Raoul, Kermadec Islands, 1876)
*:A megapode is said to have inhabited Raoul Island until the population was wiped out in a volcanic eruption. It is not clear whether the birds represent a distinct taxon or derive from a prehistoric introduction by Polynesian seafarers.&lt;!-- Notornis 51(2):61 --&gt;
* [[New Zealand quail]], ''Coturnix novaezelandiae'' (New Zealand, 1875)
* [[Himalayan quail]], ''Ophrysia superciliosa'' (North India, late 19th century?)
*:Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]]. Not recorded with certainty since 1876, but thorough surveys are still required, and there was a recent set of possible (though unlikely) sightings around [[Naini Tal]] in 2003. A little-known native name from Western [[Nepal]] probably refers to this bird, but for various reasons, no survey for ''Ophrysia'' has ever been conducted in that country, nor is it generally assumed to occur there (due to the native name being overlooked).

===[[Charadriiformes]]===
[[Image:greatauk-london.jpg|thumb|[[Great auk]] (''Pinguinus impennis''), [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London, England]]
[[Shorebird]]s, [[gull]]s and [[auk]]s
* [[Javan lapwing]], ''Vanellus macropterus'' (Java, Indonesia, mid-20th century)
*:Officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered]], but as this conspicuous bird has not been recorded since 1940, it is almost certainly extinct.
*[[Kiritimati sandpiper]], ''Prosobonia cancellata'' ([[Kiritimati]] Island, [[Kiribati]], 1850s)
* [[Tahiti sandpiper]], ''Prosobonia leucoptera'' (Tahiti, Society Islands, 19th century)
* [[White-winged sandpiper]], ''Prosobonia ellisi'' (Moorea, Society Islands, 19th century)
*:Doubtfully distinct from ''P. leucoptera''.
* [[North Island snipe]], ''Coenocorypha barrierensis'' ([[North Island]], New Zealand, 1870s)
* [[South Island snipe]], ''Coenocorypha iredalei'' (South and Stewart Islands, New Zealand, 1964)
* [[Eskimo curlew]], ''Numenius borealis'' (Northern North America, late 20th century?)
*:May still exist; officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]].
* [[Slender-billed curlew]], ''Numenius tenuirostris'' (Western Siberia, early first decade of the 21st century?)
*:May still exist; officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered]]. A few birds were recorded in 2004, following several decades of increasing rarity. There was an unconfirmed sighting in Albania in 2007. A survey to find out whether this bird still exists is currently being undertaken by the RSPB ([[BirdLife International|BirdLife]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]).
* [[Great auk]], ''Pinguinus impennis'' (Newfoundland, 1852)
* [[Canary Islands oystercatcher]], ''Haematopus meadewaldoi'' (Eastern Canary Islands, E Atlantic, c.&amp;nbsp;1940?)
*:Later sightings of black oystercatchers off [[Senegal]] were not likely to be of this sedentary species, but two records from [[Tenerife]] - the last in 1981 - may be.

===[[Gruiformes]]===
[[Rallidae|Rail]]s and allies - probably [[paraphyletic]]

* [[Antillean cave rail]], ''Nesotrochis debooyi'' known by pre-Columbian bones from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Stories of an easy-to-catch bird named carrao heard by Alexander Wetmore in 1912 on Puerto Rico might refer to this species.
* [[Hawkins's rail]], ''Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi'' (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, 19th century)
* [[Red rail]], ''Aphanapteryx bonasia'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1700)
* [[Rodrigues rail]], ''Erythromachus leguati'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
* [[Bar-winged rail]], ''Nesoclopeus poecilopterus'' (Fiji, Polynesia, c.&amp;nbsp;1980)
* [[New Caledonian rail]], ''Gallirallus lafresnayanus'' (New Caledonia, Melanesia, c.&amp;nbsp;1990?)
*:Officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered]], the last records were in 1984 and it seems that all available habitat is overrun by feral pigs and dogs, which prey on this bird.
* [[Wake Island rail]], ''Gallirallus wakensis'' (Wake Island, Micronesia, 1945)
* [[Image:Gallirallus.pacificus.jpg|thumb|[[Tahitian red-billed rail]]]][[Tahitian red-billed rail]], ''Gallirallus pacificus'' (Tahiti, Society Islands, late 18th– 19th century)
* [[Dieffenbach's rail]], ''Gallirallus dieffenbachii'' (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, mid-19th century)
* [[Tongatapu rail]], ''Gallirallus hypoleucus'' (Tongatapu, Tonga, late 18th - 19th century)
* Vava'u rail, ''Gallirallus'' cf. ''vekamatolu'' (Vava'u, Tonga, early 19th century?)
*:This bird is known only from a drawing by the 1793 [[Alessandro Malaspina|Malaspina]] expedition, apparently depicting a species of ''Gallirallus''. The 'Eua rail, ''Gallirallus vekamatolu'', is known from prehistoric bones found on [['Eua]], but this species is almost certainly not ''G. vekamatolu'', as that bird was flightless and hence is unlikely to have settled three distant islands. However, it probably was a close relative.
* Norfolk rail, ''Gallirallus sp.'' may be the bird shown on a bad watercolor illustration made around 1800.
* [[Chatham rail]], ''Cabalus modestus'' (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1900)
* [[Réunion rail]] or Dubois's wood-rail, ''Dryolimnas augusti'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
* [[Ascension crake]], ''Mundia elpenor'' (Ascension, Island, Atlantic, late 17th century)– formerly ''Atlantisia''
* [[Saint Helena crake]], ''Porzana astrictocarpus'' (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* [[Image:Laysanralle.jpg|thumb|The [[Laysan rail]] was an [[omnivore.]]]][[Laysan rail]], ''Porzana palmeri'' (Laysan Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1944)
* [[Image:Hawaiirail.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaiian rail]]]][[Hawaiian rail]], ''Porzana sandwichensis'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1890)
* [[Kosrae crake]], ''Porzana monasa'' (Kosrae, Carolines, c. mid-late 19th century)
* [[Miller's rail]], ''Porzana nigra'' (Tahiti, Society Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1800)
*:Known only from paintings and descriptions; taxonomic status uncertain as the material is often believed to refer to the extant [[spotless crake]].
* [[Saint Helena swamphen]], ''Aphanocrex podarces'' (Saint Helena, Atlantic, 16th century)– formerly ''Atlantisia''
* [[Image:PorphyrioAlbus.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Howe swamphen]]]][[Lord Howe swamphen]], ''Porphyrio albus'' ([[Lord Howe Island]], SW Pacific, early 19th century)
* [[Réunion swamphen]] or ''Oiseau bleu'', ''Porphyrio coerulescens'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, 18th century)
*:Known only from descriptions. Former existence of a ''Porphyrio'' on Réunion is fairly certain, but not proven to date.
* [[Marquesas swamphen]], ''Porphyrio paepae'' (Hiva Oa and Tahuata, Marquesas)
*:May have survived to c.&amp;nbsp;1900. In the lower right corner of [[Paul Gauguin]]'s 1902 painting ''Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa ou le Marquisien à la cape rouge'' there is a bird which resembles native descriptions of ''P. paepae''.
* [[North Island takahē]], ''Porphyrio mantelli'' known from subfossil bones found in New Zealand's North Island; may have survived to 1894 or later.
* [[New Caledonian gallinule]], ''Porphyrio kukwiedei'' from New Caledonia, Melanesia, may have survived into historic times. The native name ''n'dino'' is thought to refer to this bird.
* [[Samoan wood rail]], ''Gallinula pacifica'' (Savai'i, Samoa, 1907?)
*:Probably better placed in the genus ''Pareudiastes'', unconfirmed reports from the late 20th century suggest it still survives in small numbers, and therefore it is officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered]].
* [[Makira woodhen]], ''Gallinula silvestris'' (Makira, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Only known from a single specimen, this rail is probably better placed in its own genus, ''Edithornis''. There are some unconfirmed recent records that suggest it still survives, and thus it is officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered]].
* [[Tristan moorhen]], ''Gallinula nesiotis'' (Tristan da Cunha, Atlantic, late 19th century)
* [[Mascarene coot]], ''Fulica newtonii'' (Mauritius and Réunion, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1700)
* Fernando de Noronha rail, Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Fernando de Noronha, W. Atlantic, 16th century?)
*:A distinct species of rail inhabited Fernando de Noronha island, but it has not been formally described yet. Probably was extant at first Western contact.
* Tahitian "goose", Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. (Tahiti, late 18th century?)
*:Early travelers to Tahiti reported a "goose" that was found in the mountains. Altogether, a species of the rail genus ''Porphyrio'' seems the most likely choice.
* Bokaak "bustard", Rallidae? gen. et sp. indet. 'Bokaak'
*:An unidentified terrestrial bird is mentioned in an early report from Bokaak in the Marshall Islands. It is described as a "[[bustard]]" and may have been a rail or a [[megapode]]. In the former case it may have been a vagrant of some still-extant species; in any case, no bird that could be described as "bustard-like" is found on Bokaak today.&lt;ref name = spennemann2006&gt;Spennemann (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rallidae gen. et sp. indet. 'Amsterdam Island'
*:Unknown rail from [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam Island]], one specimen found but not recovered. Extinct by 1800 or may have been straggler of extant species.

===[[Podicipediformes]]===
[[Grebe]]s
* [[Colombian grebe]], ''Podiceps andinus'' (Bogotá area, Colombia, 1977)
* [[Alaotra grebe]], ''Tachybaptus rufolavatus'' (Lake Alaotra, Madagascar, 1985)
*:Officially declared extinct in 2010, 25 years after the last official sighting. Declined through habitat destruction and hybridization with the [[little grebe]]. Disappeared from only known location in the 1980s.
* [[Atitlán grebe]], ''Podilymbus gigas'' (Lake Atitlán, Guatemala, 1989)

=== [[Cathartiformes]] ===

* "Painted vulture", ''Sarcoramphus sacer (''Florida, United States, late 18th century?)
** A bird supposedly similar to the king vulture identified by [[William Bartram]] on his travels in the 1770s. Skeptics have stated that it is likely based on a misidentification of the [[northern caracara]], although evidence has increasingly shifted towards it being a valid species that existed, based on an independent illustration of a near-identical bird made several decades earlier by [[Eleazar Albin]]. See [[King vulture]] article for discussion.

===[[Pelecaniformes]]===
[[Pelican|Pelicans]] and related birds

* [[Bermuda night heron]], ''Nyctanassa carcinocatactes'' (Bermuda, West Atlantic, 17th century)
*:Sometimes assigned to the genus ''Nycticorax''
*[[Réunion night heron]], ''Nycticorax duboisi'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
*[[Mauritius night heron]], ''Nycticorax mauritianus'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1700)
*[[Rodrigues night heron]], ''Nycticorax megacephalus'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*[[Ascension night heron]], ''Nycticorax olsoni'' (Ascension Island, Atlantic, late 16th century?)
*:Known only from subfossil bones, but the description of a flightless Ascension bird by [[André Thévet]] cannot be identified with anything other than this species.
*[[New Zealand little bittern]], ''Ixobrychus novaezelandiae'' (New Zealand, late 19th century)
*:Long considered to be vagrant individuals of the Australian [[little bittern]], bones recovered from Holocene deposits indicate that this was indeed a distinct taxon, but it might not be a separate species.&lt;!-- Notornis 10(7):317 --&gt;
*[[Réunion ibis]], ''Threskiornis solitarius'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, early 18th century)
*:This species was the basis of the "Réunion solitaire", a supposed relative of the [[dodo]] and the [[Rodrigues solitaire]]. Given the fact that ibis (but no dodo-like) bones were found on [[Réunion]] and that old descriptions match a flightless [[sacred ibis]] quite well, the "Réunion solitaire" hypothesis has been refuted.

===[[Suliformes]]===
[[Booby|Boobies]] and related birds

*[[Spectacled cormorant]], ''Phalacrocorax perspicillatus'' (Komandorski Islands, North Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1850)
*Mascarene booby, ''Papasula sp.'' (Mauritius and Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-19th century)
**An undescribed booby species that was formerly considered a population of the [[Abbott's booby|Abbot's booby]]. Known physically only from subfossil bones, but is likely the bird referred to as a "boeuf" by early settlers. The "boeuf" was last recorded on Rodrigues in 1832, and likely went extinct following the deforestation of the island.

===[[Procellariiformes]]===
[[Petrel]]s, [[shearwater]]s, [[albatross]]es and [[storm petrel]]s.
* [[Olson's petrel]], ''Bulweria bifax'' (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* [[Bermuda shearwater]], ''Puffinus parvus'' ([[Bermuda]], West Atlantic, 16th century)
* [[Saint Helena petrel]], ''Pseudobulweria rupinarum'' (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)
* [[Jamaica petrel]], ''Pterodroma caribbaea'' (Jamaica, Caribbean)
*:Possibly a subspecies of the [[black-capped petrel]]; unconfirmed reports suggest it might survive. Officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]].
* ''Pterodroma'' cf. ''leucoptera'' ([[Mangareva]], [[Gambier Islands]], 20th century?)
*:A wing of a carcass similar to [[Gould's petrel]] was recovered on Mangareva in 1922, where it possibly bred. No such birds are known to exist there today.
* [[Guadalupe storm petrel]], ''Oceanodroma macrodacyla'' (Guadalupe, East Pacific, 1910s)
*:Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]], but a thorough survey in 2000 concluded the species was certainly extinct.
* [[Imber's petrel]], ''Pterodroma imberi''
*:Described from subfossil remains from the Chatham Islands, became apparently extinct in the early 19th century.

===[[Sphenisciformes]]===
[[Penguins]]
* The [[Chatham penguin]], ''Eudyptes'' sp. (Chatham Islands, SW Pacific), is only known from subfossil bones, but a bird kept captive at some time between 1867 and 1872 might refer to this taxon.&lt;!-- Notornis 41(S):165 --&gt;

===[[Columbiformes]]===
[[Image:Ectopistes migratoriusMCN2P28CA.jpg|thumb|Male [[passenger pigeon]]]]
[[Pigeon]]s, doves and [[dodo]]s&lt;br /&gt;
For the "Réunion solitaire", see [[Réunion ibis]].
* [[Saint Helena dove]], ''Dysmoropelia dekarchiskos'', possibly survived into the Modern Era.
* [[Passenger pigeon]], ''Ectopistes migratorius'' (Eastern North America, 1914)
*:The passenger pigeon was once among the most common birds in the world, a single flock numbering up to 2.2 billion birds. It was hunted close to extinction for food and sport in the late 19th century. The last individual, [[Martha (passenger pigeon)|Martha]], died in the [[Cincinnati Zoo]] in 1914.
* [[Bonin woodpigeon]], '' Columba versicolor'' (Nakodo-jima and Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1890)
* [[Ryukyu woodpigeon]], ''Columba jouyi'' (Okinawa and Daito Islands, Northwest Pacific, late 1930s)
* [[Réunion pink pigeon]], ''Nesoenas duboisi'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1700)
*:Formerly in ''Streptopelia''. There seems to have been at least another species of pigeon on Réunion (probably an ''Alectroenas''), but bones have not yet been found. It disappeared at the same time.
* [[Rodrigues pigeon]], ''Nesoenas rodericana'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, before 1690?)
*:Formerly in ''Streptopelia''. A possible subspecies of the [[Madagascar turtle dove]] (''N. picturata''), this seems not to be the bird observed by [[François Leguat|Leguat]]. Introduced rats might have killed it off in the late 17th century.
* [[Liverpool pigeon]], ''"Caloenas" maculata''
*:Also known as the spotted green pigeon, the only known specimen has been in [[Liverpool]] Museum since 1851 and was probably collected on a [[Pacific]] island for [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]]. It has been suggested that this bird came from [[Tahiti]] based on native lore about a somewhat similar extinct bird called the ''titi'', but this has not been verified.
* [[Sulu bleeding-heart]], ''Gallicolumba menagei'' (Tawitawi, Philippines, late 1990s?)
*:Officially listed as [[endangered species|critically endangered]]. Only known from two specimens taken in 1891. There have been a number of unconfirmed reports from all over the [[Sulu Archipelago]] in 1995, however, these reports stated that the bird had suddenly undergone a massive decline, and by now, habitat destruction is almost complete. If not extinct, this species is very rare, but the ongoing [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|civil war]] prevents comprehensive surveys.
* [[Norfolk ground dove]], ''Gallicolumba norfolciensis'' (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1800)
* [[Tanna ground dove]], ''Gallicolumba ferruginea'' (Tanna, Vanuatu, late 18th-19th century)
*:Only known from descriptions of two now-lost specimens.
* [[Thick-billed ground dove]], ''Gallicolumba salamonis'' (Makira and Ramos, Solomon Islands, mid-20th century?)
*:Last recorded in 1927, only two specimens exist. Declared extinct in 2005.
* [[Image:Microgoura meeki.jpg|thumb|[[Choiseul crested pigeon]]]][[Choiseul pigeon]], ''Microgoura meeki'' (Choiseul, Solomon Islands, early 20th century)
* [[Red-moustached fruit dove]], ''Ptilinopus mercierii'' (Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, Marquesas, mid-20th century)
*:Two subspecies, the little-known ''P. m. mercierii'' of Nuku Hiva (extinct mid-late 19th century) and ''P. m. tristrami'' of Hiva Oa.
* [[Negros fruit dove]], ''Ptilinopus arcanus'' (Negros, Philippines, late 20th century?)&lt;!-- Condor58:283 --&gt;
*:Known only from one specimen taken at the only documented sighting in 1953, the validity of this species has been questioned, but no good alternative to distinct species status has been proposed. Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]], it might occur on Panay, but no survey has located it. One possible record in 2002 does not seem to have been repeated.
* [[File:Extinctbirds1907 P22 Alectroenas nitidissima0325.png|thumb|[[Mauritius blue pigeon]]]][[Mauritius blue pigeon]], ''Alectroenas nitidissima'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1830s)
* Farquhar blue pigeon, ''Alectroenas'' sp. (Farquhar Group, Seychelles, 19th century)
*:Only known from early reports; possibly a subspecies of the [[Comoro blue pigeon|Comoro]] or [[Seychelles blue pigeon]].
* [[Rodrigues grey pigeon]], ''"Alectroenas" rodericana'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:A mysterious bird of unknown affinities, known from a few bones and, as it seems, two historical reports.
* [[Dodo]], ''Raphus cucullatus'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, late 17th century)
*:Called ''Didus ineptus'' by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. A metre-high flightless bird found on [[Mauritius]]. Its forest habitat was lost when Dutch settlers moved to the island and the dodo's nests were destroyed by the monkeys, pigs, and cats the Dutch brought with them. The last specimen was killed in 1681, only 80 years after the arrival of the new predators.
* [[Rodrigues solitaire]], ''Pezophaps solitaria'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1730)

===[[Psittaciformes]]===
[[Parrot]]s
[[Image:Karolinasittich 01.jpg|thumb|Mounted specimen of ''[[Conuropsis carolinensis]]'', [[Museum Wiesbaden]], Germany]]
* [[New Caledonian lorikeet]], ''Charmosyna diadema'' (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century?)
*:Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]], there have been no reliable reports of this bird since the early 20th century. It is, however, small and inconspicuous.
* [[Image:John-Gould-001.jpg|thumb|[[Norfolk kaka]]]][[Norfolk kaka]], '' Nestor productus'' (Norfolk and Philip Islands, SW Pacific, 1851?)
* [[Society parakeet]], ''Cyanoramphus ulietanus'' (Raiatea, Society Islands, late 18th century)
* [[Black-fronted parakeet]], ''Cyanoramphus zealandicus'' (Tahiti, Society Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1850)
* [[Paradise parrot]], ''Psephotus pulcherrimus'' (Rockhampton area, Australia, late 1920s)
* [[Oceanic eclectus parrot]], ''Eclectus infectus'', known from subfossil bones found on Tonga, Vanuatu, and possibly Fiji, may have survived until the 18th century: a bird which seems to be a male ''Eclectus'' parrot was drawn in a report on the Tongan island of [[Vava'u|Vavaʻu]] by the [[Alessandro Malaspina|Malaspina]] expedition. Also a 19th-century Tongan name ''ʻāʻā'' ("parrot") for "a beautiful bird found only at [['Eua|ʻEua]]" is attested (see here&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TreMaor-c1-5.html nzetc.org]&lt;/ref&gt; under "kaka"). This seems to refer either ''E. infectus'' which in Tonga is only known from Vavaʻu and ʻEua, or the extirpated population of the [[collared lory]] which also occurred there. It is possible but unlikely that the species survived on ʻEua until the 19th century.
* [[Image:Psittacula.wardi.jgk.jpg|thumb|[[Seychelles parakeet]]]][[Seychelles parakeet]], ''Psittacula wardi'' (Seychelles, W Indian Ocean, 1883)
* [[Newton's parakeet]], ''Psittacula exsul'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1875)
* [[Mascarene grey parakeet]], ''Psittacula bensoni'' (Mauritius, possible Réunion as ''Psittacula cf bensoni''). Formerly described as Mauritius grey parrot, ''Lophopsittacus bensoni''.  Known from a 1602 sketch by Captain Willem van Westzanen and by subfossil bones described by [[David Thomas Holyoak]] in 1973. Might have survived to the mid-18th century.
* [[Mascarene parrot]], ''Mascarinus mascarinus'' (Réunion and possibly Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1834?)
*:Last known individual was a captive bird which was alive before 1834.
* [[Broad-billed parrot]], ''Lophopsittacus mauritianus'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, 1680?)
*:May have survived to the late 18th century.
* [[Rodrigues parrot]], ''Necropsittacus rodericanus'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, late 18th century)
*:The species ''N. francicus'' is fictional, ''[[Réunion red and green parakeet|N. borbonicus]]'' most likely so.
* [[Glaucous macaw]], ''Anodorhynchus glaucus'' (N Argentina, early 20th century)
*:Officially [[endangered species|critically endangered]] due to persistent rumors of wild birds, but probably extinct.
* [[Cuban macaw]], ''Ara tricolor'' (Cuba, West Indies, late 19th century)
*:A number of related species have been described from the West Indies, but are not based on good evidence. Several prehistoric forms are now known to have existed in the region, however.
* [[Carolina parakeet]], ''Conuropsis carolinensis'' (SE North America, c. 1930?)
*:Although the date of the last captive bird's death in the Cincinnati Zoo, 1918, is generally given as its extinction date, there are convincing reports of some wild populations persisting until later. Two subspecies, ''C. c. carolinensis'' (east and south of the Appalachian range– extinct 1918 or c. 1930) and ''C. c. ludovicianus'' (Louisiana parakeet, west of the Appalachian range– extinct early 1910s).
* [[Guadeloupe parakeet]], ''Aratinga labati'' (Guadeloupe, West Indies, late 18th century)
*:Only known from descriptions, the former existence of this bird is likely for biogeographic reasons and because details as described cannot be referred to known species.
* [[Martinique amazon]], ''Amazona martinica'' (Martinique, West Indies, mid-18th century)
* [[Guadeloupe amazon]], ''Amazona violacea'' (Guadeloupe, West Indies, mid-18th century)
*:The extinct amazon parrots were originally described after travelers' descriptions. Both are now considered valid extinct species closely related to the [[imperial amazon]].

* [[Mauritius owl]], ''Mascarenotus sauzieri'' (Mauritius, Mascarenes, c.&amp;nbsp;1850)
* [[Rodrigues owl]], ''Mascarenotus murivorus'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
*:The preceding two species were variously placed in ''Bubo'', ''Athene'', ''"Scops"'' (=''Otus''), ''Strix'', and ''Tyto'' before their true affinity was realized.
* New Caledonian boobook, ''Ninox'' cf. ''novaeseelandiae'' (New Caledonia, Melanesia)
*:Known only from prehistoric bones, but might still survive.
* [[Laughing owl]], ''Sceloglaux albifacies'' (New Zealand, 1914?)
*:Two subspecies, ''S. a. albifacies'' (South Island and Stewart Island, extinct 1914?) and ''S. a. rufifacies'' (North Island, extinct c.&amp;nbsp;1870s?)– circumstantial evidence suggests small remnants survived until the early/mid-20th century.
* The [[Puerto Rican barn owl]], ''Tyto cavatica'', known from prehistoric remains found in caves of Puerto Rico, West Indies, may still have existed in 1912 given reports of the presence of cave-roosting owls.
* The Bahaman barn owl, ''[[Tyto pollens]]'', known from prehistoric remains found on Andros (Bahamas), may have survived to the 16th century as indicated by the "[[chickcharnie]]" legend.
* [[Siau scops owl]] ''Otus siaoensis'' (20th century?)
*: Only known from the holotype collected in 1866. Endemic to the small volcanic island of [[Siau Island|Siau]] north of [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]. Might still survive as there are ongoing rumors of scops owls at Siau.

===[[Caprimulgiformes]]===
'''[[Caprimulgidae]]''' - nightjars and nighthawks&lt;br /&gt;
Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large [[insects]] and similar prey. They are easily located by the males' song, but this is not given all year. Habitat destruction represents currently the biggest threat, while island populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators, notably dogs, cats, pigs and mongoose.
* [[Jamaican poorwill]], ''Siphonorhis americana'' (Jamaica, West Indies, late 19th century?)
*:Reports of unidentifiable nightjars from the 1980s in habitat appropriate for ''S. americana'' suggest that this cryptic species may still exist. Research into this possibility is currently underway; pending further information, it is classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]].
* [[Cuban pauraque]], ''Siphonorhis daiquiri'' (Cuba, West Indies, prehistoric?)
*:Described from [[subfossil]] bones in 1985. There are persistent rumors that this bird, which was never seen alive by scientists, may still survive. Compare [[Puerto Rican nightjar]] and preceding.
* [[Vaurie's nightjar]] (''Caprimulgus centralasicus'') is only known from a single 1929 specimen from [[Xinjiang]], China. It has never been found again, but the validity of this supposed species is seriously disputed. It was never refuted to be an immature female desert [[European nightjar]].

===[[Apodiformes]]===
[[Swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s
* [[Coppery thorntail]], ''Discosura letitiae'' (Bolivia?)
*:Known only from three trade specimens of unknown origin. Might still exist.
* [[Brace's emerald]], ''Chlorostilbon bracei'' (New Providence, Bahamas, late 19th century)&lt;!-- Auk104:296 --&gt;
* [[Gould's emerald]], ''Chlorostilbon elegans'' (Jamaica or northern Bahamas, West Indies, late 19th century)
* [[Turquoise-throated puffleg]], ''Eriocnemis godini'' (Ecuador, 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]]. Known only from six pre-1900 specimens, the habitat at the only known site where it occurred has been destroyed. However, the bird's distribution remains unresolved.

===[[Coraciiformes]]===
[[Kingfisher]]s and related birds
* [[Saint Helena hoopoe]], ''Upupa antaois'' (Saint Helena, Atlantic, early 16th century)

===[[Piciformes]]===
[[Woodpecker]]s and related birds
* [[Imperial woodpecker]], ''Campephilus imperialis'' (Mexico, late 20th century)
*:This 60-centimetre-long woodpecker is officially listed as [[endangered species|critically endangered, possibly extinct]]. Occasional unconfirmed reports come up, the most recent in late 2005.
* The [[ivory-billed woodpecker]] (''Campephilus principalis principalis'') is most likely extinct, but there is uncertainty on whether or not it was rediscovered in the [[White River National Wildlife Refuge]] of [[Arkansas]] in 2004, as intensive searching in the five following years has failed to confirm its survival. The Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (''Campephilus principalis bairdii'') was last seen in 1987 and is generally considered extinct, but a few patches of unsurveyed potential habitat remain.

===[[Passeriformes]]===
[[Perching bird]]s
[[Image:Xenicus lyalli.jpg|thumb|[[Lyall's wren]], victim of feral cats]]
'''[[Acanthisittidae]]'''– New Zealand "wrens"
* [[Lyall's wren]], ''Xenicus lyalli'' (New Zealand, 1895?)
*:The species famously (but erroneously) claimed to have been made extinct by a single cat named "Tibbles".
* [[Bushwren]], ''Xenicus longipes'' (New Zealand, 1972)
*:Three subspecies: ''X. l. stokesi'' (North Island, extinct 1955); ''X. l. longipes'' (South Island, extinct 1968); ''X. l. variabilis'' (Stewart Island, extinct 1972).

'''[[Mohoidae]]''' &amp;ndash; Hawaiian "honeyeaters". Family established in 2008, previously in Meliphagidae.
* [[Kioea]], ''Chaetoptila angustipluma'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1860s)
* [[Image:Moho nobilis-Keulemans.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaiʻi ʻōʻō]]]][[Hawaiʻi ʻōʻō]], ''Moho nobilis'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1930s)
* [[Oʻahu ʻōʻō]], ''Moho apicalis'' (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
* [[Moloka‘i ‘ō‘ō|Molokaʻi ʻōʻō]], ''Moho bishopi'' (Molokaʻi and probably Maui, Hawaiian Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1910 or 1980s)
* [[Kauaʻi ʻōʻō]], ''Moho braccatus'' (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1987)

'''[[Meliphagidae]]''' &amp;ndash; honeyeaters and Australian chats
* [[Chatham bellbird]], ''Anthornis melanocephala'' (Chatham Islands, Southwest Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1910)
*:Sometimes regarded as subspecies of the [[New Zealand bellbird]], ''Anthornis melanura''. Unconfirmed records exist from the early-mid-1950s.
* The identity of ''"[[Strigiceps leucopogon]]"'' (an [[junior homonym|invalid name]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extinct Birds|last=Hume|first=Julian P.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2017|isbn=9781472937469|location=|pages=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; described by Lesson in 1840, is unclear. Apart from the holotype supposedly from "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]", a second specimen from the "[[Himalaya]]" may have existed (or still exist). Lesson tentatively allied it to the Meliphagidae, and Rothschild felt reminded of the [[kioea]].

'''[[Acanthizidae]]''' &amp;ndash; scrubwrens, thornbills, and gerygones
* [[Lord Howe gerygone]], ''Gerygone insularis'' (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1930)

'''[[Pachycephalidae]]''' &amp;ndash; whistlers, shrike-thrushes, pitohuis and allies
* [[Mangarevan whistler]], ?''Pachycephala gambierana'' (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, late 19th century?)
*: Tentatively placed here. A mysterious bird of which no specimens exist today. It was initially described as a shrike, then classified as an ''Eopsalteria'' "robin", and may actually be an ''Acrocephalus'' warbler.

'''[[Dicruridae]]''' &amp;ndash; monarch flycatchers and allies
* [[Maupiti monarch]], ''Pomarea pomarea'' (Maupiti, Society Islands, mid-19th century)
* [[Eiao monarch]], ''Pomarea fluxa'' (Eiao, Marquesas, late 1970s)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the [[Iphis monarch]], this is an early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* [[Nuku Hiva monarch]], ''Pomarea nukuhivae'' (Nuku Hiva, Marquesas, mid-late 20th century)
*:Previously considered a subspecies of the [[Marquesas monarch]], this is another early offspring of the Marquesan stock.
* [[Ua Pou monarch]], ''Pomarea mira'' (Ua Pou, Marquesas, c.&amp;nbsp;1986)
*:Previously considered another subspecies of the [[Marquesas monarch]], this was a distinct species most closely related to that bird and the [[Fatuhiva monarch]].
* [[Guam flycatcher]], ''Myiagra freycineti'' (Guam, Marianas, 1983)

'''[[Oriolidae]]''' &amp;ndash; Old World orioles and allies

* [[North Island piopio]], ''Turnagra tanagra''	(North Island, New Zealand, c.&amp;nbsp;1970?)
*:Not reliably recorded since about 1900.
* [[South Island piopio]], ''Turnagra capensis'' (South Island, New Zealand, 1960s?)
*:Two subspecies, ''T. c. minor'' from [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]] (extinct c.&amp;nbsp;1897) and the nominate ''T. c. capensis'' from the South Island mainland (last specimen taken in 1902, last unconfirmed record in 1963)

'''[[Callaeidae]]''' &amp;ndash; New Zealand wattlebirds
[[Image:Huia Buller.jpg|thumb|Male (front) and female (back) [[Huia]]]]
* [[Huia]], ''Heteralocha acutirostris'' (North Island, New Zealand, early 20th century)

'''[[Hirundinidae]]''' &amp;ndash; swallows and martins
* [[White-eyed river martin]], ''Pseudochelidon sirintarae'' (Thailand, late 1980s?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]], this enigmatic species is only known from migrating birds and it was last seen in 1986 at its former roost site. Recent unconfirmed reports suggest it may occur in [[Cambodia]].
* [[Red Sea cliff swallow]], ''Petrochelidon perdita'' (Red Sea area, late 20th century?)
*:Known from a single specimen, this enigmatic swallow probably still exists, but the lack of recent records is puzzling. It is alternatively placed in the genus ''Hirundo''.

'''[[Acrocephalidae]]''' &amp;ndash;  marsh and tree warblers
* [[Nightingale reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus luscinius'' (Guam, c.&amp;nbsp;1970's)
* [[Aguiguan reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus nijoi'' (Aguiguan, Marianas, c.&amp;nbsp;1997)
* [[Mangareva reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus astrolabii'' (Marianas?, mid-19th century?)
*: Known from just two specimens found from [[Mangareva Island]] in the western Pacific.
* [[Pagan reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus yamashinae'' (Pagan, Marianas, 1970s)
* [[Garrett's reed warbler]], ''Acrocephalus musae'' (Society Islands, 19th century?)
* [[Moorea reed warbler]],'' Acrocephalus longirostris'' (Moorea, Society Islands, 1980s?)
Last reliable sighting was in 1981. Survey in 1986/1987 remained unsuccessful. A photograph of a warbler from Moorea in 1998 or 1999 taken by Philippe Bacchet remains uncertain, as do reports from  2003 and 2010.            
*:

'''[[Muscicapidae]]''' &amp;ndash; Old World flycatchers and chats
* [[Rück's blue flycatcher]], ''Cyornis ruckii'' (Malaysia or Indochina, 20th century?)
*:An enigmatic bird known from two or four possibly migrant specimens, last recorded in 1918. Might exist in northeast Indochina and might be a subspecies of the [[Hainan blue flycatcher]].

'''[[Megaluridae]]''' &amp;ndash; megalurid warblers or grass warblers
* [[Chatham fernbird]], ''Bowdleria rufescens'' (Chatham Islands, New Zealand, c.&amp;nbsp;1900)
*:Often placed in genus ''Megalurus'', but this is based on an incomplete review of the evidence.

'''[[Cisticolidae]]''' &amp;ndash; cisticolas and allies
* [[Tana River cisticola]], ''Cisticola restrictus'' (Kenya, 1970s?)
*:A mysterious bird, found in the Tana River basin in small numbers at various dates, but not since 1972. Probably invalid, based on aberrant or hybrid specimens. An unconfirmed sighting was apparently made in 2007 in the Tana River Delta.

'''[[White-eye|Zosteropidae]]''' &amp;ndash; white-eyes - probably belonging to Timaliidae
* [[Marianne white-eye]], ''Zosterops semiflavus'' (Marianne Island, Seychelles, late 19th century)
* [[Lord Howe white-eye]], ''Zosterops strenuus'' (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1918)
* [[White-chested white-eye]], ''Zosterops albogularis'' (Norfolk Island, between 2006 and 2010)

'''[[Timaliidae]]''' &amp;ndash; Old World babblers
* [[Black-browed babbler]], ''Malacocincla perspicillata'' (Borneo?, Indonesia, 20th century?)
*:Known from a single mid-19th century specimen, this bird may be extinct or could still exist. If the specimen label, usually considered erroneous in claiming "Java" as the bird's origin, is correct, it may have gone extinct earlier.

'''[[Pycnonotidae]]''' &amp;ndash; bulbuls
* [[Rodrigues bulbul]], ''Hypsipetes cowlesi'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, extinction date unknown, 17th century or 18th century might be possible)&lt;!-- Hume (Ostrich September 2015)--&gt;
*:Known only from subfossil bones.

'''[[Sylvioidea]] ''[[incertae sedis]]'''''
* [[Aldabra brush warbler]], ''Nesillas aldabrana'' (Aldabra, Indian Ocean, c.&amp;nbsp;1984)
* [[Rodrigues babbler|Rodrigues "babbler"]] (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, 17th century?)
*:Known from [[subfossil]] bones. Provisionally assigned to [[Timaliidae]], but placement highly doubtful.

'''[[Sturnidae]]''' &amp;ndash; starlings
[[Image:Fregilupus varius - John Gerrard Keulemans.jpg|thumb|[[Hoopoe starling]]]]
* [[Kosrae starling]], ''Aplonis corvina'' (Kosrae, Carolines, mid-19th century)
* [[Mysterious starling]], ''Aplonis mavornata'' (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid-19th century)
* [[Tasman starling]], ''Aplonis fusca'' (Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1923)
*:Two subspecies, ''A. f. fusca''– [[Norfolk starling]] (extinct c.&amp;nbsp;1923); ''A. fusca hulliana''– [[Lord Howe starling]] (extinct c.&amp;nbsp;1919).
* [[Pohnpei starling]], ''Aplonis pelzelni'' (Pohnpei, Micronesia, c.&amp;nbsp;2000)
*:Only one reliable record since 1956, in 1995, leaves the species' survival seriously in doubt.
* [[Bay starling]], ''Aplonis? ulietensis'' (Raiatea, Society Islands, between 1774 and 1850)
*:Usually called "bay thrush" (''Turdus ulietensis''); a mysterious bird from [[Raiatea]], now only known from a painting and some descriptions of a (now lost) specimen. Its [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] position is thus unresolvable at present, although for [[Biogeography|biogeographic]] reasons and because of the surviving description, it has been suggested to have been a [[honeyeater]]. However, with the discovery of fossils of the prehistorically extinct [[starling]] ''[[Aplonis diluvialis]]'' on neighboring [[Huahine]], it seems likely that this bird also belonged to this genus.
* [[Hoopoe starling]], ''Fregilupus varius'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, 1850s)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae
* [[Rodrigues starling]], ''Necropsar rodericanus'' (Rodrigues, Mascarenes, mid-18th century?)
*:Tentatively assigned to Sturnidae. The bird variously described as ''Necropsar leguati'' or ''Orphanopsar leguati'' and considered to be identical with ''N. rodericanus'' (which is only known from [[subfossil]] bones) was found to be based on a misidentified [[albinistic]] specimen of the [[Martinique trembler]] (''Cinclocerthia gutturalis'')

'''[[Thrush (bird)|Turdidae]]''' &amp;ndash; thrushes and relatives
* [[Grand Cayman thrush]], ''Turdus ravidus'' (Grand Cayman, West Indies, late 1940s)
* [[Bonin thrush]], ''Zoothera terrestris'' (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1830s)
* [[ʻĀmaui]], ''Myadestes woahensis'' (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, mid-19th century)
* [[Image:Zzzkamao.jpg|thumb|[[Kāmaʻo]]]][[Kāmaʻo]], ''Myadestes myadestinus'' (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1990s)
* [[Olomaʻo]], ''Myadestes lanaiensis'' (Hawaiian Islands, 1980s?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]] because a possible location on Molokaʻi remains unsurveyed. Two subspecies are known from Lanaʻi (''M. l. lanaiensis'', extinct early 1930s), Molokaʻi (''M. l. rutha'', extinct 1980s?) and a possible third subspecies from Maui (extinct before late 19th century).

'''[[Mimidae]]''' &amp;ndash; mockingbirds and thrashers
*[[Cozumel thrasher]], ''Toxostoma guttatum'' (Cozumel, Caribbean, early first decade of the 21st century?)
*:It is still unknown whether the tiny population rediscovered in 2004 survived Hurricanes [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in 2005. Unconfirmed records in April 2006 and October and December 2007.

'''[[Estrildidae]]'''– estrildid finches (waxbills, munias, etc.)
* [[Black-lored waxbill]], ''Estrilda nigriloris'' (D.R. Congo, Africa, late 20th century?)
*:An enigmatic waxbill not seen since 1950; because part of its habitat is in [[Upemba National Park]] it may survive.

'''[[Icteridae]]''' &amp;ndash; grackles
* [[Slender-billed grackle]], ''Quiscalus palustris'' (Mexico, 1910)

'''[[Parulidae]]''' &amp;ndash; New World warblers
* [[Image:Vermivora bachmaniiMFEMP04CB.jpg|thumb|[[Bachman's warbler]]]][[Bachman's warbler]], ''Vermivora bachmanii'' (southern US, c.&amp;nbsp;1990?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]].
* [[Semper's warbler]], ''Leucopeza semperi'' (Saint Lucia, Caribbean, 1970s?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]]. Suitable habitat remains, and there have been unconfirmed records within the last decade.
'''[[Ploceidae]]''' &amp;ndash; weavers
* [[Réunion fody]], ''Foudia delloni''
*:Formerly ''Foudia bruante'', which might refer to a color morph of the [[red fody]].

'''[[Fringillidae]]''' &amp;ndash; true finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers
* [[Bonin grosbeak]], ''Chaunoproctus ferreorostris'' (Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands, 1830s)
* [[ʻŌʻū]], ''Psittirostra psittacea'' (Hawaiian Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;2000?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]], this was once the most widespread species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. It has not been reliably recorded since 1987 or 1989.
* [[Lanaʻi hookbill]], ''Dysmorodrepanis munroi'' (Lanaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1918)
* [[Kauai palila|Pila's palila]], ''Loxioides kikuichi'' (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands), possibly survived to the early 18th century.
* [[Lesser koa finch]], ''Rhodacanthus flaviceps'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1891)
* [[Greater koa finch]], ''Rhodacanthus palmeri'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1896)

* [[Greater ʻamakihi]], ''Hemignathus sagittirostris'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1901)
* [[Maui nukupuʻu]], ''Hemignathus affinis'' (Maui, Hawaiian Islands, 1990s)
* [[Kauaʻi nukupuʻu]], ''Hemignathus hanapepe'' (Kauaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, late 1990s)
* [[Oʻahu nukupuʻu]], ''Hemignathus lucidus'' (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, late 19th century)
* [[Hawaiʻi ʻakialoa]] or lesser ʻakialoa, ''Akialoa obscurus'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1940)
* [[Maui Nui ʻakialoa]], ''Akialoa lanaiensis'' (Lanaʻi and prehistorically probably Maui and Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1892)

* [[Oahu akepa|Oʻahu {{okina}}akepa]], ''Loxops wolstenholmei'' (Oʻahu, Hawaiian Islands, 1900s)
* [[ʻUla-ʻai-hawane]], ''Ciridops anna'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1892 or 1937)
* [[Black mamo]], ''Drepanis funerea'' (Molokaʻi, Hawaiian Islands, 1907)
* [[Image:Drepanis pacifica-Keulemans.jpg|thumb|[[Hawaiʻi mamo]]]][[Hawaiʻi mamo]], ''Drepanis pacifica'' (Big Island, Hawaiian Islands, 1898)
* [[Laysan honeycreeper]], ''Himatione fraithii'' (Laysan, Hawaiian Islands, 1923)
* [[Poʻo-uli]], ''Melamprosops phaeosoma'' (Maui, Hawaiian Islands, 2004?)
*:The most recent unequivocal extinction on this list. What was most likely the last known bird died in captivity on 28 November 2004.

'''[[Emberizidae]]''' &amp;ndash; buntings and American sparrow
* [[Hooded seedeater]], ''Sporophila melanops'' (Brazil, 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]]. It is known only from a single male collected in 1823, and has variously been considered an aberrant [[yellow-bellied seedeater]] or a hybrid.
* [[Antioquia brush finch]], ''Atlapetes blancae'' (Antioquia, Colombia, late 20th century?)
*:Officially classified as [[critically endangered]]. A mysterious bird, formerly misidentified as [[slaty brush finch]] and only described in 2007. Not found in recent surveys; may be extinct due to rampant habitat destruction.
*[[Bermuda towhee]], ''Pipilo naufragus''. Known by subfossil remains and possibly from a travel report by [[William Strachey]] in 1610.

==(Probably) extinct subspecies of birds==
Extinction of [[subspecies]] is a subject very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as [[IUCN Red List|redlists]] usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of threatened subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of taxa that may still exist, but are listed here due to any combination of absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, or an observed decline.

===[[Struthioniformes]]===
The [[ostrich]] and related [[ratites]]
* [[Arabian ostrich]], ''Struthio camelus syriacus'' (Arabia, 1966)
:The last record of this [[ostrich]] subspecies was a bird found dead in Jordan in 1966.
* [[Tasmanian emu]], ''Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis'' (Tasmania, mid-19th century)
:An [[emu]] subspecies: the last wild bird was collected in 1845. The subspecies may have persisted in captivity until 1884.

=== [[Kiwi|Apterygiformes]] ===

* [[North Island little spotted kiwi]], ''Apteryx owenii iredalei'' (North Island, New Zealand, late 19th century)
:A doubtfully distinct [[little spotted kiwi]] subspecies
:

===[[Casuariiformes]]===
[[Image:Dromaius parvulus.jpg|thumb|[[Kangaroo Island emu]]]]

*[[King Island emu]], ''Dromaius novaehollandiae minor'' (King Island, Australia, 1822)
*:Extinct in the wild c.&amp;nbsp;1805, the last captive specimen died in 1822 in the [[Jardin des Plantes]].
*[[Kangaroo Island emu]], ''Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus'' (Kangaroo Island, Australia, 1827)

===[[Tinamiformes]]===
Tinamous
* [[Magdalena tinamou]], ''Crypturellus (erythropus) saltuarius'' (Colombia, late 20th century?)
:Variously considered a [[red-legged tinamou]] subspecies or a distinct species, this bird is currently only known with certainty from the 1943 [[type specimen]]. An additional specimen exists (or existed), but its present whereabouts is unknown. Recent research suggest it is still extant, and there was a likely – although as yet unconfirmed – record near the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] by Colombian [[ornithologist]] Oswaldo Cortés in late 2008.

===[[Anseriformes]]===
[[Duck]]s, [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s
* [[Bering cackling goose]], ''Branta hutchinsii asiatica'' (Komandorski and Kuril Islands, N Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1914 or 1929)
:A subspecies of the [[cackling goose]] (formerly "lesser Canada goose") which is doubtfully distinct from the Aleutian one.
* Rennell Island teal, ''Anas gibberifrons remissa'' (Rennell, Solomon Islands, c.&amp;nbsp;1959)
:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the [[Sunda teal]], which disappeared due to predation on young birds by introduced [[tilapia]] ''[[Oreochromis mossambicus]]''.&lt;!-- AmMusNovit486; Auk59:90 --&gt;
* Niceforo's pintail, ''Anas georgica niceforoi'' (Colombia, 1950s)
:A [[yellow-billed pintail]] subspecies that has not been recorded since the 1950s.
* Borrero's cinnamon teal, ''Anas cyanoptera borreroi'' (Colombia, mid-20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[cinnamon teal]] known only from a restricted area in the Cordillera Occidental of Colombia, with a couple of records from Ecuador. It was discovered in 1946 and thought to be extinct by 1956.
* Coues's gadwall, ''Anas strepera couesi'' (Teraina, Kiribati, c.1900)
:This subspecies of the [[gadwall]] was discovered in 1874 and has not been recorded since, with none found by a 1924 expedition from Honolulu's Bishop Museum.

===[[Galliformes]]===
[[Quail]]s and relatives
* Italian grey partridge, ''Perdix perdix italica'' (Italy, 1980s)
:A subspecies of the [[grey partridge]] whose validity has been questioned; the last purebred individuals disappeared during the late 1980s due to hybridization with introduced birds.
* [[Lake Amik]] black francolin, ''Francolinus francolinus billypayni'' (S Turkey, possibly Lebanon, 1960s)
:A doubtfully distinct subspecies of the [[black francolin]].
* Sicilian black francolin, ''Francolinus francolinus'' ssp. (Sicily, Mediterranean, c.1869)
:Another doubtfully distinct [[black francolin]] subspecies.
* [[Heath hen]], ''Tympanuchus cupido cupido'', (New England, North America, 1932)
:A subspecies of the [[greater prairie-chicken]] or possibly a distinct species.
* New Mexico sharp-tailed grouse, ''Tympanuchus phasianellus hueyi'' (New Mexico, North America, 1950s)
:[[Sharp-tailed grouse]] subspecies last recorded in Colfax County in 1952.
* Moroccan guineafowl, ''Numida meleagris sabyi'' (Morocco, mid-late 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[helmeted guineafowl]]. Reportedly still kept in captivity in Morocco in the late 1990s. Possibly extinct in the wild by 1950, three records from the 1970s may refer to feral-domestic hybrids.

===[[Charadriiformes]]===
[[Shorebird]]s, [[gull]]s and [[auk]]s
* Kiritimati sandpiper, ''Prosobonia cancellata cancellata'' (Kiritimati, Kiribati, 19th century?)
:The doubtfully distinct nominate subspecies of the [[Tuamotu sandpiper]], sometimes considered a distinct species, but only known from a painting.
* Andalusian hemipode, ''Turnix sylvatica sylvatica'' (Mediterranean region, extant)

* Tawitawi small buttonquail, ''Turnix sylvatica suluensis'' (Tawitawi, Philippines, mid-20th century?)
:A [[small buttonquail]] subspecies. It has not been recorded since the 1950s, but there have been few surveys and it is likely to persist.
* New Caledonia painted buttonquail, ''Turnix varius novaecaledoniae'' (New Caledonia, Melanesia, early 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[painted buttonquail]] that has been variously considered anything from a hybrid between introduced species to a full species. Plentiful subfossil bones indicate that it was indeed a good endemic form. The last specimen was taken in 1912 and surveys since have failed to record it.

===[[Gruiformes]]===

:A [[nankeen night heron]] subspecies.
* Principe olive ibis, ''Bostrychia olivacea rothschildi'' (Principe, Gulf of Guinea, extant)
:A subspecies of the [[olive ibis]], or (as ''B. bocagei rothschildi'') the São Tomé ibis if this is considered a distinct species. It was unrecorded through most of the 20th century and has been considered extinct, but was recorded on multiple occasions in the 1990s and should now be considered extant.

* [[Lord Howe pigeon]], ''Columba vitiensis godmanae'' (Lord Howe Island, Southwest Pacific, 1853)
:[[Metallic pigeon]] subspecies last recorded in 1853, and almost certainly extinct by 1869.
* Tongan metallic pigeon, ''Columba vitiensis'' ssp. (Vava'u, Tonga, late 18th century?)
:This subspecies of the metallic pigeon is only known from a footnote in [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]]'s ''General History of Birds'', and seems to have died out some time before 1800; possibly, the location is erroneous and the note really refers to the extant population on Fiji.
*Amirante turtle-dove, ''Nesoenas picturata aldabrana'' (Amirante Islands, Seychelles, late 20th century)
:This subspecies of the [[Malagasy turtle dove]] persisted until at least 1974, after which it was hybridised out of existence through breeding with the introduced nominate subspecies.
* Catanduanes bleeding-heart, ''Gallicolumba luzonica rubiventris'' (Catanduanes, Philippines, late 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[Luzon bleeding-heart]] known from a single specimen collected in 1971. There have been recent reports of the taxon and as much of its forest habitat remains it is likely to be extant.
* Basilan bleeding-heart, ''Gallicolumba crinigera bartletti'' (Basilan, Philippines, mid-20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[Mindanao bleeding-heart]], it was last reported in 1925 and given the massive habitat destruction is likely extinct.

:The Central Tuamotu subspecies of the [[Polynesian ground dove]], often referred to as ''G. e. pectoralis'', disappeared at an undetermined date, but might still exist on some unsurveyed atolls. The identity of northern Tuamotu populations, possibly still extant, is undetermined.
* Ebon crimson-crowned fruit dove, ''Ptilinopus porphyraceus marshallianus'' (Ebon?, Marshall Islands, late 19th century?)
:[[Crimson-crowned fruit dove]] subspecies of doubtful validity. Known from a single specimen collected in 1859, it is not certain whether this bird actually occurred on Ebon. All that can be said is that this subspecies is no longer found anywhere.
* Mauke fruit dove, ''Ptilinopus rarotongensis "byronensis"'' (Mauke, Cook Islands, mid- or late 19th century)
:A subspecies of the [[lilac-crowned fruit dove]], known only from the description of a now-lost specimen. the prehistorically extinct population on [[Mangaia]] is likely to belong to another distinct subspecies too.

:[[Spotted imperial pigeon]] subspecies not recorded since the 1950s.
* [[Norfolk pigeon]], ''Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae spadicea'' (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, early 20th century)
:A subspecies of the [[New Zealand pigeon]] not recorded since 1900. Similar birds were reported from Lord Howe Island; these seem to represent another extinct subspecies but are undescribed to date.

* [[Sinú parakeet]], ''Pyrrhura picta subandina'' (Colombia, mid-20th century?)
:Formerly recognized as a distinct species, this bird has a very restricted distribution and was last reliably recorded in 1949. It was not found during searches in 2004 and 2006 and seems to be extinct; efforts to find it again continue but are hampered by the threat of armed conflict.
* Challenger's lory, ''Eos histrio challengeri'' (Nenusa Islands, Talaud Archipelago, early 20th century?)

:[[Red-crowned parakeet]] subspecies.
* [[Réunion parakeet]], ''Psittacula eques eques'' (Réunion, Mascarenes, mid-18th century)
:Known only from a painting and descriptions; if it is accepted as valid, it would become the nominate subspecies of the [[Mauritius parakeet]], extant on Mauritius, which would then have to be called ''P. eques echo''.

===[[Falconiformes]]===
[[Bird of prey|Birds of prey]]
* [[Cape Verde kite]], ''Milvus ''(''milvus'')'' fasciicauda'' (Cape Verde Islands, E Atlantic, 2000)
:Considered either a subspecies of the [[red kite]], a distinct species, or a hybrid between [[Red kite|red]] and [[black kite]]s, the validity of this taxon has recently being questioned on the basis of molecular analysis. However, hybridization and a confusing molecular phylogeny of red kite populations coupled with the distinct phenotype of the Cape Verde birds suggest that the taxonomic status of this form is far from resolved.
* Car Nicobar sparrowhawk, ''Accipiter butleri butleri'' (Car Nicobar, Nicobar Islands, 20th century?)
: The nominate subspecies of the [[Nicobar sparrowhawk]]– which is currently listed as [[endangered species|vulnerable]]– is possibly extinct. It was last reliably recorded in 1901 and despite searches, has not been sighted after an unconfirmed record in 1977. However, the species is known for being very shy and a population may persist unrecorded.
* Volcano Islands peregrine falcon,  ''Falco peregrinus furuitii''. (Ogasawara Islands, 1940s)
:[[Peregrine falcon]] subspecies from the [[Ogasawara Islands]]. No sightings since 1945. A survey in 1982 failed to find this bird. Only known from [[Iwo Jima]] and [[Torishima (Izu Islands)|Torishima]].&lt;!-- Uncertain distinctness as there is a phylogenetic relationship with F. p. pealei. [no, they just look somewhat similar.] --&gt;

* Virgin Islands screech owl, ''Megascops nudipes newtoni'' (Virgin Islands, Caribbean, 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[Puerto Rican screech owl]] of somewhat doubtful validity which occurred on several of the Virgin Islands, West Indies. The last reliable records are in 1860; there were a number of unconfirmed reports during the 20th century, but it was not found in thorough surveys in 1995.
* Socorro elf owl, ''Micrathene whitneyi graysoni'' (Socorro, Revillagigedo Islands, mid-20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[elf owl]]. Officially listed as critically endangered, the last specimen was taken in 1932, but there apparently still was a large population in 1958; it was not found by subsequent searches and appears to be extinct.
* Antiguan burrowing owl, ''Athene cunicularia amaura'' (Antigua, St Kitts and Nevis, West Indies, c. 1900)
:[[Burrowing owl]] subspecies last collected in 1890 and extinct by 1903.

* [[Norfolk boobook]], ''Ninox novaeseelandiae undulata'' (Norfolk Island, Southwest Pacific, 1990s)
:Individuals of the [[Southern boobook|nominate subspecies]] were introduced in a last-ditch effort to save the local owl population. There now exists a hybrid population of a few dozen birds; the last individual of ''N. n. undulata'', a female named ''Miamiti'' died in 1996, though individuals descended from her remain.
* Cave-nesting masked owl, ''Tyto novaehollandiae troughtoni'' (Nullarbor Plain, Australia, 1960s)
:Doubtfully distinct from [[Australian masked owl|nominate subspecies]], but differed behaviorally.
* Buru masked owl, ''Tyto sororcula cayelii'' (Buru, Indonesia, mid-20th century?)
:Subspecies of [[lesser masked owl]]. Last recorded in 1921; the identity of a similar bird found on Seram remains to be determined. Seems to survive as an owl matching this bird's description was encountered in August 2006.&lt;!-- http://extinctanimals.proboards22.com/index.cgi?board=rediscoveredbirds&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1118209580 --&gt;
* Peleng masked owl, ''Tyto rosenbergii pelengensis'' (Peleng, Banggai Islands, mid-20th century)
:Subspecies of [[Sulawesi owl]] or separate species. Possibly extant, but only specimen known taken in 1938 and no further records.
* Samar bay owl, ''Phodilus badius riverae'' (Samar, Philippines, mid-20th century)
:Subspecies of [[Oriental bay owl]] or possibly distinct species. Taxonomy doubtful but only specimen lost in 1945 bombing raid so validity cannot be verified; no population exists on Samar today.

===[[Caprimulgiformes]]===
[[Nightjar]]s and allies
* New Caledonian white-throated nightjar, ''Eurostopodus mystacalis exsul'' (New Caledonia, Melanesia, mid-20th century)
:This distinct subspecies of the [[white-throated nightjar]] is possibly a separate species. It was found only once; due to its cryptic habits, it possibly still exists, but this is now considered unlikely.

===[[Apodiformes]]===
[[Swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s
* Miravalles hummingbird, ''Amazilia cyanifrons alfaroana'' (Costa Rica, Central America, 20th century?)
:This subspecies of the [[indigo-capped hummingbird]] is only known from a specimen collected in Costa Rica in 1895. It is likely to have gone extinct since

:[[Juan Fernández firecrown]] subspecies last recorded in 1908.
* Luzon Whitehead's swiftlet, ''Collocalia whiteheadi whiteheadi'' (Luzon, Philippines, 20th century?)
:The nominate subspecies of [[Whitehead's swiftlet]] is only known from four specimens collected at [[Mount Data]] in 1895. From the lack of further records and the massive habitat destruction, it is usually considered extinct. Given the size of the island, it might still exist though.

===[[Coraciiformes]]===
[[Kingfisher]]s and related birds
* Sangihe dwarf kingfisher, ''Ceyx fallax sangirensis'' ([[Sangihe Islands|Sangihe]], Indonesia, 1998?)
:This subspecies of the [[Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher]] was last seen in 1997 but not during a thorough survey one year later; it is either close to extinction or already extinct. Sometimes it is said to occur on Talaud Islands also, but this is erroneous.
* Rarotonga kingfisher, ''Todiramphus'' cf. ''tutus'' (Rarotonga, Cook Islands, mid-1980s?)
:There exist reports of locals that kingfishers– probably a subspecies of the [[chattering kingfisher]] which is found on neighboring islands, but possibly vagrants from there– were found until around 1979, and there is a last record from 1984. Presently, no kingfishers are known to exist on Rarotonga.&lt;!-- Notornis 28 (1) p.84 --&gt;
* Mangareva kingfisher, ''Todiramphus gambieri gambieri'' (Mangareva, Gambier Islands, late 19th century)

*Guam kingfisher, ''Todiramphus cinnamominus cinnamominus'' (Guam, West Pacific, 1986)
:This subspecies of the [[Micronesian kingfisher]] became extinct in the wild in 1986 when 29 birds were taken for a captive breeding programme, which is ongoing. Its decline was caused by the depredations of introduced [[brown tree snake]]s.
* [[Ryūkyū kingfisher]], ''Todiramphus cinnamominus miyakoensis'' (Miyako-jima, Ryukyu Islands, late 19th century)
:Previously considered as full species but better regarded as subspecies of the [[Micronesian kingfisher]] ''Todiramphus cinnamominus''. Only seen once by scientists, in 1887; the specimen taken is somewhat damaged, making identification by other than molecular analysis difficult. It is now thought likely that the specimen came from Guam, where the nominate subspecies was distributed, rather than Miyako, which would make this subspecies invalid.
* Javan blue-banded kingfisher, ''Alcedo euryzona euryzona'' (Java, Indonesia, extant)
:The nominate subspecies of the [[blue-banded kingfisher]]; the last specimen was taken in 1937 and the taxon has been considered extinct, but it was mist-netted five times in 2000-2001 at Halimun National Park, which has not undergone much change since.
* Guadalcanal little kingfisher, ''Alcedo pusilla aolae'' (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, ?)
:[[Little kingfisher]] subspecies
* Sakarha pygmy kingfisher, ''Ispidina madagascariensis dilutus'' (Southwest Madagascar, late 20th century?)
:This subspecies of the [[Madagascar pygmy kingfisher]] is only known from one specimen taken in 1974 in an area where most habitat had already been lost. However there have been records of the species (uncertain subspecies) from near the type locality, suggesting it is likely to be extant.
* Ticao hornbill, ''Penelopides panini ticaensis'' (Ticao, Philippines, 1970s)
:A subspecies of the [[Visayan hornbill]] of somewhat uncertain status– possibly a distinct species, possibly a color morph– the last confirmed report was in 1971 and it became extinct shortly thereafter.

* Guadalupe red-shafted flicker, ''Colaptes cafer rufipileus'' (Guadalupe, East Pacific, c.&amp;nbsp;1910)
:A subspecies of the red-shafted flicker (or the [[northern flicker]], as ''C. auratus rufipileus''), it was last recorded in 1906 and not found anymore in 1911 and 1922. Recently, vagrant birds of a mainland subspecies have begun recolonizing the island as the habitat improves after the removal of feral goats.
* Northern white-mantled barbet, ''Capito hypoleucus hypoleucus'' (Colombia, extant)
:The nominate subspecies of the [[white-mantled barbet]] has been considered extinct, but has been recorded recently.

:Another subspecies of the [[White-mantled barbet]] also considered extinct by some sources but confirmed extant by researchers in Colombia.
* Todd's jacamar, ''Brachygalba lugubris phaeonota'' (Brazil, late 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[brown jacamar]], or possibly a hybrid, color morph or full species. Might survive as it is only known from a remote and seldom visited area.
* Cebu white-bellied woodpecker, ''Dryocopus javensis cebuensis'' (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century)
:Only known by 3 specimens collected before 1900.

===[[Passeriformes]]===

* Peruvian scale-throated earthcreeper, ''Upucerthia dumetaria peruana'' (Peru, 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[scale-throated earthcreeper]], it is only known from 2 specimens taken in the early 1950s at Puno, Peru, and has never been found since. It may well persist as there is no obvious reason why it should have become extinct.
* Northern stripe-crowned spinetail, ''Cranioleuca pyrrhophia rufipennis'' (N Bolivia, 20th century?)
:A [[stripe-crowned spinetail]] subspecies known from a few specimens and not recorded since the 1950s; may be endangered or possibly extinct.

* Cebu blackish cuckooshrike, ''Coracina coerulescens altera'' (Cebu, Philippines, 20th century?)
:A [[blackish cuckooshrike]] subspecies; could be extant as the birds are rather unmistakable and a 1999 record therefore likely to be valid, though surveys since then have failed to find it/
* Marinduque blackish cuckooshrike, ''Coracina coerulescens deschauenseei'' (Marinduque, Philippines, late 20th century?)
:Another [[blackish cuckooshrike]] subspecies, described from specimens collected in 1971, but apparently not seen since. As few ornithologists have visited Marinduque and forest remains on the island, it is thought likely to remain extant.

'''[[Acrocephalidae]]''' &amp;ndash; acrocephalid warblers or marsh- and tree warblers
* Marshall Islands reed warbler, ''Acrocephalus rehsei'' ssp.? (Marshall Islands, Micronesia, c.1880?)
:Oral tradition and some early reports mention a bird called ''annañ'' which inhabited some of the Marshall Islands. The best match is the [[Nauru reed warbler]]; the ''annañ'' might have been an undescribed subspecies of that species, or a distant but related species of reed warbler.&lt;ref name = spennemann2006 /&gt;
* [[Laysan millerbird]], ''Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris'' (Laysan Island, Hawaiian Islands, late 1910s)

* Vanua Levu long-legged warbler, ''Trichocichla rufa clunei'' (Vanua Levu, Fiji, late 20th century?)
:A subspecies of the [[long-legged warbler]]; it was only found once, but there was an unconfirmed sighting in 1990 suggesting it is likely to remain extant. Placement in Sylviidae doubtful.
* Fayyum warbler, ''Sylvia melanocephala/momus norissae'' (Egypt, 1939)
:A doubtfully distinct [[Sardinian warbler]] subspecies. It has not been recorded since 1939.

'''[[Zosteropidae]]''' &amp;ndash; white-eyes. Probably belong into Timaliidae

The '''S.E.A.

===Collection===
The S.E.A. Aquarium houses the world's largest collection of [[manta ray]]s, including the only [[giant oceanic manta ray]] in captivity. It also showcases 24 [[Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[scalloped hammerhead shark]]s, the [[Japanese spider crab]], and relatively uncommonly-exhibited species such as the [[guitarfish]] and the [[chambered nautilus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Relax/Story/A1Story20130408-414465.html | title=Marine Life Park visitors get 1st glimpse of dolphins | publisher=asiaone | date=2013-04-08 | accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shopping ===
The gift shop located at the exit of S.E.A. Aquarium sells a variety of souvenirs.&lt;ref name=attractions/&gt;

=== Controversies ===
The resort originally planned to include [[whale shark]]s, but conceded that it might not be feasible to house them and has dropped the plan.&lt;ref name="no_whale_sharks"&gt;{{cite news| title = No whale sharks at Sentosa IR | date = 16 May 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2010 | url = http://wildsingaporenews.blogspot.com/2009/05/no-whale-sharks-at-sentosa-ir.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing controversy over captures of wild dolphins from Solomon Islands and the facilities in which they are kept in [[Subic Bay]], Philippines. On 14 October 2012, [[Quezon City]] court issued a 72-hour temporary environment protection order to block the re-export of the dolphins to Marine Life Park, following a civil rights suit filed by animal rights groups. RWS spokesperson reiterated that the resort's acquisition of the 25 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins adhere to regulations governed by the United Nations Environment Programme under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1231886/1/.html | title = Philippine court lifts order preventing export of dolphins to S'pore | publisher = Channel News Asia | date = 17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another appeal was made and the exports to Singapore were temporarily held. When the hold had expired, RWS exported the dolphins while the court appeal was ongoing. On the flight to Singapore, one of the dolphins, Wen Wen, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1238913/1/.html | title=Dolphin bound for Marine Life Park dies en route to Singapore | publisher=Channel NewsAsia | date=22 November 2012 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brings to three the number of dolphins that have died prior to the opening of the Dolphin Island section within the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Relax/Story/A1Story20121231-392639.html | title=A peek at the Marine Life Park dolphins | publisher=Asia One | date=31 December 2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">The '''Division of Ecological Restoration''' (DER) is a Division of the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game within the [[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]]. DER was created in 2009 with the merger of the Riverways and Wetlands Restoration Programs. DER coordinates ecological restoration to improve ecological condition and to restore important [[ecosystem services]] that improve the quality of life for all Massachusetts citizens.

The Riverways Program ([https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter21a MGL Chapter 21A Section 8]) has been maintained within DER and coordinates outreach and technical assistance to support [[drainage divide|watershed]] conservation and protection.

The Division and partners facilitate capital-based projects including (but not limited to) dam removal and [[culvert]] replacement with the goal of restoring [[aquatic habitat]]s (e.g. salt marshes)
and ecosystems across the state. These projects support commercial and recreational fisheries and provide many other benefits such as reduced flooding, improved water quality, [[carbon sequestration]] and increased public safety.

Ecological restoration is a core component of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts efforts to build habitat resiliency to better allow fish and wildlife to adapt to climate change – including sea level rise, elevated water temperatures, and increased floods and periods of drought.

[[File:Logo Tagline MADFG.jpg|thumbnail|Division of Ecological Restoration seal]]

Tim Purinton currently serves as the Director of the Division of Ecological Restoration.

==Philosophy==
*DER espouses a comprehensive, holistic approach to restoration, that prioritizes ecosystems over habitats.
*DER places an emphasis on restoring ecological processes, rather than species specific habitats, focusing on implementation of restoration actions at a watershed scale.
*DER staff identifies the most detrimental stressors in the larger watershed context and coordinates restoration actions to improve conditions in partnership with local organizations.
*DER bases its programs on engaging and working with stakeholders in the communities to maximize impact and stewardship.

[[File:Tree_on_the_Mongolian_steppe_(June_1997).jpg|thumb]]
The '''Mongolian-Manchurian grassland''' [[ecoregion]], also known as the '''Mongolian-Manchurian steppe''', in the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grassland]] [[Biome]], is found in [[Mongolia]], the [[Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Autonomous region]] of [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Northeast China|northeastern China]].

==Setting==
The Mongolian-Manchurian grassland covers an area of {{convert|887,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. This [[Palearctic]] temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands [[ecoregion]] of the [[Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[Biome]], forms a large crescent around the [[Gobi Desert]], extending across central and eastern [[Mongolia]] into the eastern portion of [[Inner Mongolia]] and eastern and central [[Manchuria]], and then southwest across the [[North China Plain]]. To the northeast and north, the [[Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe|Selenge-Orkhon]] and [[Daurian forest steppe|Daurian]] [[forest steppe]]s form a transition zone between the grassland and the forests of [[Siberia]] to the north. On the east and southeast, the grasslands transition to [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], including the [[Manchurian mixed forests]], [[Northeast China Plain deciduous forests]], and [[Central China loess plateau mixed forests]]. On the southwest, the grasslands extend to the [[Yellow River]], across which is the [[Ordos Plateau steppe]].

The law of the steppes allowed people to take what they wished - but that ensured fighting between tribes.  The history of [[Genghis Khan]] records that he believed one cannot fight a battle one cannot win.  On the other hand, a determined person can accomplish great things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/Genghis-Khan-Life-on-the-Steppes//1|title=Genghis Khan - Life on the Steppes|website=AwesomeStories.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The dominant flora consists of medium to tall grasslands, dominated by [[Stipa|feather grass]] (''Stipa baicalensis'', ''S. capillata'', and ''S. grandis''), [[sheep's fescue]] (''Festuca ovina''), ''Aneurolepidium chinense'', ''Filifolium sibiricuman,'' and ''Cleistogenes sqarrosa''. The drier regions surrounding the Gobi host drought-tolerant grasses, together with forbs and low, spiny shrubs.

The southwestern slopes of the [[Greater Khingan]] range support pockets of broadleaf deciduous forest, of either [[Mongolian oak]] (''Quercus mongolica''), or a mixture of [[Populus|poplar]] (''[[Populus davidiana]]'' and ''[[Populus suaveolens|P. suaveolens]]''), [[Siberian silver birch]] (''Betula platyphylla''), and [[willow]] (''[[Salix rorida]]).''

==Fauna==
*The [[brown eared-pheasant]] (''Crossoptilon mantchuricum'') is the sole endemic bird in the ecoregion.
*The [[bobak marmot]] (''Marmota bobak''), also known as the steppe marmot, inhabits the area
*The [[gray wolf]] lives here.
*The [[Mongolian gazelle]] is numerous here.
*The [[Przewalski's horse]] is reintroduced here.
*The [[corsac fox]]
*eagles

==Conservation and threats==
The Mongolian-Manchurian grassland faces threat from human expansion, though in most of its eastern area, it has not been altered by agriculture as much as its reaches in western Asia, or similar grasslands in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPENVIRONMENT/0,,contentMDK:21019441~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502886,00.html Environment in East Asia &amp; Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savesteppe.org/en/threats-to-steppes|title=Structure of threats to steppe biome in Russia - Conservation of steppes in Russia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mount Tate'''|立山|Tate-yama|{{IPA-ja|tate|IPA}}}}, commonly referred to as simply '''Tateyama''', is a mountain located in the southeastern area of [[Toyama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. It is one of the tallest mountains in the [[Hida Mountains]] at {{Convert|3015|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and, along with [[Mount Fuji]] and [[Mount Haku]], it is one of Japan's {{Nihongo|"[[Three Holy Mountains]]"|三霊山|Sanreizan}}. Tateyama is a term for the mountain consisting of three peaks: Ōnanjiyama (大汝山, 3,015m), Oyama (雄山, 3,003m), and Fuji-no-Oritateyama, (富士ノ折立, 2,999m)&lt;ref&gt;http://maps.gsi.go.jp/#15/36.575910/137.619592/&amp;base=std&amp;ls=std&amp;disp=1&amp;vs=c1j0l0u0f0&lt;/ref&gt; which run along a ridge (see photo). Tateyama is the tallest mountain in the Tateyama Mountain Range (立山連峰, Tateyama-renpō).

It was first climbed by [[Saeki no Ariyori]] during Japan's [[Asuka period]]. The area was designated the [[Chūbu-Sangaku National Park]] on December 4, 1934.&lt;ref name="npark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/parks/chubu.html|title=Chūbu-Sangaku National Park|publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)]]|accessdate=January 28, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227172634/http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/parks/chubu.html|archivedate=February 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsi.go.jp/KOKUJYOHO/MOUNTAIN/mountain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The ''[[kanji]]'' for the mountain (立山 ''Tateyama''), which is called Tateyama in Japanese, mean "standing 立 or outstanding 顕" and "mountain", respectively. The pronunciation of ''tate'' is two syllables similar to ''tah-tei'' rather than ''gate''. The Toyama Prefectural Government uses the name Mount Tateyama as an official translation of the Japanese mountain. English-speaking locals tend to use the Japanese name '''Tateyama''' when referring to the mountain.

==Geology==
The mountain is composed primarily of [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]. However, located along the ridge and plateau about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the summit is a small [[andesite]]-[[dacite]] [[stratovolcano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gvp|id=0803-08= |name=Tate-yama}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volcano has an elevation of {{Convert|2621|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and has had minor historical eruptions, the latest in 1839.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Tateyama is located in southeastern Toyama Prefecture. At the base of the mountain is the town of [[Tateyama, Toyama|Tateyama]], which is accessible by train from the prefecture's capital city, [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]]. Public transportation will take climbers and tourists as far as the Murodo Plateau Station at an elevation of {{Convert|2450|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, from where individuals may climb to the peak on foot. These are the only [[glacier]]s identified in Japan so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201802070001.html |title=3 snow patches in central Japan certified as glaciers |journal=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountain sights ==
Located by the Oyama peak is Oyama Shrine, where climbers can receive a blessing and warm ''[[sake]]'' from a priest. There is also a rest area where climbers may buy food, drinks, and souvenirs. This peak is better known but it is some way from the highest point of the mountain (Onanjiyama).

On Murodo Plateau the contains [[Murodō Station]] is a shopping area and [[onsen]] bath. The onsen on Tateyama is famously known for its use of sulfur spring water for the bath, leaving a noticeable aroma that can be detected even while ascending the mountain. Visitors can also find several hiking and walking paths that take them through the beautiful valleys, and take a look at Devil's Valley (Jigokudani). With many volcanic areas in Japan by the same name, visitors are no longer able to walk within the sulfur valley due to gas-related safety concerns. Murodo is a great place to hike from mid-July to mid-November. The summer months are dappled with greenery and some leftover snow from winter, while from mid-September, visitors can enjoy bright autumn colors along the entire route.

There are charter services from [[Taipei]], [[Inchon]] and [[Thailand]] during the high season to reach Murodo.

From Murodo, visitors can also reach [[Kurobe Dam]], which stands at 186 meters (610 feet), making it the tallest dam in Japan. From [[Murodō Station]], visitors should take the [[Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus]] (10 minutes), followed by the [[Tateyama Ropeway]] (7 minutes), and finally the [[Kurobe Cable Car]] (5 minutes). From the last stop, a 15-minute walk will take visitors to the dam.

Midagahara is a flat walking area filled with flowing plains interrupted by blue ponds. Near the bus stop that returns visitors to Bijodaira back down the mountain is a slightly hidden walking path. Midagahara is accessible from [[Tateyama Station (Toyama)|Tateyama Station]] via the [[Tateyama Cable Car]] (7 minutes) followed by [[Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route]] bus (about 40 minutes) that goes in the direction of [[Murodō Station]].

On clear days, climbers can see [[Shōmyō Falls]] (the tallest waterfall in Japan) across the valley while traveling along the main road from Tateyama Station to the Murodo Plateau. For a closer look, visitors can take a bus from Tateyama Station to the [[Shōmyō Falls]] stop (about 20 minutes). From there, visitors can walk to the falls up a steady slope (about 20 minutes). There is a large bridge as well as two viewing platforms to get views of the Falls.

The '''Novato meteorite''' is an [[ordinary chondrite]] which entered the earth's atmosphere and broke up at 19:44 [[Pacific time]] on 17 October 2012. The [[bolide|fireball]] created [[sonic boom]]s and fragmented.&lt;ref name="AMS"/&gt; The meteoroid was about {{convert|35|cm|sp=us}} across.&lt;ref name="Space2014"/&gt;

==Meteorite==
The first fragment of the meteorite (N01) was recovered by Lisa Webber on 20 October after reading a story in the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] that described the NASA/CAMS meteor trajectory predicting a fall area in the [[North Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|North Bay]].&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; Lisa recalled hearing a sound on her roof the night of the meteor and went outside and located a 62 gram stone. Analysis of fragment N01 by Dr. Alan Rubin came back as a [[L chondrite|L6 breccia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/metsoc2013/pdf/5213.pdf] {{cite journal |last1=Buseman |first1=H.

The second fragment was found by Brien Cook on 22 October (66 grams) and the third fragment was found by Jason Utas on 27 October (79 grams).&lt;ref name="Jenniskens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utas"/&gt; The largest fragment recovered as of 5 November 2012 is N04 at 96 grams found by Robert Verish on 27 October.&lt;ref name="Verish"/&gt; A fifth stone (N05) weighing 24 grams was found by Jason Utas on November 2.&lt;ref name="Utas"/&gt; A sixth stone (N06) weighing 23.7 grams was found by the Kane family on November 11.&lt;ref name="Verish"/&gt;  More massive {{convert|1|kg}} fragments may have fallen near [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] with any {{convert|10|kg}} fragments possibly falling near [[Yountville, California|Yountville]].&lt;ref name="CAMS"/&gt;

This was the second significant meteorite in California in 2012, the first being the [[Sutter's Mill meteorite]].

== Project description and goals ==
'''PROITERES''' ('''Project of OIT Electric-Rocket-Engine Onboard Small Space Ship''') or '''大阪工業大学 電気推進ロケットエンジン搭載小型スペースシッププロジェクト''' in Japanese is a [[satellite]] launched by [[ISRO]] in 2012 for [[Osaka Institute of Technology]](OIT). This small (15&amp;nbsp;kg) boxlike system, with [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s on the hull, is the testbench for the 4.4 W [[Pulsed Plasma Thruster]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oit.ac.jp/elc/~satellite/image/engine.pdf PROITERES Pulsed Plasma Thruster (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; operating on the [[Miniaturized satellite#Microsatellite|microsatellite]] platform. The total power budget of the satellite is 15 watt.

PROITERES' secondary goals, as stated by the manufacturer, are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/proiteres.htm PROITERES stated goals]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Experiments of two-way radio signal propagation characteristics using amateur radio (430&amp;nbsp;MHz) band.
* Communication tests of satellite communication technology using off-the-shelf consumer-grade components.
* Tracking and communicating by [[amateur radio]] users around the world.
* Monitoring with a high-resolution camera the Yodogawa basin near Osaka and other parts of Kansai District.

It is equipped with 3-axis magnetic torquers and gyro-sensors for [[attitude control]] (orientation), a magnetic sensor on the boom, a solar sensor, and the CMOS camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oit.ac.jp/elc/~satellite/SysDiag.html PROITERES system diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;!--clarify the type of camera (spectrum) it is.--&gt;

== Failure ==
As in 2013, '''PROITERES''' does not respond to any ground commands, although still broadcasting [[telemetry]] data.  According to the PROITERES development team report on 17 January 2014 at JAXA annual symposium, the PROITERES had a design error resulting in the flight computer engaged in a [[Booting|boot]] loop. The root cause of the boot loop was the electromagnetic incompatibility issue, resulting in a reset signal being generated if power-up ramp rate of the flight computer is high enough.

The Osaka Institute of Technology team abandoned attempts to restore communications with PROITERES satellite and proceeded with development of the PROITERES-2 design.

Bowyer Bible.gif|thumb|300px|Etching by [[Jan Luyken]] showing the triumphant return of the shepherd, from the [[Bowyer Bible]].]] The '''Parable of the Lost Sheep''' is one of the [[parables of Jesus]].  It appears in the [[Gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse|Matthew|18:12–14|NIV}}) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:3–7|NIV}}). It is about a shepherd who leaves his flock of ninety-nine sheep in order to find the one which is lost. It is the first member of a trilogy about [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] that Jesus tells after the [[Pharisees]] and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with "sinners."&lt;ref name="RNL"&gt;[[Richard Longenecker|Richard N. Longenecker]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JojVvncUgk0C&amp;pg=PA201 The Challenge of Jesus' Parables]'', Eerdmans, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8028-4638-6}}, pp. 201–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The two parables that follow (in Luke's Gospel) are those of the [[Parable of the Lost Coin|Lost Coin]] and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son|Prodigal Son]]. The parable of the [[Good shepherd]], a [[pericope]] found in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:1|John 10:1-21]], derives from it.{{who says|date=June 2018}}

== Narrative ==
In the Gospel of Luke, the parable is as follows:

{{quotation|He told them this parable. "Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn't leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it? When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing. When he comes home, he calls together his friends, his family and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance."|Luke 15:3-7, [[World English Bible]]}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Champaigne shepherd.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Depiction of the [[Good Shepherd]] by [[Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne]] showing the influence of this parable.]]

The parable shares themes of loss, searching, and rejoicing with the [[Parable of the Lost Coin]].&lt;ref name="RNL"/&gt; The lost sheep or coin represents a lost human being.

As in the analogy of the [[Good Shepherd]], Jesus is the shepherd, thus identifying himself with the image of God as a shepherd searching for stray sheep in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] {{bibleverse|Ezekiel|34:11–16|NIV}}.&lt;ref name="RNL"/&gt; [[Joel B. Green]] writes that "these parables are fundamentally about God, ... their aim is to lay bare the nature of the divine response to the recovery of the lost."&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[[Joel B. Green]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wzRVN2S8cVgC&amp;pg=PA526 The Gospel of Luke]'', Eerdmans, 1997, {{ISBN|0-8028-2315-7}}, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rejoicing of the shepherd with his friends represents God rejoicing with the angels. The image of God rejoicing at the recovery of lost sinners contrasts with the criticism of the religious leaders which prompted the parable.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt;

==Depiction in art==
The image from this parable of the shepherd placing the lost sheep on his shoulders ({{bibleverse|Luke|15:5|NIV}}) has been widely incorporated into depictions of the Good Shepherd.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Lowrie, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0fwCGTzbMQ0C&amp;pg=PA69 Art in the Early Church]'', Pantheon Books, 1947, {{ISBN|1-4067-5291-6}}, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, this parable appears in art mostly as an influence on depictions of the Good Shepherd rather than as a distinct subject on its own.

==Hymns==
While there are innumerable references to the Good Shepherd image in Christian [[hymn]]s, specific references to this parable can be recognised by a mention of the ninety-nine other sheep.

Perhaps the best-known hymn describing this parable is "The Ninety and Nine" by [[Elizabeth C. Clephane]] (1868), which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the fold.
But one was out on the hills away,
Far off from the gates of gold.
Away on the mountains wild and bare.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.
Away from the tender Shepherd’s care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/n/i/90_and_9.htm The Cyber Hymnal: ''The Ninety and Nine''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23023">In astronomy a '''phase curve''' describes the brightness of a reflecting body as a function of its [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]. The brightness usually refers the object's [[absolute magnitude]], which, in turn, is its [[apparent magnitude]] at a distance of one [[astronomical unit]] from the Earth and Sun. The [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] equals the arc subtended by the observer and the sun as measured at the body.

The phase curve is useful for characterizing an object's [[regolith]] (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the [[geometrical albedo]] and the [[Bond albedo]] of the body. In [[ephemeris]] generation, the phase curve is used in conjunction with the distances from the object to the Sun and the Earth to calculate the apparent magnitude.

==Mercury==

[[File:Mercury Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and its opposition surge.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is very steep, which is characteristic of a body on which bare [[regolith]] (soil) is exposed to view. At phase angles exceeding 90° ([[crescent]] phase) the brightness falls off especially sharply. The shape of the phase curve indicates a mean slope on the surface of Mercury of about 16°,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; which is slightly smoother than that of the [[Moon]]. Approaching phase angle 0° (fully illuminated phase) the curve rises to a sharp peak. This surge in brightness is called the [[opposition effect]]&lt;ref Name="Shkuratov"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Helfenstein"/&gt; because for most bodies (though not Mercury) it occurs at astronomical opposition when the body is opposite from the Sun in the sky. The width of the opposition surge for Mercury indicates that both the compaction state of the regolith and the distribution of particle sizes on the planet are similar to those on the Moon.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;

Early visual observations contributing to the phase curve of Mercury were obtained by G. Muller&lt;ref name="Muller"/&gt; in the 1800s and by [[André-Louis Danjon]]&lt;ref name="Danjon1949"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1950"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danjon1953"/&gt; in the mid-twentieth century. W. Irvine and colleagues&lt;ref name="IrvineIII"/&gt; used photoelectric photometry in the 1960s. Some of these early data were analyzed by G. de Vaucouleurs,&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deVaucouleurs1970"/&gt; summarized by D. Harris&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and used for predicting apparent magnitudes in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton1992"/&gt; for several decades. Highly accurate new observations covering the widest range of phase angles to date (2 to 170°) were carried out by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; using the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph (LASCO)]] on the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)]] satellite. They also obtained new CCD observations from the ground. These data are now the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

The apparent brightness of Mercury as seen from Earth is greatest at phase angle 0° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|superior conjunction]] with the Sun) when it can reach magnitude −2.6.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; At phase angles approaching 180° ([[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]]) the planet fades to about magnitude +5&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; with the exact brightness depending on the phase angle at that particular [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]. This difference of more than 7 magnitudes corresponds to a change of over a thousand times in apparent brightness.

==Venus==

[[File:Venus Phase Curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Venus&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; compared to Mercury,&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt; and the brightness excess of Venus.]]

The relatively flat phase curve of [[Venus]] is characteristic of a cloudy planet.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination scattering angle of clouds, as opposed to the narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin [[crescent]], due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of [[sulfuric acid]] that are above the planet's cloud tops.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus"/&gt; Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.

The history of observation and analysis of the phase curve of Venus is similar to that of Mercury. The best set of modern observations and interpretation was reported by A. Mallama, D. Wang and R. Howard.&lt;ref name="MallamaVenus" /&gt; They used the [[LASCO Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph|LASCO]] instrument on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and ground-based, CCD equipment to observe the phase curve from 2 to 179°. As with Mercury, these new data are the major source of the phase curve used in the [[Astronomical Almanac]]&lt;ref name="Hilton2005"/&gt; for predicting apparent magnitudes.

In contrast to Mercury the maximal apparent brightness of Venus as seen from Earth does not occur at phase angle zero. Since the phase curve of Venus is relatively flat while its distance from the Earth can vary greatly, maximum brightness occurs when the planet is a crescent, at phase angle 125°, at which time Venus can be as bright as magnitude −4.9.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; Near [[conjunction (astronomy and astrology)#Superior and inferior|inferior conjunction]] the planet typically fades to about magnitude −3&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; although the exact value depends on the phase angle. The typical range in apparent brightness for Venus over the course of one apparition is less than a factor of 10 or merely 1% that of Mercury.

==Earth==

The phase curve of the [[Earth]] has not been determined as accurately as those for Mercury and Venus because its integrated brightness is difficult to measure from the surface. Instead of direct observation, [[earthshine]] reflected from the portion of the Moon not lit by the Sun has served as a proxy. A few direct measurements of the Earth's luminosity have been obtained with the [[EPOXI]] spacecraft. While they do not cover much of the phase curve they reveal a rotational light curve caused by the transit of dark oceans and bright land masses across the hemisphere. P. Goode and colleagues at [[Big Bear Solar Observatory]] have measured the earthshine&lt;ref Name="Goode"/&gt; and T. Livengood of NASA analyzed the EPOXI data.&lt;ref Name="Livengood"/&gt;

Earth as seen from Venus near opposition from the Sun would be extremely bright at magnitude −6. To an observer outside the Earth's orbit on Mars our planet would appear most luminous near the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun, at about magnitude −1.5.

==Mars==

[[File:Mars phase curve.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Mars&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

Only about 50° of the martian phase curve can be observed from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than our planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2004"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Schmude2006"/&gt; obtained many of the [[Mars]] brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama.&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

Because the orbit of Mars is considerably eccentric its brightness at opposition can range from magnitude −3.0 to −1.4.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The minimum brightness is about magnitude +1.6&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt; when Mars is on the opposite site of the Sun from the Earth. Rotational variations can elevate or suppress the brightness of Mars by 5% and global dust storms can increase its luminosity by 25%.&lt;ref name="MallamaSky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MallamaMars"/&gt;

==Gas giants==

The outermost planets ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) are so distant that only small portions of their phase curves near 0° (full phase) can be evaluated from the Earth. That part of the curve is generally fairly flat, like that of Venus, for these cloudy planets.

The apparent magnitude of Jupiter ranges from −2.9 to −1.4, Saturn from −0.5 to +1.4, Uranus from +5.3 to +6.0, and Neptune from +7.8 to +8.0. Most of these variations are due to distance. However, the magnitude range for Saturn also depends on its ring system as explained below.

==The rings of Saturn==

[[File:Saturn Phase Curve 2.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of Saturn, according to Schmude&lt;ref Name="Schmude2010"/&gt; demonstrating the opposition effect of the ring system.]]

The brightness of the Saturn system depends on the orientation of [[Rings of Saturn|its ring system]]. The rings contribute more to the overall brightness of the system when they are more inclined to the direction of illumination from the Sun and to the view of the observer. Wide open rings contribute about one magnitude of brightness to the disk alone.&lt;ref Name="MallamaSky"/&gt; The icy particles that compose the rings also produce a strong opposition surge. Hubble Space Telescope and Cassini spacecraft images have been analyzed in an attempt to characterize the ring particles based on their phase curves.&lt;ref Name="French"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Poulet"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Cuzzi"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Salo2010"/&gt;

==The Moon==

[[File:Moon Phase Curve 5.jpg|thumb|The phase curve of the Moon&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt; compared to Mercury.&lt;ref name="MallamaMercury"/&gt;]]

The phase curve of the [[Moon]] approximately resembles that of Mercury due to the similarities of the surfaces and the lack of an atmosphere on either body.&lt;ref name="Warell"/&gt; [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] spacecraft data analyzed by J. Hillier, B. Buratti and K. Hill&lt;ref Name="Hillier"/&gt; indicate a lunar opposition surge. The Moon's apparent magnitude at full phase is −12.7&lt;ref name="WilliamsMoon"/&gt; while at quarter phase it is 21 percent as bright.&lt;ref name="CoxMoon"/&gt;

==Planetary satellites==

The phase curves of many [[natural satellite]]s of other planets&lt;ref Name="Bauer"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Deau"/&gt; have been observed and interpreted. The icy moons often exhibit opposition brightness surges. This behavior has been used to model their surfaces.

==Asteroids==

The phase curves of many [[asteroid]]s&lt;ref Name="CoxAsteroids"/&gt; have also been observed and they too may exhibit opposition surges. Asteroids can be physically classified in this way.&lt;ref Name="Kaasalainen"/&gt; The effects of rotation can be very large and have to be factored in before the phase curve is computed. An example of such a study is reported by R. Baker and colleagues.&lt;ref Name="Baker"/&gt;

==Exoplanets==

Programs for characterizing planets outside of the solar system depend largely on spectroscopy to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama&lt;ref name="MallamaExo"/&gt; has demonstrated that phase curve analysis may be a useful tool for identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; has pointed out that phase curve anomalies such as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)#Venus|brightness excess of Venus]] could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to [[Extraterrestrial life|life in the universe]].

==Criticisms on phase curve modelling==

Inferences about regoliths from phase curves are frequently based on [[Hapke parameters|Hapke parameterization]]. However, in a blind test M. Shepard and P. Helfenstein&lt;ref Name="Shepard"/&gt; found no strong evidence that a particular set of [[Hapke parameters]] derived from photometric data could uniquely reveal the physical state of laboratory samples. These tests included modeling the three-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions and the coherent backscatter opposition effect. This negative finding suggests that the radiative transfer model developed by [[Bruce William Hapke|B. Hapke]] may be inadequate for physical modeling based on photometry.

'''''Play and Aggression: A Study of Rhesus Monkeys''''' is a 1978 book about play in the [[rhesus macaque]] by the anthropologist [[Donald Symons]]. The book was well-received, and Symons was credited with providing a detailed and useful discussion of his subject.

==Summary==
Symons discussed aggressive play in the rhesus macaque, arguing that as a "structured and coherent activity, aggressive play has a design." Symons provided information about sex differences in play, and behaviors that he referred to as "playchasing" and "playfighting". He suggested that "the adaptive function of aggressive play is to practice, or rehearse, and thereby to perfect behaviors used in high-intensity intraspecific aggression and in predator avoidance." He critically evaluated objections to the hypothesis that specific skills are practiced in play, discussed the nature and adaptive significance of skill, reviewed the history of attempts to characterize and define play, and critically discussed the idea that the function of play is to produce novel behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sym78|Symons 1978]]. pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Symons compared human play to that of non-human animals, attempted to explain differences in play between male and female rhesus macaques in terms of reproductive strategies, and argued that human warfare and animal fighting, as well as the developmental processes upon which they are based, are not homologous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sym78|Symons 1978]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Play and Aggression'' was reviewed by James Loy in the ''[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Loy79|Loy 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; Susan C. Wilson in ''Aggressive Behavior'',&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[#Wil79|Wilson 1979]]. p. 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt; and John D. Baldwin in ''[[American Anthropologist]]''.&lt;ref name="Baldwin" /&gt; Wilson reviewed the book positively, writing that it could be read for pleasure and that Symons convincingly argued that the "play-fighting of young rhesus monkeys is ''designed'' as practice for certain skills used by adults during fights." However, Wilson criticized Symons for making claims about play in general based only on the example of play in the rhesus macaque.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Baldwin credited Symons with providing a "detailed description of play in rhesus monkeys", and suggested that "many readers will find Symons’ description of rhesus play in a seminatural environment to be very useful", but added that many might conclude that Symons "overemphasizes the practice-for-violence hypothesis" and is "too eager to reject the other functions of play, such as general learning, practice for other activities, and innovation."&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;[[#Bal79|Baldwin 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the psychologists [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] wrote in ''[[The Sciences]]'' that Symons' "well-received" monograph is the work he is best known for.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dal80|Daly 1980]]. p. 22-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2328">'''Radioflash''' is a term used (chiefly in sources from the [[United Kingdom]]) in early literature on the phenomena now known more widely as [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse]], or EMP.  The term originated in the early 1950s, primarily associated with the "click" typically heard on radio receivers when a nuclear bomb was detonated.  It was later discovered that the phenomena was one part of the more wide-ranging set of effects resulting from EMPs after the detonation of [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] and certain [[chemical weapons]].

Instrumentation failures observed during [[nuclear weapons testing]] between 1951 and 1953 were mentioned in [[declassified]] military literature as attributed to "radiated radioflash".&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, Bernard J., ''Nuclear Hostages'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baum1"&gt;Baum, Carl E., "Reminiscences of High-Power Electromagnetics," IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Vol. 49, No. 2. pp. 211&amp;ndash;218. May 2007. [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/History/BaumReminiscences.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar term was first used in the [[Soviet Union]] in an early theoretical publication (which contained some errors and was later corrected&lt;ref&gt;Gilinsky, Victor, "The Kompaneets Model for Radio Emission from a Nuclear Explosion". RAND Corporation, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;) on the effects of a nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Kompaneets, A.S., "Radio Emission from an Atomic Explosion". Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics (Журнал экспериментальной и теоретической физики), Vol. 35. December, 1958 ('''in Russian''').&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in [[high-energy physics]] in the description of a type of collective [[ion]] [[acceleration]] that would take place during intense [[solar flares]].&lt;ref&gt;Gershtein, S.S., [http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/10/467/10467817.pdf The Collective Acceleration Mechanism of Solar Cosmic Rays.] Institute of High Energy Physics, Serpukhov, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1328">'''Saturated surface dry''' (SSD{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}) is defined as the condition of an [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] in which the surfaces of the particles are "dry" (''i.e.'', surface [[adsorption]] would no longer take place), but the [[porosity|inter-particle voids]] are saturated with water. In this condition aggregates will not affect the free [[water content]] of a [[composite material]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.concreteconstruction.net/producers/aggregate-moisture-in-concrete_o |title= Aggregate Moisture in Concrete |publisher=Concrete Construction |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot-info/cst/TMS/400-A_series/pdfs/cnn403.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The water adsorption by mass (A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)) is defined in terms of the mass of saturated-surface-dry (M&lt;sub&gt;ssd&lt;/sub&gt;) sample and the mass of oven dried test sample (M&lt;sub&gt;dry&lt;/sub&gt;) by

'''Secondary electrons''' are electrons generated as [[ionization]] products. They are called 'secondary' because they are generated by other radiation (the ''primary'' [[radiation]]). This radiation can be in the form of ions, electrons, or photons with sufficiently high energy, i.e. exceeding the [[ionization potential]]. [[Photoelectron]]s can be considered an example of secondary electrons where the primary radiation are photons; in some discussions photoelectrons with higher energy (&gt;50&amp;nbsp;eV) are still considered "primary" while the electrons freed by the photoelectrons are "secondary".

[[Image:Electron MFP and Range.PNG|right|thumb|300px|'''Mean free path of low-energy electrons.''' Secondary electrons are generally considered to have energies below 50&amp;nbsp;eV. The rate of energy loss for electron scattering is very low, so most electrons released have energies peaking below 5&amp;nbsp;eV(Seiler, 1983).]]

==Applications==
Secondary electrons are also the main means of viewing images in the [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). The range of secondary electrons depends on the energy. Plotting the [[inelastic mean free path]] as a function of energy often shows characteristics of the "universal curve" &lt;ref&gt;A. Zangwill, ''Physics At Surfaces'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; familiar to electron spectroscopists and surface analysts. This distance is on the order of a few nanometers in metals and tens of nanometers in insulators.&lt;ref&gt;H. Seiler, ''J. Appl. Phys.'' 54 (11), R1 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Cazaux, ''J. Appl. Phys.'' 85(2), 1137 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; This small distance allows such fine resolution to be achieved in the SEM.

For [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], for a primary electron energy of 100&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], the secondary electron range is up to 20&amp;nbsp;nm from the point of incidence.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schreiber and H.-J. Fitting, ''J. Electron Spec. and Rel. Phen.'', 124, 25 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.-J. Fitting ''et al.'', ''Phys. Stat. Sol. (A)'' 81, 323 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sudd''' (''{{transl|ar|a[[solar letter|s]]-Sudd}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|al-Sudd}}'') is a vast [[swamp]] in [[South Sudan]], formed by the [[White Nile]]'s ''[[Mountain Nile|Baḥr al-Jabal]]'' section. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|sudd}}'' is derived from ''{{transl|ar|sadd}}'' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:سد|سد]]}}), meaning "barrier"&lt;ref&gt;Gaudet, J.J., and A. Falconer, 1983. Remote sensing for tropical freshwater bodies. The problem of floating islands on Lake Naivasha. Regional Remote Sensing Facility, Nairobi, Kenya. 4p.&lt;/ref&gt; or "obstruction".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' (''NOAD''), 3rd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "the sudd" has come to refer to any large solid floating vegetation island or mat. The area which the swamp covers is one of the world's largest [[wetland]]s and the largest freshwater wetland in the Nile basin.

For many years the swamp, and especially its thicket of vegetation, proved an impenetrable barrier to navigation along the Nile. In AD 61, a party of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers sent by the Emperor [[Nero]] proceeded up the [[White Nile]] but were not able to get beyond the Sudd, which marked the limit of Roman penetration into [[equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;L.P. Kirwan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1790717 "Rome beyond The Southern Egyptian Frontier"], ''[[Geographical Journal]]'', '''123''' (1957), pp. 16f&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons in later times the [[Nile#Search for the source of the Nile|search for the source of the Nile]] was particularly difficult; it eventually involved overland expeditions from the central African coast, so as to avoid having to travel through the Sudd.

==Location==

The Sudd stretches from [[Mongalla, South Sudan|Mongalla]] to just outside the [[Sobat River|Sobat]] confluence with the White Nile just upstream of Malakal as well as westwards along the [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr el Ghazal]]. The shallow and flat inland delta lies between 5.5 and 9.5 degrees latitude North and covers an area of {{convert|500|km|mi}} south to north and {{convert|200|km|mi}} east to west between Mongalla in the south and [[Malakal]] in the north.

Its size is highly variable, averaging over {{convert|30000|km2|sqmi}} . During the [[wet season]] it may extend to over {{convert|130000|km2|sqmi}} comprising 13% of the country, depending on the inflowing waters, with the discharge from [[Lake Victoria]] being the main control factor of flood levels and area inundation. Since the Sudd area consists of various meandering channels, lagoons, reed and [[papyrus]] fields and loses half of its inflowing water through [[evapotranspiration]] in the permanent and seasonal floodplains, the complex hydrology has many primary and secondary effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sutcliffe | first = J.V. | authorlink = |author2=Parks, Y.P. | year = 1999 | location = Wallingford. UK | title = IAHS Special Publication No 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major feature of the area, even if not completed and not functional, is the [[Jonglei Canal]], planned to bypass waters from the Sudd to avoid evaporation losses and increase the amount of water discharged at the outlet of the Sudd.

From 1961 to 1963, a great increase in the inundated area occurred when the level of Lake Victoria rose and the outflow increased. The total area of the Sudd is related to the amount of water reaching Bor from Albert Nile and from torrents or seasonal watercourses that can add substantial amounts to the flow in the upstream end of the Sudd. During the 1960s increase in Lake Victoria discharge, where flows at Mongalla roughly doubled, the flows at Malakal at the northern end of the swamps increased by 1.5 times the previous average flow. As a consequence of these high flows, the areas of permanent swamp and seasonal floodplains have, taken together, increased to 2.5 times their former size. The swamps have increased the most, and the seasonal floodplain is 1.5 times its previous size.&lt;ref name = "mefit"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mefit-Babtie Srl | first = | title = Development Studies of the Jonglei Canal Area, Range Ecology Survey, Final Report, Volume 2, Background| year = 1983 | publisher = USAID PCE-I-00-96-00002-00 | location = Khartoum. Sudan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the southern inflow of the [[White Nile#In South Sudan|Bahr al Jabal]] ("Sea of the Mountain") at Mongalla, the defined riverbed successively widens into a floodplain, where the waters flow in meandering river stretches and various channels and lagoons throughout the dry season. With rising water levels it expands over the semi-flooded grasslands during the flood season.

Slightly downstream of [[Bor, Sudan|Bor]], the [[Bahr el Zeraf]] ("Sea of the [[Giraffe]]s") river branches off the Bahr al Jabal to the east, diverting part of the flow, and again joins the Bahr al Jabal just before reaching Malakal. During the course of its flow, the Bahr al Jabal passes [[Lake No]], where the [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr el Ghazal]] ("Sea of the [[Gazelle]]s") connects to the Bahr al Jabal, contributing an inflow with seasonal variation. At Malakal, the Sobat River joins into the system. The combined flows then stream to the north as the White Nile in a defined bed, joining with the Blue Nile waters at Khartoum to form the main Nile.

Sudd was designated as a [[Ramsar Wetland of International Importance]] on 5 June 2006. An area of {{convert|57000|km2|sqmi}} was designated.

==Climate==
Hydrologically the Sudd plays an important role in storing floodwaters and trapping sediments from the [[White Nile#In South Sudan|Bahr al Jabal]]. Roughly 55 percent of water entering the area is lost to evaporation.&lt;ref name="baecher"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baecher | first = G. | title = The Nile Basin – Environmental transboundary opportunities and constraint analysis | year = 2000 | publisher = USAID PCE-I-00-96-00002-00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water levels fluctuate by up to 1.5 metres, depending on the intensity of seasonal flooding.&lt;ref name="mefit"/&gt;

The region receives less rainfall (typically between 55 and 65 centimetres per year) than neighbouring areas at the same latitude. [[Orographic lift]]ing on the eastern and western sides of the Sudd contribute to that condition.&lt;ref&gt;Zahran, A.B. 1986. Sudan Rainfall Variability – Towards a Drought Assessment Model. Interna. Confer. on water Resources Needs &amp; Planning in Drought Prone Areas, 85-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomorphology==
The morphology of the area is defined by the channel and lagoon system of the permanent Sudd swamps, the adjacent flood plains and the surrounding flat terrain. The Bahr al Jabal runs to the north-northwest and therefore in an angle to the gradient of the [[flood plain]], which slopes down to the north, while north of Juba the river flows in an incised trough. The banks of this trough decrease in height from south to north with the [[White Nile#In South Sudan|Bahr al Jabal]] approaching Bor and ending in the Sudd flood plain just north of [[Bor, South Sudan|Bor]] on the eastern bank and towards Shambe on the western bank. In the southern part, the river meanders from side to side in the restraining trough in one or more channels, but further north the swamp is not limited by higher ground and the system of river channels becomes increasingly complex. The characteristics of the river with its network of channels and lagoons are distinguishable in satellite imagery and digital elevation models.

The geology of the area is defined by heavy clay soils, highly impermeable with a top layer of "black cotton" [[vertisol]] of approximately 500&amp;nbsp;mm on average. Sandy soils are found only at depths of approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} and below, as determined by well drilling profiles (Petersen, 2008). This indicates a very limited groundwater influence on the area's hydrology.

==Population==

[[Dinka]], [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] pastoralists use the Sudd and the surrounding areas extensively. Livestock and rain-fed agriculture are the dominant means of support for the largely rural population for which the seasonal flooded grasslands along the Sudd provides valuable grazing lands.&lt;ref name="baecher" /&gt;

==Vegetation and ecosystem==
Vegetation cover of the area can generally be classified in five categories which depend on the elevation of the area above river flood level: the lakes and rivers themselves, the floating plant life of the swamp, river-flooded grasslands (Toic), rain-flooded grasslands, and wooded grasslands on the fringes. Grassland and woodland areas have been cultivated by local populations.

The density of the grasslands along the Sudd changes with the season, with tall grass in the rainy season and short dry grass in the dry season, when frequent fires also occur. The fluvial area is mostly overgrown with vegetation, with some main and side channels as well as lagoons of open water. The vegetation distribution is described in further detail in Sutcliffe (1974) and Petersen (2007). The main species are:

* ''[[Phragmites communis]]'' (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* ''[[Echinochloa]] pyramidalis'' (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* ''[[Oryza barthii]]'' (shallow flooded, buried roots)
* ''[[Echinochloa stagnina]]'' (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* ''[[Vossia (plant)|Vossia cuspidata]]'' (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' (deep flooded, superficial/floating roots)
* ''[[Typha domingensis]]''

The first three species are anchored so their distribution is limited to the depth of flooding. For the last species their root system needs to be permanently in water or saturated soil, which is a good indicator of flood patterns. ''P. communis'', ''E. pyramidalis'' and ''O. barthii'' for example dominate only in areas where the depth of flooding does not exceed 130&amp;nbsp;cm over a period of ten years or 118&amp;nbsp;cm for one month in the year.

Floating vegetation of ''C. papyrus'' had caused blockages in the Sudd swamps on a number of occasions between 1879 and 1900, when the plants were torn out by increased flooding. ''C. papyrus'' needs saturated conditions and can tolerate flooding that is not more than 150&amp;nbsp;cm deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sutcliffe | first = J.V. | authorlink = | title = A Hydrological Study of the Southern Sudd Region of the Upper Nile | journal = Hydrological Science Bulletin 19 | issue = 2 6/1974: | pages = 237–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the matted vegetation breaks free of its moorings, it forms floating islands of vegetation up to 30&amp;nbsp;km in length. Such islands, in varying stages of decomposition, eventually break up.

The sluggish waters are host to a large population of [[mosquito]]es and [[parasite]]s that cause [[waterborne diseases]].

The early explorers searching for the [[Nile#The search for the source of the Nile|source of the Nile]] experienced considerable difficulties, sometimes taking months to get through the Sudd.  In his 1972 book ''[[The White Nile]]'', [[Alan Moorehead]] says of the Sudd, "there is no more formidable swamp in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Moorehead | first=Alan | title=The White Nile | publisher=Book Club Associates | location=London | page=85 | year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The Sudd provides food and water to large populations of migrating birds; over 400 species of bird are found here, including [[shoebill]]s, [[great white pelican]]s, and [[black crowned crane]]s. As the surrounding landscape is a large swath of dry [[Sahel]] across Africa, the swamp is also a haven for migrating animals, especially [[antelope]]s, such as the endangered [[Nile lechwe]], [[Korrigum|tiang]], [[reedbuck]], and the world's largest population of white-eared [[kob]], estimated at around 1.2 million—an animal population comparable to Tanzania's better-known [[Serengeti National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Massive Animal Herds Flourishing Despite Sudan War, Survey Reveals| publisher = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]

In more upland areas the Sudd was known as an historic [[habitat]] for the [[endangered]] [[painted hunting dog]], ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'', which however may have been exterminated in the region.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

==Threats and preservation==
The long-running [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war in Southern Sudan]] seriously disrupted conservation efforts in the Sudd, especially as the widespread availability of weapons has encouraged wildlife poaching, including of elephants. There are three game reserves: [[Zeraf Island]] between the [[Zeraf River]] and the Nile, [[Shambe]] Reserve, and [[Mongalla Game Reserve]].

===Jonglei diversion canal===
{{main article|Jonglei Canal}}
Because of the Sudd swamp, the water from the southwestern tributaries (the Bahr el Ghazal system) for all practical purposes does not reach the main river and is lost through [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]].

Sir William Garstin, [[Undersecretary of State of Public Works of Egypt]], created the first detailed proposal for digging a canal east of the Sudd in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/egyptiansudanits02budg#page/484/mode/2up|title=The Egyptian Sudan, its history and monuments|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By bypassing the swamps, evaporation of the Nile's water would vastly decrease, allowing an increase in the area of cultivatable land in Egypt by {{convert|2000000|acres|km2}}.

Hydrogeologists in the 1930s proposed digging a [[canal]] east of the Sudd to divert water from the [[White Nile#In South Sudan|Bahr al Jabal]] above the Sudd to a point farther down the White Nile, bypassing the swamps and carrying the White Nile's water directly to the main channel of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=motor+gun+boat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6AXqTIOfAsienAf959ngDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=motor%20gun%20boat&amp;f=true "Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River"], October 1933, ''[[Popular Science]]'', short article on top-right of page with map&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jonglei canal scheme was first studied by the government of Egypt in 1946 and plans were developed in 1954-59. Construction work on the canal began in 1978 but the outbreak of political instability in Sudan has held up work for many years. By 1984 when the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|Southern Sudanese rebels (SPLA)]] brought the works to a halt, 240&amp;nbsp;km of the canal of a total of 360&amp;nbsp;km had been excavated. The rusting remains of the giant German-built excavation machine—variously nicknamed either "Sarah" or "Lucy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923276-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Environment: Sarah Digs a Great Canal | date=10 January 1983 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are visible on a [[Google Earth]] image at the south end of the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goo.gl/maps/tV5lK Google Earth image]&lt;/ref&gt; It was destroyed by a missile. When peace was restored in 2000, speculation grew about a restart of the project. However, on 21 February 2008, the Sudanese government said the revival of the project was not a priority. Nevertheless, in 2008, Sudan and Egypt agreed to restart the project and finish the canal in 24 years.&lt;ref name = "ahmad"&gt;Ahmad, A.M.

It is estimated that the Jonglei canal project would produce 3.5-4.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water per year (equal to a mean annual discharge of 110–152 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (3,883-5,368&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s), an increase of around five to seven per cent of Egypt's current water supply.&lt;ref name=Furniss2010/&gt; The canal's benefits would be shared by Egypt and Sudan, with the expected damage falling on [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name = "ahmad" /&gt; The complex environmental and social issues involved, including the collapse of fisheries, drying of grazing lands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/2718/Jonglei-Canal-Project-is-a-Looming-Catastrophe.aspx | work=Gurtong | title=Jonglei Canal Project Is A Looming Catastrophe |author=Koang Tut Jing| date=8 September 2006 | accessdate=22 Oct 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a drop of groundwater levels, and a reduction of rainfall in the region&lt;ref&gt;[[De Villiers, Marq]], 2001. ''Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource''. Mariner Books. {{ISBN|978-0-618-12744-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; may limit the scope of the project in practical terms. The draining of the Sudd is likely to have environmental effects comparable to the drying of [[Lake Chad]] or the draining of the [[Aral Sea]].

Les '''''Suites à Buffon''''' is a [[France|French]] nineteenth-century scientific publication

Les ''Suites à Buffon'' carries the complete title ''Suites à Buffon formant avec les œuvres de cet auteur un cours complet d'histoire naturelle embrassant les trois règnes de la nature, confié aux plus célèbres naturalistes et habiles écrivains''
(Sequels to Buffon Constituting a Complete Course of Natural History Encompassing the Three Reigns of Nature, Entrusted to the Most Famous Naturalists and to Skillful Writers). The three reigns or kingdoms are [[Botany]], [[Zoology]] and [[Geology]].
This work constitutes a vast realization in 89 volumes edited and published by the [[Paris]]ian editor [[Nicolas Roret]]. Published between 1834 and 1890, it appears in many forms and is often extracted, sometimes under the titles ''Nouvelles Suites à Buffon'', ''Suites à Buffon'', and ''Nouvelles Suites à Buffon''.

An example of a ''Suites à  Buffon'' title is [[Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc]], ''Histoire Naturelle des Coquilles,contenant leur description, les moeurs des animaux qui les habitant et leurs usages'' in 5 vols. 2nd ed. Paris, Verdière, 1824.  Several new species of shells are described in this rather rare work which included a long "table alphabétique de toutes les espèces mentionnées dans ces ouvrages avec les synonymes de Lamarck". It is not clear from the title that this is part of ''Suites à  Buffon'', but it is, though not published by Roret and of a specialised nature.

Sometimes ''Suites de Buffon''

[[File:Endeavour silhouette STS-130.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' silhouetted against the atmosphere. The orange layer is the troposphere, the white layer is the [[stratosphere]], and the blue layer is the [[mesosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-130/html/iss022e062672.html |title=STS-130 Shuttle Mission Imagery |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The shuttle is actually orbiting at an altitude of more than {{cvt|320|km|mi}}, far above all three layers.)]]

The '''troposphere''' is the lowest layer of [[Earth's atmosphere]], and is also where nearly all [[weather]] conditions take place. It contains approximately 75% of the [[atmosphere]]'s [[mass]] and 99% of the total mass of [[water vapor]] and [[aerosol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology |year=1984 |section=Troposphere |quote=It contains about four-fifths of the mass of the whole atmosphere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average height of the troposphere are {{cvt|18|km|mi ft}} in the [[tropics]], {{cvt|17|km|mi ft}} in the [[middle latitudes]], and {{cvt|6|km|mi ft}} in the [[polar regions]] in winter.

The lowest part of the troposphere, where [[friction]] with the Earth's surface influences air flow, is the [[planetary boundary layer]]. This layer is typically a few hundred meters to {{cvt|2|km|mi ft}} deep depending on the [[landform]] and time of day. Atop the troposphere is the [[tropopause]], which is the border between the troposphere and [[stratosphere]]. The tropopause is an [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]], where the air temperature ceases to decrease with height and remains constant through its thickness.&lt;ref name="DLA"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Danielson, Levin, and Abrams |title=Meteorology |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''troposphere'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tropos'' (meaning "turn, turn toward, change") and ''[[sphere]]'' (as in the Earth), reflecting the fact that rotational [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixing plays an important role in the troposphere's structure and behaviour. Most of the phenomena associated with day-to-day weather occur in the troposphere.&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt;

==Pressure and temperature structure==
[[File:Troposphere CIMG1853.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A view of Earth's troposphere from an [[airplane]].]]

===Composition===
By volume, dry air contains 78.08% [[nitrogen]], 20.95% [[oxygen]], 0.93% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]]. Except for the water vapor content, the  composition of the troposphere is essentially uniform. The source of water vapor is at the Earth's surface through the process of [[evaporation]]. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with [[altitude]]. And, [[saturation vapor pressure]] decreases strongly as temperature drops. Hence, the amount of water vapor that can exist in the atmosphere decreases strongly with altitude and the proportion of water vapor is normally greatest near the surface of the Earth.

===Pressure===
The pressure of the atmosphere is maximum at [[sea level]] and decreases with altitude. This is because the atmosphere is very nearly in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] so that the pressure is equal to the weight of air above a given point. The change in pressure with altitude can be equated to the density with the [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic]] equation&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;Landau and Lifshitz, ''Fluid Mechanics'', Pergamon, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dP}{dz} = -\rho g_n = - \frac {mPg_n}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:*''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[standard gravity]]
:*''ρ'' is the [[density]]

:*''z'' is the [[altitude]]
:*''P'' is the [[pressure]]
:*''R'' is the [[gas constant]]
:*''T'' is the [[thermodynamic temperature|thermodynamic (absolute) temperature]]
:*''m'' is the [[molar mass]]

Since temperature in principle also depends on altitude, one needs a second equation to determine the pressure as a function of altitude as discussed in the next section.

===Temperature===

[[File:Troposphere Temperature Trend1.jpg|thumb|This image shows the temperature trend in the Middle Troposphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between January 1979 and December 2005. The middle troposphere is centered around 5 kilometers above the surface. Oranges and yellows dominate the troposphere image, indicating that the air nearest the Earth's surface warmed during the period.Source: [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7839]|alt=hi]]
The [[temperature]] of the troposphere generally decreases as altitude increases. The rate at which the temperature decreases, &lt;math&gt;-dT/dz&lt;/math&gt;, is called the environmental lapse rate (ELR). 
The ELR is nothing more than the difference in temperature between the surface and the tropopause divided by the height. The ELR assumes that the air is perfectly still, i.e. that there is no mixing of the layers of air from vertical convection, nor winds that would create turbulence and hence mixing of the layers of air. The reason for this temperature difference is that the ground absorbs most of the sun's energy, which then heats the lower levels of the atmosphere with which it is in contact. Meanwhile, the radiation of heat at the top of the atmosphere results in the cooling of that part of the atmosphere.

The ELR assumes the atmosphere is still, but as air is heated it becomes buoyant and rises. The dry adiabatic lapse rate accounts for the effect of the expansion of dry air as it rises in the atmosphere and wet adiabatic lapse rates includes the effect of the condensation of water vapor on the lapse rate.

When a parcel of air rises, it expands, because the pressure is lower at higher altitudes. As the air parcel expands, it pushes the surrounding air outward, transferring energy in the form of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] from that parcel to the atmosphere. As energy transfer to a parcel of air by way of heat is very slow, it is assumed to not exchange energy by way of [[heat]] with the environment. Such a process is called an [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] process (no energy transfer by way of heat). Since the rising parcel of air is losing energy as it does work on the surrounding atmosphere and no energy is transferred into it as heat from the atmosphere to make up for the loss, the parcel of air is losing energy, which manifests itself as a decrease in the temperature of the air parcel. The reverse, of course, will be true for a parcel of air that is sinking and is being compressed.&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt;

Since the process of compression and expansion of an air parcel can be considered reversible and no energy is transferred into or out of the parcel, such a process is considered [[isentropic]], meaning that there is no change in entropy as the air parcel rises and falls, &lt;math&gt;dS = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the heat exchanged &lt;math&gt;dQ = 0&lt;/math&gt; is related to the [[entropy]] change &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;dQ=T dS&lt;/math&gt;, the equation governing the temperature as a function of height for a thoroughly mixed atmosphere is 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dz} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. The above equation states that the entropy of the atmosphere does not change with height. The rate at which temperature decreases with height under such conditions is called the adiabatic [[lapse rate]].

For ''dry'' air, which is approximately an [[ideal gas]], we can proceed further. The adiabatic equation for an ideal gas is &lt;ref name="LL1"&gt;Landau and Lifshitz, ''Statistical Physics Part 1'', Pergamon, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; p(z)T(z)^{-\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}=\text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat capacity ratio]] (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;=7/5, for air). Combining with the equation for the pressure, one arrives at the [[Lapse rate#Dry adiabatic lapse rate|dry adiabatic lapse rate]],&lt;ref&gt;Kittel and Kroemer, ''Thermal Physics'', Freeman, 1980; chapter 6, problem 11&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dz}=- \frac{mg}{R} \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}=-9.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt;
If the air contains [[water vapor]], then cooling of the air can cause the water to condense, and the behavior is no longer that of an ideal gas. If the air is at the [[Saturation vapor pressure|saturated vapor pressure]], then the rate at which temperature drops with height is called the [[Lapse rate#Saturated adiabatic lapse rate|saturated adiabatic lapse rate]]. More generally, the actual rate at which the temperature drops with altitude is called the [[Lapse rate#Environmental lapse rate|environmental lapse rate]]. 
In the troposphere, the average environmental lapse rate is a drop of about 6.5&amp;nbsp;°C for every 1&amp;nbsp;km (1,000 meters) in increased height.&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt;

The environmental lapse rate (the actual rate at which temperature drops with height, &lt;math&gt;dT/dz&lt;/math&gt;) is not usually equal to the adiabatic lapse rate (or correspondingly, &lt;math&gt;dS/dz \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;). If the upper air is warmer than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate (&lt;math&gt;dS/dz &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), then when a parcel of air rises and expands, it will arrive at the new height at a lower temperature than its surroundings. In this case, the air parcel is denser than its surroundings, so it sinks back to its original height, and the air is stable against being lifted. If, on the contrary, the upper air is cooler than predicted by the adiabatic lapse rate, then when the air parcel rises to its new height it will have a higher temperature and a lower density than its surroundings, and will continue to accelerate upward.&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

The troposphere is heated from below by [[latent heat]], [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]], and [[sensible heat]].  Surplus heating and vertical expansion of the troposphere occurs in the tropics. At middle latitudes, tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 15&amp;nbsp;°C at sea level to about −55&amp;nbsp;°C at the [[tropopause]]. At the [[Geographical pole|pole]]s,  tropospheric temperature only decreases from an average of 0&amp;nbsp;°C at sea level to about −45&amp;nbsp;°C at the tropopause. At the [[equator]], tropospheric temperatures decrease from an average of 20&amp;nbsp;°C at sea level to about −70 to −75&amp;nbsp;°C at the tropopause. The troposphere is thinner at the poles and thicker at the equator. The average thickness of the tropical tropopause is roughly 7 kilometers greater than the average tropopause thickness at the poles.&lt;ref name="ZonalFlowDef"&gt;{{Cite web

===Tropopause===
{{main article|Tropopause}}

The tropopause is the boundary region between the troposphere and the [[stratosphere]].

Measuring the temperature change with height through the troposphere and the stratosphere identifies the location of the tropopause. In the troposphere, temperature decreases with altitude. In the stratosphere, however, the temperature remains constant for a while and then increases with altitude. This coldest layer of the atmosphere, where the lapse rate changes from positive (in the troposphere) to negative (in the stratosphere), is defined as the tropopause.&lt;ref name="DLA"/&gt; Thus, the tropopause is an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion layer]], and there is little mixing between the two layers of the atmosphere.

==Atmospheric flow==
The flow of the atmosphere generally moves in a west to east direction. This, however, can often become interrupted, creating a more north to south or south to north flow. These scenarios are often described in meteorology as zonal or meridional. These terms, however, tend to be used in reference to localised areas of atmosphere (at a [[synoptic scale]]). A fuller explanation of the flow of atmosphere around the Earth as a whole can be found in the three-cell model.

===Zonal flow===
[[File:Zonalflow.gif|thumb|right|250 px|A [[zonal flow regime]].  Note the dominant west-to-east flow as shown in the 500 hPa height pattern.]] 

A [[zonal flow regime]] is the [[meteorology|meteorological]] term meaning that the general flow pattern is west to east along the Earth's latitude lines, with weak shortwaves embedded in the flow.&lt;ref name="ZonalFlowDef2"&gt;{{Cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word "zone" refers to the flow being along the Earth's latitudinal "zones". This pattern can buckle and thus become a meridional flow.

===Meridional flow===
[[File:Meridionalflowpattern.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Meridional Flow pattern of October 23, 2003. Note the amplified troughs and ridges in this 500 hPa height pattern.]]
When the zonal flow buckles, the atmosphere can flow in a more longitudinal (or meridional) direction, and thus the term "[[meridional flow]]" arises. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified troughs of low pressure and ridges of high pressure, with more north-south flow in the general pattern than west-to-east flow.&lt;ref name="MeridonialFlow"&gt;{{Cite web

===Three-cell model===
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}

[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|200px|Atmospheric circulation shown with three large cells.]]

The three  cells model of the atmosphere attempts to describe the actual flow of the Earth's atmosphere as a whole. It divides the Earth into  the tropical ([[Hadley cell]]), mid latitude ([[Ferrel cell]]), and polar ([[Polar vortex|polar cell]]) regions, to describe energy flow and global atmospheric circulation (mass flow). Its fundamental principle is that of balance – the energy that the Earth absorbs from the sun each year is equal to that which it loses to space by radiation. This overall Earth energy balance, however, does not apply in each latitude due to the varying strength of the sun in each "cell" as a result of the tilt of the Earth's axis in relation to its orbit. The result is a circulation of the atmosphere that transports warm air poleward from the tropics and cold air equatorward from the poles. The effect of the three cells is the tendency to even out the heat and moisture in the Earth's atmosphere  around the planet'''.&lt;ref name="ThreecellEncarta"&gt;{{Cite web

==Synoptic scale observations and concepts==

===Forcing===
Forcing is a term used by meteorologists to describe the situation where a change or an event in one part of the atmosphere causes a strengthening change in another part of the atmosphere. It is usually used to describe connections between upper, middle or lower levels (such as upper-level divergence causing lower level convergence in cyclone formation), but also be to describe such connections over lateral distance rather than height alone. In some respects, [[teleconnection]]s could be considered a type of forcing.

===Divergence and convergence===
An area of convergence is one in which the total mass of air is increasing with time, resulting in an increase in pressure at locations below the convergence level (recall that atmospheric pressure is just the total weight of air above a given point). Divergence is the opposite of convergence – an area where the total mass of air is decreasing with time, resulting in falling pressure in regions below the area of divergence. Where divergence is occurring in the upper atmosphere, there will be air coming in to try to balance the net loss of mass (this is called the principle of mass conservation), and there is a resulting upward motion (positive vertical velocity). Another way to state this is to say that regions of upper air divergence are conducive to lower level convergence, cyclone formation, and positive vertical velocity. Therefore, identifying regions of upper air divergence is an important step in forecasting the formation of a surface low pressure area.

== History ==

=== Launch and initial years of WHO-CHOICE ===

In May 1998, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] succeeded [[Hiroshi Nakajima]] as the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], and the organization was significantly restructuring as a result of the leadership change. With her election, a new program, called '''Choosing Interventions: Effectiveness Quality, Costs, Gender and Ethics''', was launched as part of the Global Programme for Evidence on Health and Policy. The name of the program would later morph into WHO-CHOICE.&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;

=== Subsequent use ===

WHO-CHOICE was used in the [[World Health Report]] of 2002, specifically informing the recommendations in Chapter 5.&lt;ref name=whr-2002/&gt;

Results based on WHO-CHOICE were published in a series of papers in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=who-economic-evaluation/&gt;

== Tools and methods ==

=== Adoption of sectoral CEA ===

Prior to WHO-CHOICE, most projects that did cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in the real world focused on evaluating a single program or intervention, comparing it against either a fixed price threshold or an existing array of interventions with predetermined cost-effectiveness taken from the literature. However, theoretical literature on CEAs considered a broader kind of CEA called "sectoral CEA" where all programs and interventions available within a sector would be compared and cost-effectiveness priorities would be determined. Prior to WHO-CHOICE, there were only a few examples of practical implementation of sectoral CEAs: the [[Oregon Health Services Commission]] (tasked with prioritizing for [[Medicaid]] in the [[United States]]), the [[World Bank Health Sectors Priorities Review]], and the [[Harvard Life Saving Project]]. Of these, only the World Bank's work had attempted a global comparison.&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt; In a 2000 paper discussing the WHO-CHOICE approach, Murray et al. identified four challenges to a wider application of sectoral CEA:

# Resource allocation decisions affecting the entire health sector must also take into account social concerns, such as priority for the sick, reducing social inequalities in health, or the well-being of future generations. The history of the Oregon Health Services Commission provides an example of the sort of conflicts that emerge as a result of balancing all these concerns.
# Current CEA is too focused on the evaluation of new strategies, rather than identifying potential for efficiency improvements by reallocating within existing strategies.
# For all but the richest societies, the cost and time required to evaluate the large set of interventions required may be prohibitive.
# It is difficult to institutionalize CEA, and a number of conflicting CEA guidelines at national and regional levels have proliferated.

=== Use of generalized CEA (a type of sectoral CEA) based on epidemiological subregions ===

WHO-CHOICE identified a key trade-off in sectoral CEA based on the granularity of the region at which the CEA was performed. At one extreme, sectoral CEA could be performed at the level of individual cities or districts, incorporating information about local resources, costs, and current context. At the other extreme, a single CEA could be carried out globally. Highly localized sectoral CEA would be very expensive and difficult to perform whereas global CEA would fail to take into account the huge differences between the epidemiology and resource structure of regions.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;

WHO-CHOICE's solution was to use an intermediate level of granularity, that it called "generalized CEA" (GCEA). It argued that at this intermediate level, it could conduct CEAs more efficiently while also allowing local policymakers and agents to use its findings and further adapt them to local contexts.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;

WHO-CHOICE has divided the world into 14 epidemiological subregions, and publishes its findings by subregion, as shown below. Each subregion is a combination of a region (a geographical region of the world) and a mortality stratum (a stratum describing the level and nature of mortality). WHO-CHOICE chose to put each country in a single mortality stratum and a single region (and therefore a single subregion) even if mortality varies widely within the country.&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

* There are 6 regions: AFR (Africa), AMR (Americas), EMR (Middle East), EUR (Europe), SEAR (South-East Asia), and WPR (West Pacific). 
* There are 5 mortality strata, defined as follows:
** A = very low rates of adult and child mortality
** B = low adult mortality, low child mortality
** C = high adult mortality, low child mortality
** D = high adult mortality, high child mortality
** E = very high adult mortality, high child mortality

Although the 6 regions and 5 mortality strata could give a theoretical maximum of 6 X 5 = 30 subregions, only 14 subregions occur in practice because not every region has countries with all mortality strata.

Below is the classification into subregions as of 2003.&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

=== Modifications to ICM-CEA to use null set as comparator for interventions ===

The CEA done by WHO-CHOICE differed from the standard ICM-CEA in two important ways:&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=murray-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;

# Interventions were compared against the null set of interventions, rather than the existing backdrop of interventions. This provides a complete cost-effectiveness analysis that can be adapted more easily to different subregions and different times.
# Results are presented in a single league table. For each set of mutually exclusive interventions (between which a selection is being made), the intervention with the lowest average cost-effectiveness with respect to the null set is presented first. If there are two or more rows, the second intervention is the one with the lowest slope with respect to the internvention with the lowest CE, and so on. Essentially, this identifies the [[principal component analysis|principal component]]s for the best intervention.

=== Intended usage ===

The results that WHO-CHOICE reports are not intended to be applied literally when choosing policies or selecting interventions. This is for a few reasons:&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

* The interventions available in a specific local context, as well as the cost and effectiveness estimates, may vary between contexts. Some interventions covered by WHO-CHOICE may not exist in the local context, and other interventions available in the local context may not be covered by WHO-CHOICE.
* The model does not fully capture all the real-world interactions and phenomena. For instance, transition costs are not modeled separately.
* The ranking of interventions by cost-effectiveness could be fairly non-robust, with huge margins of error making the ranking uncertain.

Rather, the results are intended to be used as a starting point in classifying interventions as highly cost-effective, moderately cost-effective, and cost-ineffective. With this classification in place, a more detailed and localized analysis can be done for the highly cost-effective interventions, incorporating concerns such as poverty, equity, implementation capacity, and feasibility.&lt;ref name=hutubessy-2003/&gt;

=== Tools used for the estimates ===

WHO-CHOICE lists the following tools that it uses and can provide to researchers interested in using WHO-CHOICE:&lt;ref name=cea-tools&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/en/|title = Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* PopMod simulates the time evolution of an arbitrary population subject to births, deaths, and two distinct disease conditions. It has yearly granularity and keeps track of population by age and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/popmod/en/|title = PopMod|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research paper describing PopMod called it the first multi-state dynamic [[life table]], and highlighted how it modeled multiple diseases with interaction terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = PopMod: a longitudinal population model with two interacting disease states|last = Lauer|first = Jeremy|last2 = Röhrich|first2 = Klaus|last3 = Wirth|first3 = Harald|last4 = Charette|first4 = Claude|last5 = Gribble|first5 = Steve|last6 = Murray|first6 = Christopher J.L.|journal = Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation|doi = 10.1186/1478-7547-1-6|date = February 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEA country contextualization templates: These templates help contextualize WHO-CHOICE's results (that are provided at the level of epidemiological subregion) to specific countries based on estimated information about population and costs in the country, that is pre-populated into the tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/cost-effectiveness/tools/CEA_context/en/|title = CEA country contextualization templates|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CostIt (Costing Intervention Templates) is a software for the recording and analysis of cost data. It is not a data-collection tool but can guide the development of instruments for collecting data. Its main value add is in automating the computation of the [[economic cost]]s of intervention, though it can also be used to compute financial costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/cost_it/en/|title = CostIt, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE)|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of CostIt is that it automatically adjusts for capacity utilization, and therefore, comes to different conclusions based on different levels of capacity utilization: for instance, it would come to different conclusions if the hospital bed occupancy rate were 30% than if it were 80%.
* MCLeague (Monte Carlo League) is a software program that represents uncertainty around costs and effects to decision-makers in the form of stochastic league tables. It provides information on the probability that any given intervention is in the optimal intervention mix for a given level of resource availability. The program also allows for covariance between costs and outcomes.&lt;ref name=guide-2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/toolkit/mc_league/en/|title = MC League, under Cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE) |publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Health Report of 2002 ===

The [[World Health Report]] of 2002 relied on WHO-CHOICE. Specifically, it used the division of the world into epidemiological subregions in its analysis of health risks, and used recommendations generated by WHO-CHOICE in Chapter 5, "Some Strategies to Reduce Risk".&lt;ref name=whr-2002&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/whr02_en.pdf?ua=1|title = The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|accessdate = January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are the key results in the report based on WHO-CHOICE:

{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
! Risk being considered !! Potential interventions !! Conclusion about best intervention
|-
| [[Malnutrition|Childhood undernutrition]] (and [[breastfeeding]]) || Complementary feeding&lt;br/&gt;Complementary feeding with growth monitoring and promotion || Both interventions have identical impact, and the latter is cheaper, and more likely to be cost-effective in most regions.
|-
| [[Iron deficiency]] || Iron fortification&lt;br/&gt;[[Iron supplement]]ation || Supplementation yields greater improvements in population health in subregions with high child mortality (all D and E subregions) and at all levels of coverage.&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, fortification is the preferred option at low levels of resource availability, as it has lower and less sharpy increasing unit cost and does not require a visit to a provider.&lt;br/&gt;However, in some settings, fortification is hindered by the absence of ideal food vehicles to fortify, and supplementation could be the better approach.
|-
| [[Vitamin A deficiency]] || Vitamin A supplementation&lt;br/&gt;Vitamin A fortification || Vitamin A fortification is more cost-effective in all regions because of its lower cost. Supplementation has a higher population benefit despite the higher cost. Both interventions are cost-effective.
|-
| [[Zinc deficiency]] || Zinc supplementation&lt;br/&gt;Zinc fortification || Fortification is more cost-effective. However, it has lower total population benefit than Vitamin A supplementation in subregions where both Vitamin A deficiency and zinc deficiency are problems.
|-
| Other individual-based interventions focusing on children under five years of age || [[Oral rehydration therapy]]&lt;br/&gt;Case management of [[pneumonia]] || Vitamin A supplementation achieves greater health effects than ORT in some areas (AMR-B, SEAR-B, WPR-B) but in others the reverse is true. Both ORT and case management of pneumonia achieve substantially greater benefits than zinc fortification and supplementation, though the latter is more cost-effective.
|-
| [[Blood pressure]] ([[hypertension]]) || Population wide salt reductions&lt;br/&gt;Individual-based hypertension treatment and education || In all subregions, strategies to reduce blood pressure are very cost-effective. Legislation is potentially more cost-effective than voluntary agreement with industry.&lt;br/&gt;Strategies to reduce blood pressure by treating individuals with a blood pressure with a SBP greater than 160mmHg are the most cost-effective, and lowering the threshold to 140mmHg is not cost-effective in many subregions such as AFR-D and AMR-D.&lt;br/&gt;Combinations of individual treatment and population based approaches are cost-effective at the 160mmHg SBP threshold in all settings.
|-
| [[Cholesterol]] || Population-wide health education through mass media&lt;br/&gt;Individual-based treatment and education || In all subregions, population strategies to reduce cholesterol are very cost-effective, but the total impact on DALYs gained is small.&lt;br/&gt;Statins are low-cost and effective and thus cost-effective in all regions.
|-
| Combined interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events || Individual-based treatment and education for systolic blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;br/&gt;Population-wide combination of interventions to reduce hypertension and cholesterol.&lt;br/&gt;Absolute risk approach: focus on the absolute risks of individuals and choose medication based on that&lt;br/&gt;Combining population interventions and the absolute risk approach || The absolute risk approach for a threshold of 35% is very cost-effective in all subregions. At lower thresholds, the health benefits increase but so do the costs. The threshold for cost-effectiveness can vary based on region, and can vary from 5% to 25%.
|-
| Unsafe sex and [[HIV/AIDS]] || Population-wide mass media&lt;br/&gt;[[Voluntary counseling and testing]]&lt;br/&gt;School-based AIDS education&lt;br/&gt;Peer outreach for men who have sex with men&lt;br/&gt;Treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STI)&lt;br/&gt;[[Vertically transmitted infection|Mother-to-child transmission]] (MTCT)&lt;br/&gt;[[Management of HIV/AIDS|Antiretroviral therapy]] (ARV)&lt;br/&gt;Intervention combinations || All preventive interventions have a substantial impact on population health in the high mortality subregions. The specific intervention that is best varies with the setting.&lt;br/&gt;Treatment of STIs has a higher impact on population health than the other preventive interventions in all except the A subregions where peer outreach for men who have sex with men also has a substantial impact.
|-
| [[Smoking]] || Taxation&lt;br/&gt;Clean indoor air laws in public places&lt;br/&gt;Comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising&lt;br/&gt;Information dissemination through health warning labels, counter-advertising, and consumer information packages.&lt;br/&gt;Nicotine replacement therapy || The interventions have a larger impact in subregions with more tobacco use (AMR-B, AMR-D, EUR-B, EUR-C, SEAR-B, SEAR-D, WPR-B). If only one intervention is to be chosen, it should be taxation.
|-
| Unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene || [[Millennium Development Goals]]&lt;br/&gt;Disinfection at point of use&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, low technologies&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, with disinfection at point of use&lt;br/&gt;Improved water supply and sanitation, high technologies || In subregions other than EUR-A and AMR-A (where almost everybody has access to safe water and basic sanitation), the intervention that is consistently the most cost-effective is the provision of disinfection capacity at the point of use. However, the principal driver for improvement to water supplies is not health but economic development, and this should be factored into the evaluation.
|-
| Unsafe health care injections || Decreased reuse of injected equipment without sterilization&lt;br/&gt;Decreased unnecessary use of injections || Interventions were not evaluated in A subregions.&lt;br/&gt; In other mortality strata, reducing unnecessary use of injections has a lower total impact of health, and the impact of the interventions is additive.&lt;br/&gt;In approximately half the subregions (AMR-B, AMR-D, EUR-B, EUR-C), reducing reuse is also the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;br/&gt;In other regions (AFR-D, AFR-E, EMR-D, SEAR-B, SEAR-D, WPR-B), behavioral interventions to reduce overuse are more cost-effective, and would be done first if resources are scarce.

=== Report on scaling up Millennium Development Goals ===

The WHO-CHOICE database was one of the sources of data used for the 2009 [[World Health Organization]] costing report ''Constraints to Scaling Up the Health Millennium Development Goals: Costing and Financial Gap Analysis. Background Document for the Taskforce on Innovative International Financing and Health Systems'' (published 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.who.int/choice/publications/d_ScalingUp_MDGs_WHO_finalreport.pdf?ua=1|title = Constraints to Scaling Up the Health Millennium Development Goals: Costing and Financial Gap Analysis.

== Reception ==

Giving What We Can, a charity evaluator and advocate of more effective giving, reviewed WHO-CHOICE's results, and emphasized that these results "should perhaps not be taken from the individual donor’s perspective, but rather from the perspective of someone who can influence the health system of that country."&lt;ref name=gwwc-overview/&gt; GWWC has also referenced WHO-CHOICE and compared it with DCP2 in some of its coverage of diseases.&lt;ref name=gwwc-tb&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/other-causes/tuberculosis/|title = Tuberculosis|accessdate = January 21, 2017|publisher = [[Giving What We Can]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
