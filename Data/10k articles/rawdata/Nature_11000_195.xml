The '''Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants''', a 1998 protocol on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), is an addition to the 1979 [[Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (LRTAP). The Protocol seeks "to control, reduce or eliminate discharge, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants" in Europe, some former Soviet Union countries, and the United States, in order to reduce their transboundary fluxes so as to protect human health and the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1979|title=PROTOCOL TO THE 1979 CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1998.POPs.e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and promoters of the Protocol were the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE), which at the time housed 53 different country members and alliance.   The protocol was amended on 18 December 2009, but the amended version has not yet come into force.

As of May 2013, the protocol has been ratified by 31 states and the [[European Union]].

In the United States, the protocol is an executive agreement that does not require Senate approval. However, legislation is needed to resolve inconsistencies between provisions of the protocol and existing U.S. laws (specifically the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] and the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]]).

== Substances ==
The following substances are contained in the CLRTAP POPs Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;UNECE: ''[http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/Publications/11-22162-Part-C.pdf Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution 2010]'', p. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document focuses on a list of 16 substances that have been singled out according to agreed risk criteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 25, 1998|title=CONVENTION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1–35|via=UNECE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (comprising eleven pesticides, two industrial chemicals and three by-products/contaminants). The Protocol assigned the arrangements for proper disposal of waste products deemed banned and limited, including medical supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/pops_h1.html|title=Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) - Air Pollution - Environmental Policy - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ageostrophy''' is the real condition that works against [[geostrophic wind]] or [[Geostrophic|geostrophic currents]] in the ocean, and works against an exact balance between the [[Coriolis force]] and the [[pressure gradient]] force.  While geostrophic currents or winds come from an equilibrium of a particular system, ageostrophy is more often observed because of other forces  such as [[friction]] or the [[centrifugal force]] from curved fluid flow.

[[Image:Andres de Urdaneta.jpg|thumb|right|Andrés de Urdaneta]]

[[Friar]] '''Andrés de Urdaneta, [[Order of St. Augustine|OSA]]''', (November 30, 1498 &amp;nbsp;– June 3, 1568) was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Basques|Basque]] [[circumnavigator]], explorer and [[Augustinian Order|Augustinian]] friar. As a navigator he achieved in 1536 the "second" world circumnavigation (after the first one led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and their crew in 1522). Urdaneta discovered and plotted a path across [[Pacific Ocean|the Pacific]] from the [[Philippines]] to [[Acapulco]] in the [[Viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]] (present day [[Mexico]]) used by the [[Manila galleons]], which came to be known as "Urdaneta's route." He was considered as "protector of the Indians" for his treatment of the [[Filipino peoples|Filipino]] natives; also [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu|Cebu]] and the [[Philippines|Philippines']] first [[prelate]].&lt;ref&gt;The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803, vol. 2, eds. Emma Helen Blair, James Alexander Robertson (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1903), 33, note 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomé de Letona, OSF, ''The Philippine Islands, 1493-1803'', vol. 36, eds. Emma Helen Blair, James Alexander Robertson (Cleveland: The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1906), 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Urdaneta was born in the town of [[Ordizia]], [[Spain]].

==Exploration==
[[File:Andres Urdaneta Tornaviaje.jpg|thumb|right|500 px|Route from Philippines to Acapulco, México]] 
Urdaneta was one of the few survivors of the [[Loaísa Expedition]] to reach the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] late in the year 1526, only to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta spent the next eight and a half years in and around the Spice Islands, but eventually he managed to return to Europe in the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India Armada]] and under [[Portugal|Portuguese]] guard. Upon his arrival in [[Lisbon]] on June 26, 1536, he achieved the second world [[circumnavigation]].&lt;ref&gt;or rather the third or even the fourth circumnavigation in history, considering that [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and some of his men had been in the regions of [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] a decade before reaching the [[Philippines]], or the route taken by other crew members of Magellan's expedition and later returned to Europe after [[Elcano]]`s ship, who were also brought by the Portuguese from [[Moluccas]] and then released in Lisbon{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urdaneta accomplished his trip around the world through a journey which lasted just shy of eleven years.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Mairin. 1964. ''Friar Andrés de Urdaneta, O.S.A.'' Macdonald and Evans, London, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lisbon the Portuguese authorities confiscated his charts and letters. Urdaneta then escaped to Spain, where he recreated much of the confiscated material, and presented it to the Spanish Court. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] did not give him a very favourable reception either, and, wearied by his many adventures, he returned to New Spain and there entered the [[Order of Hermits of St. Augustine]].

At the death of the viceroy, [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Luís de Velasco]], in 1564, New Spain had passed under the government of the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]], one of whose first cares was to equip an expedition for the conquest and colonization of the Philippines. This had been ordered by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in 1559. Friar Andrés de Urdaneta having been designated as the Commander, the Viceroy had the matter under consideration at the time of his death. Urdaneta was considered a great navigator and especially fitted for cruising in Indian waters. Philip II wrote urging him to join the expedition and offering him the command. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to take command; the ''adelantado'', Don [[Miguel López de Legazpi]], was appointed as Commander. The expedition, composed of the ''Capitana'', which carried on board Legazpi and Urdaneta, the [[galleon]]s ''San Pablo'' and ''San Pedro'', and the [[ship's tender|tenders]] ''San Juan'' and ''San Lucas'', set sail on November 21, 1564.

Urdaneta founded the first churches in the Philippines, the [[Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral|St. Vitales Church]] and the [[Basilica del Santo Niño]]; he served as the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu#Ordinaries|first]] [[prelate]] of the [[Archdiocese of Cebu|Church in Cebu]]. After spending some time in the islands, Legazpi determined to remain and sent Urdaneta back for the purpose of finding a better return route and to obtain help from New Spain for the Philippine colony. (For the problem of sailing east across the Pacific, which Urdaneta solved,  see [[Manila Galleon]] and [[Volta do Mar]].) Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel (the island of [[Cebu Island|Cebu]]), on June 1, 1565 and was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North]] latitude to obtain favourable winds. With the voyage in trouble, Urdaneta had to assume command himself.  The ship reached the port of [[Acapulco]], on October 8, 1565, having traveled 12,000 miles (20,000&amp;nbsp;km) in 130 days. Fourteen of the crew had died; only Urdaneta and [[Felipe de Salcedo]], nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Upon arriving, Urdaneta discovered that a member of the crew of his expedition, [[Alonso de Arellano]]—who had abandoned them just after leaving the port—had actually beaten them across the ocean, arriving at [[Barra de Navidad, Jalisco|Barra de Navidad]] in [[Jalisco]] in August of the same year. However, Arellano was in disgrace for his rebellion against the authority of Legazpi, and his notes were far less precise and professional than Urdaneta's, and so the latter's route became the famous and trusted one.

==Legacy==
[[File:Urdanetajf154.JPG|thumb|right|75 px|Fray Andrés de Urdaneta Monument]]
[[File:Urdanetajf155.JPG|thumb|right|75 px|The Memorial stands in [[Urdaneta, Pangasinan]] ( a town named in his honor).]]
From Mexico, Urdaneta went to Europe to make a report on the expedition and then returned to New Spain, intending to continue on to the Philippines, but he was dissuaded by his friends. He wrote two accounts of his voyages: one giving the account of the Loaiza expedition was published; the other, which gives the account of his return voyage, is preserved in manuscript in the archives of the [[Council of the Indies]].

For the remainder of the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish ships, particularly the annual [[Manila Galleon|Manila-Acapulco trading Galleon]], used "Urdaneta's route."

In the Philippines, the City of [[Urdaneta, Pangasinan|Urdaneta]] in [[Pangasinan]] was named after him. The same city is the seat of one of the biggest [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Urdaneta|dioceses]] on the country.

Urdaneta died in Mexico City in 1568.

The '''Aptian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[geologic timescale]] or a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[stratigraphic column]]. It is a subdivision of the [[Early Cretaceous|Early or Lower Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] and encompasses the time from 125.0 ± 1.0 [[annum|Ma]] to 113.0 ± 1.0 Ma (million years ago), approximately. The Aptian succeeds the [[Barremian]] and precedes the [[Albian]], all part of the Lower/Early Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aptian partly overlaps the upper part of the regionally used (in [[Western Europe]]) stage [[Urgonian]].

The [[Selli Event]], also known as OAE1a, was one of two oceanic [[Anoxic event]]s in the [[Cretaceous]] period, which occurred around 120 [[annum|Ma]] and lasted approximately 1 to 1.3 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Yong-Xiang|last2=Bralower|first2=Timothy J.|last3=Montañez|first3=Isabel P.|last4=Osleger|first4=David A.|last5=Arthur|first5=Michael A.|last6=Bice|first6=David M.|last7=Herbert|first7=Timothy D.|last8=Erba|first8=Elisabetta|last9=Premoli Silva|first9=Isabella|date=2008-07-15|title=Toward an orbital chronology for the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE1a, ~ 120 Ma) |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X08002215|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=271|issue=1–4|pages=88–100|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.03.055|bibcode=2008E&amp;PSL.271...88L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oaedef"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Leckie, R.|author2=Bralower, T.|author3=Cashman, R.| year = 2002| title =  Oceanic anoxic events and plankton evolution: Biotic response to tectonic forcing during the mid-Cretaceous| journal =  Paleoceanography| volume =  17| issue = 3| pages =  1–29| url= https://www.geo.umass.edu/faculty/leckie/Leckie%20et%20al.%202002.pdf| doi = 10.1029/2001pa000623| bibcode =2002PalOc..17.1041L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aptian extinction]] was a minor [[extinction event]] hypothesized to have occurred around 116 to 117 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;Archangelsky, Sergio.

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Aptian was named after the small city of [[Apt, Vaucluse|Apt]] in the [[Provence]] region of [[France]], which is also known for its crystallized fruits. The original [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] is in the vicinity of Apt. The Aptian was introduced in scientific literature by French palaeontologist [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] in 1840.

The base of the Aptian stage is laid at [[magnetic chronozone|magnetic anomaly M0r]]. A global reference profile for the base (a [[GSSP]]) had in 2009 not yet been appointed. The top of the Aptian (the base of the Albian) is at the first appearance of [[coccolithophore]] species ''[[Praediscosphaera|Praediscosphaera columnata]]'' in the stratigraphic record.

===Subdivision===
In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Aptian contains eight [[ammonite]] [[biozone]]s:
* zone of ''[[Hypacanthoplites|Hypacanthoplites jacobi]]''
* zone of ''[[Nolaniceras|Nolaniceras nolani]]''
* zone of ''[[Parahoplites|Parahoplites melchioris]]''
* zone of ''[[Epicheloniceras|Epicheloniceras subnodosocostatum]]''
* zone of ''[[Duffrenoyia|Duffrenoyia furcata]]''
* zone of ''[[Deshayesites|Deshayesites deshayesi]]''
* zone of ''Deshayesites weissi''
* zone of ''Deshayesites oglanlensis''

Sometimes the Aptian is subdivided in three substages or subages: [[Bedoulian]] (early or lower), [[Gargasian]] (middle) and [[Clansayesian]] (late or upper).

==Lithostratigraphic units==
&lt;!-- Should become a section about palaeogeography and lithofacies (f.e. per continent) - user:Woodwalker August 2009 --&gt;
Examples of rock units formed during the Aptian are:
[[Antlers Formation]], [[Cedar Mountain Formation]], [[Cloverly Formation]], [[Elrhaz Formation]], [[Jiufotang Formation]], [[Little Atherfield]], [[Mazong Shan]], [[Potomac Formation]], [[Santana Formation]], [[Twin Mountains Formation]], [[Xinminbao Group]] and [[Yixian Formation]].

| [[Marree Formation]], [[South Australia]], Australia
| A little-known [[maniraptoran]] known primarily from a single fossilized tibia, which had been fossilized through a rare process in which the bone through hydration turned to opal. Apart from the tibia, the first find included some small probable fibula fragments. Later a foot digit was referred that might have come from the same species, but the assignment is dubious. The tibia is broken into about ten larger pieces and roughly {{convert|33|cm|in|0|abbr=off}} long. It is very slender in build and shows the impression of the ascending process of the astragalus, an ankle bone itself lost. The process seems to have been very long and narrow. ''Kakuru'' is believed to have been carnivorous, was bipedal and about {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} in length. This small dinosaur seems to have had long, slender legs.

{{Solar terms}}
The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s. '''''Báilù''''', ''Hakuro'', ''Baengno'', or ''Bạch lộ'' ({{CJKV|t=白露|s=白露|p=báilù|j=白露|r=hakuro|k=백로|rr=baengno|v=bạch lộ|l=white dew}}) is the 15th solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 165° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 180°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 165°. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around September 7 and ends around September 23. [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] is celebrated around this time.

[[File:Bise.svg|thumb|right|Bise on Lake Geneva]]
'''The Bise''' (French: ''La Bise'') is a cold, dry wind in [[Switzerland]] which blows through the [[Swiss Plateau]] from the northeast to the southwest.&lt;ref name=bise&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meteocentrale.ch/en/weather/foehn-and-bise/bise.html |title=Bisendiagramm |publisher=MeteoGroup Schweiz AG |location=Appenzell, Switzerland |accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causation and effect==
It is caused by canalisation of the air-current along the northern edge of the Alps, during high-pressure conditions in northern or eastern Europe respectively. Towards western Swiss Plateau, the Bise is pressed between the [[Jura Mountains|Jura mountains]] and Pre-Alps whereby it strengthens and mostly climaxes on the western shore of [[Lake Geneva]]. In summer, the Bise wind causes rather dry and sunny weather whereas in winter, it frequently forms low stratus clouds over the Swiss Plateau by strengthening the inversion layer.&lt;ref name=bise/&gt;

The Bise can sometimes lead to severe icing during winter months in Geneva and nearby communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/8314926-la-bise-va-se-calmer-apres-une-journee-chaotique-mais-plusieurs-ecoles-vont-rester-fermees.html |title=La bise va se calmer après une journée chaotique, mais plusieurs écoles vont rester fermées |publisher=[[Radio Télévision Suisse|RTS Radio Télévision Suisse]] |date=17 January 2017 |location=Geneva |language=fr |accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many foreign travellers to this Swiss city have commented upon the Bise.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrika Bremer, ''Two Years in Switzerland and Italy'', Hurst and Blackett  1861, p.258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Century: A Popular Quarterly''  by Making of America Project, The Century Co.  1909, p.463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The strength of the Bise wind can be determined by the analysis of the air pressure difference (in hectopascal [hPa]) between [[Geneva]] and [[Güttingen]] in [[canton of Thurgau]]. The Bise arises as soon as the air pressure in Güttingen (TG) is higher than in Geneva. The greater this air pressure difference, the stronger the Bise blows through the Swiss Plateau. In case of an inverted air pressure difference (low air pressure in Güttingen (TG) and high air pressure in Geneva), the opposite of Bise occurs: The wind blows from southwest through the Swiss Plateau.&lt;ref name=bise/&gt;

==Use and Etymology==
An alternative form in English is '''Biz'''.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Shelley, ''The Last Man'', vol. 3 ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The term entered [[Middle English]] from French ''bise''. Its origin is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Trumble; A. Stevenson, eds.,''Shorter Oxford Dictionary'', Oxford University Press 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chao Phraya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|aʊ|_|p|r|ə|ˈ|j|ɑː}} {{respell|CHOW|_|prə|YAH}}; {{lang-th|[[wikt:เจ้าพระยา|แม่น้ำเจ้าพระยา]]}} {{RTGS|''Maenam Chao Phraya''}}, {{IPA-th|mɛ̂ːnáːm tɕâːw pʰráʔjaː|pron}} or {{IPA-th|tɕâːw pʰrajaː|}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forvo.com/word/แม่น้ำเจ้าพระยา/#th Pronunciation]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the major river in Thailand,&lt;ref name="McCarthy" /&gt; with its low alluvial plain forming the centre of the country. It flows through [[Bangkok]] and then into the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

==Etymology==
On many old European maps, the river is named ''Menam'' or ''Mae Nam'' (Thai: [[wikt:แม่น้ำ|แม่น้ำ]]), Thai for "river". [[James McCarthy (surveyor)|James McCarthy]], [[F.R.G.S.]], who served as Director-General of the Siamese Government Surveys prior to establishment of the [[Royal Thai Survey Department|Royal Survey Department]], wrote in his account, "''Me Nam'' is a generic term, ''me'' signifying "mother" and ''Nam'' "water," and the epithet Chao P'ia signifies that it is the chief river in the kingdom of Siam."&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book |last= McCarthy |first= James Fitzroy |title= Surveying and exploring in Siam |url= https://archive.org/stream/surveyingandexp00mccagoog.pdf|date= 2005-07-13 |origyear= 1900 |publisher= John Murray, Albemarle Street |location= London |oclc= 5272849 |page= 21|chapter= Chapter VI.

In the English-language media in Thailand, the name Chao Phraya River is often translated as ''river of kings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.speakingthai.com/stories/river%20king.htm |title= The River of Kings II : City of Angels

[[Image:Wat Arun Bangkok View Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Chao Phraya River, Bangkok]]

==Geography==
The Chao Phraya begins at the [[confluence]] of the [[Ping River|Ping]] and [[Nan River|Nan]] rivers at [[Nakhon Sawan]] (also called Pak Nam Pho) in [[Nakhon Sawan Province]].  After this it flows south for {{convert|372|km|mi}} from the [[Central Thailand|central plains]] to [[Bangkok]] and the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. In [[Chai Nat province|Chai Nat]], the river then splits into the main course and the [[Tha Chin]] River, which then flows parallel to the main river and exits in the Gulf of Thailand about {{convert|35|km|mi}} west of Bangkok in [[Samut Sakhon]]. In the low [[alluvial plain]] which begins below the [[Chainat Dam]], there are many small canals (''[[khlong]]'') which split off from the main river. The ''khlongs'' are used for the irrigation of the region's rice paddies.

The rough coordinates of the river are 13 N, 100 E. This area has a wet monsoon climate, with over {{convert|1400|mm|in}} of rainfall per year. Temperatures range from {{convert|24|to|33|C|F}} in Bangkok.

===River engineering===
[[File:Chaophrayashortcut.jpg|thumb|upright|The original course of the river and its shortcut canals]]

The lower Chao Phraya underwent several man-made modifications during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period. Several shortcut canals were constructed to bypass large loops in the river, shortening the trip from the capital city to the sea. The course of the river has since changed to follow many of these canals.

* In 1538, Thailand's first [[river engineering]] of a {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} long canal was dug at the order of [[Chairacha|King Chairachathirat]]. It was called "khlong lat", today known as [[Khlong Bangkok Noi]]. It shortened the route by 13–14&amp;nbsp;km for ships from the Gulf of Siam to the then-capital city, [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steve Van Beek: ''The Chao Phya'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1542, a two kilometer-long canal, "khlong lat Bangkok", was completed. Today it's called [[Khlong Bangkok Yai]]. It is said to have shortened the river route by {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* In 1608, a seven kilometer-long "Khlong Bang Phrao" canal was completed and has shortened the Chao Phraya's original route by {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* In 1636, the "khlong lat mueang Nonthaburi" was completed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* In 1722, the two kilometre long "khlong lat Kret Noi" shortened the Chao Phraya by {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}}. This route was from the island of [[Ko Kret]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==River settlements==
Cities along the Chao Phraya include, from north to south, [[Nakhon Sawan Province]], [[Uthai Thani Province]], [[Chai Nat Province]], [[Sing Buri Province]], [[Ang Thong Province]], [[Ayutthaya Province]], [[Pathum Thani Province]], [[Nonthaburi Province]], [[Bangkok]], and [[Samut Prakan Province]]. These cities are among the most historically significant and densely populated settlements of Thailand due to their access to the waterway.

==Transportation==
{{See also|List of crossings of the Chao Phraya River|Chao Phraya Express Boat|Bangkok Boat Express Lines|Sathon-Klong Toei Express Boat}}

[[File:Chao Phraya Vendor b photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Chao Phraya River Food Vendor]]

Major bridges cross the Chao Phraya in Bangkok: the [[Rama VI Bridge|Rama VI]] railroad bridge; [[Phra Pin-klao Bridge|Phra Pin-klao]] near the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]]; [[Rama VIII Bridge|Rama VIII]], a single tower asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge; [[Rama IX Bridge|Rama IX]], a semi-symmetric cable-stayed bridge; and [[Mega Bridge]], on the Industrial Ring Road.

In Bangkok, the Chao Phraya is a major transportation artery for a network of river buses, cross-river ferries, and water taxis ("longtails"). More than 15 boat lines operate on the rivers and canals of the city, including [[commuter|commuter lines]].

==Tributaries==
{{main|Tributaries of the Chao Phraya River}}
The principal tributaries of the Chao Phraya River are the [[Pa Sak River]], the [[Sakae Krang River]], the [[Nan River]] (along with its principal confluent the [[Yom River]]), the [[Ping River]] (with its principal confluent, the [[Wang River]]), and the [[Tha Chin River]].&lt;ref name="RID River Gauges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://157.82.150.160/GAME-T/GAIN-T/routine/rid-river/RIDstations.html |title=Royal Irrigation Department River Gauges Report |year=2002 |publisher=RID Stations |accessdate=20 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814235239/http://157.82.150.160/GAME-T/GAIN-T/routine/rid-river/RIDstations.html |archivedate=14 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldWater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/case_studies/chao_phraya/index.shtml |title=Chao Phraya River Basin (Thailand) |publisher=World Water Assessment Programme |accessdate=20 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608214931/http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/case_studies/chao_phraya/index.shtml |archivedate=8 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldWaterDetail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/case_studies/chao_phraya/detailed_view.shtml |title=Detailed Map of the Chao Phraya River Basin (Thailand) |publisher=World Water Assessment Programme |accessdate=20 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918102553/http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/case_studies/chao_phraya/detailed_view.shtml |archivedate=18 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these tributaries (and the Chao Phraya itself) is augmented by minor tributaries referred to as ''khwae''. All of the tributaries, including the lesser khwae, form an extensive tree-like pattern, with branches flowing through nearly every province in central and northern [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="RID River Gauges" /&gt;  None of the tributaries of the Chao Phraya extend beyond the nation's borders.&lt;ref name="Google Earth"&gt;Google Earth&lt;/ref&gt; The Nan and the Yom River flow nearly parallel from [[Phitsanulok]] to Chumsaeng in the north of Nakhon Sawan Province. The [[Wang River]] enters the Ping River near Sam Ngao district in [[Tak Province]].

==Chao Phraya watershed==
[[Image:China House on Chao Phraya River photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|China House on the Chao Phraya River]]

The expanse of the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, i.e., the Chao Phraya river system, together with the land upon which falling rain drains into these bodies of water, form the Chao Phraya [[drainage basin|watershed]].&lt;ref name="Chao Phraya Watershed"&gt;[http://www.premcenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=246&amp;Itemid=830 River and Watershed Facts on the Chao Phraya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104161404/http://www.premcenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=246&amp;Itemid=830 |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chao Phraya watershed is the largest watershed in Thailand, covering approximately 35 percent of the nation's land, and draining an area of {{convert|157924|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Basins of Thailand"&gt;[http://en.pwa.co.th/l_basins.htm Basins of Thailand]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The watershed is divided into the following basins:
*[[Pa Sak River|Pa Sak Basin]]
*[[Sakae Krang River|Sakae Krang Basin]]
*[[Nan River|Greater Nan Basin]] (composed of the [[Nan River|Nan Basin]] and the [[Yom River|Yom Basin]], and usually divided as such in drainage analyses)
*[[Ping River|Greater Ping Basin]] (composed of the [[Ping River|Ping Basin]] and the [[Wang River|Wang Basin]], and usually divided as such in drainage analyses)
*[[Tha Chin River|Tha Chin Basin]] (the basin of the Chao Phraya's most significant distributaries)
*Finally the Chao Phraya Basin itself is defined as the portion of the Chao Phraya watershed drained by the Chao Phraya River itself, and not by its major tributaries or distributaries. As such, the Chao Phraya Basin drains {{convert|20126|km2}} of land.&lt;ref name="Basins of Thailand" /&gt;

To the west, the central plain of Thailand is drained by the [[Mae Klong]] and the east by the [[Bang Pakong River]]. They are not part of the Chao Praya system.

The landscape of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to [[Ang Thong Province]] is a flat, low area with an average of two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a [[Drainage divide|divide]], which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of [[rice|floating rice]], a much faster-growing strain of rice from [[Bengal]]. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]] moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.

==Delta==
The [[Tha Chin River]] is the major distributary of the Chao Phraya River. The expanse of the Chao Phraya and [[Tha Chin River|Tha Chin]] Rivers and their distributaries, starting at the point at which the distributaries diverge, together with the land amid the triangle formed by the outermost and innermost distributary, form the Chao Phraya [[River delta|delta]]. The many distributaries of the Chao Phraya delta are interconnected by canals that serve both for irrigation and for transportation.

==Ecology==
[[Image:Templo Wat Arun, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wat Arun]], viewed from Chao Phraya River]]
The lowland areas of the Chao Phraya watershed in central Thailand have been designated as the Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests, a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] [[ecoregion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0107|name=Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area about {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} north to south and {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} wide.

The original swamp forests have almost entirely been removed as the plain has been converted to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including a large number of fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the [[Oriental darter]] (''Anhinga melanogaster''), [[white-eyed river martin]] (''Pseudochelidon sirintarae''), the [[sarus crane]] (''Grus antigone'')&lt;ref&gt;Madoc, G. 1950. Field Notes on some Siamese Birds. Bull. Raffles Mus. 23: 129–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and animals such as [[tiger]]s, [[Asian elephant]]s, [[Javan rhinoceros]]es, and the much-hunted [[Schomburgk's deer]].&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 1991. The Conservation Atlas of Tropical Forests: Asia and the Pacific. London and Basingstoke: Macmillan Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area  would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty [[mangrove]]s on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in ''[[Phragmites]]'' marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in [[Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park]], a relic of the original landscape.

As so much has been cleared or altered the potential for creating large protected areas to preserve original habitat no longer exists. However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the [[Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand]] has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, and the use of pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,''[[Pomacea canaliculata]]'', which damages rice plants.

There are populations of threatened birds, including colonies of breeding water birds such as the world's largest populations of the near-threatened [[Asian openbill]] (''Anastomus oscitans''), and other birds such as the wintering [[black kite]] (''Milvus migrans''). Endemic mammals that remain are the [[limestone rat]] (''Niviventer hinpoon''), [[Neill's long-tailed giant rat]] (''Leopoldamys neilli''), and the near-endemic [[Thailand roundleaf bat]] (''Hipposideros halophyllus'').

The Chao Phraya basin is home to about half a dozen endemic [[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]. The conservation status of most of these in unclear (they are rated as [[data deficient]] by the [[IUCN]]), but ''[[Cryptophaea saukra]]'' is [[critically endangered]] and ''[[Caliphaea angka]]'' is [[Endangered species|endangered]].&lt;ref name=Allen2008&gt;Allen, D.J.; Smith, K.G. &amp; Darwall, W.R.T. (editors)(2008). ''[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/indo_burma_report_complete_low_res_28_aug.pdf The status and distribution of freshwater fishes of Indo-Burma.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729182912/http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/indo_burma_report_complete_low_res_28_aug.pdf |date=29 July 2016 }}'' [[IUCN]]. {{ISBN|978-2-8317-1424-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few areas of wetland protected as national parks, but these are mostly very small.

===Fish===

===Pollution===
The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower Chao Phraya contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from [[phosphate]]s, [[phosphorus]], and [[nitrogen]]. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD rated water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's [[Bang Khun Thian District]] as "very poor", worse than in 2014.&lt;ref name="PCDR-2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thailand State of Pollution Report 2015|publisher=Pollution Control Department|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-616-316-327-1|url=http://infofile.pcd.go.th/mgt/PollutionReport2015_en.pdf?CFID=2140989&amp;CFTOKEN=61488210|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|56}} PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="BP-20160925"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangkiat|first1=Paritta|title=Breach of trust|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1094405/breach-of-trust|accessdate=25 September 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Smart''' (11 April 1722&amp;nbsp;– 21 May 1771), was an English poet.

He was a major contributor to two popular magazines and a friend to influential cultural icons like [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Henry Fielding]]. Smart, a [[high church]] [[Anglican]], was widely known throughout London.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart was infamous as the pseudonymous midwife "Mrs. Mary Midnight" and widespread accounts of his father-in-law, [[John Newbery]], locking him away in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] for many years over Smart's supposed religious "mania". Even after Smart's eventual release, a negative reputation continued to pursue him as he was known for incurring more debt than he could repay; this ultimately led to his confinement in debtors' prison until his death.

Smart's two most widely known works are ''[[A Song to David]]'' and ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'', both at least partly written during his confinement in asylum. However, ''Jubilate Agno'' was not published until 1939 and ''A Song to David'' received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals ''The Midwife'' and ''The Student'', along with his famous ''Seaton Prize poems'' and his mock epic ''[[The Hilliad]]''. Although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of [[English nationalism]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Smart was born in [[Shipbourne]] in Kent, England on the [[Fairlawn Estate|Fairlawn]] estate of [[William Vane, 1st Viscount Vane|William, Viscount Vane]], younger son of [[Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard|Lord Barnard]] of [[Barnard Castle]].&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 22"&gt;Mounsey p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He was, according to his nephew, "of a delicate constitution having been born earlier than the natural period".&lt;ref&gt;Hunter p. vi&lt;/ref&gt;  He was baptised in [[Wrotham]] parish on 11 May 1722. Smart's father was Peter Smart, [[Steward (office)|steward]]&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Bailiff#England .26 Wales|bailiff]]&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 22"/&gt; of Fairlawne. His mother was Winifred Smart of the Griffiths family of [[Radnorshire]], Wales.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 5"&gt;Sherbo p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Winifred was born c 1691, given that when she died in 1766 she was 75 years of age: "15 May 1766 Forename: Winefred, Widow Surname: Smart Age: 75 Place: St John in Thanet (Margate), St John the Baptist County: Kent Archive Reference: U3/140/1/3&lt;ref&gt;St John the Baptist in Thanet, Burial Records&lt;/ref&gt;"  This was near Margate where she had been living "Dr. John Hawkesworth visited him (Christopher Smart) in October 1764, and found him silently hostile towards his mother, Winifred Smart, and his sister, Margaret Hunter, at Margate" (The Poetry of Christopher Smart by Moira Dearnley).&lt;ref&gt;The Poetry of Christopher Smart by Moira Dearnley&lt;/ref&gt;

Winifred's parentage "Of the Griffiths family of Radnorshire" has not been unequivocally established before.  However, she now appears to have been the daughter of a Resse Griffiths and the sister of Jeremiah Griffith c1692-c1759; qv Inner Temple admission records;&lt;ref&gt;Inner Temple admission records&lt;/ref&gt; "First Name: Jeremiah Last Name: Griffith Occupation Given: gentleman Admission Date: 12/02/1713 Call Date: 18/06/1716 Father's Details Name: Resse Griffith Occupation: gentleman Father/Son Relationship: son and heir apparent Address: Diserth Radnorshire Notes: Referred to as Jeremy Griffith in the Bar Book. Father's address described as in "Parish of Dissearth Wales".

Before giving birth to Christopher, Winifred had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Anne.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 5"/&gt;

During Smart's younger years, Fairlawne was the residence of [[Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard]] and Lady Barnard, who bequeathed £200 to Smart.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 6"&gt;Sherbo p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He is supposed to have received so much money due to his father's closeness to the Vane family, his being named after Christopher Vane, and the young boy was considered "the pride of Fairlawn".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 6"/&gt; However, there is some controversy over the exact nature of this inheritance; while some cynically disagree with the reasons for his inheritance, no other explanation has been specified.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1726, three years after Christopher Vane died, Peter Smart purchased Hall-Place in [[East Barming]], which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland, a property that was influential throughout Smart's later life.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 6"/&gt; From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but did not participate, leading to speculations that he suffered from asthma attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all scholars agree that he was a "sickly youth".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 12"&gt;Sherbo p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem, at the age of four, in which he challenges a rival to the affections of a twelve-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 12" /&gt;

While at Hall-Place, Smart was sent to the local [[Maidstone Grammar School]] where he was taught by [[Charles Walwyn]], a scholar from [[Eton College]] who had received an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] from [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1696.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 9"&gt;Sherbo p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 9"/&gt; He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off a large portion of the estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 19"&gt;Sherbo p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart then attended [[Durham School]], where the Reverend Mr. Richard Dongworth was headmaster; it is not known whether he lived with his uncle, John Smart, or with a school master.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He spent vacations at [[Raby Castle]], which was owned by [[Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington]], the grandson of Christopher Vane.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 16"&gt;Sherbo p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Vane and his wife Grace, sister to William and Henrietta Fitzroy the Duke and Duchess of Cleveland, had four children, Henry, Frederick, Anne, and Mary. They were only a few years younger than Smart and became playmates, with Anne and Henry "pairing off" with Christopher and his sister Margaret respectively.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 16"/&gt; Although nothing resulted from the match, Anne has been traditionally described as being his "first love".&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the Vane family, Smart dedicated many poems to Henrietta, the Duchess of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; It was his closeness with the Vane family along with his skill for learning that encouraged Henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly, continued by her husband after her death in 1742.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 19" /&gt; This allowed Smart to attend [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===College===
[[Image:Christopher Smart Pembroke portrait.JPG|thumb|right|Christopher Smart's Pembroke portrait showing a letter sent from [[Alexander Pope]]]]
Smart was admitted to Pembroke College on 20 October 1739 as a [[sizar]] under Leonard Addison.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=SMRT739C|name=Smart, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is unclear why he chose Pembroke College, Addison was named in Peter Smart's trust deed (1729).&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; As a sizar, he occasionally had to wait on the "Fellows' table" and perform other menial tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1740, he was awarded the "Dr. Watt's Foundation scholarship", which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 26"&gt;Sherbo p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this income, he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was successful academically, he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at the college.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 26"/&gt;

During his time at Pembroke, Smart borrowed numerous books spanning the fields of literature, religion, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; These works helped when he wrote the three "Tripos Verse" at the end of each year.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were written in Latin and they, along with his other Latin poems like his translation of [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Ode on St. Cecilia's Day'', led to him being awarded the "Craven scholarship for classics" on 10 June 1742, which paid ₤25 a year for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; These scholarships, combined with his becoming a [[fellow]] in 1743, justified Smart calling himself "Scholar of the University".&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, Smart pushed his translation of Pope's ''Ode on St. Cecilia's Day'' as ''Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum'' and paid for the publication himself.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 50"&gt;Mounsey p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's ''Essay on Man'', but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's ''An Essay on Criticism'' (''De Arte Critica'') instead.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 50"/&gt; The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 33"&gt;Sherbo p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1745, Smart was elected [[Praelector]] of Philosophy, which paid one pound a year, and made one of three Keepers of the Common Chest.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, on 11 February 1746, he became a Master of Arts and was later elected on 10 October 1746, to Praelector of Philosophy, Praelector of Rhetoric, and Keeper of the Common Chest.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had run up more debt of over twice his annual income, and he was not re-elected in 1747 to the Praelectorship and was denied his control over the Common Chest accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was made a "Preacher before the Mayor of Cambridge" at the college under the title "Concionatori Coram Praetore oppidano", and his modest living during this year allowed him to regain Praelectorship in Philosophy along with being made a catechist, which suggests that he was ordained in the [[Anglican]] church.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1746, Smart became tutor to [[John Delaval, 1st Baron Delaval|John Hussey Delaval]], but this was abruptly cancelled because Delaval was removed from Pembroke after a variation of broken rules and mischief.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/ref&gt; After recovering from this, Smart returned to studying. In April 1747, a comedy he wrote just months before, ''A Trip to Cambridge'', or ''The Grateful Fair'', was performed in Pembroke College Hall, with many parts, including female roles, played by Smart himself.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 53-54"&gt;Sherbo p.&amp;nbsp;53–54&lt;/ref&gt;  The prologue was printed in ''The Cambridge Journal Weekly Flying-Post'', which claimed that the play received "Universal Applause".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 54"&gt;Sherbo p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

During his final years at Pembroke, Smart was writing and publishing many poems.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 1748, there were three proposals for "A Collection of Original Poems, By Christopher Smart, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the University of Cambridge" that would include "The Hop Garden", "The Judgment of Midas, a Masque", his odes, his translations into Latin, and some original Latin poems.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 51"&gt;Sherbo p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gray]], on 17 March 1747, referred to this work as Smart's "Collection of Odes".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 51"/&gt; This collection was not printed in 1748 but was delayed until 1752, and was re-titled ''Poems on Several Occasions''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 51"/&gt;

Between 1740 and 1746, he was introduced to Harriot Pratt, and he began to write poetry about her.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; By 1749, he was in love with her and wrote to his friend [[Charles Burney]] (father of [[Fanny Burney]]), "I am situated within a mile of my Harriote &amp; Love has robd Friendship of her just dues&amp;nbsp;... There was a great musical crash at Cambridge, which was greatly admired, but I was not there, being much better pleased with hearing my Harriote on her spinnet &amp; organ at her ancient mansion", suggesting that he was living permanently in Market Downham, London.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Although he wrote many poems dedicated to Harriot, his poem "The Lass with the Golden Locks" (1752) claims that he was done with both Harriot, Polly, and other women.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The "lass with the golden locks" who replaced Smart's previous fancies was Anna Maria Carnan.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetical Works'' iv p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Anna would be Smart's future wife and she was the stepdaughter of [[John Newbery]], Smart's future publisher.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 87"&gt;Sherbo p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===London===
Although Smart seemed to turn his life around at Pembroke, he slowly abandoned the college for London. During 1749, Smart listed himself on Pembroke's "Liber Absentiae" and would occasionally return to Pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 57"&gt;Sherbo p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his relationship with those at Pembroke, he was allowed to keep his name in the college's records, which allowed him to participate and be charged as a member of the college.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 57"/&gt; By 1750 he was living near St. James's Park and was busy familiarising himself with [[Grub Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p.&amp;nbsp;58–59&lt;/ref&gt; It was this year that Smart developed a business relationship with John Newbery.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how Smart and Newbery met, but Smart's daughter claimed Charles Burney introduced the two.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 62"&gt;Sherbo p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was looking for a contributory to his ''The Midwife'' and ''The Student'' magazines, and it is possible that Smart's winning of Cambridge's "Seatonian Prize" on 25 March 1750 brought his poetic abilities to Newbery's attention.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 62"/&gt;

The "Seatonian Prize" was a contest for one English poem each year on the topic of "the Perfections or Attributes of the Supreme Being" and the prize would be the "Rent of the [Kislingbury, Northamptonshire] estate"&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 62"/&gt; It was established by the will of Thomas Seaton, an "Anglican divine and hymn writer".&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Smart wrote in the "poetical essay" tradition using Miltonic blank verse.&lt;ref name="Curry p. 8"/&gt; In 1750, the poem he won the prize with was ''On the Eternity of the Supreme Being''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 62"/&gt; The prize was only worth 17 pounds each year before 7 pounds were deducted for the publication of the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the publication of the poem, Smart became a regular contributor in ''The Student''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 68"&gt;Sherbo p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Student'', before Smart's work, was a serious magazine that included a few poems and critical essays.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 68"/&gt; However, once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms, the magazine became filled with satire, parody, and humorous essays and poems.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 68"/&gt; Along with him composing 15 of the essays and the majority of the poems published in the two volumes of the magazine, he decided to append three of ''The Inspector'', a "humorous news report", to the second of the volumes.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 69"&gt;Sherbo p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; These reports included many "puff pieces" promoting Smart's works along with various stories written by his friends and associates, including the famous writers/poets [[Henry Fielding]], Samuel Johnson, [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]], and [[Tobias Smollett]].&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 69"/&gt; However, this was not the only important publication produced by him during this time.

===''The Midwife''===
[[Image:The Midwife titlepage.JPG|thumb|right|Title page of ''The Midwife'']]
''The Midwife'', first published on 16 October 1751 and lasting until April 1753, was produced primarily by Smart while he worked on ''The Student''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 70"&gt;Sherbo p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; This magazine was popular enough to be published in four editions.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; To hide his identity for practical and humorous reasons, he adopted the persona of a midwife, also known as a "Mrs. Midwife" in slang, and called this persona "Mrs. Mary Midnight".&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 70"/&gt;

When his poem "Night Piece" was attacked by [[William Kenrick (writer)|William Kenrick]] in ''Kapelion, or Poetical Ordinary'', possibly out of a prearranged publicity stunt, Smart used ''The Midwife'' in December, 1750, to attack back at Kenrick and promised an ''Old Woman's Dunciad'' to be written against the other poet.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 72"&gt;Sherbo p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kenrick beat Smart to the use of the title and printed his own in January, 1751.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 72"/&gt; This feud lasted as attacks published in a few issues of ''The Midwife'', but it soon died out when Smart focused his attention to writing a prologue and epilogue for a production of ''Othello'' and using the magazine to promote it.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

His attention slowly shifted away from ''The Midwife'' when he wrote for, and won, the "Seatonian Prize" for his ''On the Immensity of the Supreme Being'' and when he began working with Newbery's children's magazine, ''The Lilliputian Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p.&amp;nbsp;74–75&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established ''The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats'' in December 1751.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oratory'' included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and "miscellany" acts.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oratory'' was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as "the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace."&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as ''Poems on Several Occasions'', which resulted in the end of the ''Oratory'' and ''The Midwife''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p.&amp;nbsp;130–131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[Image:The HopGarden illustration.JPG|thumb|right|Illustration of ''[[The Hop-Garden]]'']]
In 1752, Christopher Smart was slowly dragged into a large "[[Paper War of 1752-1753|paper war]]" that involved many of London's writers.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p.&amp;nbsp;131–132&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Poems on Several Occasions'', including ''[[The Hop-Garden]]'', in June 1752, [[John Hill (author)|John Hill]] launched a major attack upon Smart's poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Smart responded with his mock-epic, ''[[The Hilliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the release of Smart's poem, Hill was engaged in a large literary battle between various members of Grub Street's and London's writing community, especially [[Henry Fielding]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  This battle may have been for publicity only and lasted over many months before Smart involved himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even with such a late entry, his ''Hilliad'' was the "loudest broadside" of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart was incurring many debts, and started publishing as much as possible during this time to support his family; he was married to Anna Maria Carnan around mid-1752, and in 1754 already had two daughters, Marianne (3 May 1753) and [[Elizabeth Anne Le Noir|Elizabeth Anne]] (27 October 1754).&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 100"&gt;Sherbo p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  As a married man, he could no longer stay enrolled at Pembroke and collect his scholarship money when his marriage and children were made apparent to the heads of the college.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 100"/&gt;  Newbery allowed Smart, along with his wife and their children, to live at [[Canonbury House]], Islington.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 87"/&gt; Although Newbery had a strong reputation for charity, he was determined to have complete control over his writers.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  It is likely that such an attitude combined with monetary problems led to a rift forming between the two in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1753 and 1755, Smart published or republished at least 79 works.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony and Rizzo&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if he received money from each of these publications, these publications were unable to provide enough of an income to support a family, especially to his standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; While he was producing a poem each year for the ''Seatonian Prize'', this amounted to very little of his writing; he was forced into a life of "hack work", which was described by his contemporary, Arthur Murphy, as "a bookseller is his only friend, but for that bookseller, however liberal, he must toil and drudge."&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1755, he finished ''The Works of Horace, Translated Literally into English Prose'', a translation of [[Horace]], which was widely used but brought him little profit.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

He signed a 99-year contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled ''The Universal Visitor or Monthly Memorialist'' for Thomas Gardner and Edmund Allen.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; However, the strain of publishing caused Smart to suffer from a fit, and he was unable to keep up with the publishing of the paper.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 105"&gt;Sherbo p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Allen was a friend of [[Samuel Johnson]], and it was Samuel Johnson, along with many other friends of Smart, who contributed to the magazine in order to help Smart keep up with his contract.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 105"/&gt;  In March 1756, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's final "Seatonian Prize" poem, ''On the Goodness of the Supreme Being'', and later, on 5 June, Newbery published without Smart's authority Smart's ''Hymn to the Supreme Being'', a poem which thanked God for recovery over an illness of some kind, possibly a "disturbed mental state".&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Hymn to the Supreme Being'' marks the time in Smart's life after the mysterious "fit" was resolved and the beginning of Smart's obsession with religion and his praying "without ceasing".&lt;ref name="Curry 6 7"&gt;Curry p.&amp;nbsp;6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asylum confinement===
{{main|Christopher Smart's asylum confinement}}
[[Image:Amusement of Children three Foot High frontispiece.JPG|thumb|A [[caricature]] of Christopher Smart in [[Tommy Tagg]]'s book published by [[John Newbery]]]]

A "Commission of Lunacy" was taken out against Smart, and he was admitted to [[St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics]] on 6 May 1757 as a "Curable Patient".&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart and his immorality in his ''A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.''&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on "madness".&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"&gt;Mounsey p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also evidence that an incident of some kind took place in St. James's Park in which Smart started to pray loudly in public until he had "routed all the company" (''Jubilate Agno'' B89).&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 200"/&gt;

It is not known what exactly happened during his confinement, but Smart did work on two of his most famous poems, ''Jubilate Agno'' and ''A Song to David''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; What is known is that he may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke's and that he was later moved from St Luke's to Mr. Potter's asylum until his release.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; At St Luke's, he transitioned from being "curable" to "incurable", and was moved to Mr. Potter's asylum for monetary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p.&amp;nbsp;203–204&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, although he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote ''Jubilate Agno''.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is debated as to whether his turning inward to examine himself in his poetry represents an evangelical type of Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for "unmediated revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; There is an "inner light" that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during this time, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart was left alone, except for his cat Jeoffrey and the occasional gawker.&lt;ref&gt;Sherbo p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; It is very possible that he felt "homeless" during this time and surely felt that he was in a "limbo&amp;nbsp;... between public and private space".&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In London, only a few of his works were still being published.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone viewed Smart's "madness" as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times.&lt;ref&gt;Keymer p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, [[Robert Browning]] later remarked that ''A Song to David'' was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.

Little is known as to how and why Smart was released from asylum, but Elizabeth, his daughter, claimed: "He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery's great kindness in placing him under necessary &amp; salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more."&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Although this may be a misstatement of the events, Smart did leave the asylum on 30 January 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
''A Song to David'' was printed on 6 April 1763 along with a proposal for a new translation of the ''Psalms''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p.&amp;nbsp;247–248&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Smart composed the poem during his second period of confinement to an asylum during an episode of religious mania&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Robin Flower|date=1927|title=Smart's "Song to David"|jstor=4420831|journal=The British Museum Quarterly|volume=2|issue=2|pages=38–39|doi=10.2307/4420831}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was received harshly, which was possibly just thinly veiled personal attacks over Smart being freed from the asylum just weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kenrick, Smart's former rival, praised the poem in one of his own printed on 25 May 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; Also, John Lockman followed on 21 June 1763, with his own poem in praise of Smart's and [[Samuel Boyce]] followed this on 15 July 1763 with another.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this support, Smart responded to his critics at the ''Critical Review''; in regards to Smart's response, the ''Critical Review'' claimed that they would "say no more of Mr. Smart".&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''A Song to David'', he tried to publish a collection of his ''Psalms'' translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart to find a new publisher, delaying the printing of his ''Psalms''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed ''A Translation of the Psalms of David'', which included ''Hymns and Spiritual Songs'' and a second edition of ''A Song to David''.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetical Works'' III p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light.&lt;ref&gt;Davie p. 828&lt;/ref&gt; While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the ''Phaedrus'' and a verse translation of ''Horace''.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; His verse ''Horace'' was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1770, Smart was arrested for debt.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who originally introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the [[King's Bench Prison]].&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 272"&gt;Mounsey p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the "Rules" (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, in two or three days."&lt;ref&gt;Dearnley p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, ''Hymns, for the Amusement of Children''.&lt;ref name="Mounsey p. 272"/&gt;

===Death===
In response to his uncle's death, Christopher Hunter wrote, "I trust he is now at peace; it was not his portion here."&lt;ref&gt;Curry qtd. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Fanny Burney, in her journal, wrote:

{{quote|But now I speak of authors, let me pay the small tribute of regret and concern due to the memory of poor Mr. Smart, who died lately in the King's Bench Prison; a man by nature endowed with talents, wit, and vivacity, in an eminent degree; and whose unhappy loss of his sense was a public as well as private misfortune. I never knew him in his glory, but ever respected him in his ''decline'', from the fine proofs he had left of his better day, and from the account I have heard of his youth from my father, who was then his intimate companion; as, of late years, he has been his most active and generous friend, having raised a kind of fund for his relief, though he was ever in distress. His intellects, so cruelly impaired, I doubt not, affected his whole conduct.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 265"&gt;Sherbo qtd. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 22 May 1771, a jury of twelve fellow inmates of the King's Bench Prison declared that Smart "upon the Twentieth day of May Instant died a Natural Death within the Rules of the Prison."&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 265"/&gt; He was buried on 26 May in [[St Paul's Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 265" /&gt;

==Literary themes and styles==
Christopher Smart received occasional mentions by critics and scholars after his death, especially by Robert Browning, but analysis and commentary on his works increased dramatically with the "discovery" of ''Jubilate Agno'' in 1939.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works I p. xxii"&gt;''Poetical Works'' I p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent critics approach Smart from a religious perspective (Neil Curry, Harriet Guest, Clement Hawes, Chris Mounsey). However, some also favour a psychology/sexual analysis of his works (Lance Bertelsen, Clemet Hawes, Alan Liu).

===Religion===
[[Image:Jubilate Agno let.JPG|thumb|right|A page from the "Let" side of the ''Jubilate Agno'' manuscript]] [[Image:Jubilate Agno for.JPG|thumb|right|A page from the "For" side of the ''Jubilate Agno'' manuscript]]
Although Smart wrote the "Seatonian Prize" poems early on, there is a contrast between the mimicked Miltonic blank verse and the intense exploration of religion found in his later works.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; His first "Seatonian Prize" poem, ''On the Eternity of the Supreme Being'' is part of two traditional types of religious writing: "authoritative discourse of religious poetry" and "tentative and self-critical discourse of an apparently more personal devotion"&lt;ref name="Guest p. 71"&gt;Guest p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  In connecting the two, he redefines "the role of the religious poet."&lt;ref name="Guest p. 71"/&gt; By establishing a debate between these two forms, Harriet Guest claims that Smart creates "a poetic space which allows the poet to make provisional, even questionable statements", which are important to his later works.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; To Guest, Smart, in his religious poems, "is not concerned to offer instruction in Christian conduct."&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the greater theological debate, the poems also are the origins of Smart's belief that all of creation is constantly praising God, and that a poet must "give voice to mute nature's praise of God."&lt;ref name="Curry p. 8"&gt;Curry p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jubilate Agno'' reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; His "Let" verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of Biblical poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Smart, in ''Jubilate Agno'', plays on words and the meaning behind words in order to participate with the divine that exists within language.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original manuscript divided the "Let" and "For" verses onto opposing sides of the manuscript, Karina Williams claims that "Dr W. H. Bond then discovered that some of the LET and FOR folios were numbered and dated concurrently, and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links."&lt;ref name="Prose Works I p. xxii"&gt;''Prose Works'' I p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; This justified her combining the two sides to follow each other.&lt;ref name="Prose Works I p. xxii"/&gt; Using this as a model, Guest claims that the "For" verses explore religion with a "personal tone" and the "Let" are "unambiguous" and deal with public matters.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p.&amp;nbsp;141–142&lt;/ref&gt; Jeanne Walker goes further than Guest and claims that the "Let " and "For" sections are united with the Hebrew tradition and "iterate both present and future simultaneously, that is, they redeem time."&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

Words and language connect the poet to divine revelation, and God is the "great poet" who used language in order to create the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Through words and language, Smart attempted to capture the creative power of those words.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p.&amp;nbsp;140–141&lt;/ref&gt; By relying on the power of words, Smart is, according to Clement Hawes, subverting "Anglican control over religious functions and services."&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, Smart's approach to religion in ''Jubilate Agno'' is comparable to [[John Wesley]]'s theological [[dictum]] and to the writings of John Perro and [[William Bowling]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; He also creates his own natural philosophy and criticises science, like that established by [[Isaac Newton]], for their ignoring "the glory of Almighty God."&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

To Smart, each piece of matter is alive because it is connected to God, and matter cannot be described in a cold manner that disconnects it from this reality.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; However, Smart accomplished his new science by relying on Newtonian empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his desire to bring back the divine language to poetry and science, he creates an "Ark of Salvation" in order to describe a prophetic and apocalyptic future which emphasises the importance of Christ and England.&lt;ref name="Prose Works I p. xxv"&gt;''Prose Works'' I p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Along with being prophetic, the poem itself is modelled after the canticles and follows the form of the [[Benedicite]].&lt;ref name="Prose Works I p. xxv"/&gt; The Benedicite is not the only model however, and there is a strong link between ''Jubilate Agno'' and the [[psalm]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Walker p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's ''A Song to David'' is an attempt to bridge poetry written by humans and Biblical poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; The Biblical [[David]] plays an important role in this poem just as he played an important role in ''Jubilate Agno''&lt;ref name="Hawes p. 167"&gt;Hawes p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; However, David in ''Jubilate Agno'' is an image of the creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realised model of the religious poet.&lt;ref name="Hawes p. 167" /&gt; By focusing on David, Smart is able to tap into the "heavenly language."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of [[Solomon's Temple]] and his possible role with the [[Freemasons]].&lt;ref name="Curry p. 57"&gt;Curry p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; However, the true life of the poem comes later when Christ is introduced as the major subject.&lt;ref name="Curry 6 7"/&gt; After Christ is introduced, Smart attempts to "reach to heaven" and the final passages, to Neil Curry, represent a "final rush for glory."&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mounsey, ''A Song to David'' and Smart's ''Psalms'' is an attempt to "Christianize" the Old Testament through writing an 18th-century [[psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Psalms'' perform a secondary function: they allow Smart to relate to the suffering of David and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his Biblical model.&lt;ref name="Curry p. 44"&gt;Curry p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Smart's "Christianizing" of the ''Psalms'', Jesus becomes a divine form of suffering, and Smart becomes further juxtaposed with his Biblical model as both praise God for Jesus's ultimate sacrifice and for the beauty of all creation.&lt;ref name="Curry p. 44"/&gt; The ''Hymns'' and ''Psalms'' form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform Anglican liturgy by emphasising God's place in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's ''Hymns'' are modelled after a tradition exemplified by [[Robert Nelson (nonjuror)|Robert Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasise English patriotism and England's divine favour.&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hymns'', according to Guest, "[express] a delight in creation that is largely absent from the work of other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David."&lt;ref&gt;Guest p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; To Hawes, the ''Hymns'' exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Although he wrote his second set of hymns, ''Hymns for the Amusement of Children'', for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasising the need for children to be moral instead of "innocent".&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; These works have been seem as possibly too complicated for "amusement" because they employee ambiguities and complicated theological concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Booth p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the ''Hymns for the Amusement of Children'' is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Curry p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Hymns for the Amusement of Children'', Smart's ''The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ'' were designed to teach morals.&lt;ref&gt;Parker p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ''Parables'' alter the original Biblical [[parable]]s in order to simplify them and help them "make sense"&lt;ref&gt;Parker p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Todd Parker claims that the ''Parables'', and the other religious works of Smart, are part of his final push for the "evangelization of London's reading public."&lt;ref&gt;Parker p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The language and commentary on language is of particular emphasis in ''Jubilate Agno''. To Alan Jacobs, Smart's use of language represents his attempt to connect to the "Ur language", allowing Smart to connect to "the Word calling forth the world."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to David and [[Orpheus]]'s ability as poets to create through their song.&lt;ref name="Hawes p. 167"/&gt; In his constant emphasis on the force of poetry, ''Jubilate Agno'' takes on the qualities of the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the "one true, eternal poem."&lt;ref&gt;Ennis p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam's "onomathetic" tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.&lt;ref&gt;Costa p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Jubilate Agno'', he describes his writing as creating "impressions".&lt;ref&gt;Liu p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomonpoeia in order to emphasise theological significance of his poetic language.&lt;ref&gt;Costa p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these techniques, he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works, especially in his ''Hymns''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Along with scriptural authority, he relies on prophetic rhetoric to gain his audience's sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;Katz p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, there was a debate over poetic language and the translations of Smart, especially of Horace, positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh "Something Old" p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics, like Alan Liu, believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against the original works, and that Smart's language, at least in his translations, must constantly seek to undermine the original authors, like Horace.&lt;ref&gt;Liu p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Not all critics agree with Liu, and those like Donald Davie believe that the Smart's translations cannot be compared to the original works, but are part of a system of Smart competing against the language of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Davie p. 825&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Keymer further verified this point about Smart's translations by revealing that the poet claims, in William Toldervy's ''The History of Two Orphans'', "But what heaven-exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius, who can produce such lines as these following!" in anticipation of replacing the previous flawed translations of the ''Psalms''.&lt;ref&gt;Keymer p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of where he stood on the specific issue of translation Smart believed that there was an importance to language, which carried over to his constant revising of his poems to slowly correct them.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Smart's poems served a dual purpose, and when put to music were altered to meet various standards.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; By constantly revising, he ensured that his poems were always the "authentic" version.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
Smart's role as Mrs. Midnight along with his gendered comments in ''Jubilate Agno'' form the focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender. With Mrs. Midnight, Smart challenges the traditional social order found in 18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; However, some, like Lance Bertelsen, claim that the Mrs. Midnight persona reveals Smart's [[schizophrenia]] in which he is torn between masculine and feminine roles.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser Easton claims that the existence of Mrs. Midnight proves that Smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th-century notions of who is able to attain knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Easton p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; This role allowed Smart to focus on "social and sexual dimensions" in his satire.&lt;ref&gt;Easton p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a potentially darker side to Mrs. Midnight, and she could represent his feelings that he was "emasculated by economic pressures."&lt;ref&gt;Hawes "Bawdy" p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of "horns" in ''Jubilate Agno'' is commonly viewed as a sexual image.&lt;ref&gt;Liu p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Easton puts particular emphasis on the image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout Smart's poem.&lt;ref&gt;Easton p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claims that the poem shows "that [Smart] had been 'feminized' as a cuckold."&lt;ref&gt;Hawes "Bawdy" p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this possible cuckolding, ''Jubilate Agno'' predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes "Bawdy" p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Smart had a reputation for being a "dedicated gardener".&lt;ref name="Dearnley p. 46"&gt;''Dearnley'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; His poem the ''Hop-Garden'' helped to further this reputation, and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature.&lt;ref name="Dearnley p. 46"/&gt; Johnson witnessed Smart's time in asylum and stated, "he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden."&lt;ref&gt;''Boswell's Life of Johnson''&lt;/ref&gt; Gardening, to Smart, was a way in which humans could interact with nature and actually "improve" on the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Dearnley p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Smart did not only write about gardens and vegetation, and his focus on his cat ''Jeoffry'' is widely known and his focus on nature connects him to those mistreated and neglected by 18th-century society.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The first fragment of ''Jubilate Agno'' is a poetic "Ark" that pairs humans with animals in order to purify all of creation.&lt;ref name="Prose Works I p. xxv"/&gt; The whole work relies on his extensive background in botany and his knowledge of taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Smart actively participated in the 18th-century taxonomy systems established by [[Carl Linnaeus]]; however, Smart is mythologising his view of nature and creation when he adds information from [[Pliny the Elder]] into his work.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

By using this knowledge, Smart was able to give a "voice" to nature; he believed that nature, like his cat Jeoffry, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice.&lt;ref name="Curry p. 8"/&gt; As such, themes of animals and language are merged in ''Jubilate Agno'', and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the ''Ars Poetica'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ennis p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freemasonry===
Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of [[Solomon's Temple]] and his possible role with the [[Freemasons]].&lt;ref name="Curry p. 57" /&gt; Although it is not known for sure whether Christopher was a Freemason or not, there is evidence suggesting that he was either part of the organisation or had a strong knowledge of its belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Rose p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Based on personal admittance to contributing to ''A Defence of Freemasonry'', contemporary verification of his participation in the volume and with Masonic meetings, there is enough to confirm "his participation in Masonic affairs."&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 221"&gt;Sherbo p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are accounts of Smart attending meetings at the Bell Tavern in Westminster.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 221"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, John ''Masonic Records, 1717–1886.'' London, 1886. p. 4, 23&lt;/ref&gt; The information available has led Marie Roberts to declare in her 1986 book ''British Poets and Secret Societies'', "It has been universally accepted by scholars that Christopher Smart&amp;nbsp;... was a Freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1986 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the notes to Chris Mounsey's 2001 book ''Christopher Smart: Clown of God'', Marie Roberts' 1986 book is referred to as "an account of Smart's work which accepts his association with the Freemasons," but in Mounsey's view, "Since neither Smart's name nor his pseudonyms appear in the records of the Freemasons, it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number."&lt;ref&gt;Mounsey 2001 p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's involvement with Masonry can be traced through his poems, including ''Jubilate Agno'' and ''A Song to David'', with his constant references to Masonic ideas and his praise of Free Masonry in general.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1986 pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Jubilate Agno'', Smart declares "I am the Lord's builder and free and accepted MASON in CHRIST JESUS" (B 109). This declaration of being a "free and accepted MASON" has been interpreted to define his connection to [[History of Freemasonry#Origin theories of speculative freemasonry|speculative Masonry]]. The "in Christ Jesus" declaration places Smart within a Christian version of Masonry. He also declares himself as "the Lord's builder" and this connects his life with the building of King Solomon's Temple, an important Masonic idea. In ''A Song to David'', Smart returns to the building of Solomon's Temple and incorporates many of the Masonic images that he uses in ''Jubilate Agno''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1986 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this detail that encouraged many critics to try and decode the "seven pillar" section of ''A Song of David'' along the lines of Masonic imagery.&lt;ref name="Curry p. 57"/&gt; The poem follows two traditional sets of motions common to Freemason writing that mimic the image of [[Jacob's Ladder]]: movement from earth to heaven and movement from heaven to earth.&lt;ref&gt;Rose p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; This image further connects Freemason belief surrounding the relationship of David to Solomon's Temple.&lt;ref name ="Rose p. 407"&gt;Rose p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; While these images, and further images in ''A Song to David'' are related also to depictions of the Temple in Isaac Newton's ''Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'' (1728), the [[John Bunyan]]'s ''Solomon's Temple Spiritualiz'd'' (1688), and to the [[Geneva Bible]], these works were relied on by the Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;Rose p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this theory, the first pillar, the Greek alpha, represents the mason's compass and "God as the Architect of the Universe."&lt;ref&gt;Rose p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; The second, the Greek gamma, represents the mason's square.&lt;ref&gt;Rose pp.&amp;nbsp;406–407&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the square represents the "vault of heaven."&lt;ref name ="Rose p. 407"/&gt; The third, the Greek eta, represents Jacob's ladder itself and is connected to the complete idea of seven pillars.&lt;ref name="Rose p. 408"&gt;Rose p. 408&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth, the Greek theta, is either "the all-seeing eye or the point within a circle."&lt;ref name="Rose p. 408"/&gt; The fifth letter, the Greek iota, represents a pillar and the temple.&lt;ref name="Rose p. 410"&gt;Rose p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth letter, the Greek sigma, is an incomplete [[hexagram]], otherwise known as "the blazing star or hexalpha" to the Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Rose p. 410"/&gt; The last, the Greek omega, represents a lyre and David as a poet.&lt;ref&gt;Rose p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

[[File:Abimelech first.jpg|thumb|First page of Abimelech (1768)]]

Smart, throughout his career, published many known works. Although his works are far too many to list, a few of his most famous and important publications during his life include:

* ''[[A Song to David]]''
* ''Poems on Several Occasions'' (including the ''Hop-Garden'')
* ''[[The Hilliad]]''
* ''[[The Hop-Garden]]''
* ''[[Hymns and Spiritual Songs (book)|Hymns and Spiritual Songs]]''
* ''[[Hymns for the Amusement of Children]]''
* The Oratorios ''[[Hannah (oratorio)|Hannah]]'' and ''[[Abimelech (oratorio)|Abimelech]]''
* ''[[The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (book)|The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ]]''
* ''A Poetical Translation of the Fables of Phaedrus''
* The "Seatonian Prize" poems
* ''A Translation of the Psalms of David''
* The ''Works of Horace'' Prose and Verse

One of his most famous poems, ''[[Jubilate Agno]]'', was not published until 1939, by William Force Stead.&lt;ref name="Poetical Works I p. xxii"/&gt; In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by [[Benjamin Britten]] with the translated title ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]''.

He is also credited with the writing of ''A Defence of Freemasonry'' (1765), also known as ''A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered'', that response to [[Laurence Dermott]]'s ''[[Ahiman Rezon]]''.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 221" /&gt; Although there is no direct attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Sherbo p. 221"/&gt;

A two-volume edition of the '' Complete Poems of Christopher Smart '' was published in 1949 by Norman Callan, Professor of English at Queen Mary College, London (now University). There have been numerous reprints.

[[File:Hubert Lamb Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Hubert Lamb Building, University of East Anglia, where the Climatic Research Unit is based]]
The '''Climatic Research Unit''' ('''CRU''') is a component of the [[University of East Anglia]] and is one of the leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Craig | title = The forecast for Scotland: wet, wet, wet | work = The Scotsman | date = 8 February 2005 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/weather/The-forecast-for-Scotland-wet.2601547.jp | accessdate = 1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a staff of some thirty research scientists and students, the CRU has contributed to the development of a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including one of the global temperature records used to monitor the state of the climate system,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global temperature 2008: Another top-ten-year | publisher = Met Office | date = 3 January 2008 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | accessdate = 1 November 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184106/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as statistical software packages and [[climate model]]s.&lt;ref name="UEA Climatic Research Unit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/ |title=About the Climatic Research Unit|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CRU was founded in 1971 as part of the university's School of [[Environmental science]]s. The establishment of the Unit owed much to the support of Sir [[Graham Sutton]], a former Director-General of the [[Meteorological Office]], Lord [[Solly Zuckerman]], an adviser to the University, and Professors [[Keith Clayton]] and [[Brian Funnel]], Deans of the School of Environmental Sciences in 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hulme, Michael|editor2=Barrow, Elaine|author1=Lamb, H.H.|author2=Clayton, K.M.|author3=Wigley, T.M.L.|title=Climates of the British Isles: present, past and future|chapter=The Climatic Research Unit at Twenty-five Years|page=xxvii–xxix|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-13016-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZVVkhW8wL8C&amp;pg=PR27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Initial sponsors included [[BP|British Petroleum]], the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA285 |title=The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich |author=Michael Sanderson |page=285 |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] was another early benefactor, and the [[Wolfson Foundation]] gave the Unit its current building in 1986.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt; Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the [[United States Department of Energy]] to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii"&gt;Hulme &amp; Barrow (1997), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government ([[Margaret Thatcher]]) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name = HistoryCRU /&gt;

The first director of the unit was Professor [[Hubert Lamb]], who had previously led research into climatic variation at the [[Met Office]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; He was then known as the "''ice man''" for his prediction of [[global cooling]] and a coming [[ice age]] but, following the UK's exceptionally [[1976 United Kingdom heat wave|hot summer of 1976]], he switched to predicting a more imminent [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; The possibility of major weather changes and flooding attracted attention to the unit and sponsorship by major insurance companies wanting to mitigate their potential losses.&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Prior to the Unit's establishment, it had widely been believed by the meteorological establishment that the climate was essentially constant and unvarying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maunder|first=W.J.|title=The uncertainty business: risks and opportunities in weather and climate|page=6|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1986|isbn=978-0-416-36100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb and others in the climatological community had for years argued that the climate system was in fact highly variable on timescales of decades to centuries and longer. The establishment of the CRU enabled Lamb and his colleagues to focus on this issue and eventually to win the argument decisively.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt;

Hubert Lamb retired in 1978. His successors were [[Tom Wigley]] (1978–1993), [[Trevor Davies]] (1993–1998), [[Jean Palutikof]] and [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] (jointly 1998–2004), Phil Jones (2004–2016), and [[Tim Osborn]] (from January 2017);&lt;ref name=HistoryCRU&gt;{{cite web|title = History of the Climatic Research Unit|publisher = Climatic Research Unit, [[University of East Anglia]]|url = http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|accessdate = 21 January 2017|archivedate = 18 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118234215/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/tim-osborn-to-take-over-leadership-of-cru|title = Tim Osborn to take over leadership of CRU|publisher = [[University of East Anglia]]|date = 21 December 2016|accessdate = 20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Liss]] was acting director during investigations between December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|title = CRU Update 3|date = 1 December 2009|accessdate = 14 April 2010|archivedate = 2 December 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202075038/http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and July 2010.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|last = McCarthy|first = Michael|title = 'Conspiracy theories finally laid to rest' by report on leaked climate change emails|date = 8 July 2010|newspaper = [[The Independent]]|accessdate = 20 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144651/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|archivedate = 7 March 2016|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the unit moved to a new cylindrical building designed by [[Rick Mather]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE345&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA345|title = The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich|first = Michael|last = Sanderson|page = 345|year = 2002|isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, this was named the ''Hubert Lamb Building'' in honour of the first director.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Fred Pearce|last = Pearce|first = Fred|title = The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming|year = 2010|publisher = [[Guardian Books]]|isbn = 978-0-85265-229-9|page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

At the time of its establishment the CRU set out four key aims, which still remain valid:

* To establish firmer knowledge of the history of climate in the recent and distant past.
* To monitor and report on current climatic developments on a global scale.
* To identify the processes (natural and man-made) at work in climatic fluctuations and the characteristic timescales of their evolution.
* To investigate the possibilities of making advisory statements about future trends of weather and climate from a season to many years ahead, based on acceptable scientific methods and in a form likely to be useful for long-term planning purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Research Unit Monthly Bulletin'', 1972, vol. 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

CRU produces a range of climate datasets, covering temperature, precipitation, pressure and circulation, both global and regional.&lt;ref name="Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=Data | website=CRU | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/data | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the CRU's most significant products is the CRUTEM global dataset of land near-surface temperature anomalies on a 5° by 5° grid-box basis, which is compiled in conjunction with the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] and its sea-surface temperature dataset to produce the [[HadCRUT]] [[Instrumental temperature record|temperature record]].&lt;ref name="CRUTEM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Temperature data (HadCRUT4) | website=CRU | date=27 August 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; First compiled in the early 1980s, the record documents global temperature fluctuations since the 1850s. The CRU compiles the land component of the record and the Hadley Centre provides the marine component. The merged record is used by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in all its publications.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii" /&gt; Other products include the CRU TS high resolution gridded land surface dataset of multiple factors including precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover as well as temperatures.&lt;ref name="CRU TS"&gt;{{cite web | title=High-resolution gridded datasets | website=CRU | date=1 September 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRU is also involved in a study of Eurasian climate over the last 10,000 years based upon [[dendroclimatology|tree ring data]] and a study of European climate in the last 200 years based upon temperature records.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; It is a participant in MEDALUS – the [[Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use project]].&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFmadtCvtRoC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–3 |title=The environment dictionary |author=David D. Kemp |isbn=978-0-415-12752-3 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custodians of the raw data are the [[:Template:National Meteorological Organisations|National Meteorological Organisations]] that originated the data; CRU retains most but not all of the raw data, which continues to be held by the originating services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bravender|first=Robin|title=CLIMATE: Scientists return fire at sceptics in 'destroyed data' dispute|work=Greenwire|url=http://www.eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2009/10/14/3|date=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It published a quarterly journal, ''Climate Monitor''.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; This ceased publication in 1998, being replaced by an online version, ''Climate Monitor Online''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/climon/ |title=Climate Monitor Online |year=2004 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604225349/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/climon/ |archivedate=4 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of raw meteorological data === 
{{main|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit}}
The CRU collates data from many sources around the world. In August 2009 its director, [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]], told the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that he was working to make the data publicly available with the agreement of its owners but this was expected to take some months, and objections were anticipated from National Meteorological Organisations that made money from selling the data. It was not free to share that data without the permission of its owners because of confidentiality agreements, including with institutions in Spain, Germany, Bahrain and Norway, that restricted the data to academic use. In some cases the agreements were made orally, and some of the written agreements had been lost during a move. Despite this, the CRU was the focus of numerous requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] for data used by the unit's scientists. ''Nature'' reported that in the course of five days in July 2009 the CRU had been "inundated" with 58 FOI requests from [[Stephen McIntyre]] and people affiliated with his [[Climate Audit]] blog requesting access to raw climate data or information about their use.&lt;ref name="Nature 20090812"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460787a.html|title=Climate data spat intensifies|date=12 August 2009|issue=460|page=787|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}} Subscription or payment required to read article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 a large amount of raw weather station data had been released by the [[Met Office]] and the US [[Global Historical Climatology Network]], but around two-thirds of the data owners did not respond to the CRU requests for agreement, and both [[Poland]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] declined. Two FOIA requests for data shared with another researcher were refused by the university, and the requestors appealed this to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO). In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO required CRU to release the remaining raw data irrespective of the wishes of the meteorological organisations which owned the data. This decision included data from Trinidad and Tobago but did not cover Poland. The raw data release was completed by 27 July 2011.&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011"&gt;{{Cite web |last = Black | first = Richard | title = Climate unit releases virtually all remaining data | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14315747 |work=''BBC News''|date = 27 July 2011 | accessdate =15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a new analysis of temperature data by the independent [[Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature]] group, many of whom had stated publicly that they thought it was possible that the CRU had manipulated data, concluded that "these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions".&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |author=Richard Black|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiation fractionation as cancer treatment ==
Fractionation effects are utilised in the treatment of [[cancer]] with [[radiation therapy]]. When the total dose of [[radiation]] is divided into several, smaller doses over a period of several days, there are fewer [[toxic]] effects on healthy cells. This maximizes the effect of radiation on cancer and minimizes the negative [[side effects]]. A typical fractionation scheme divides the dose into 30 units delivered every weekday over six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiotherapy dose fractionation, second edition |url=https://www.rcr.ac.uk/publication/radiotherapy-dose-fractionation-second-edition |website=[[The Royal College of Radiologists]] |language=en |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Bleddyn |last2=Morgan |first2=David AL |editor1-last=Dale |editor1-first=Roger G. |editor2-last=Jones |editor2-first=Bleddyn |title=Radiobiological modelling in radiation oncology |date=2007 |publisher=British Institute of Radiology |location=London |isbn=9780905749600 |chapter=Radiotherapy fractionation|doi=10.1259/9780905749839.chapter04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypofractionation''' is a treatment regimen that delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer visits. The logic behind this treatment is that applying greater amounts of radiation works to lower the effects of accelerated tumor growth that typically occurs during the later stages of radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperfractionation''' is dividing the same total dose into more deliveries. Treatments are given more than once a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hyperfractionated radiation therapy |url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/hyperfractionated-radiation-therapy |website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Earth''''' is a 2007 [[nature documentary]] film which depicts the diversity of wild habitats and creatures across the planet. The film begins in the [[Arctic]] in January of one year and moves southward, concluding in [[Antarctica]] in the December of the same year. Along the way, it features the journeys made by three particular species—the [[polar bear]], [[African bush elephant]] and [[humpback whale]]—to highlight the threats to their survival in the face of rapid [[environmental change]]. A companion piece to the 2006 [[BBC Worldwide|BBC]]/[[Discovery Channel|Discovery]] television series ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', the film uses many of the same sequences, though most are edited differently, and features previously unseen footage.

''Earth'' was co-directed by [[Alastair Fothergill]], the executive producer of the television series, and [[Mark Linfield]], the producer of ''Planet Earth''{{'}}s "From Pole to Pole" and "Seasonal Forests" episodes. It was co-produced by [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and Greenlight Media, with Discovery providing some of the funding. In North America, the film was released by [[Disneynature]], the first film under Disney's recently formed nature film label. The same organisations collaborated on Fothergill's previous film, ''Deep Blue'' (2003), itself a companion to his 2001 television series on the natural history of the world's oceans, ''[[The Blue Planet]]''. The British version of ''Earth'' was narrated by [[Patrick Stewart]] and the US version was narrated by [[James Earl Jones]].

''Earth'' was released in cinemas internationally during the final quarter of 2007 and throughout 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0393597/releaseinfo |publisher=IMDb.com |title=Earth (2007) - Release dates |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With total worldwide box office revenue exceeding [[United States dollar|$]]100 million, ''Earth'' is the second-highest-grossing nature documentary of all time.&lt;ref name="bomojo"/&gt;

A sequel, titled ''Earth: One Amazing Day'', was released in the United States on 6 October 2017. It made its world premiere in [[Beijing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldwide/2017/earth-one-amazing-day|title=BBC Earth Films launches Earth: One Amazing Day in China|work=BBC News|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Over the course of a calendar year, ''Earth'' takes the viewer on a journey from the [[North Pole]] in January to the [[South Pole|South]] in December, revealing how plants and animals respond to the power of the sun and the changing seasons. The film focuses on three particular species, the [[polar bear]], [[African bush elephant]] and [[humpback whale]].

Starting in the high [[Arctic]] in January, as the darkness of winter gives way to the sun, a mother polar bear is shown emerging from her den with two new cubs. She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the [[sea ice]] before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a [[walrus]] colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack.

African bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a [[dust storm]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]]. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry [[lion]]s and scavenger [[white-backed vulture]]s. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the [[Okavango Delta]] to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world.

A humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the [[tropics]]. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a {{convert|4000|mi|km|adj=mid}} journey south to the rich feeding grounds near [[Antarctica]], the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they navigate dangerous seas where [[great white shark]]s are filmed breaching as they hunt. [[Sea lion]]s, and [[sailfish]] and [[dolphin]]s combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays. Here, the whales are shown feeding on [[krill]] by trapping them in bubble nets.

The stories of these individual creatures are woven into the film alongside a great many additional scenes. The supporting cast of animals include [[mandarin duck]]lings filmed jumping from their tree hole nest, [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]] hunting [[caribou]], [[cheetah]] hunting [[Thomson's gazelle]], [[elephant]]s charging at [[white-backed vulture]], [[birds of paradise]] displaying in the [[New Guinea]] [[rainforest]], [[Adelie penguins]] in the Antarctic and [[demoiselle crane]]s on their autumn migration across the [[Himalayas]].

[[Time-lapse photography]] is used to show the blossoming of spring flowers, seasonal changes to [[deciduous forest]]s, clouds sweeping up Himalayan valleys, and the growth of jungle [[spore]]s and [[fungi]].

==Themes==
The narration is woven around the theme of anthropogenic [[environmental change]]. The three species it features are used to illustrate particular threats to the planet's wildlife. In the Arctic, rising temperatures are causing a greater area of sea ice to melt and threatening the polar bear with [[extinction]] as early as 2030. [[Global warming]] is also disrupting the planet's [[weather system]]s and making seasonal rainfall patterns less predictable. This poses a threat to creatures like elephants, which must travel greater distances to reach water. Rising ocean temperatures have started to kill the [[plankton]] on which humpback whales and most other sea life depend. The film ends with the message that "it's not too late to make a difference."

==Production==
''Earth'' was produced by Alix Tidmarsh of BBC Worldwide and Sophokles Tasioulis of Greenlight Media. Following ''Deep Blue'', it is the second film of a five-picture deal between the two companies. The process of bringing ''Planet Earth'' and ''Earth'' to the screen took over five years. With a budget of $47 million, the film was the most expensive production in the history of documentary filmmaking at the time, later to be surpassed by ''[[Oceans (film)|Oceans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grhomeboy.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/%E2%80%98earth%E2%80%99-vision-and-the-art-of-persuasion/ |title=''Earth'': Vision and the art of persuasion |publisher=HomeboyMediaNews |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography began in 2004 and was completed in 2006.

==Release==
''Earth'' received its world [[premiere]] at Spain's [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]] in September 2007. It was released across Europe in the fourth quarter of 2007 and early 2008 to much success. In April 2008, it was announced that ''Earth'' would be the first feature released by [[Disneynature]], a newly-formed film unit of the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], specialising in natural history documentaries since ''[[True-Life Adventures]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia|title=Disney gets back to nature|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/22/business/fi-disney22|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 April 2008|author2=Dawn C. Chmielewski}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the US on April 22, 2009, with [[James Earl Jones]] narrating in place of [[Patrick Stewart]]. [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] also handled distribution in Canada and Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&amp;id=earth09.htm |title=Earth (2009) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of those territories, the film's distribution rights were sold to various independent distributors including; [[Lionsgate]] in the UK and Australia, [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] in France, and [[UFA GmbH|Universum Film AG]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Wendy|title=Lionsgate strikes UK and Australia deal for BBC's Earth|url=http://www.screendaily.com/lionsgate-strikes-us-uk-and-australia-deal-for-bbcs-earth/4030921.article|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=Screen Daily|date=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional differences==
In addition to replacing Patrick Stewart with James Earl Jones as a narrator, the U.S. version uses a more dramatic soundtrack and runs only 90 minutes, compared to the original cut's 99 minutes.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 87% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 91 reviews, the second-highest score of all the Disneynature films (behind ''[[Monkey Kingdom]]'', which has a score of 93%), with an average score of 7.2 out of 10. Its consensus stated: "With its spectacular and extensive footage, ''Earth'' is both informative and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1197228-earth/ |title=Earth (2009) Movie Reviews, Pictures |accessdate=2009-05-26 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[review aggregator]], [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave an average score of 72, being a generally favourable review, based on 26 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/earth2009 |title=Earth(2009): Reviews |accessdate=2009-05-26 |publisher=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
On its first day of release in the US, ''Earth'' opened at #1, grossing $4,023,788 from 1,810 theaters. For its first weekend, it opened at #5, grossing $8,825,760, as well as $14,472,792 over the five-day period. Despite dropping to #7 the next weekend, taking in $4,340,235, it took in $12,017,017 over the previous week (including Sunday), and ending up with a two-week total of $22,004,284. It closed on July 30, 2009 after 100 days of release, ending up with a final gross of $32,011,576, making it a modest success in the US.

''Earth'' picked up an additional $76,931,115 at the international box office. It took over $30 million in Germany alone, became one of the three highest-grossing films of the year in France and had the best opening of any natural history documentary in Spain. By contrast, in the UK ''Earth'' debuted on just 14 screens and amassed less than [[Pound sterling|£]]75,000 in ticket sales.

In January 2008, the Japanese version of ''Earth'', narrated by actor [[Ken Watanabe]], knocked [[Hollywood]] blockbuster ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' off the top of the box office despite opening on half the number of screens. It went on to gross more than 2 billion yen ($18.5 million), making it the most successful documentary there of the last 10 years.

Its worldwide total of $108,942,691 made ''Earth'' a commercial success and placed it second on the all-time list of highest-grossing nature documentaries, behind ''[[March of the Penguins]]''.

==Nuclear power==
{{See also|Nuclear energy in Hungary}}

Hungary had in 2017 four operating nuclear power reactors, constructed between 1982 and 1987, at the [[Paks Nuclear Power Plant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atomeromu.hu/en/AboutUs/Lapok/1default.aspx|title=Paks Nuclear Power Plant - About Us|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=May 11, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Oil ==
[[MOL Group]] is an oil and gas group in Hungary.

==Gas ==
[[Emfesz]] is a natural gas distributor in Hungary. [[Panrusgáz]] imports natural gas from Russia mainly Gazprom.

The [[Arad–Szeged pipeline]] is a natural gas pipeline from Arad (Romania) to Szeged (Hungary).

[[Nabucco]] and [[South Stream]] gas pipelines may be constructed via Hungary to other European countries. The [[Nabucco]] gas pipeline is expected to pipe 31bn cubic metres of gas annually in a 3,300&amp;nbsp;km long pipeline constructed via Hungary, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and Austria. The [[South Stream]] gas pipeline is expected to pipe 63bn cu m of gas from southern Russia to Bulgaria under the Black Sea. The pipe is planned to run via Hungary  to central and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Putin opens Nord Stream Baltic gas pipeline to Germany, BBC 6 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{Main |Renewable energy in Hungary }}
{{See also|Wind power in Hungary}}

Hungary is a member of the [[European Union]] and thus takes part in the EU strategy to increase its share of the [[renewable energy]]. The EU has adopted the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, which included a 20% renewable energy target by 2020 for the EU.&lt;ref name=EWEA2050&gt;[http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/reports/EWEA_EU_Energy_Policy_to_2050.pdf EU Energy Policy to 2050] EWEA March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By 2030 wind should produce in average 26-35% of the EU's electricity and save Europe €56 billion a year in avoided fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;Wind Energy Factsheets, [[European Wind Energy Association]] 2010 page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The national authors of Hungary forecast is 14.7% renewables in gross energy consumption by 2020, exceeding their 13% binding target by 1.7 percentage points. Hungary is the EU country with the smallest forecast penetration of renewables of the electricity demand in 2020, namely only 11% (including [[biomass]] 6% and [[wind power]] 3%). The forecast includes 400 MW of new [[wind power]] capacity between 2010-2020. EWEA’s 2009 forecast expects Hungary to reach 1.2 GW of installed wind capacity in this time.&lt;ref name="EWEA2050"/&gt; In the end of 2010 wind power capacity was 295 MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/statistics/EWEA_Annual_Statistics_2010.pdf Wind in power 2010 European statistics] [[EWEA]] February 2011 page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fieldstone''' is a naturally occurring type of stone, which lay at or near the surface of the Earth. Fieldstones were a nuisance for farmers seeking to expand their farms, but at some point these stones started being used as a [[building construction|construction]] material&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/history-science-and-poetry-new-englands-stone-walls|title=The history, science and poetry of New England's stone walls|date=2014-05-13|work=EARTH Magazine|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-england-stone-walls|title=New England Is Crisscrossed With Thousands of Miles of Stone Walls|date=2018-05-04|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stonewall.uconn.edu/resources/primer/purposes-then-and-now/#|title=Purposes Then and Now {{!}} Stone Wall Initiative|website=stonewall.uconn.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Strictly speaking, it is [[Rock (geology)|stone]] collected from the surface of [[Field (agriculture)|fields]] where it occurs naturally. Collections of fieldstones which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective [[agriculture]] are called [[clearance cairn]]s.

In practice, fieldstone is any [[architecture|architectural]] stone used in its natural shape and can be applied to stones recovered from the [[topsoil]] or [[subsoil]]. Although fieldstone is generally used to describe such material when used for exterior walls, it has come to include its use in other ways including [[garden]] features and interiors. It is sometimes cut or split for use in architecture.

==Glacial Deposition of Fieldstone==
Fieldstone is common in soils throughout temperate latitudes due to glacial deposition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/history-science-and-poetry-new-englands-stone-walls|title=The history, science and poetry of New England's stone walls|date=2014-05-13|work=EARTH Magazine|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The type of field stones left through [[Glacial period|glaciation]], are known as glacial erratics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Catskills in the Ice Age|last=Titus|first=Robert|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|year=1996|isbn=0-995796-77-0|location=|pages=40-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In Canada and the northern United States, the advance of the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] pulverized bedrock, and its retreat deposited several dozen meters of unsorted [[till]] in previously glaciated areas as far south as [[New England]] and the [[Upper Midwest]]. 

Although a coarse layer of glacial ablation would settle on top of the deeper lodgment till, it was these more deeply set stones that would prove a persistent challenge for [[agriculture|settled human agriculture]] because they would be [[frost heave|frost-churned]] into surface soils during harsh winters.&lt;ref name="Thorson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thorson |first=Robert |title=Stone by Stone: The Magnificent History in New England's Stone Walls |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |date=2002|isbn=9780802776877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large collections of fieldstone can be found at the edge of the [[last glacial period]] also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation. These edges are known as [[Terminal moraine|terminal moraines]]. Large deposits are found at the end of these glacial advances. In The northeastern United States there are some of the largest deposits caused by terminal moraines which are known to exist from the last glacial period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ice Age in North America|last=Wright|first=G. Frederick|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=175-195}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Fieldstones and human settlement==
Settled agriculture requires relatively fine and uniform soils for intensive use, and large rocks pose additional risks for agricultural machinery, which they can damage if not removed. Because the stones are widely disseminated, removing fieldstone is a widespread and costly activity in early agricultural settlement. To prepare fields for cultivation, farmers would need to remove these stones, which requires significant manual labor. Until the 19th century, fieldstone was removed exclusively by hand, often with whole families participating in this task.&lt;ref name="Thorson"/&gt; Depending on the harshess of winters, this task would need to be repeated whenever frost levels would churn new stones into soil surfaces. Thus, land with many fieldstones was and is considered marginal and is assessed for tax purposes well below land that is considered stone-free.

In [[mechanized agriculture]], fieldstone is usually removed by a tractor attachment called a [[rock picker]]. A chain-driven wheel rotates a graded scoop picking surface rocks from the soil and shakes off excess soil. A hydraulic lift then tilts and empties the rock bucket, usually along the perimeter of the farm. Washed and split, field rock is considered an attractive landscape and building material, and can be expensive at building supply stores.

=== In New England ===
Fieldstone became abundant throughout [[New England]] and Eastern Canada as European settlers began to [[Clearcutting|clearcut]] forests for timber, wood fuel, and [[agricultural expansion]]. Although settled agriculture and timber extraction began as early as 1620 in coastal areas, large-scale clear-cutting began in the late 18th century with increased immigration and inland settlement. Fuel and material demands led to the near-complete deforestation of the region. Cleared soils were subject to deeper freezing, which caused [[frost heave|frost-churned]] stones to rise to the soil surfaces.&lt;ref name="Thorson"/&gt; When the virgin land was tilled, the fields were littered with rocks. Abundant and not as portable or versatile as other fencing materials, these stones were moved to the edge of the fields and stacked into stone walls, for which New England is now well-known. 

Each spring, the [[stone walls]] were added to when the fields were plowed, as more stones were brought to the surface following the winter freeze and the spring thaw. The greatest number of these walls were stacked between 1775 and 1825, but efforts to repair and extend these walls continued throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Thorson" /&gt; According to an 1871 agricultural census, over {{convert|380,000|km|mi}} were constructed throughout the region, representing 40 million days of human labor.&lt;ref name="Thorson" /&gt; As agricultural production moved westward, areas of New England have since reforested.

=== On the High Plains ===
Fieldstone occurs extensively on the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]]. On or near the surface, fieldstones come in many colors, and are limited in size to about 4 feet in diameter, although larger rocks are sometimes recovered. Pretty and colorful, fieldstones are used occasionally as building materials; some of the more stately homes on the Prairies are constructed of fieldstone and are over a century old. However, fieldstone as a building material is very much underused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=3105 |title=Reynolds Stone House |publisher=HistoricPlaces.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldisround.com/articles/311291/photo8.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319192631/http://www.worldisround.com/articles/311291/photo8.html |archivedate=2012-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fugitive emissions''' are emissions of gases or [[vapor]]s from pressurized equipment due to [[leak]]s and other unintended or irregular releases of gases, mostly from industrial activities. As well as the economic cost of lost commodities, fugitive emissions contribute to [[air pollution]] and [[climate change]]. A detailed inventory of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from upstream [[Petroleum industry|oil and gas]] activities in Canada for the year 2000 estimated that fugitive equipment leaks had a [[global warming potential]] equivalent to the release of 17 million metric tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]], or 12 per cent of all greenhouse gases emitted by the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | last = Clearstone Engineering | year = 1994 | title = A National Inventory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG), Criteria Air Contaminant (CAC) and Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) Emissions by the Upstream Oil and Gas Industry, Volume 1, Overview of the GHG Emissions Inventory | pages = v | publisher = Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers | url = http://www.capp.ca/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=763&amp;PubID=86220 | accessdate = 2008-12-10 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venting of natural gas, [[Gas flare|flaring]], accidental releases and storage losses accounted for an additional 38 per cent.

Fugitive emissions present other risks and hazards. Emissions of [[volatile organic compound]]s such as [[benzene]] from [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[chemical plant]]s pose a long term health risk to workers and local communities. In situations where large amounts of flammable liquids and gases are contained under pressure, leaks also increase the risk of fire and explosion.

Leaks from pressurized process equipment generally occur through [[valve]]s, [[Flange#Pipe flanges|pipe connections]], [[Seal (mechanical)|mechanical seals]], or related equipment. Fugitive emissions also occur at evaporative sources such as [[waste water treatment|waste water treatment ponds]] and [[storage tank]]s. Because of the huge number of potential leak sources at large industrial facilities and the difficulties in detecting and repairing some leaks, fugitive emissions can be a significant proportion of total emissions.  Though the quantities of leaked gases may be small, gases that have serious health or environmental impacts can cause a significant problem.

To minimize and control leaks at process facilities operators carry out regular leak detection and repair activities. Routine inspections of process equipment with [[gas detector]]s can be used to identify leaks and estimate the leak rate in order to decide on appropriate corrective action. Proper [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] of equipment reduces the likelihood of leaks.

Because of the technical difficulties and costs of detecting and quantifying actual fugitive emissions at a site or facility, and the variability and intermittent nature of emission flow rates, bottom-up estimates based on standard [[emission factor]]s are generally used for annual reporting purposes.

New technologies are under development that could revolutionize the detection and monitoring of fugitive emissions. One technology, known as differential absorption [[lidar]] (DIAL), can be used to remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from a facility. DIAL has been used for refinery surveys in Europe for over 15 years. A pilot study carried out in 2005 using DIAL found that actual emissions at a refinery were fifteen times higher than those previously reported using the emission factor approach. The fugitive emissions were equivalent to 0.17% of the refinery throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct Measurement of Fugitive Emissions of Hydrocarbons from a Refinery |journal= Journal of the Air &amp; Waste Management Association |date=August 2008 |first=Allan |last=Chambers |author2=Tony Wootton |author3=Jan Moncrieff |author4=Philip McCready |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1047–1056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable gas leak imaging cameras are also a new technology that can be used to improve leak detection and repair, leading to reduced fugitive emissions. The cameras use infrared imaging technology to produce video images in which invisible gases escaping from leak sources can be clearly identified.

'''George-ericksenite''' is a mineral with the chemical formula Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular [[crystal habit]] along [001] and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, [[Chile]] had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an [[X-Ray Powder Diffraction|X-ray powder diffraction]] pattern that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research [[Economic geology|economic geologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA).  The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]].

== Description ==

=== Occurrence and paragenesis ===
George-ericksonite is commonly found as isolated bright lemon-yellow micronodules of crystals that are concentrated on the surface of one part of the mineral specimen. However, in some cases the micronodules occur as groupings instead of isolated occurrences. The average size of these micronodules is approximately 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm and each consists of numerous individual crystals in random orientation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/TOC/Articles_Free/1998/Cooper_p390-399_98.pdf|title = Georgeericksenite, Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;|last = Cooper|first = Mark A.|date = 1998|journal = American Mineralogist|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 15, 2015|last2 = Hawthorne|first2 = Frank C.|last3 = Roberts|first3 = Andrew C.|last4 = Grice|first4 = Joel D.|last5 = Stirling|first5 = John A.R.|last6 = Moffatt|first6 = Elizabeth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron microprobe examination ===
This examination was carried out by attaching two [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] crystals to the surface of a disk with [[epoxy]] and then examining them with a CAMECA SX-50 [[electron microprobe]]. One of the crystals had the (100) surface facing up, and the other crystal had a growth face of the form (110) facing up. The microprobe was operating in wavelength-dispersive mode at 15 kV and ran various currents from 20 nA to 0.5 nA. The CAMECA SX-50 has three [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] and the samples were examined in the sequence ([[Sodium|Na]], [[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iodine|I]]), then ([[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Sulfur|S]], [[Calcium|Ca]]). When the [[crystal]] was exposed to the electron beam for the first 200 seconds, the counts per second on each element varied greatly which indicates that the crystals are extremely unstable in the electron beam. The counts per second for each element were also dependent on the surface of the crystal [(100) or (110)] analyzed. Over shorter counting times (&lt;10 s) at 15 kV and 5 nA, there is a gain in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and a drop in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O relative to ideal values. However, a significant orientation effect exists for SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO values for the (100) and (110) surfaces on either side of the ideal values. With increasing exposure to the electron beam, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increases and all other oxides decrease. This behavior is also more rapid on the (100) surface than on the (110) crystal face. The (100) surface is overall more reactive to the electron beam than the (110) surface, but both surfaces seem to approach equilibrium with the beam and give similar oxides weight percentages after 200 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Even at low currents and short counting times george-ericksenite is extremely unstable under the electron beam. After examination, the crystal faces are stained brown from the reaction with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the decrease in analyzed I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with increasing time. The crystallographic orientation of the material analyzed has a large impact on the analytical values at any given time. The overall quantitative behavior of george-ericksenite in the electron beam is consistent with the chemical composition derived (ideally I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; 59.13, CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 9.92. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 1.51, MgO 2.38, CaO 3.31, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 10.98, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 12.77 weight %).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Crystal structure ==

=== Data collection ===
A 0.046 X 0.059 X 0.060&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; crystal was mounted on a Siemans ''P''4 four-circle diffractometer. The crystal was aligned using 42 reflections automatically centered following measurement from a rotation photograph. The orientation matrix and unit-cell dimensions were determined from the setting angles of least-squares refinement. 3872 reflections were recorded out to 60&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 2θ with a fixed scan speed of 1.33° 2θ/min. Corrections for absorption by [[Gaussian quadrature]] integration were applied. Corrections for Lorentz, [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and background effects were also applied as well as reduction of intensities to structure factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure solution and refinement ===
The SHELXTL PC Plus system of programs were used for the calculations. The ''R'' and ''Rw'' indices are of the conventional form. The structure was solved by direct methods. The structure is centrosymmetric as indicated by the E statistics. Systematic absences also indicate the presence of a ''c'' glide for the C-centered cell. The result was placing george-ericksenite in the C2/c space group. The structure was refined by a combination of least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier synthesis to an ''R'' index of 3.5% and ''Rw'' equal to 3.5%. Site occupancies were determined by the basis of site-scattering refinement and crystal-chemical criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the structure ==

=== Cation coordination ===
There is one [[Chromium|chromium (Cr)]] site that is symmetrically distinct and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms. The average length of the bonds is 1.61 Å which indicates that the Cr [[cation]] is [[Valence (chemistry)|hexavalent]]. The average bond length at the Cr site is less than would be expected for complete occupancy by Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;. This difference can be accounted for by partial substitution of [[Sulfur|sulfur (S)]] atoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Iodine|iodine (I)]] sites that are coordinated by three [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms arranged in a triangle to one side of the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group forming a [[Pyramid (geometry)|triangular pyramid]] with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional [[ligand]]s that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each [[octahedron]]. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded [[anions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Sodium|sodium (Na)]] sites that are each unique. Each site has a different type of coordination. The Na1 site is encompassed by two [[Oxygen|O]] atoms and four [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] groups in a distorted [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] arrangement with a Na1-Φ distance (where Φ=unspecified ligand) of 2.41 Å. The Na2 site is surrounded by five O atoms and 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in an augmented octahedral arrangement with a Na2-Φ distance of 2.54 Å. The Na3 site is surrounded by five O atoms and three H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O atoms in a triangular [[Dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] arrangement with a Na3-Φ distance of 2.64 Å.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is only one [[Magnesium|magnesium (Mg)]] site which is coordinated by six O atoms in an octahedral arrangement with a Mg-O distance of 2.09 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Mg with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The one [[Calcium|calcium (Ca)]] site is coordinated by six O atoms and two H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in a square-antiprismatic arrangement with a Ca-Φ distance of 2.50 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Ca with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure topology ===
George-ericksenite features a structural arrangement that is composed of slabs of polyhedra orthogonal to [100]. These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the [100] direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by [[hydrogen bond]]ing. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three planar layers of cations. There are also three planar layers of cations parallel to the edges of the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The ''c''-glide symmetry relates the top and bottom of the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.

There is a prominent [[zigzag]] pattern of chains of Na polyhedra extending in the ''c'' direction on the outer layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] that extends in the [011] direction. This [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer extending in the [0-11] direction. This [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] continues to form a [Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;] [[zigzag]] chain extending in the ''c'' direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the ''c'' axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.

The inner layer of the slab is composed of one Mg octahedron that shares corners with two Cr tetrahedra. This forms a [MT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster. The other two anions of the Mg octahedron link by corner-sharing to two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. These [Mg(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters link together two (CaΦ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) polyhedra. This forms chains parallel to the ''b'' axis. Weak I-O bonds link these chains to form the central layer of the slab.

=== Relation to other minerals ===
The only other chromate-iodate mineral is dietzeite, Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Dietzeite and george-ericksenite have no structural relationship.  Fuenzalidaite and carlosruizite are sulphate-iodate minerals found in the Chilean nitrate fields and contain small amounts of Cr substituting for S. They are also sheet structures, but the sheets are vastly different in terms of connectivity than in george-ericksenite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

==Description==

Holdrege silt loam covers 1.8 million acres of land in south-central Nebraska, under a grass landscape. Good drainage and moisture movement resulted in the downward movement of clay and lime. First described in 1917 in [[Phelps County, Nebraska]], the soil has a significant role in corn, grain and soy farming. Formed in silty, calcareous [[loess]], the soil ranges from 0 to 15 percent slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holdrege -- Nebraska State Soil|url=http://extension.illinois.edu/soil/st_soils/ne_soil.htm|publisher=University of Illinois Extension|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1841">The '''Itigi-Sumbu thicket''' is an [[ecoregion]] consisting of two small areas of thick shrubland in [[Tanzania]] and in [[Zambia]], [[East Africa]].

==Setting==
The thickets are found in the flatland between [[Lake Mweru Wantipa]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] in Zambia (between 950 m and 1,200 m above sea level), and near the town of [[Itigi]] in Tanzania. The climate consists of a cool dry season from May to August, a hot dry season from August to November, and a rainy season from November to April.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Itigi-Sumbu thicket|id=at0708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The extremely dense, impenetrable Itigi deciduous thicket is a unique mixture of woody shrubs 3 to 5 metres high.

==Fauna==
Traditionally habitat of [[elephant]] and [[black rhino]] the area is vulnerable to poaching and the rhino have been eradicated from the area. 
The thickets are also home to three endemic reptiles Urungu beaked snake ([[Rhinotyphlops gracilis]]), four-fingered skink ([[Sepsina]] tetradactyla), and a lizard [[Latastia]] johnstoni.

==Human settlement==

{{Empty section|date=November 2013}}

==Threats and preservation==
The thickets are being extensively cleared for firewood and for cultivation as the populations of the two countries grow, with 50% gone in Tanzania (which is unprotected) and 70% in Zambia, which does have some protection in the [[Mweru Wantipa National Park]]. The largest blocks of thicket remain on the northern shores of Lake Mweru Wantipa and in the eastern portion of the Zambian Itigi thicket.

The '''Janka hardness test''' (from the Austrian-born emigrant Gabriel Janka, 1864-1932) measures the resistance of a sample of wood to denting and wear. It measures the [[Indentation hardness|force required to embed]] an {{convert |11.28|mm|in|3}} diameter steel ball halfway into a sample of wood. A common use of Janka hardness ratings is to determine whether a species is suitable for use as [[Wood flooring |flooring]].

The hardness of wood varies with the direction of the [[wood grain]]. Testing on the surface of a plank, perpendicular to the grain, is said to be of "side hardness".  Testing the cut surface of a stump is called a test of "end hardness".{{fact|date=March 2016}}  Side hardness may be further divided into "radial hardness" and "tangential hardness", although the differences are minor and often neglected.

The results are stated in various ways, which can lead to confusion, especially when the actual units employed are often not attached. Overall, the resulting measure is always one of [[force]]. In the United States, the measurement is in [[pound-force |pounds-force]] (lbf).  In Sweden it is in [[kilogram-force |kilograms-force]] (kgf), and in Australia, either in [[newton (unit) |newton]]s (N) or kilonewtons (kN). This confusion is greatest when the results are treated as units, for example "660&amp;nbsp;Janka".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Pedersen |first = Jason |title=The Janka Hardness Test |url= http://www.lowcostflooring.com/janka-hardness-test/ | work = Low Cost Flooring|accessdate= 18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Janka hardness test results tabulated below were done in accordance with [[ASTM]] D&amp;nbsp;1037-12 testing methods. Lumber stocks tested range from 1" to 2" thick. The tabulated Janka hardness numbers are an average. There is a standard deviation associated with each species, but these values are not given.{{fact |date= March 2016}} No testing was done on actual flooring. Other factors affect how flooring performs: the type of core for engineered flooring such as pine, HDF, poplar, oak, birch; grain direction and thickness; floor or top wear surface, etc. The chart is not to be considered an absolute; it is meant to help people understand which woods are harder than others.

[[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] The Hon. '''John Byron''' (8 November 1723 – 10 April 1786) was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer and politician. He was known as '''Foul-weather Jack''' because of his frequent encounters with bad weather at sea. As a midshipman, he sailed in the squadron under [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] on his voyage around the world, though Byron made it only to southern Chile, where his ship was wrecked. He returned to England with the captain of HMS ''Wager''. He was governor of [[Newfoundland]] following [[Hugh Palliser]], who left in 1768. He circumnavigated the world as a commodore with his own squadron in 1764-1766. He fought in battles in [[The Seven Years' War]] and the [[American Revolution]]. He rose to Vice Admiral of the White before his death in 1786.

His grandsons include the poet [[George Gordon Byron]] and [[George Byron, 7th Baron Byron|George Anson Byron]], admiral and explorer, who were the 6th and 7th Baron Byron, respectively.

==Early career==
Byron was the son of [[William Byron, 4th Baron Byron]] and Frances Berkeley, the daughter of [[William Berkeley, 4th Baron Berkeley of Stratton|William, 4th Baron Berkeley]]. He joined the Royal Navy in 1731.&lt;ref name=dcb&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/byron_john_4E.html |title=Byron, John |first=W. A. B. |last=Douglas |volume=4 |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740, he accompanied [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]] on his [[George Anson's voyage around the world|voyage around the world]] as a [[midshipman]] aboard one of the several ships in the squadron. On 14 May 1741, [[HMS Wager (1739)|HMS ''Wager'']] under Captain Cheap (as Captain Dandy Kidd had died), was shipwrecked on the coast of [[Chile]] on what is now called Wager Island and Byron was one of the survivors.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt; The survivors decided to split in two teams, one to make its way by boat to [[Rio de Janeiro]] on the Atlantic coast; the other, including John Byron and the Captain, to sail north along the Spanish colonial coast.

Captain Cheap at Wager Island had a party of 19 men after the deserters rejoined the camp. This included the surgeon Elliot and Lieutenant Hamilton who had been cast adrift with him plus midshipmen John Byron and Campbell who had been in the barge. They rowed up the coast but were punished by continuous rain, headwinds and waves that threatened the boats. One night while the men slept on shore, one of the boats was capsized while at anchor and was swept out to sea with its two boatkeepers. One of the men got ashore but the other drowned. As it was now impossible for them all to fit in the remaining boat, four marines were left ashore with muskets to fend for themselves. The winds prevented them from getting around the headland so they returned to pick up the marines only to find them gone. They returned to Wager Island in early February 1742. With one death on the journey, there were now 13 in the group.

A local Indian guided the men up the coast to [[Chiloe Island]] so they set out again. Two men died and after burying the bodies, the six seaman rowed off in the boat never to be seen again while Cheap, Hamilton, Byron, Campbell and the dying Elliot were on shore looking for food. The Indian then agreed to take the remaining four on by canoe for their only remaining possession, a musket. Eventually they made it to be taken prisoner by the Spanish. The Spaniards treated them well and they were eventually taken to the inland capital of Santiago where they were released on parole. The Spaniards heard that Anson had been generous in the treatment of the prisoners he had taken and this kindness was returned.

Byron and the other three men stayed in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] till late 1744 and were offered passage on a French ship bound for Spain. Three accepted the passage. Campbell elected to take a mule across the Andes and joined the Spanish [[José Alfonso Pizarro|Admiral Pizarro]] in [[Montevideo]] on the ''Asia'' only to find Isaac Morris and the two seamen who had been abandoned in [[Mar del Plata|Freshwater Bay]] on the Atlantic coast. After time in prison in Spain, Campbell reached Britain in May 1746, followed by the other three two months later.

In England, the official court martial examined only the loss of the ''Wager'' in which Baynes, in nominal charge at the time, was acquitted of blame but reprimanded for omissions of duty. Disputes over what happened after the wreck were instead played out as Bulkeley and Cummins, Campbell, Morris, the cooper Young and later Byron published their own accounts, the last of which was the only one that in any way defended Cheap who had since died. Twenty nine crew members plus seven marines made it back to England.

Byron's account of his adventures and the [[Wager Mutiny]] are recounted in ''The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron'' (1768). His book sold well enough to be printed in several editions.

Byron was appointed captain of {{HMS|Siren|1745|6}} in December 1746.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

==Seven Years War==
{{Main|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}
In 1760 during the Seven Years' War, Byron commanded a squadron sent to destroy the fortifications at [[Louisbourg]], Quebec, which had been [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured by the British]] two years before. They wanted to ensure it could not be used by the French in Canada. In July of that year he defeated the French flotilla sent to relieve [[New France]] at the [[Battle of Restigouche]].

==Commodore, governor and vice admiral==
In early 1764 the British Admiralty determined that it would require a permanent naval settlement off the South American coast, in order to resupply naval vessels seeking to enter the Pacific via [[Cape Horn]]. Captain Byron was selected to explore the South Atlantic for a suitable island upon which to establish such a settlement. The South American mainland was controlled by Spain, which was hostile to local expansion of British interests; to disguise Byron's mission it was announced that he had been appointed the new commander of the Navy's [[East Indies Station]]. Byron set sail in June 1764, ostensibly to take up the East Indies post. For the voyage he was granted command of the 24-gun frigate {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|6}} and the 16-gun [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Tamar|1758|6}}.&lt;ref name=Rea&gt;{{cite journal | last =Rea | first =Robert R. | title =Florida and the Royal Navy's Floridas | journal =The Florida Historical Quarterly | volume =60 | issue =2 | pages=187–191 | publisher =[[Florida Historical Society]] | date =October 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pepys island.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The mythical Pepys Island, which Byron searched for in 1764-65. Illustration by William Hacke, 1699.]]
Byron's two-vessel flotilla crossed the Atlantic over the winter of 1764 and made its way slowly down the South American coast. The Admiralty had ordered Byron to first seek [[Pepys Island]], reputedly discovered off the Patagonian coast by the corsair [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1683. Byron reached the co-ordinates given by Cowley in January 1765, but there was no sign of the island and the search was swiftly abandoned.{{efn|Historian Robert Rea describes Pepys Island as "completely mythical;" Cowley's description of it was either fictional or a mistaken landfall among the Falklands.&lt;ref name=Rea/&gt;}} On 5 February Byron reached the Patagonian settlement of [[Port Desire]] where he resupplied his vessels from the storeship {{HMS|Florida|1764|6}}.&lt;ref name=Rea/&gt;

Between June 1764 and May 1766, Byron completed his own circumnavigation of the globe as captain of [[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']]. This was the first such circumnavigation that was accomplished in less than 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/circumnavigation.htm |title=Circumnavigation: Notable global maritime circumnavigations |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His actions [[Falklands Crisis (1770)|nearly caused a war]] between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Spain]], as both countries had armed fleets ready to contest the sovereignty of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Later Byron encountered islands and extant residents of the [[Tuamotus]] and [[Tokelau]] Islands, and [[Nikunau]] in the southern [[Gilbert Islands]]; he also visited [[Tinian]] in the [[Northern Marianas Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Officer on Board the Said Ship.

Newbery.&lt;/ref&gt; A notable member of Byron's crew was Master's Mate [[Erasmus Gower]] whom Byron chose to 'take a significant part' in the ceremony when he took possession of the [[Falkland Islands]]. Byron had examined Gower for his lieutenant's examination in 1762 and was so impressed that he chose him to accompany him on his own circumnavigation (1764-65) and ensured that he was appointed as lieutenant to Commander [[Philip Carteret]] immediately afterwards in the next circumnavigation (1766-69). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=Ian M|title=Champion of the Quarterdeck: Admiral Sir Erasmus Gower (1742-1814)|publisher=Sage Old Books|isbn=9780958702126|pages=28,35-73|edition=First|url=https://www.sageoldbooks.com/champion_sale.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1769 he was appointed governor of [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] off the mainland of Canada, an office he held for the next three years.&lt;ref name=dcb/&gt;

He was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 31 March 1775. In 1779, he served as Commander-in-chief of the [[Leeward Islands Station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haydn|first1=Joseph|title=The Book of Dignities: Containing Lists of the Official Personages of the British Empire ... from the Earliest Periods to the Present Time ...

==Death==

John Byron died on 10 April 1786 at home in London. His remains were buried in the Berkeley family vault situated beneath the chancel of the [[St Mary's Church, Twickenham|Church of St Mary the Virgin]], [[Twickenham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=86 |title=At Twickenham Park, Lord John Berkeley |publisher=The Twickenham Museum |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

John Byron's experiences in the Anson voyage form the basis of the novel ''[[The Unknown Shore]]'' by [[Patrick O'Brian]]. It closely follows Byron's account in ''The Narrative of the Honourable John Byron'' (1768).

{{featured article}}
[[File:Thekelpie large.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Kelpie'' by [[Herbert James Draper]], 1913]]
'''Kelpie''', or '''water kelpie''', is the [[Scots language|Scots]] name given to a shape-shifting water spirit inhabiting the [[loch]]s and pools of Scotland. It has usually been described as appearing as a [[water horse|horse]], but is able to adopt human form. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human, leading to its association with the Christian idea of [[Satan]] as alluded to by [[Robert Burns]] in his 1786 poem "[[Address to the Devil]]".

Almost every sizeable body of water in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of [[Loch Ness]]. Parallels to the general [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[neck (water spirit)|neck or nixie]] and the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] [[bäckahäst]] have been observed. More widely, the [[wihwin]] of Central America and the Australian [[bunyip]] have been seen as counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in [[human sacrifice]]s once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.

Kelpies have been portrayed in their various forms in art and literature, including recently as two {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} high steel sculptures in [[Falkirk]], ''[[The Kelpies]]'', completed in October 2013.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the [[Scots language|Scots]] word ''kelpie'' is uncertain, but it may be derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''calpa'' or ''cailpeach'', meaning "heifer" or "colt". The first recorded use of the term to describe a mythological creature, then spelled ''kaelpie'', appears in the manuscript of an [[ode]] by [[William Collins (poet)|William Collins]], composed some time before 1759{{r|OEDKelpie}} and reproduced in the [[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] of 1788.{{sfnp|Carlyle|1788|p=72|ps=none}} The [[toponymy|place names]] Kelpie hoall and Kelpie hooll are reported in ''[[Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue|A Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue]]'' as appearing in the 1674 burgh records for [[Kirkcudbright]].{{r|DOST}}

==Folk beliefs==

===Description and common attributes===
[[Douglas Harper]], historian and founder of the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], defines ''kelpie'' as "the Lowland name of a demon in the shape of a horse".{{r|Harper}} It is the most common water spirit in Scottish folklore, but the name is attributed to several different forms in narratives recorded throughout the country.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=none}} The late 19th century saw the onset of an interest in transcribing folklore, but the recorders were inconsistent in spelling and frequently [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] words, which could result in differing names for the same spirit.{{sfnp|Monaghan|2009|pp=ix, xi, xv|ps=none}}

Commentators have disagreed over the kelpie's aquatic habitat. Folklorists who define kelpies as spirits living beside rivers, as distinguished from the Celtic lakeside-dwelling water horse (''[[each-uisge]]''), include 19th-century minister of [[Tiree]] [[John Gregorson Campbell]] and 20th-century writers [[Lewis Spence]] and [[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]].{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|p=215|ps=none}}{{r|Scotsman1933}}&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Katharine, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies'', quoted in {{harvnb|Bown|2001|pp=177–178|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is not universally applied however; Sir [[Walter Scott]] for instance claims that the kelpie's range may extend to lochs.{{r|scott-ladyofthelake}}{{sfnp|Graham|1812|p=245|ps=none}} Mackillop's dictionary reconciles the discrepancy, stating that the kelpie was "initially thought to inhabit&amp;nbsp;... streams, and later any body of water."{{r|MacKillop}} But the distinction should stand, argues one annotator, who suggests that people are led astray when an ''each uisge'' in a "common practice of translating" are referred to as kelpies in English accounts,{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|2008|p=320|ps=none}} and thus mistakenly attribute lake-dwelling habits to the latter.

Others associate the term ''kelpie'' with a wide variety of mythical creatures.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=none}} Counterparts in some regions of Scotland include the shoopiltee and [[nuggle]]{{sfnp|Blind|1881|p=189|ps=none}} of [[Shetland]] and the [[tangie]] of [[Orkney]]; in other parts of the United Kingdom they include the Welsh [[Ceffyl Dŵr|ceffyl dŵr]] and the [[Isle of Man|Manx]] [[Glashtyn#Cabyll-ushtey|cabbyl-ushtey]]. Parallels to the general [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[neck (water spirit)|neck]] and the [[Scandinavian folklore|Scandinavian]] [[bäckahäst]] have been observed; [[Nick Middleton]] observes that "the kelpie of Scottish folklore is a direct parallel of the [sic] bäckahästen [of Scandinavian folklore]".{{sfnp|Middleton|2012|p=44|ps=none}} The [[wihwin]] of Central America{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=none}} and the Australian [[bunyip]]{{sfnp|McPherson|1929|p=61|ps=none}} are seen as similar creatures in other parts of the world.

The [[mythology|mythological]] kelpie is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters,{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Gregor|1881|p=38|ps=none}} One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the ''[[Neck (water spirit)|nykur]]'' of Iceland.{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Blind|1881|p=200|ps=none}} An [[Aberdeenshire]] variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents,{{sfnp|McPherson|1929|p=63|ps=none}} whereas the resident equine spirit of the [[River Spey]] was white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.{{sfnp|McPherson|1929|p=61|ps=none}}

The creature's nature was described by [[Walter Gregor]], a folklorist and one of the first members of [[the Folklore Society]],{{sfnp|Buchan|Olson|1997|ps=none}} as "useful", "hurtful", or seeking "human companionship";{{sfnp|Gregor|1883|p=292|ps=none}} in some cases, kelpies take their victims into the water, devour them, and throw the entrails to the water's edge.{{sfnp|Anonymous|1887|p=513|ps=none}} In its equine form the kelpie is able to extend the length of its back to carry many riders together into the depths;{{sfnp|Campbell|1860|p=lxxxvi|ps=none}} a common theme in the tales is of several children clambering onto the creature's back while one remains on the shore. Usually a little boy, he then pets the horse but his hand sticks to its neck. In some variations the lad cuts off his fingers or hand to free himself; he survives but the other children are carried off and drowned, with only some of their entrails being found later. Such a creature said to inhabit Glen Keltney in [[Perthshire]] is considered to be a kelpie by 20th-century folklorist [[Katharine Mary Briggs]],{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=none}} but a similar tale also set in Perthshire has an ''each uisge'' as the culprit and omits the embellishment of the young boy.{{r|MacKillop Uisge}} The lad does cut his finger off when the event takes place in [[Thurso]], where a water kelpie is identified as the culprit.{{sfnp|Anonymous|1887|p=512|ps=none}} The same tale set at [[Sunart]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] gives a specific figure of nine children lost, of whom only the innards of one are recovered. The surviving boy is again saved by cutting off his finger, and the additional information is given that he had a Bible in his pocket. Gregorson Campbell considers the creature responsible to have been a water horse rather than a kelpie, and the tale "obviously a pious fraud to keep children from wandering on Sundays".{{sfnp|Gregorson Campbell|1900|pp=208–209|ps=none}}

Kelpie myths usually describe a solitary creature, but a fairy story recorded by [[John Francis Campbell|John F. Campbell]] in ''[[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]]'' (1860) has a different perspective. Entitled ''Of the Drocht na Vougha or Fuoah'', which is given the translation of ''the bridge of the fairies or kelpies'', it features a group of [[fuath|voughas]]. The spirits had set about constructing a bridge over the [[Dornoch Firth]] after becoming tired of travelling across the water in cockleshells. It was a magnificent piece of work resplendent with gold piers and posts, but sank into the water to become a treacherous area of quicksand after a grateful onlooker tried to bless the kelpies for their work.{{sfnp|Campbell|1860a|p=64|ps=none}} The same story is recorded by Folklore Society member and folklore collector [[Charlotte Louisa Hawkins Dempster|Charlotte Dempster]] simply as ''The Kelpie's Bridge'' (1888) with no mention of Voughas or Fuoah.{{sfnp|Dempster|1888|p=172|ps=none}} Quoting the same narrative [[Jennifer Westwood]], author and folklorist,{{sfnp|Bowman|2008|pp=346–348|ps=none}} uses the descriptor ''water kelpies'', adding that in her opinion "Kelpies, here and in a few other instances, is used in a loose sense to mean something like 'imps{{'"}}.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=356|ps=none}}

Progeny resulting from a mating between a kelpie and a normal horse were impossible to drown, and could be recognised by their shorter than normal ears, a characteristic shared by the mythical [[water bull]] or ''tarbh uisge'' in Scottish Gaelic, similar to the Manx ''tarroo ushtey''.{{r|MacKillop Tarbh}}{{sfnp|Lamont-Brown|1996|p=19|ps=none}}

===Shapeshifting===
[[File:The Kelpie by Thomas Millie Dow.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A melancholy kelpie sketched sitting on a rock|''The Kelpie'' by [[Thomas Millie Dow]], 1895]]
Kelpies have the ability to [[shapeshifting|transform]] themselves into non-equine forms, and can take on the outward appearance of human figures,{{sfnp|McPherson|1929|p=62|ps=none}} in which guise they may betray themselves by the presence of water weeds in their hair.{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=none}} In their human form, kelpies are almost invariably male. One of the few stories describing the creature in female form is set at Conon House in [[Ross and Cromarty]]. It tells of a "tall woman dressed in green", with a "withered, meagre countenance, ever distorted by a malignant scowl", who overpowered and drowned a man and a boy after she jumped out of a stream.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=423|ps=none}} Gregor described a kelpie adopting the guise of a wizened old man continually muttering to himself while sitting on a bridge stitching a pair of trousers. Believing it to be a kelpie, a passing local struck it on the head, causing it to revert to its equine form and scamper back to its lair in a nearby pond.{{sfnp|Gregor|1883|pp=293–294|ps=none}} Other accounts describe the kelpie when appearing in human form as a "rough, shaggy man who leaps behind a solitary rider, gripping and crushing him", or as tearing apart and devouring humans.{{r|MacKillop}}

A folk tale from [[Barra]] tells of a lonely kelpie that transforms itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put to work for a year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. The wise man then asks the kelpie, once again transformed into the handsome young man the girl had first met, whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.{{sfnp|McNeil|2001|pp=68–72|ps=none}}

The arrival of [[History of Christianity in Scotland|Christianity]] in Scotland in the 6th century resulted in some folk stories and beliefs being recorded by scribes, usually Christian monks, instead of being perpetuated by [[oral tradition|word of mouth]].{{sfnp|Monaghan|2009|pp=ix, xi, xv|ps=none}} Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves even in human form, leading to its association with the Christian notion of [[Satan]], just as with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Pan (god)|Pan]].{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=24|ps=none}} [[Robert Burns]] refers to such a Satanic association in his "[[Address to the Devil]]" (1786):
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;When thowes dissolve the snawy hoord
An' float the jinglin icy boord
Then, water-kelpies haunt the foord
By your direction
An' nighted trav'llers are allur'd
To their destruction.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Capture and killing===
When a kelpie appeared in its equine persona without any [[Horse tack|tack]], it could be captured using a halter stamped with the sign of a [[Christian cross|cross]], and its strength could then be harnessed in tasks such as the transportation of heavy mill stones.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=91|ps=none}} One folk tale describes how the Laird of Morphie captured a kelpie and used it to carry stones to build his castle. Once the work was complete, the laird released the kelpie, which was evidently unhappy about its treatment. The curse it issued before leaving&amp;nbsp;– "Sair back and sair banes/ Drivin' the Laird o' Morphies's stanes,/ The Laird o' Morphie'll never thrive/ As lang's the kelpy is alive"&amp;nbsp;– was popularly believed to have resulted in the extinction of the laird's family.{{sfnp|Chambers|1870|pp=334–335}} Some kelpies were said to be equipped with a bridle and sometimes a saddle, and appeared invitingly ready to ride, but if mounted they would run off and drown their riders. If the kelpie was already wearing a bridle, [[exorcism]] might be achieved by removing it.{{sfnp|Mackinlay|1893|p=174|ps=none}} A bridle taken from a kelpie was endowed with magical properties, and if brandished towards someone, was able to transform that person into a horse or pony.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=19|ps=none}}

Just as with cinematic [[werewolf|werewolves]],{{sfnp|Varner|2007|p=23|ps=none}} a kelpie can be killed by being shot with a silver bullet, after which it is seen to consist of nothing more than "turf and a soft mass like jelly-fish" according to an account published by Spence.{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=95|ps=none}} When a blacksmith's family were being frightened by the repeated appearances of a water kelpie at their summer cottage, the blacksmith managed to render it into a "heap of starch, or something like it" by penetrating the spirit's flanks with two sharp iron spears that had been heated in a fire.{{sfnp|Gregor|1881|p=66|ps=none}}

==Loch Ness==
{{main|Loch Ness Monster}}
Almost every sizeable Scottish body of water has a kelpie story associated with it,{{sfnp|Graham|1812|p=245|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Spence|1999|p=91|ps=none}} but the most widely reported is the kelpie of [[Loch Ness]]. Several stories of mythical spirits and monsters are attached to the loch dating back to 6th-century reports of Saint [[Columba]] defeating a monster there.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=458|ps=none}} The early 19th-century kelpie that haunted the woods and shores of Loch Ness was tacked up with its own saddle and bridle. A fable attached to the notoriously nasty creature has the Highlander James MacGrigor taking it by surprise and cutting off its bridle, the source of its power and life,  without which it would die within twenty-four hours. As the kelpie had the power of speech, it attempted unsuccessfully to bargain with MacGrigor for the return of its bridle. After following MacGrigor to his home, the kelpie asserted that MacGrigor would be unable to enter his house while in possession of the bridle, because of the presence of a cross above the entrance door. But MacGrigor outwitted the creature by tossing the bridle through a window, so the kelpie accepted its fate and left, cursing and swearing.{{sfnp|Mackinlay|1893|p=174|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Stewart|1823|pp=102–107|ps=none}} The myth is perpetuated with further tales of the bridle as it is passed down through the family. Referred to as "Willox's Ball and Bridle", it had magical powers of healing; a spell was made by placing the items in water while chanting "In the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Ghost"; the water could then be used as a cure.{{sfnp|Black|1893|p=501|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Stewart|1823|p=102|ps=none}}

A popular and more recent explanation for the Loch Ness monster among believers is that it belongs to a line of long-surviving [[plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]],{{sfnp|Harmsworth|2010|p=310|ps=none}} but the kelpie myth still survives in children's books such as [[Mollie Hunter]]'s ''The Kelpie's Pearls'' (1966) and [[Dick King-Smith]]'s ''The Water Horse'' (1990).

==Origins==
Folklorist Gary R. Varner has suggested that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in [[horse sacrifice]]s performed in ancient [[Scandinavia]].{{sfnp|Varner|2007|pp=24–25|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Gath Whitley|1911|p=147|ps=none}} Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers.{{sfnp|Westwood|Kingshill|2012|p=364|ps=none}} The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays.{{sfnp|Anonymous|1887|p=513|ps=none}} The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.{{sfnp|Campbell|2002|p=1|ps=none}}

Historian and [[symbol]]ogist Charles Milton Smith has hypothesised that the kelpie myth might originate with the [[water spout]]s that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, giving the impression of a living form as they move across the water.{{sfnp|Milton Smith|2009|p=44}} Sir Walter Scott alludes to a similar explanation in his epic poem ''[[The Lady of the Lake (poem)|The Lady of the Lake]]'' (1810), which contains the lines
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;He watched the wheeling eddies boil,
Till from their foam his dazzled eyes
Beheld the River Demon rise:&lt;/poem&gt;}} in which Scott uses "River Demon" to denote a "kelpy".&lt;ref name="scott-ladyofthelake"/&gt; Scott may also have hinted at an alternative rational explanation by naming a treacherous area of [[quicksand]] "Kelpie's Flow" in his novel ''[[The Bride of Lammermoor]]'' (1818).{{r|Scott}}

==Artistic representations==

[[Pictish stone]]s dating from the 6th to 9th centuries featuring what has been dubbed the [[Pictish Beast]] may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature.{{r|Cessford}} Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in [[Herbert James Draper|Draper]]'s 1913 oil on canvas.{{r|Liverpool}} [[Thomas Millie Dow]] had also sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden balanced on a rock,{{sfnp|Martin|1902|p=12|ps=none}} a common depiction for artists of the period.{{r|Liverpool}} Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.{{sfnp|Bown|2001|p=218|ps=none}}

Two {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} high steel sculptures in [[Falkirk]] on the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]], named ''[[The Kelpies]]'', borrow the name of the mythical creature to associate with the strength and endurance of the horse; designed by sculptor [[Andy Scott (sculptor)|Andy Scott]], they were built as monuments to Scotland's horse-powered industrial heritage. Construction was completed in October 2013 and the sculptures were opened for public access from April 2014.{{r|BBC}}

The main purpose for this list is the possibility to compare stars of different categories, like to compare the most luminous known star [[R136a1]] with the brightest star of our sky [[Sirius]], which is not possible with the existing lists in [[Lists of stars]]. 

For multiple values from different sources the average value is displayed. From binary star systems the brighter (A) star is considered except for magnitude and luminosity, where it is combined. More Properties (e.g. Temperature, Age) will be added. Data is yet to be added, verified and corrected.

[[File:Alpenrelief 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Relief of the Alps]]
This page contains a table listing by [[elevation]] all 537 [[mountains]] of the [[Alps]] that exceed 3000 m and have a [[topographic prominence]] of at least 300 m. The list is continued down to 2500 m elevation on [[List of mountains of the Alps (2500-2999 m)|this page]] and down to 2000 m elevation on [[List of mountains of the Alps (2000–2499 m)|this page]]. All of these mountains are located in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]] or [[Slovenia]]. The list includes all 44 [[List of Alpine peaks by prominence|ultra-prominent peaks of the Alps]], with 19 ultras over 3000m on this page.

==Criteria==
The [[Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme]] defines a summit in the Alps as independent, if the connecting ridge between it and a higher summit drops at least 30 m (a [[topographic prominence|prominence/drop]] of 30 m, with the lowest point referred to as the "key col"). There are over 3300 such summits exceeding 2500 m in Switzerland alone.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Thöni, [http://www.gipfelverzeichnis.ch Directory of the mountains of Switzerland]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a peak to qualify as an independent mountain, traditionally a prominence of at least 300 m, or 10 times the aforementioned criterion value, has been used.&lt;!-- an old reference for that would be nice--&gt; Inclusion based on prominence is expedient for its objectivity and verifiability, but has its drawbacks. For example, an impressive mountain peak dominating a valley may be connected via long high ridges to a barely higher hidden summit. Among the better-known peaks absent from this list are [[Aiguille du Dru]] (due to [[Aiguille Verte]]), [[Dent du Géant]] ([[Grandes Jorasses]]), [[Mont Blanc de Cheilon]] ([[Ruinette]]), [[Nadelhorn]] and [[Täschhorn]] ([[Dom (mountain)|Dom]]), [[Piz d'Err]] ([[Piz Calderas]]), [[Piz Badile]] ([[Piz Cengalo]]), [[Piz Palü]] ([[Piz Zupo]]), [[Similaun]] ([[Hintere Schwarze]]), [[Crozzon di Brenta]] ([[Cima Tosa]]), and [[Cimon della Pala]] ([[Cima Vezzana]]).

==Accuracy==
All mountain heights and prominences on the list are from the largest-[[scale (map)|scale]] maps available.&lt;ref name=maps&gt;All mountain heights and prominences are from the following maps:&lt;br/&gt;For France the 1:25,000 [http://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/accueil cartes topographiques] of the [[Institut Géographique National ]]&lt;br/&gt;For Switzerland the 1:25,000 [http://map.geo.admin.ch/ Swisstopo] maps.&lt;br/&gt;For Austria [[Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen|BEV]]'s [http://www.austrianmap.at Österreichische Karte 1:50.000] supplemented with the 1:25,000 [[Alpine Club map]]s where available.&lt;br/&gt;For Italy the 1:25,000 [[Istituto Geografico Militare]] maps via the [http://www.pcn.minambiente.it Geoportale Nazionale] website.&lt;br/&gt;Key cols were verified using the [[SRTM]] data based contour lines in the terrain view of [[Google maps]].&lt;/ref&gt;
However, heights often conflict on different topographic maps, even when created by the same cartographic institution. For example, the [[Fletschhorn]] is indicated to be 3993, 3982, and 3984.5 m high on the 1:100,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 [[National Maps of Switzerland|Swisstopo map]], respectively. The (rounded) elevation of the latter map is used in this table.
Also, the deepest points in connecting ridges are not always survey points with spot elevations, where heights have to be estimated from contour lines. For example, maps often provide heights for the place where a route passes over a ridge rather than for the lowest point of that pass.

Finally, many height indications on these maps are from quite old measurements, while glacier and [[firn]] melt has decreased the height of both peaks and key cols, sometimes quite dramatically. For example, in 1930, glacier-capped [[Cima Tosa]] was the highest mountain of the [[Brenta Dolomites]] at 3,173 m, but now is around 3,140 m high and some 10 m lower than its rocky neighbor [[Cima Brenta]] (3,151 m). Most maps and guides still report Cima Tosa's old height.&lt;ref name=brenta&gt;Petter E. Bjørstad, [http://www.ii.uib.no/~petter/mountains/3000mtn/tosa.html Cima Tosa is lower than Cima Brenta]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the 1930s, when the current Italian 1:25.000 topographic map of the region was created, the ''Passo del Vannino'', northwest of the [[Ofenhorn]], was covered by the ''Lebendun'' glacier and was measured to be 2,754 m, while the much more recent Swisstopo map shows it to be bare and 2,717 m high. This is the key col for [[Corno di Ban]] (3,028 m), which, thanks to the retreat of the glacier, now appears on the list with a prominence of 311 m.

Given the inaccuracies, the list includes (unranked) summits with estimated prominences down to 7 meter below the cut-off (293 m), many of which may very well have a real prominence exceeding 300 m.

==Distribution==
The lists contain 1599 mountains higher than 2000 m.&lt;ref  group="Note"&gt;The number 1599 includes the 54 unranked summits with 293-299 m prominence, but excludes the 6 summits between 1996-1999 m high&lt;/ref&gt; The summits are distributed over 7 countries as follows:

175 of the summits are on international borders. A number of mountains (e.g. [[Rocciamelone]] (IT), [[Aiguille de Tré la Tête]] (IT), [[Monte Rosa]] (CH), [[Piz Bernina]] (CH), and [[Hochgall]] (IT)) straddle borders as well, but have their summit on one side. In the list, only the exact location of the culminating point of the mountain is considered.

The 1092 mountains over 2500 m are found in 44 different administrative regions ([[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]], [[Departments of France|departments]], [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]], [[Bundesländer|states]]). The administrative regions with the most mountains over 2500 m are [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] (161), [[Graubünden]] (148), [[Valais]] (103), [[South Tyrol]] (91), [[Province of Sondrio|Sondrio]] (73), [[Aosta Valley]] (69), [[Savoie|Savoy]] (67), [[Hautes-Alpes]] (66), [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] (57), [[Province of Belluno|Belluno]] (56) and [[Province of Trentino|Trentino]] (50).

This is a list of '''[[river]]s in [[South Africa]]'''.

It is quite common to find the [[Afrikaans]] word '''''-rivier''''' as part of the name. Another common suffix is "''-kamma''", from the [[Khoisan]] term for "river"&lt;ref&gt;
Meiring, Barbara. [http://196.35.231.101/Documents/InformationBooklet/TOPONYMIC%20GUIDELINES%20SOUTH%20AFRICAN%20GEOGRAPHICAL%20NAMES.pdf "South African Toponymic Guidelines for Map and other editors: Fourth Edition"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 12. Retrieved on 30 April 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt;
(often tautologically the English term "river" is added to the name). The [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word '''''amanzi''''' (water) also forms part of some river names.

The Afrikaans term '''''spruit''''' (compare [[wiktionary:spring|spring]]) often labels small rivers.

A '''luminous red nova''' (abbr. ''LRN'', pl. ''luminous red novae'', pl.abbr. ''LRNe'') is a stellar explosion thought to be caused by the merging of two [[star]]s.  They are characterised by a distinct red colour, and a [[light curve]] that lingers with resurgent brightness in the [[infrared]]. Luminous red novae are not to be confused with standard [[nova]]e, explosions that occur on the surface of [[white dwarf]] stars.

==Discovery==

A small number of objects exhibiting the characteristics of luminous red novae have been observed over the last 30 years or so. The red star [[M31 RV]] in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] flared brightly during 1988 and may have been a luminous red nova. In 1994, [[V4332 Sgr]], a star in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, flared similarly, and in 2002, [[V838 Mon]] followed suit and was studied quite closely.

The first confirmed luminous red nova was the object [[M85 OT2006-1]], in the galaxy [[Messier 85]]. It was first observed during the [[Lick Observatory]] [[Supernova]] Search, and subsequently investigated by a team of [[astronomer]]s from both [[U.C. Berkeley]] and [[Caltech]]. They confirmed its difference from known explosions such as novae and [[thermal pulse]]s, and announced luminous red novae as a new class of stellar explosion.&lt;ref name="Kulkarni2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kulkarni|first1=S.

==Characteristics==

The [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] of the explosion occurring in  luminous red novae is between that of a supernova (which is brighter) and a nova (dimmer). The visible light lasts for weeks or months, and is distinctively red in colour, becoming dimmer and redder over time. As the visible light dims, the infrared light grows and also lasts for an extended period of time, usually dimming and brightening a number of times.

Infrared observations of M85 OT2006-1 have shown that temperature of this star  is slightly less than 1000 [[Kelvin|K]], a rather low temperature. It is not clear if this characteristic is shared by other luminous red novae.

==Evolution==

The team investigating M85 OT2006-1 believe it to have formed when two [[main sequence]] stars merged. (See the article on [[V838 Mon]] for further information on ''mergebursts'' and alternative possibilities.)

At the time the mergeburst occurs, the LRN appears to expand extremely rapidly, reaching thousands to tens of thousands of solar [[radius|radii]] in only a few months. This would cause the object to cool, explaining the intriguing co-existence of a bright flash with a cool post-flash object.

==Other viewpoints==

Some astronomers believe it to be premature to declare a new class of stellar explosions based on such a limited number of observations.
For instance, they may be due to a type II-p supernova;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature06282|arxiv = 0710.3753 |bibcode = 2007Natur.449E...1P |title = A very faint core-collapse supernova in M85 |journal = Nature |volume = 449 |issue = 7164 |pages = 1 |author1 = Pastorello |first1 = A. |last2 = Della Valle |first2 = M. |last3 = Smartt |first3 = S.

'''Mare Cognitum''' ("'''The Sea that has Become Known'''") is a [[lunar mare]] located in a basin or large [[Impact crater|crater]] which sits in the second ring of [[Oceanus Procellarum]]. To the northwest of the mare is the [[Montes Riphaeus]] mountain range, part of the rim of the buried crater or basin containing the mare. Previously unnamed, the mare received its name in 1964 in reference to its selection as the target for the successful [[impact probe]] [[Ranger 7]], the first American spacecraft to return closeup images of the [[Moon's surface]].&lt;ref name=gazetteer&gt;{{GPN|3670|Mare Cognitum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
The [[Ranger 7]] lunar probe impacted Mare Cognitum at the conclusion of its picture-taking mission. [[Surveyor 3]] and [[Apollo 12]] landed near its northern shore. The outcrop of the [[Fra Mauro formation]], where [[Apollo 14]] landed, is also located near Mare Cognitum.

===Statio Cognitum===
[[File:Apollo 12- Pinpoint Landing on the Ocean of Storms (6962456793).jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Statio Cognitum; craters, the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] descent stage, and Surveyor 3, among other landmarks, are labeled (''click to enlarge''). The astronauts' footprints are still visible.]]
The landing site of Apollo 12 within Mare Cognitum, near the Surveyor 3 landing site, is known as "'''Statio Cognitum'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinpoint Landing on the Ocean of Storms|url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/posts/401|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site was selected in an effort to demonstrate the capability for precision lunar landings to explore specific sites in future Apollo missions, so mission planners used Surveyor 3 as a landing target. This specific site was selected because of its relative smoothness (given its location on the mare surface) and proximity to the lunar equator (ensuring relative ease of access from the standpoint of fuel consumption).&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 12 Landing Site Overview|url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_12/landing_site/|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Geologically, the astronauts noted the amount of glass contained in the [[regolith]] and present at the bottoms of shallow craters at the site, as well as lighter-colored regolith material that geologists later determined to be [[ejecta]] from [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus crater]].&lt;ref name=psr/&gt; The Copernicus ejecta sampled suggested that the Copernicus impact occurred about 800 million years ago, but geologists believe the results of this analysis are inconclusive.&lt;ref name=lpi2/&gt; The Apollo 12 astronauts also noted the existence of small, shallow elongated depressions ("trenches" or "grooves") similar to those the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts observed at [[Tranquility Base]] in the [[Sea of Tranquility]]; Shoemaker et al. preliminarily concluded in 1970 that these features reflected the direction and location of fractures in the underlying bedrock, into which fine-grained material settled, thereby creating the grooves.&lt;ref name=psr&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shoemaker|first1=E. M., et al.|title=Preliminary Geologic Investigation of the Apollo 12 Landing Site|journal=Apollo 12 Preliminary Science Report|date=1970|pages=113–156|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/as12psr.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Overall, Statio Cognitum and the surrounding area appears to have a slightly more red coloration from lunar orbit than Tranquility Base (which geologists later found to be the result of less [[titanium]] in the Apollo 12 rocks) and to have less craters overall than Tranquility Base; because of this, geologists suspected the site chosen for Apollo 12 contained younger rocks than those of the Apollo 11 site, and this was confirmed by the samples returned by Apollo 12. These samples consisted of more [[basalt]]s and fewer [[breccia]]s than the Apollo 11 samples and the basalts are about 500 million years younger than those from Tranquility base, the latter of which geologists estimate to be about 3.6 to 3.8 billion years old. The differing ages of the basalts collected on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 demonstrate that the volcanic activity that formed the [[lunar mare]] did not occur all at once across the lunar surface, but rather took place at different times at different locations.&lt;ref name=lpi2&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 12 Lunar Sample Overview|url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_12/samples/|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obvious water pollution.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|While marine pollution can be obvious, as with the [[marine debris]] shown above, it is often the pollutants that cannot be seen that cause most harm.]]

'''Marine pollution''' occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals, [[particle (ecology)|particles]], [[industrial waste|industrial]], agricultural, and [[municipal solid waste|residential]] [[waste]], noise, or the spread of [[invasive organism]]s. Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What is the biggest source of pollution in the ocean?|url= http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/pollution.html|website= oceanservice.noaa.gov|accessdate= 2015-11-22|language= EN-US|author= US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pollution often comes from [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]]s such as agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]], wind-blown debris, and dust. [[Nutrient pollution]], a form of [[water pollution]], refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of [[eutrophication]] of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually [[nitrate]]s or [[phosphate]]s, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by [[plankton]] and [[benthos|benthic animals]], most of which are either [[deposit feeder]]s or [[filter feeder]]s. In this way, the toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of [[oxygen]], causing [[estuary|estuaries]] to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]].

When pesticides are incorporated into the [[marine ecosystem]], they quickly become absorbed into marine [[food web]]s. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. [[Toxic metal]]s can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.

In order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been developed internationally. There are different ways for the ocean to get polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put into place throughout history.

==History==
[[File:MARPOL 73-78 signatories.png|thumb|350px|right|Parties to the [[MARPOL 73/78]] convention on marine pollution]]

Although marine pollution has a long history, significant international laws to counter it were only enacted in the twentieth century. Marine pollution was a concern during several [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea]] beginning in the 1950s. Most scientists believed that the oceans were so vast that they had unlimited ability to dilute, and thus render pollution harmless.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there were several controversies about dumping radioactive waste off the coasts of the United States by companies licensed by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], into the Irish Sea from the British reprocessing facility at [[Windscale]], and into the Mediterranean Sea by the French [[Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique]]. After the Mediterranean Sea controversy, for example, [[Jacques Cousteau]] became a worldwide figure in the campaign to stop marine pollution. Marine pollution made further international headlines after the 1967 crash of the oil tanker [[Torrey Canyon]], and after the 1969 [[Santa Barbara oil spill]] off the coast of California.

Marine pollution was a major area of discussion during the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], held in Stockholm. That year also saw the signing of the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], sometimes called the London Convention. The London Convention did not ban marine pollution, but it established black and gray lists for substances to be banned (black) or regulated by national authorities (gray). Cyanide and high-level radioactive waste, for example, were put on the black list. The London Convention applied only to waste dumped from ships, and thus did nothing to regulate waste discharged as liquids from pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hamblin, Jacob Darwin |year=2008 |title=Poison in the Well: Radioactive Waste in the Oceans at the Dawn of the Nuclear Age |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-4220-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathways of pollution==
{{See also|Water pollution}}
[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|Septic river.]]

There are many ways to categorize and examine the inputs of pollution into our marine ecosystems. Patin (n.d.) notes that generally there are three main types of inputs of pollution into the ocean: direct discharge of waste into the oceans, runoff into the waters due to rain, and pollutants released from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.offshore-environment.com/anthropogenicimpact.html |title=Anthropogenic impact in the sea and marine pollution |last=Patin, S.A. |website=offshore-environment.com |access-date=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common path of entry by [[contaminant]]s to the sea are rivers. The evaporation of water from oceans exceeds precipitation. The balance is restored by rain over the continents entering rivers and then being returned to the sea. The [[Hudson River|Hudson]] in [[New York State]] and the [[Raritan River|Raritan]] in [[New Jersey]], which empty at the northern and southern ends of [[Staten Island]], are a source of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] contamination of [[zooplankton]] ([[copepod]]s) in the open ocean. The highest concentration in the filter-feeding [[copepod]]s is not at the mouths of these rivers but {{convert|70|mi|km}} south, nearer [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], because water flows close to the coast. It takes a few days before toxins are taken up by the [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=Gerlach/&gt;

Pollution is often classed as [[point source]] or [[nonpoint source pollution]]. Point source pollution occurs when there is a single, identifiable, localized source of the pollution. An example is directly discharging sewage and industrial waste into the ocean. Pollution such as this occurs particularly in developing nations. Nonpoint source pollution occurs when the pollution comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. These can be difficult to regulate. Agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]] and wind blown [[debris]] are prime examples.

===Direct discharge===
[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|Acid mine drainage in the Rio Tinto River.]]
{{See also|Sewerage|Industrial waste|Environmental impact of mining}}

Pollutants enter rivers and the sea directly from urban [[sewerage]] and [[industrial waste]] discharges, sometimes in the form of [[hazardous waste|hazardous]] and [[toxic waste]]s.

Inland [[mining]] for copper, gold, etc., is another source of marine pollution. Most of the pollution is simply soil, which ends up in rivers flowing to the sea. However, some minerals discharged in the course of the mining can cause problems, such as [[copper]], a common industrial pollutant, which can interfere with the [[biological life cycle|life history]] and development of coral polyps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Young, Emma |year=2003|title=Copper decimates coral reef spawning|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4391|accessdate=26 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining has a poor environmental track record. For example, according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40% of watersheds in the western continental US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this pollution finishes up in the sea.

===Land runoff===
{{Main|Surface runoff}}
{{See also|Urban runoff|Stormwater|Nutrient pollution}}
[[Surface runoff]] from farming, as well as [[urban runoff]] and runoff from the construction of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbours, can carry soil and [[particle (ecology)|particles]] laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals. This nutrient-rich water can cause fleshy algae and [[phytoplankton]] to thrive in coastal areas; known as [[algal bloom]]s, which have the potential to create [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions by using all available oxygen. In the coast of southwest Florida, harmful [[algal bloom]]s have existed for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt5hj4c2.10|title=Salt Marshes|date=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813545486|editor-last=Weis|editor-first=Judith S.|series=A Natural and Unnatural History|pages=117–149|editor-last2=Butler|editor-first2=Carol A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These algal blooms have been a cause of species of fish, turtles, dolphins, and shrimp to die and cause harmful effects on humans who swim in the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Polluted runoff from roads and highways can be a significant source of water pollution in coastal areas. About 75% of the toxic chemicals that flow into [[Puget Sound]] are carried by [[stormwater]] that runs off paved roads and driveways, rooftops, yards and other developed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Washington State Department of Ecology |title=Control of Toxic Chemicals in Puget Sound, Phase 2: Development of Simple Numerical Models |date=2008|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/Programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302010119/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/pstoxics/index.html|archive-date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, there are many rainstorms that runoff into the ocean. These rainstorms occur from October to March, and these runoff waters contain petroleum, heavy metals, pollutants from emissions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Benjamin|last2=Trinh|first2=Rebecca|last3=Gierach|first3=Michelle M.|date=2017-05-15|title=Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X17301558|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=118|issue=1|pages=141–154|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, there is a large coastal population that pollutes the ocean through land runoff. This includes sewage discharge and pollution from [[urbanization]] and land use. In 2001, more than 66,795&amp;nbsp;mi² of the Chinese coastal ocean waters were rated less than Class I of the Sea Water Quality Standard of China.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daoji|first=Li|last2=Daler|first2=Dag|date=2004|title=Ocean Pollution from Land-Based Sources: East China Sea, China|jstor=4315461|journal=Ambio|volume=33|issue=1/2|pages=107–113|doi=10.2307/4315461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this pollution came from Ag, Cu, Cd, Pb, As, DDT, PCBs, etc., which occurred from contamination through land runoff.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Ship pollution===
{{Main|Environmental impact of shipping}}
{{See also|Ballast water discharge and the environment}}

Ships can pollute waterways and oceans in many ways. [[Oil spill]]s can have devastating effects. While being toxic to marine life, [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), found in [[crude oil]], are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the [[sediment]] and marine environment.&lt;ref name="Panetta"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Panetta, L.E.

Oil spills are probably the most emotive of marine pollution events. However, while a tanker wreck may result in extensive newspaper headlines, much of the oil in the world's seas comes from other smaller sources, such as tankers discharging ballast water from oil tanks used on return ships, leaking pipelines or engine oil disposed of down sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Farmer, Andrew |year=1997 |title=Managing Environmental Pollution |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0415145155 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

Discharge of cargo residues from [[bulk carrier]]s can pollute ports, waterways, and oceans. In many instances vessels intentionally discharge illegal wastes despite foreign and domestic regulation prohibiting such actions. An absence of national standards provides an incentive for some [[cruise liner]]s to dump waste in places where the penalties are inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Schulkin, A (2002) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/gintenlr15&amp;div=12&amp;id=&amp;page= "Safe Harbours: Creating an International Solution to Cruise Ship Pollution"], ''Georgetown International Environmental Law Review'', '''15''' (1): 105–132.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that [[container ship]]s lose over 10,000 [[containerization|containers]] at sea each year (usually during storms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/06/0619_seacargo.html |title=Lost Sea Cargo: Beach Bounty or Junk? |accessdate=8 April 2008 |date=19 June 2001 |author=Podsadam, Janice |publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships also create [[noise pollution]] that disturbs natural wildlife, and water from [[sailing ballast|ballast]] tanks can spread harmful [[algae]] and other [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="Meinesz"&gt;Meinesz, A.

[[Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port is a major source of unwanted exotic marine life. The [[invasive species|invasive]] freshwater zebra mussels, native to the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, were probably transported to the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsg.washington.edu/mas/pdfs/leastwanted.pdf Aquatic invasive species.

University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless [[jellyfish]]. ''[[Mnemiopsis leidyi]]'', a species of comb jellyfish that spread so it now inhabits estuaries in many parts of the world. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the [[Black Sea]] in a ship's ballast water. The population of the jellyfish grew exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local [[fishing industry]]. "The [[anchovy]] catch fell from 204,000 tons in 1984 to 200 tons in 1993; [[sprat]] from 24,600 tons in 1984 to 12,000 tons in 1993; horse [[mackerel]] from 4,000 tons in 1984 to zero in 1993."&lt;ref name="Meinesz"/&gt; Now that the jellyfish have exhausted the [[zooplankton]], including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the [[ecosystem]].

[[Invasive species]] can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new [[genetics|genetic]] material, alter underwater seascapes, and jeopardize the ability of [[native species]] to obtain food. Invasive species are responsible for about $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually in lost revenue and management costs in the US alone.&lt;ref name=pimental&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 |title= Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal= Ecological Economics |volume= 52 |issue= 3 |pages= 273–288 |year= 2005 |last1= Pimentel |first1= D. |last2= Zuniga |first2= R. |last3= Morrison |first3= D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pathway of pollution occurs through the atmosphere. Wind-blown dust and debris, including [[plastic bag]]s, are blown seaward from [[landfill]]s and other areas. Dust from the [[Sahara]] moving around the southern periphery of the [[subtropical ridge]] moves into the [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]] during the warm season as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust can also be attributed to a global transport from the [[Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan]] deserts across [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the Northern [[Pacific]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.209.4464.1522 |pmid= 17745962 |title= Long-Range Atmospheric Transport of Soil Dust from Asia to the Tropical North Pacific: Temporal Variability |journal= Science |volume= 209 |issue= 4464 |pages= 1522–4 |year= 1980 |last1= Duce |first1= R.

===Deep sea mining===
{{Main|Deep sea mining}}
[[Deep sea mining]] is a relatively new mineral retrieval process that takes place on the [[seabed|ocean floor]]. Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of [[manganese nodule|polymetallic nodules]] or active and extinct [[hydrothermal vent]]s at about 1,400 – 3,700 meters below the ocean's surface.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1023/A:1009963912171|title=Environmental risk assessment of anthropogenic activity in the deep-sea |year= 2000 |last1= Ahnert |first1= A. |journal= Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Stress and Recovery |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages= 299–315 |last2= Borowski |first2= C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vents create [[seafloor massive sulfide deposits|sulfide deposits]], which contain [[precious metal]]s such as [[silver]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[manganese]], [[cobalt]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.1138289 |pmid= 17510349 |title= ECOLOGY: Danger of Deep-Sea Mining |journal= Science |volume= 316 |issue= 5827 |pages= 987 |year= 2007 |last1= Halfar |first1= J. |last2= Fujita |first2= R.

P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposits are mined using either hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed. As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about environmental damages to the surrounding areas

Because deep sea mining is a relatively new field, the complete consequences of full-scale mining operations are unknown. However, experts are certain that removal of parts of the sea floor will result in disturbances to the [[benthic zone|benthic layer]], increased [[toxicity]] of the [[water column]], and sediment plumes from tailings.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"/&gt; Removing parts of the sea floor disturbs the habitat of [[benthos|benthic organisms]], possibly, depending on the type of mining and location, causing permanent disturbances.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Aside from direct impact of mining the area, leakage, spills, and [[corrosion]] would alter the mining area's chemical makeup.

Among the impacts of deep sea mining, sediment plumes could have the greatest impact. Plumes are caused when the tailings from mining (usually fine particles) are dumped back into the ocean, creating a cloud of particles floating in the water. Two types of plumes occur: near-bottom plumes and surface plumes.&lt;ref name="web.ebscohost.com"/&gt; Near-bottom plumes occur when the tailings are pumped back down to the mining site. The floating particles increase the [[turbidity]], or cloudiness, of the water, clogging [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]] apparatuses used by benthic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/10641190500446698 |title= Deep-Sea Impact Experiments and their Future Requirements |journal= Marine Georesources &amp; Geotechnology |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 331–338 |year= 2005 |last1= Sharma |first1= R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface plumes cause a more serious problem.

A report from [[NOAA]] scientists published in the journal Science in May 2008 found that large amounts of relatively acidified water are upwelling to within four miles of the Pacific [[continental shelf]] area of North America.

[[File:Scheme eutrophication-en.svg|thumb|The effect of eutrophication on marine [[benthos|benthic life]].]]

[[Eutrophication]] is an increase in chemical [[nutrient]]s, typically compounds containing [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]], in an [[ecosystem]]. It can result in an increase in the ecosystem's [[primary productivity]] (excessive plant growth and decay), and further effects including lack of oxygen and severe reductions in water quality, fish, and other animal populations.

The biggest culprit are rivers that empty into the ocean, and with it the many chemicals used as [[fertilizer]]s in agriculture as well as waste from [[livestock]] and [[human]]s. An excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref name=Gerlach&gt;Gerlach, S. A. (1975) ''Marine Pollution'', Springer, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Estuary|Estuaries]] tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where [[surface runoff|runoff]] enters the marine environment in a confined channel. The [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that kill fish and marine mammals and cause respiratory problems in humans and some domestic animals when the blooms reach close to shore.

In addition to [[land runoff]], atmospheric [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[nitrogen fixation|fixed nitrogen]] can enter the open ocean. A study in 2008 found that this could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply and up to three per cent of the annual new marine biological production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.1150369 |pmid= 18487184 |title= Impacts of Atmospheric Anthropogenic Nitrogen on the Open Ocean |journal= Science |volume= 320 |issue= 5878 |pages= 893–7 |year= 2008 |last1= Duce |first1= R.

Plastic debris tends to accumulate at the centre of [[ocean gyre]]s. The [[North Pacific Gyre]], for example, has collected the so-called "[[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]", which is now estimated to be one to twenty times the size of Texas (approximately from 700,000 to 15,000,000 square kilometers). It has a very high level of plastic particulate suspended in the upper water column. In samples taken in 1999, the mass of plastic exceeded that of zooplankton (the dominant animal life in the area) by a factor of six.&lt;ref name=Weisman/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlgalitaVid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVwuPSLx2Xc |title=Plastics and Marine Debris |accessdate=1 July 2008 |year=2006 |publisher=Algalita Marine Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Midway Atoll]], in common with all the [[Hawaiian Islands]], receives substantial amounts of debris from the garbage patch. Ninety percent plastic, this debris accumulates on the beaches of Midway where it becomes a hazard to the bird population of the island.

Toxic additives used in the manufacture of plastic materials can [[wikt:leach|leach]] out into their surroundings when exposed to water. Waterborne [[hydrophobic]] pollutants [[adsorbtion|collect and magnify on the surface]] of plastic debris,&lt;ref name=Algalita/&gt; thus making plastic far more deadly in the ocean than it would be on land.&lt;ref name=Weisman/&gt; Hydrophobic contaminants are also known to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in fatty tissues, [[biomagnification|biomagnifying]] up the food chain and putting pressure on [[apex predator]]s.

Saido, a chemist with the College of Pharmacy, conducted a study in Nihon University, [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba, Japan]], that discovered, when plastics eventually decompose, they produce potentially toxic bisphenol A (BPA) and PS oligomer into the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bernstein, M.|title=Plastics in oceans decompose, release hazardous chemicals, surprising new study says |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2009/august/plastics-in-oceans-decompose-release-hazardous-chemicals-surprising-new-study-says.html |website=www.acs.org |publisher=American Chemical Society |date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These toxins are believed to bring harm to the marine life living in the area.

A growing concern regarding plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem is the use of [[microplastics]]. Microplastics are little beads of plastic less than 5 millimeters wide, and they are commonly found in hand soaps, face cleansers, and other exfoliators. When these products are used, the microplastics go through the water filtration system and into the ocean, but because of their small size they are likely to escape capture by the preliminary treatment screens on wastewater plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.04.025 |pmid=19481226 |title=Contributing to marine pollution by washing your face: Microplastics in facial cleansers |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1225–8 |year=2009 |last1=Fendall |first1=Lisa S. |last2=Sewell |first2=Mary A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beads are harmful to the organisms in the ocean, especially filter feeders, because they can easily ingest the plastic and become sick. The microplastics are such a concern because it is difficult to clean them up due to their size, so humans can try to avoid using these harmful plastics by purchasing products that use natural, environmentally safe exfoliates.

===Toxins===
{{See also|Mercury in fish}}
Apart from plastics, there are particular problems with other [[toxin]]s that do not disintegrate rapidly in the marine environment. Examples of [[persistent organic pollutant|persistent toxin]]s are [[PCBs]], [[DDT]], [[tributyltin|TBT]], [[pesticide]]s, [[furan]]s, [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[phenols]], and [[radioactive waste]]. [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metals]] are metallic chemical elements that have a relatively high density and are toxic or poisonous at low concentrations. Examples are [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[nickel]], [[arsenic]], and [[cadmium]]. Such toxins can accumulate in the tissues of many species of aquatic life in a process called [[bioaccumulation]]. They are also known to accumulate in [[benthic zone|benthic environments]], such as [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[bay mud]]s: a geological record of human activities of the last century.

;Specific examples:
*Chinese and Russian industrial pollution such as [[phenols]] and heavy metals in the [[Amur River]] have devastated fish stocks and damaged its [[estuary]] soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npolar.no/ansipra/english/Indexpages/Ethnic_groups.html#19 "Indigenous Peoples of the Russian North, Siberia and Far East: Nivkh" ] by Arctic Network for the Support of the Indigenous Peoples of the Russian Arctic&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Wabamun Lake]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], once the best [[freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] lake in the area, now has unacceptable levels of heavy metals in its sediment and fish.

*Due to their high position in the [[food chain]] and the subsequent [[bioaccumulation|accumulation]] of [[heavy metals]] from their diet, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] levels can be high in larger species such as bluefin and [[albacore]].

===Underwater noise===
{{See also|Noise pollution|Acoustic ecology|The Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life|Marine mammals and sonar}}
Marine life can be susceptible to noise or the sound pollution from sources such as passing ships, oil exploration seismic surveys, and naval low-frequency active [[sonar]]. Sound travels more rapidly and over larger distances in the sea than in the atmosphere. Marine animals, such as [[cetacean]]s, often have weak eyesight, and live in a world largely defined by acoustic information. This applies also to many deeper sea fish, who live in a world of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://see-the-sea.org/topics/pollution/noise/noise_pollution.htm Noise pollution] Sea.org. Retrieved 24 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1975, ambient noise at one location in the Pacific Ocean increased by about ten [[decibel]]s (that is a tenfold increase in intensity).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, (1993) On Ocean Underwater Ambient Noise.

According to the oceanographer [[Sylvia Earle]], "Undersea noise pollution is like the death of a thousand cuts. Each sound in itself may not be a matter of critical concern, but taken all together, the noise from shipping, seismic surveys, and military activity is creating a totally different environment than existed even 50 years ago. That high level of noise is bound to have a hard, sweeping impact on life in the sea."&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] Press Release (1999) Sounding the Depths: Supertankers, Sonar, and the Rise of Undersea Noise, Executive Summary. New York, N.Y.: www.nrdc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise from ships and human activity can damage Cnidarians and Ctenophora, which are very important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their simple structures. When there is underwater noise, the vibrations in the water damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and the results showed that damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence of Cnidarians sensitivity to sound after exposure to low frequency underwater sources.

==Adaptation and mitigation==
[[File:Aerosolcan pullution.jpg|thumb|An aerosol can pollute a beach.]]

Much [[anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] [[pollution]] ends up in the ocean. The 2011 edition of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Year Book identifies as the main emerging environmental issues the loss to the oceans of massive amounts of [[phosphorus]], "a valuable fertilizer needed to feed a growing global population", and the impact billions of pieces of plastic waste are having globally on the health of marine environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=659&amp;ArticleID=6897&amp;l=en Fertilizer and plastic pollution are the main emerging issues in 2011 UNEP Year Book], 17 February 2011. ''News Centre'', United Nations Environment Programme, The Hague&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bjorn Jennssen (2003) notes in his article, "Anthropogenic pollution may reduce biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems, resulting in reduction and depletion of human marine food resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jenssen |first1= BM |year= 2003 |title= Marine pollution: the future challenge is to link human and wildlife studies |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241462/pdf/ehp0111-a00198.pdf |format= PDF |journal= Environ Health Perspect |volume= 111 |issue= 4 |pages= A198–A199 |pmc=1241462 |pmid=12676633 |doi=10.1289/ehp.111-a198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways the overall level of this pollution can be mitigated: either the human population is reduced, or a way is found to reduce the [[ecological footprint]] left behind by the average human. If the second way is not adopted, then the first way may be imposed as the world [[ecosystem]]s falter.

The second way is for humans, individually, to pollute less. That requires social and political will, together with a shift in awareness so more people respect the environment and are less disposed to abuse it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/S0964-5691(99)00059-9 |title= Approaches to addressing the problems of pollution of the marine environment: An overview |journal= Ocean &amp; Coastal Management |volume= 42 |issue= 12 |pages= 999–1018 |year= 1999 |last1= Kullenberg |first1= G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an operational level, regulations, and international government participation is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/0302-184X(73)90010-3 |title= Pollution of the oceans: An international problem? |journal= Ocean Management |volume= 1 |pages= 161–170 |year= 1973 |last1= Matthews |first1= G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often very difficult to regulate marine pollution because pollution spreads over international barriers, thus making regulations hard to create as well as enforce.&lt;ref&gt;Warner R (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0s3nzXC7tMcC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Protecting the oceans beyond national jurisdiction: strengthening the international law framework'']. Vol. 3 of ''Legal aspects of sustainable development'', Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17262-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without appropriate awareness of marine pollution, the necessary global will to effectively address the issues may prove inadequate. Balanced information on the sources and harmful effects of marine pollution need to become part of general public awareness, and ongoing research is required to fully establish, and keep current, the scope of the issues. As expressed in Daoji and Dag's research,&lt;ref&gt;Daoji L and Daler D (2004) [http://www.unep.org/dewa/giwa/publications/articles/ambio/article_13.pdf "Ocean pollution from land-based sources: East China Sea, China"] ''Ambio'', '''33''': 1–2. Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; one of the reasons why environmental concern is lacking among the Chinese is because the public awareness is low and therefore should be targeted.

The amount of awareness on marine pollution is vital to the support of keeping the prevention of trash from entering waterways and ending up in our oceans.  The EPA reports that in 2014 Americans generated about 258 million tons of waste, and only a third was recycled or composted.  In 2015, there was over 8 million tons of plastic that made it into the ocean.  Through more sustainable packing this could lead to; eliminating toxic constituents, using fewer materials, making more readily available recyclable plastic.  However, awareness can only take these initiatives so far.  The most abundant plastic is PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) and is the most resistant to biodegradables.  Researchers have been making great strides in combating this problem.  In one way has been by adding a special polymer called a tetrablock copolymer.  The tetrablock copolymer acts as a laminate between the PE and iPP which enables for an easier breakdown but still be tough.  Through more awareness, individuals will become more cognizant of their carbon footprints.  Also, from research and technology, more strides can be made to aid in the plastic pollution problem.  &lt;ref&gt;Harry P. Austin, M. D. (2018, April 17).

[[Image:Japan trench topographic.png|right|thumb|235px|The [[Japan Trench]], where the [[Pacific Plate]] slides beneath the [[Okhotsk Plate]] is the cause of the Northeastern Japan Arc]]

The '''Northeastern Japan Arc''', also '''Northeastern Honshū Arc''', is an [[island arc]] on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. The arc runs north to south along the [[Tōhoku region]] of [[Honshū]], [[Japan]]. It is the result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] underneath the [[Okhotsk Plate]] at the [[Japan Trench]]. The southern end of the arc converges with the  [[Southwestern Japan Arc]] and the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc]] at the Fossa Magna ([[:ja:フォッサマグナ|ja]]) at the east end of the [[Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line]] (ITIL). This is the geologic border between eastern and western Honshū. [[Mount Fuji]] is at the point where these three arcs meet. To the north, the Northeastern Japan arc extends through the [[Oshima Peninsula]] of [[Hokkaidō]]. The arc converges in a collision zone with the [[Sakhalin Island Arc]] and the [[Kuril arc]] in the volcanic [[Ishikari Mountains]] of central Hokkaidō. This collision formed the [[Teshio Mountains|Teshio]] and [[Yubari Mountains]].

The [[Ōu Mountains]] form the volcanic part of the [[inner arc]]. The [[volcanic front]] consists of [[Quaternary]] volcanoes, which extend the length of the range. It also includes the Quaternary volcanoes of southwestern Hokkaidō. The [[Dewa Mountains]] and the [[Iide Mountains]] are non-volcanic uplift ranges that run parallel to the west of the Ōu Mountains.

The outer arc ranges are the [[Kitakami Mountains|Kitakami]] and the [[Abukuma Mountains]]. These mountains are made from pre-tertiary rock. The mountains rose in the [[Cenozoic]] and have since been worn smooth by erosion.

The '''Pantanal''' ({{IPA-pt|pɐ̃taˈnaw}}) is a [[natural region]] encompassing the world's largest tropical [[wetland]] area. It is located mostly within the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], but it extends into [[Mato Grosso]] and portions of [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]]. It sprawls over an area estimated at between {{convert|140000|and|195000|km2|sqmi}}. Various subregional ecosystems exist, each with distinct [[hydrological]], [[geological]] and [[ecological]] characteristics; up to 12 of them have been defined (RADAMBRASIL 1982).&lt;ref name=Ecohydrology&gt;{{cite book |author=McClain, Michael E. |year=2002 |title=The Ecohydrology of South American Rivers and Wetlands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ae1OJ-vyKSkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pantanal |publisher=International Association of Hydrological Sciences |isbn=1-901502-02-3 |access-date=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;Susan Mcgrath, photos by Joel Sartore, ''Brazil's Wild Wet'', National Geographic Magazine, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Keddy2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Keddy, Paul |author2=Fraser, Lauchlan |year=2005 |title=The World's Largest Wetlands: Ecology and Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLJpgAic6FIC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=pantanal#PPR5,M1 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |access-date=2008-08-31

Roughly 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing [[biodiversity|biologically diverse]] collection of [[aquatic plant]]s and helping to support a dense array of [[fauna|animal]] species.

The name "Pantanal" comes from the Portuguese word ''pântano'', meaning wetland, bog, swamp, quagmire or marsh. By comparison, the [[Brazilian highlands]] are locally referred to as the ''planalto'', plateau or, literally, high plain.

== Geology, geography and ecology ==
[[Image:Pantanal 55.76W 15.40S.jpg|thumb|left|The extent of the Pantanal in Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay]]

The Pantanal is a huge, gently-sloped basin that receives runoff from the upland areas (the [[Mato Grosso Plateau|Planalto highlands]]) and slowly releases the water through the [[Paraguay River]] and [[tributaries]]. The formation is a result of the large, concave pre-Andean depression of the earth's crust, related to the [[Andes mountains|Andean]] [[orogeny]] of the [[Tertiary]]. It constitutes an enormous internal [[river delta]], in which several rivers flowing from the surrounding plateau merge, depositing their [[sedimentation|sediments]] and erosion residues, which have been filling, throughout the years, the large depression area of the Pantanal. This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the larger Parana-Paraguay Plain area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Pantanal is bounded by the [[Chiquitano dry forests]] to the west and northwest, by the [[Arid Chaco]] dry forests to the southwest, and the [[Humid Chaco]] to the south. The [[Cerrado]] savannas lie to the north, east and southeast.
The Pantanal has an average yearly rainfall of {{convert|1000|-|1400|mm|in|abbr=on}}, but is fed by the upper Paraguay River. Its average temperature is {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on}}, but temperatures can fluctuate from {{convert|0|to|40|C|F}}.

=== Hydrodynamics ===
[[File:Pantanal, Mato Grosso, Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|Landscape]]

Floodplain ecosystems such as the Pantanal are defined by their seasonal [[inundation]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; They shift between phases of standing water and phases of dry soil, when the water table can be well below the root region.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; Soils range from high levels of [[sand]] in higher areas to higher amounts of [[clay]] and [[silt]] in [[riverine]] areas.

Elevation of the Pantanal ranges from {{convert|80|to|150|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; Annual rainfall over the flood basin is between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|abbr=on}}, with most rainfall occurring between November and March.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; In the [[Paraguay River]] portion of the Pantanal, water levels rise between two meters to five meters seasonally; water fluctuations in other parts of the Pantanal are less than this.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; Flood waters tend to flow slowly ({{convert|2|to|10|cm|abbr=on}} per second&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt;) due to the low gradients and high resistance offered by the dense vegetation.

When rising river waters first contact previously dry soil, the waters become oxygen-depleted, rendering the water environs [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]].&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; Many natural [[fish kill]]s can occur if there are no oxygenated water refuges available (the reason for this remains speculative: it may be due to the growth of [[toxin]]-producing bacteria in the deoxygenated water rather than as a direct result of lack of oxygen (McClain 2002)).

=== Flora ===
{{main article|List of plants of Pantanal vegetation of Brazil}}

The vegetation of the Pantanal, often referred to as the "Pantanal [[Complex system|complex]]", is a mixture of plant communities typical of a variety of surrounding [[biome]] regions: these include moist tropical Amazonian rainforest plants, semiarid woodland plants typical of northeast Brazil, Brazilian ''[[cerrado]]'' savanna plants and plants of the ''Chaco'' savannas of Bolivia and Paraguay.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; Forests usually occur at higher altitudes of the region, while grasslands cover the seasonally inundated areas. The key limiting factors for growth are inundation and, even more importantly, water-stress during the dry season.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; The Pantanal ecosystem is home to 3500 known plant species.{{citation needed|date=August 2008}}

{{commons category|Animals of the Pantanal}}

The Pantanal [[ecosystem]] is also thought to be home to 1000 bird species, 400 fish species, 300 mammalian species, 480 reptile species and over 9000 subspecies of invertebrates.

The [[apple snail]] is a [[keystone species]] in Pantanal's ecosystem. When the wetlands are flooded once a year, the grass and other plants will eventually die and start to decay. During this process, decomposing microbes deplete the shallow water of all oxygen, suffocating larger decomposers. Unlike other decomposing animals, the apple snail have both gills and lungs, making it possible for them to thrive in [[anoxic waters]] where they recycle the nutrients. To get oxygen, they extend a long snorkel to the water surface, pumping air into their lungs. This ability allows them to consume all the dead plant matter and turn it into nutritious fertilizer available for the plants in the area. The snails themselves are also food for a variety of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Feeding and growth of apple snail Pomacea lineata in the Pantanal wetland, Brazil--a stable isotope approach.|date=2002 |pmid=12725426 | doi=10.1080/10256010208033268|volume=38|journal=Isotopes Environ Health Stud|pages=227-43|author=Fellerhoff C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://naturebox.org.uk/2013/04/14/apple-snail-unlikely-hero-of-the-pantanal/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601211029/https://naturebox.org.uk/2013/04/14/apple-snail-unlikely-hero-of-the-pantanal/ |title=Apple Snail: Unlikely Hero of the Pantanal |archivedate=1 June 2016|work=Nature Box|accessdate=9 September 2016 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00vl33r |title=BBC Two - Secrets of our Living Planet, Waterworlds, Enter the apple snail|work=[[BBC]] |date=1 July 2012 |accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the rarest animals to inhabit the wetland of the Pantanal are the [[marsh deer]] (''Blastocerus dichotomus'') and the [[Giant otter|giant river otter]] (''Pteroneura brasiliensis''). Parts of the Pantanal are also home to the following endangered or threatened species: the [[hyacinth macaw]] (''Anodorhyncus hyacinthinus'') (a bird endangered due to smuggling), the [[crowned solitary eagle]], the [[maned wolf]] (''Chrysocyon brachyurus''), the [[bush dog]] (''Speothos venaticus''), the [[South American tapir]] (''Tapirus terrestris'') and the [[giant anteater]] (''Myrmecophaga tridactyla''). Common species in the Pantanal include the [[capybara]] (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris'') and the [[yacare caiman]] (''Caiman yacare''). According to 1996 data, there were 10 million caimans in the Pantanal, making it the highest concentration of crocodilians in the World.{{sfn|Frederick A. Swarts|2000|p=7}} The Pantanal is home to one of the largest and healthiest [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca'') populations on Earth.

Most [[fish]] are [[detritivore]]s, primarily ingesting fine particles from sediments and plant surfaces.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; This is characteristic of fish living in South American flood-plains in general. Fish migration between river channels and flood-plain regions occurs seasonally.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt; These fish have many [[adaptation]]s that allow them to survive in the oxygen-depleted flood-plain waters.&lt;ref name="Ecohydrology" /&gt;

In addition to the caiman, some of the reptiles that inhabit the Pantanal are the [[yellow anaconda]] (''Eunectes notaeus''), the [[gold tegu]] (''Tupinambis teguixin''), the [[red-footed tortoise]] (''Geochelone carbonaria'') and the [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana'').

{{Geodesy}}
'''Physical geodesy''' is the study of the physical properties of the [[gravity]] field of the Earth, the [[geopotential]], with a view to their application in [[geodesy]].

==Measurement procedure==
Traditional geodetic instruments such as [[theodolite]]s rely on the gravity field for orienting their vertical axis along the local [[plumb line]] or local [[vertical direction]] with the aid of a [[spirit level]]. After that, vertical [[angle]]s ([[zenith]] angles or, alternatively, [[elevation]] angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical.

[[Levelling]] instruments again are used to obtain [[geopotential]] differences between points on the Earth's surface. These can then be expressed as "height" differences by conversion to metric units.

== The geopotential ==
{{main|Geopotential}}
{{further|Geopotential model}}

The Earth's gravity field can be described by a [[potential]] as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{g} = \nabla W = \mathrm{grad}\ W = \frac{\partial W}{\partial X}\mathbf{i}
+\frac{\partial W}{\partial Y}\mathbf{j}+\frac{\partial W}{\partial Z}\mathbf{k}
&lt;/math&gt;

which expresses the gravity acceleration vector as the gradient of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, the potential of gravity. The vector triad &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{i},\mathbf{j},\mathbf{k}\}&lt;/math&gt; is the orthonormal set of base vectors in space, pointing along the &lt;math&gt;X,Y,Z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate axes.

Note that both gravity and its potential contain a contribution from the [[centrifugal force|centrifugal pseudo-force]] due to the Earth's rotation. We can write

:&lt;math&gt;
W = V + \Phi\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the potential of the ''gravitational'' field, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; that of the ''gravity'' field, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; that of the centrifugal force field.

The centrifugal force -- per unit of mass, i.e., acceleration -- is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{g}_c = \omega^2 \mathbf{p},
&lt;/math&gt;

where 

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{p} = X\mathbf{i}+Y\mathbf{j}+0\cdot\mathbf{k}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the vector pointing to the point considered straight from the Earth's rotational axis. 
It can be shown that this pseudo-force field, in a reference frame co-rotating with the Earth, has a potential associated with it that looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Phi = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 (X^2+Y^2).
&lt;/math&gt;

This can be verified by taking the gradient (&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;) operator of this expression. 

Here, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are [[geocentric coordinates]].

==Units of gravity and geopotential==

Gravity is commonly measured in units of m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ([[metre]]s per [[second]] squared). This also can be expressed (multiplying by the [[gravitational constant]] '''G''' in order to change units) as [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[kilogram]] of attracted mass. 

Potential is expressed as gravity times distance, m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Travelling one metre in the direction of a gravity vector of strength 1 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; will increase your potential by 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Again employing G as a multipier, the units can be changed to [[joule]]s per kilogram of attracted mass.

A more convenient unit is the GPU, or geopotential unit: it equals 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., the direction of the 9.8 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ambient gravity, will ''approximately'' change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in geopotential, in GPU, of a point with that of sea level can be used as a rough measure of height "above sea level" in metres.

== The normal potential ==

To a rough approximation, the Earth is a [[sphere]], or to a much better approximation, an [[ellipsoid]]. We can similarly approximate the gravity field of the Earth by a spherically symmetric field:

:&lt;math&gt;
W \approx \frac{GM}{R}
&lt;/math&gt;

of which the ''equipotential surfaces''—the surfaces of constant potential value—are concentric spheres.

It is more accurate to approximate the geopotential by a field that has ''the Earth reference ellipsoid'' as one of its equipotential surfaces, however. The most recent Earth reference ellipsoid is [[GRS80]], or Geodetic Reference System 1980, which the Global Positioning system uses as its reference. Its geometric parameters are: semi-major axis ''a''&amp;nbsp;= 6378137.0&amp;nbsp;m, and flattening ''f''&amp;nbsp;= 1/298.257222101.

A geopotential field &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is constructed, being the sum of a gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; and the known centrifugal potential &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, that ''has the GRS80 reference ellipsoid as one of its equipotential surfaces''. If we also require that the enclosed mass is equal to the known mass of the Earth (including atmosphere) ''GM'' = 3986005 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, we obtain for the ''potential at the reference ellipsoid:''

:&lt;math&gt;
U_0=62636860.850 \ \textrm m^2 \, \textrm s^{-2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, this value depends on the assumption that the potential goes asymptotically to zero at infinity (&lt;math&gt;R\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;), as is common in physics. For practical purposes it makes more sense to choose the zero point of [[normal gravity]] to be that of the [[reference ellipsoid]], and refer the potentials of other points to this.

== Disturbing potential and geoid ==

Once a clean, smooth geopotential field &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; has been constructed matching the known GRS80 reference ellipsoid with an equipotential surface (we call such a field a ''normal potential'') we can subtract it from the true (measured) potential &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of the real Earth. The result is defined as '''T''', the ''disturbing potential'':

:&lt;math&gt;
T = W-U
&lt;/math&gt;

The disturbing potential '''T''' is numerically a great deal smaller than '''U''' or '''W''', and captures the detailed, complex variations of the true gravity field of the actually existing Earth from point-to-point, as distinguished from the overall global trend captured by the smooth mathematical ellipsoid of the normal potential.

Due to the irregularity of the Earth's true gravity field, the equilibrium figure of sea water, or the [[geoid]], will also be of irregular form. In some places, like west of [[Ireland]], the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks out as much as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to [[Ceylon]], it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the [[undulation of the geoid]], symbol &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and is closely related to the disturbing potential.

According to the famous [[Heinrich Bruns|Bruns]] formula, we have

:&lt;math&gt;
N=T/\gamma\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the force of gravity computed from the normal field potential &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

In 1849, the mathematician [[George Gabriel Stokes]] published the following formula named after him:

:&lt;math&gt;
N=\frac{R}{4\pi \gamma_0}\iint_\sigma \Delta g \,S(\psi)\, d\sigma.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; stands for ''gravity anomalies'', differences between true and normal (reference) gravity, and ''S'' is the ''Stokes function'', a kernel function derived by Stokes in closed analytical form.

Note that determining &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; anywhere on Earth by this formula requires &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt; to be known ''everywhere on Earth'', including oceans, polar areas, and deserts. For terrestrial gravimetric measurements this is a near-impossibility, in spite of close international co-operation within the [[International Association of Geodesy]] (IAG), e.g., through the International Gravity Bureau (BGI, Bureau Gravimétrique International). 

Another approach is to ''combine'' multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on the figure of the Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as [[GOCE]] and [[Gravity_Recovery_and_Climate_Experiment|GRACE]]. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the geoid solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only.

The [[geoid]], or mathematical mean sea surface, is defined not only on the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an ''equipotential surface'' of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level.

As mean sea level is physically realized by tide gauge bench marks on the coasts of different countries and continents, a number of slightly incompatible "near-geoids" will result, with differences of several decimetres to over one metre between them, due to the [[dynamic sea surface topography]]. These are referred to as ''vertical'' or ''height [[datum (geodesy)|datum]]s''.

For every point on Earth, the local direction of gravity or [[vertical direction]], materialized with the [[plumb line]], is ''perpendicular'' to the geoid. On this is based a method, ''astrogeodetic [[leveling|levelling]]'', for deriving the local figure of the geoid by measuring ''[[vertical deflection|deflections of the vertical]]'' by astronomical means over an area.

== Gravity anomalies ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Divergence theorem]] --&gt;

{{main|Gravity anomaly}}

Above we already made use of ''gravity anomalies'' &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;. These are computed as the differences between true (observed) gravity &lt;math&gt;g=\|\vec{g}\|&lt;/math&gt;, and calculated (normal) gravity &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\|\vec{\gamma}\|=\|\nabla U\|&lt;/math&gt;. (This is an oversimplification; in practice the location in space at which γ is evaluated will differ slightly from that where ''g'' has been measured.) We thus get 

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g = g - \gamma.\,
&lt;/math&gt;

These anomalies are called [[free-air anomaly|free-air anomalies]], and are the ones to be used in the above Stokes equation.

In [[geophysics]], these anomalies are often further reduced by removing from them the ''attraction of the topography'', which for a flat, horizontal plate ([[Bouguer plate]]) of thickness ''H'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
a_B=2\pi G\rho H,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Bouguer reduction]] to be applied as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta g_B = \Delta g_{FA} - a_B,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

so-called [[Bouguer anomaly|Bouguer anomalies]]. Here, &lt;math&gt;\Delta g_{FA}&lt;/math&gt; is our earlier &lt;math&gt;\Delta g&lt;/math&gt;, the free-air anomaly.

In case the terrain is not a flat plate (the usual case!) we use for ''H'' the local terrain height value but apply a further correction called the [[terrain correction]] (''TC'').

A '''planetary nebula''', abbreviated as PN or plural PNe, is a type of [[emission nebula]] consisting of an expanding, glowing shell of [[Ionization|ionized]] gas ejected from [[red giant]] [[star]]s late in their lives.&lt;ref name="Frankowskietal2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Frankowski|Soker|2009|pp=654–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "planetary nebula" is arguably a [[Misnomer|misnomer]], since this phenomenon is not associated with observations of actual [[Planet|planets]], and perhaps was derived from the planet-like round shape of these [[Nebula|nebulae]] as observed by astronomers through early [[History of the telescope|telescopes]].  The term may have originated in the 1780s with the English astronomer [[William Herschel]] who described these nebulae as resembling planets; however, as early as January 1779, the French astronomer [[Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix]] described in his observations of the [[Ring Nebula]], "...a very dim but perfectly outlined; it is as large as Jupiter and resembles a fading planet"&lt;ref name=Darquier&gt;{{cite book

Whatever the true origin of the term, the label "planetary nebula" became ingrained in the terminology used by astronomers to categorize these types of nebulae, and is still used by astronomers today. &lt;ref name="seds2013"&gt;{{harvnb|SEDS|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hubbleSite1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Hubblesite.org|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most planetary nebulae form at the end of the star's life, and are a relatively short-lived phenomenon, lasting perhaps a few tens of thousands of years, compared to a typical stellar lifetime spanning several billion years.&lt;ref name="FrewParker2010"&gt;during the red giant phase, when the outer layers of the star are expelled by strong [[stellar wind]]s {{harvnb|Frew|Parker|2010|pp=129–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once most of the red giant's atmosphere is dissipated,  [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] from the hot luminous core, called a planetary nebula nucleus (PNN), ionizes the ejected material.&lt;ref name="Frankowskietal2009" /&gt; Absorbed [[ultraviolet]] light then energises the shell of nebulous gas around the central star, causing it to appear as a brightly coloured planetary nebula.

Planetary nebulae likely play a crucial role in the [[chemistry|chemical]] [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of the Milky Way]] by expelling elements to the [[interstellar medium]] from stars where those [[metallicity|elements]] were created. Planetary nebulae are observed in more distant [[galaxy|galaxies]], yielding useful information about their chemical abundances.

Starting from the 1990s, [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images revealed that many planetary nebulae have extremely complex and varied morphologies. About one-fifth are roughly spherical, but the majority are not spherically symmetric. The mechanisms that produce such a wide variety of shapes and features are not yet well understood, but [[binary star|binary central stars]], stellar winds and [[magnetic field]]s may play a role.

=== Discovery ===

The first planetary nebula discovered (though not yet termed as such) was the [[Dumbbell Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Vulpecula]]. It was observed by [[Charles Messier]] in 1764 and listed as M27 in his [[Messier object|catalogue]] of nebulous objects.&lt;ref name=Kwok1&gt;{{harvnb|Kwok|2000|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae resembled the giant planets like [[Uranus]]. [[William Herschel]], discoverer of Uranus, perhaps coined the term "planetary nebula".&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore2007&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|2007|pp=279–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in as early as January 1779, the French astronomer [[Antoine Darquier de Pellepoix]] described in his observations of the [[Ring Nebula]], "a very dull nebula, but perfectly outlined; as large as Jupiter and looks like a fading planet.""&lt;ref name=Darquier/&gt;&lt;ref name "Olsen2017"&gt;{{cite magazine

===Terminology===
The true nature of these objects was uncertain, and Herschel first thought the objects were stars surrounded by material that was condensing into planets rather than what is now known to be evidence of dead stars that have incinerated any orbiting planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Malin|first=David|title=A View of the Universe|date=1993|publisher=Sky Publishing Corporation|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0876541015|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{start date and age|1782|paren=y}}, [[William Herschel]] had discovered the object now known as [[NGC 7009]] (the "Saturn Nebula"), upon which he used the term "planetary nebula".&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin, M. (2014) "William Herschel and the Planetary Nebulae". Journal for the History of Astronomy 45(2), pp. 209–225. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1177/002182861404500205.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=January 2018}}

In 1785, Herschel wrote to [[Jerome Lalande]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"These are celestial bodies of which as yet we have no clear idea and which are perhaps of a type quite different from those that we are familiar with in the heavens. I have already found four that have a visible diameter of between 15 and 30 seconds. These bodies appear to have a disk that is rather like a planet, that is to say, of equal brightness all over, round or somewhat oval, and about as well defined in outline as the disk of the planets, of a light strong enough to be visible with an ordinary telescope of only one foot, yet they have only the appearance of a star of about ninth magnitude."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal|doi=10.1177/002182861404500205|title=William Herschel and the Planetary Nebulae|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=45|issue=2|pages=209|year=2014|last1=Hoskin|first1=Michael|bibcode=2014JHA....45..209H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Herschel assigned these to Class IV of his catalogue of "nebulae", eventually listing 78 "planetary nebulae", most of which are in fact galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;p. 16 in {{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-68125-2|title=The Herschel Objects and How to Observe Them|series=Astronomers' Observing Guides|year=2007|isbn=978-0-387-68124-5|bibcode=2007hoho.book.....M|author1=Mullaney|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectra ===

The nature of planetary nebulae remained unknown until the first [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observations were made in the mid-19th century. Using a [[Prism (optics)|prism]] to disperse their light, [[William Huggins]] was one of the earliest astronomers to study the [[optical spectrum|optical spectra]] of astronomical objects.&lt;ref name=Moore2007/&gt;

On August 29, 1864, Huggins was the first to analyze the spectrum of a planetary nebula when he observed [[Cat's Eye Nebula]].&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt; His observations of stars had shown that their spectra consisted of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of radiation with many [[absorption line|dark lines]] superimposed. He found that many nebulous objects such as the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] (as it was then known) had spectra that were quite similar. However, when Huggins looked at the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]], he found a very different spectrum. Rather than a strong continuum with absorption lines superimposed, the Cat's Eye Nebula and other similar objects showed a number of [[Emission spectrum|emission lines]].&lt;ref name=Moore2007/&gt; Brightest of these was at a wavelength of 500.7&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s, which did not correspond with a line of any known element.&lt;ref name=Huggins1864&gt;{{harvnb|Huggins|Miller|1864|pp=437–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, it was hypothesized that the line might be due to an unknown element, which was named [[nebulium]]. A similar idea had led to the discovery of [[helium]] through analysis of the [[Sun]]'s spectrum in 1868.&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt; While helium was isolated on Earth soon after its discovery in the spectrum of the Sun, "nebulium" was not. In the early 20th century, [[Henry Norris Russell]] proposed that, rather than being a new element, the line at 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm was due to a familiar element in unfamiliar conditions.&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt;

Physicists showed in the 1920s that in gas at extremely low densities, [[electron]]s can occupy [[excited state|excited]] [[Metastability|metastable]] [[energy level]]s in atoms and ions that would otherwise be de-excited by collisions that would occur at higher densities.&lt;ref name=Bowen1927&gt;{{harvnb|Bowen|1927|pp=295–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electron transitions from these levels in [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] ions ({{nowrap|O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, [[Doubly ionized oxygen|{{nowrap|O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] (a.k.a. O&amp;nbsp;{{Smallcaps|iii}}), and {{nowrap|N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}) give rise to the 500.7&amp;nbsp;nm emission line and others.&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt; These spectral lines, which can only be seen in very low density gases, are called ''[[forbidden line]]s''. Spectroscopic observations thus showed that nebulae were made of extremely rarefied gas.&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan&gt;{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Potw1550a.tif|thumb|Planetary nebula [[NGC 3699]] is distinguished by an irregular mottled appearance and a dark rift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Planetary Nebula Divided|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1550a/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Central stars ===

The central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot.&lt;ref name="Frankowskietal2009" /&gt; Only when a star has exhausted most of its nuclear fuel can it collapse to a small size. Planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of [[stellar evolution]]. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding. This led to the idea that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt;

=== Modern observations ===

Towards the end of the 20th century, technological improvements helped to further the study of planetary nebulae.&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005&gt;{{harvnb|Kwok|2005|pp=271–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Space telescope]]s allowed astronomers to study light wavelengths outside those that the Earth's atmosphere transmits. [[Infrared]] and ultraviolet studies of planetary nebulae allowed much more accurate determinations of nebular [[temperature]]s, [[density|densities]] and elemental abundances.&lt;ref name=Hora2004&gt;{{harvnb|Hora|Latter|Allen|Marengo|2004|pp=296–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwoketal2006&gt;{{harvnb|Kwok|Koning|Huang|Churchwell|2006|pp=445–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charge-coupled device]] technology allowed much fainter spectral lines to be measured accurately than had previously been possible. The Hubble Space Telescope also showed that while many nebulae appear to have simple and regular structures when observed from the ground, the very high [[optical resolution]] achievable by telescopes above the [[Earth's atmosphere]] reveals extremely complex structures.&lt;ref name=Reed1999&gt;{{harvnb|Reed|Balick|Hajian|Klayton|1999|pp=2430–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alleretal2003&gt;{{harvnb|Aller|Hyung|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Morgan-Keenan spectral classification]] scheme, planetary nebulae are classified as ''Type-'''P''''', although this notation is seldom used in practice.&lt;ref name=Krause&gt;{{harvnb|Krause|1961|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars greater than 8&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es (M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;) will likely end their lives in dramatic [[supernova]]e explosions, while planetary nebulae seemingly only occur at the end of the lives of intermediate and low mass stars between 0.8&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt; to 8.0&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Macieletal2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Maciel|Costa|Idiart|2009|pp=127–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progenitor stars that form planetary nebulae will spend most of their lifetimes converting their [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] in the star's core by [[nuclear fusion]] at about 15&amp;nbsp;million [[Kelvin|K]]. This generated energy creates outward pressure from fusion reactions in the core, balancing the crushing inward pressures of the star's gravity.&lt;ref name=Harpaz4&gt;{{harvnb|Harpaz|1994|pp=55–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This state of equilibrium is known as the [[main sequence]], which can last for tens of millions to billions of years, depending on the mass.

When the hydrogen source in the core starts to diminish, gravity starts compressing the core, causing a rise in temperature to about 100 million K.&lt;ref name=Harpaz6&gt;{{harvnb|Harpaz|1994|pp=99–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such higher core temperatures then make the star's cooler outer layers expand to create much larger red giant stars. This end phase causes a dramatic rise in stellar luminosity, where the released energy is distributed over a much larger surface area, even though the average surface temperature is lower. In [[stellar evolution]] terms, stars undergoing such increases in luminosity are known as [[Asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic giant branch stars]] (AGB).&lt;ref name=Harpaz6/&gt; During this phase, the star can lose 50 to 70% of its total mass from its [[stellar wind]].&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{cite journal

For the more massive asymptotic giant branch stars that form planetary nebulae, whose progenitors exceed about 3M&lt;sub&gt;⊙&lt;/sub&gt;, their cores will continue to contract. When temperatures reach about 100&amp;nbsp;million K, the available [[helium|helium nuclei]] fuse into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]], so that the star again resumes radiating energy, temporarily stopping the core's contraction. This new helium burning phase (fusion of helium nuclei) forms a growing inner core of inert carbon and oxygen. Above it is a thin helium-burning shell, surrounded in turn by a hydrogen-burning shell. However, this new phase lasts only 20,000 years or so, a short period compared to the entire lifetime of the star.

In either scenario, the venting of atmosphere continues unabated into interstellar space, but when the outer surface of the exposed core reaches temperatures exceeding about 30,000&amp;nbsp;K, there are enough emitted [[ultraviolet]] [[photon]]s to [[ionisation|ionize]] the ejected atmosphere, causing the gas to shine as a planetary nebula.&lt;ref name=Harpaz6/&gt;

==Lifetime==
[[File:Necklace Nebula.jpg|thumb| The [[Necklace Nebula]] consists of a bright ring, measuring about two light-years across, dotted with dense, bright knots of gas that resemble diamonds in a necklace. The knots glow brightly due to absorption of ultraviolet light from the central stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hubble Offers a Dazzling Necklace|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1133a/|work=Picture of the Week|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After a star passes through the [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB.&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss.&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse.&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt;&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity,&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; while at the same time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000&amp;nbsp;K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a [[white dwarf]], and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution.&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000&amp;nbsp;years&lt;ref name=KwokJun2005 /&gt; passes between its formation and recombination of the resulting [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref name=Kwok1/&gt;

[[File:IC3568.jpg|thumb|[[Lemon slice nebula]] (IC 3568).]]

A typical planetary nebula is roughly one [[light year]] across, and consists of extremely rarefied gas, with a density generally from 100 to 10,000 particles {{nowrap|per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Osterbrock1&gt;{{harvnb|Osterbrock|Ferland|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Earth's atmosphere, by comparison, contains 2.5{{e|19}} particles {{nowrap|per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.) Young planetary nebulae have the highest densities, sometimes as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles {{nowrap|per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. As nebulae age, their expansion causes their density to decrease. The masses of planetary nebulae range from 0.1 to 1&amp;nbsp;[[solar mass]]es.&lt;ref name=Osterbrock1/&gt;

Radiation from the central star heats the gases to temperatures of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan2&gt;{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gas temperature in central regions is usually much higher than at the periphery reaching 16,000–25,000&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan3&gt;{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997|pp=130–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume in the vicinity of the central star is often filled with a very hot (coronal) gas having the temperature of about 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;K. This gas originates from the surface of the central star in the form of the fast stellar wind.&lt;ref name=Osterbrock&gt;{{harvnb|Osterbrock|Ferland|2005|pp=261–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nebulae may be described as ''matter bounded'' or ''radiation bounded''. In the former case, there is not enough matter in the nebula to absorb all the UV photons emitted by the star, and the visible nebula is fully ionized. In the latter case, there are not enough UV photons being emitted by the central star to ionize all the surrounding gas, and an ionization front propagates outward into the circumstellar envelope of neutral atoms.&lt;ref name=Osterbrock2&gt;{{harvnb|Osterbrock|Ferland|2005|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numbers and distribution===
About 3000 planetary nebulae are now known to exist in our galaxy,&lt;ref name="Parkeretal2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Parker|Acker|Frew|Hartley|2006|pp=79–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to total stellar lifetime accounts for their rarity. They are found mostly near the plane of the [[Milky Way]], with the greatest concentration near the [[galactic center]].&lt;ref name=majaess2007&gt;{{harvnb|Majaess|Turner|Lane|2007|pp=1349–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about 20% of planetary nebulae are spherically symmetric (for example, see [[Abell 39]]).&lt;ref name=Jacoby2001&gt;{{harvnb|Jacoby|Ferland|Korista|2001|pp=272–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of shapes exist with some very complex forms seen. Planetary nebulae are classified by different authors into: stellar, disk, ring, irregular, helical, [[bipolar nebula|bipolar]], quadrupolar,&lt;ref name=KwoketalDec2005&gt;{{harvnb|Kwok|Su|2005|pp=L49–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other types,&lt;ref name=Kwok8&gt;{{harvnb|Kwok|2000|pp=89–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the majority of them belong to just three types: spherical, elliptical and bipolar. Bipolar nebulae are concentrated in the [[galactic plane]], likely produced by relatively young massive progenitor stars; and bipolars in the [[galactic bulge]] appear to prefer orienting their orbital axes parallel to the galactic plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rees|Zijlstra|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, spherical nebulae are likely produced by the old stars similar to the Sun.&lt;ref name=Osterbrock/&gt;

The huge variety of the shapes is partially the projection effect—the same nebula when viewed under different angles will appear different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Z | last = Chen |author2=A.

Another possibility is that planets disrupt the flow of material away from the star as the nebula forms. It has been determined that the more massive stars produce more irregularly shaped nebulae.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1990|pp=526–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, astronomers announced the first detection of magnetic fields around the central stars of two planetary nebulae, and hypothesized that the fields might be partly or wholly responsible for their remarkable shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SpaceDaily Express|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordanetal2005" /&gt;

==Membership in clusters==
[[File:Abell 78.jpg|thumb|Abell 78, 24 inch telescope on Mt. Lemmon, AZ. Courtesy of Joseph D. Schulman.]]

Planetary nebulae have been detected as members in four Galactic [[globular clusters]]: [[Messier 15]], [[Messier 22]], [[NGC 6441]] and [[Palomar 6]]. Evidence also points to the potential discovery of planetary nebulae in globular clusters in the galaxy [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]].&lt;ref name=ja2013&gt;Jacoby, George H.; Ciardullo, Robin; De Marco, Orsola; Lee, Myung Gyoon; Herrmann, Kimberly A.; Hwang, Ho Seong; Kaplan, Evan; Davies, James E., (2013). [http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2013ApJ...769...10J ''A Survey for Planetary Nebulae in M31 Globular Clusters''], ApJ, 769, 1&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is currently only one case of a planetary nebula discovered in an [[open cluster]] that is agreed upon by independent researchers.&lt;ref name=fr2008&gt;Frew, David J.

Indeed, through cluster membership PHR 1315-6555 possesses among the most precise distances established for a planetary nebula (i.e., a 4% distance solution). The cases of [[NGC 2818]] and NGC 2348 in [[Messier 46]], exhibit mismatched velocities between the planetary nebulae and the clusters, which indicates they are line-of-sight coincidences.&lt;ref name=majaess2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=kiss2008&gt;{{harvnb|Kiss|Szabó|Balog|Parker|2008|pp=399–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mermilliod2001&gt;{{harvnb|Mermilliod|Clariá|Andersen|Piatti|2001|pp=30–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A subsample of ''tentative'' cases that may potentially be cluster/PN pairs includes Abell 8 and Bica 6,&lt;ref name=bo2008&gt;Bonatto, C.; Bica, E.; Santos, J.

Theoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from [[main-sequence]] stars of between one and eight solar masses, which puts the progenitor star's age at greater than 40 million years. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a planetary nebula within.&lt;ref name=majaess2007/&gt; For one reason, the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars is on the order of thousands of years, which is a blink of the eye in cosmic terms.  Also, partly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion and tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically from 100 to 600 million years.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{harvnb|Allison|2006|pp=56–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues in planetary nebula studies==
[[File:The planetary nebula Fleming 1 seen with ESO’s Very Large Telescope.tiff|thumb|Odd pair of aging stars sculpt spectacular shape of planetary nebula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cosmic Sprinklers Explained|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1244/|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:NGC 6886.jpg|thumb|Tiny planetary nebula [[NGC 6886]].]]

The distances to planetary nebulae are generally poorly determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Distances to Planetary Nebulae|author=R. Gathier|url= https://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.32-jun83/messenger-no32-20-22.pdf |accessdate=31 May 2014|newspaper=ESO Messenger}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to determine distances to the nearest planetary nebula by measuring their expansion rates. High resolution observations taken several years apart will show the expansion of the nebula perpendicular to the line of sight, while spectroscopic observations of the [[Doppler shift]] will reveal the velocity of expansion in the line of sight. Comparing the angular expansion with the derived velocity of expansion will reveal the distance to the nebula.&lt;ref name=Reed1999/&gt;

The issue of how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be produced is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material moving away from the star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes.&lt;ref name=Kwok8/&gt; However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae.&lt;ref name="Soker2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Soker|2002|pp=481–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields,&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan4&gt;{{harvnb|Gurzadyan|1997|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their interactions with ionized gas could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.&lt;ref name="Jordanetal2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Werner|O'Toole|2005|pp=273–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main methods of determining [[metallicity|metal abundances]] in nebulae. These rely on recombination lines and collisionally excited lines. Large discrepancies are sometimes seen between the results derived from the two methods. This may be explained by the presence of small temperature fluctuations within planetary nebulae. The discrepancies may be too large to be caused by temperature effects, and some hypothesize the existence of cold knots containing very little hydrogen to explain the observations. However, such knots have yet to be observed.&lt;ref name="Liuetal2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Liu|Storey|Barlow|Danziger|2000|pp=585–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote = We report the discovery of multiple two-dimensional rings in the quadrupolar planetary nebula NGC 6881. As many as four pairs of rings are seen in the bipolar lobes, and three rings are seen in the central torus. While the rings in the lobes have the same axis as one pair of the bipolar lobes, the inner rings are aligned with the other pair. The two pairs of bipolar lobes are likely to be carved out by two separate high-velocity outflows from the circumstellar material left over from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind. The two-dimensional rings could be the results of dynamical instabilities or the consequence of a fast outflow interacting with remnants of discrete AGB circumstellar shells.

 | quote = Planetary nebulae (PNs) have high dust content and radiate strongly in the infrared. For young PNs, the dust component accounts for ∼1/3 of the total energy output of the nebulae (Zhang &amp; Kwok 1991). The typical color temperatures of PNs are between 100 and 200 K, and at λ &gt;5 μm, dust begins to dominate over bound-free emission from the ionized component. Although PNs are traditionally discovered through examination of photographic plates or Hα surveys, PNs can also be identified in infrared surveys by searching for red objects with a rising spectrum between 4–10 μm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6514">'''Shale gas in Romania''' has been prospected, licenses were given to several companies, but no exploitation has yet started. The current government led by [[Victor Ponta]] supports extraction of shale gas through [[fracking]], but there have been protests against it. [[Romgaz]] discovered non-conventional gas resources (including shale gas) in 1994-1995 in Transylvania; however, they were only accidentally exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romgaz a descoperit gaze de sist in urma cu 17 ani si ar putea sa treaca la faza de exploatare dupa anumite evaluari |author=Claudia Pirvoiu |url=http://economie.hotnews.ro/stiri-energie-12553034-romgaz-efectueaza-lucrari-explorare-gazelor-sist-circa-17-ani.htm |newspaper=Hotnews |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policy==
When the Democratic-Liberal government began supporting shale gas extraction in 2012, the Social-Democratic Party voiced its opposition. In April 2012, a [[motion of no confidence]] written by the Social-Democrats led to the fall of the Ungureanu government. The motion of no confidence blamed the government for approving shale gas extraction without an appropriate legislative framework and without any geological studies.&lt;ref name="schimbatusl"/&gt;

When the Social-Democratic Party took power, its May 2012 party programme proposed the "immediate establishment of a moratorium on shale gas until the studies that are ongoing at European level on the environmental impacts of hydraulic fractionation process".&lt;ref name="CabinetulPonta"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cabinetul Ponta a blocat stoparea exploatărilor de gaze de şist |author=|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/cabinetul-ponta-a-blocat-stoparea-exploatarilor-de-gaze-de-sist-269719.html |newspaper=România Liberă |date=July 6, 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, a proposal by several [[Vaslui County]] deputies to ban shale gas extraction through fracking was rejected by the [[Victor Ponta]] government, being also rejected by the Senate.&lt;ref name="CabinetulPonta"/&gt; Soon after, Ponta announced that the government would re-analyze its position on shale gas.&lt;ref name="schimbatusl"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cum s-a schimbat pozitia USL fata de gazele de sist.

Following negotiations with petroleum corporation Chevron in December 2012, Ponta announced in January 2013 a reversal of the policies, saying that shale gas extraction "should be considered as something positive".&lt;ref name="schimbatusl"/&gt; The first permissions for the exploration of shale gas were given a few days later in January 2013.&lt;ref name="schimbatusl"/&gt;

The '''Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program''' is an initiative focused on converting public and private fleet vehicles from gasoline to propane autogas in the Southeastern [[United States]]. It is the largest [[Clean Cities]] alternative fuel vehicle conversion deployment program in history. The program is partially funded by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] of 2009 (ARRA) through the [[United States Department of Energy]] Clean Cities Coalition.&lt;ref name=DOE&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Offers $300 Million in Recovery Act Funds for Clean Cities Program|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12476|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Program is converting approximately 1,100 vehicles from [[gasoline]] to [[propane]] [[autogas]] and implementing more than twenty propane autogas fueling stations.&lt;ref name=Govfleet&gt;{{cite web|title=Virgina {{sic|nolink=y}} Clean Cities Helps Convert 1,000+ Vehicles to Propane Autogas|url=http://www.government-fleet.com/News/Story/2011/05/Virgina-Clean-Cities-Helps-Fleets-Convert-1-000-Vehicles-to-Propane-Autogas.aspx|publisher=Government Fleet|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is administered by Virginia Clean Cities and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, and is partially funded by an $8.6 million grant from the ARRA. The Program’s website states that "under this large-scale initiative, public and private fleet vehicles in Washington D.C. and nine southeast states&amp;nbsp;... will be converted to propane autogas in order to reduce vehicle emissions, displace gasoline consumption and create American jobs."&lt;ref name=SPADP&gt;{{cite web|title=About This Program|url=http://www.usepropaneautogas.com/about-this-program/|work=usepropaneautogas.com|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program goals==

The Program’s stated goals include:

* The displacement of an "estimated 15.7 million gallons of gasoline"
* Elimination of an "estimated 16,000 tons or more of airborne [[pollutants]]"
* The creation of "dozens of jobs" in the region&lt;ref name=SPADP /&gt;
 
The program has several types of public and private [[Fleet vehicle|fleet]] participants, including law enforcement, municipal, and transportation service fleets, that are converting anywhere between 5 and 300 of their fleet vehicles to propane autogas. The vehicles are equipped with the PRINS VSI system and are bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they can switch from propane autogas to gasoline.&lt;ref name=AAG&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Conversion|url=http://www.allianceautogas.com/fleets/vehicle-conversion/|publisher=Alliance AutoGas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fleets estimate they will save more than $100,000 in fuel costs annually with propane autogas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Amanda|title=Fuel conversion means big savings for sheriff’s office|url=http://www.times-georgian.com/view/full_story/12033255/article-Fauel-conversion-means-big-savings-for-sheriff%E2??s-office?instance=TG_home_story_offset|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Times-Georgian|date=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, autogas is a cleaner-burning transportation fuel and up to 90 percent of the U.S. supply is domestically produced.&lt;ref name=AFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Autogas|url=http://autogasforamerica.org/why-autogas/made-in-america|publisher=Autogas for America|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost share requirement==

This program, as well as other Clean Cities projects funded by ARRA grants, had a strict 50 percent cost-share requirement from the grant recipient and partners.&lt;ref name=Fueloil&gt;{{cite news|title=DOE Announces $300 Million in Clean Cities Grants — NTEA Members Could Benefit|url=http://www.fueloilnews.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=C44BAE70771342548DF3F8B2F22883E6&amp;nm=&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=1FB5E2FE4DB248D18FBDC65C70DBEDF1|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Fuel Oil News}}&lt;/ref&gt; AutoGas was selected by the program administrators to provide vehicle conversion equipment and to supply autogas fueling to fleet participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alliance AutoGas President Stuart Weidie Introduces U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack At Alternative Fuel Press Briefing And Facility Tour (Press Release)|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10808375/alliance-autogas-president-stuart-weidie-introduces-us-agriculture-secretary-tom-vilsack-at-alternative-fuel-press-briefing-and-facility-tour.html|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=The Street}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost share provided by Alliance AutoGas and other program partners is estimated to be over $11 million.&lt;ref name=Mowers&gt;{{cite web|title=EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:  Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program|url=http://www.allpropanemowers.com/v.php?pg=110|publisher=All Propane Mowers|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==

The program was conceived under the Virginia Clean Cities leadership of Chelsea Jenkins.  It was later lead primarily by the program director, Peter Denbigh, and the assistant program director, Jamison Walker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25249">'''Stopping power''' in nuclear and materials physics is defined as the retarding force acting on charged particles, typically [[alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, due to interaction with matter, resulting in loss of particle energy. &lt;ref name="Bra05"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bragg |first1=W.

[[File:Radioactivity and radiation.png|thumb|Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation]]

==Definition and Bragg curve==
Both charged and uncharged particles lose energy while passing through matter. Positive ions are considered in most cases below. 
The stopping power depends on the type and energy of the radiation and on the properties of the material it passes. Since the production of an [[ion]] pair (usually a positive ion and a (negative) electron) requires a fixed amount of energy (for example, 33.97 [[Electron volt|eV]] in dry air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiation Oncology Physics: A Handbook for Teachers and Students|year=2005|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-107304-4|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf|editor=Podgorsak, E. B.|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}}), the number of ionizations per path length is proportional to the stopping power. The ''stopping power'' of the material is numerically equal to the loss of energy ''E'' per unit path length, ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;S(E) = -dE/dx &lt;/math&gt;

The minus sign makes S positive.

[[File:Bragg Curve for Alphas in Air.png|thumb|Bragg curve of 5.49&amp;nbsp;MeV [[alpha particle]]s in air]] The force usually increases toward the end of [[Range (particle radiation)|range]] and reaches a maximum, the [[Bragg peak]], shortly before the energy drops to zero. The curve that describes the force as function of the material depth is called the ''Bragg curve''. This is of great practical importance for [[radiation therapy]].

The equation above defines the '''linear stopping power''' which in the international system is expressed in [[newton (unit)|N]] but is usually indicated in other units like M[[Electronvolt|eV]]/mm or similar. If a substance is compared in gaseous and solid form, then the linear stopping powers of the two states are very different just because of the different density. One therefore often divides the force by the [[density]] of the material to obtain the '''mass stopping power''' which in the international system is expressed in [[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but is usually found in units like MeV/(mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or similar. The mass stopping power then depends only very little on the density of the material.

The picture shows how the stopping power of 5.49 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] alpha particles increases while the particle traverses air, until it reaches the maximum. This particular energy corresponds to that of the alpha particle radiation from naturally [[radioactivity|radioactive]] gas [[radon]] (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn) which is present in the air in minute amounts.

The mean [[Range (particle radiation)|range]] can be calculated by [[Integral|integrating]] the reciprocal stopping power over energy:&lt;ref name=icru16&gt;{{cite book|last=International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|title=Linear Energy Transfer|year=1970|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0913394090|url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/8949/1/8949.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2012|id=ICRU report 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta x=\int_{0}^{E_0}\frac{1}{S(E)}\, dE&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial kinetic energy of the particle
:''Δx'' is the "continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA)" range and
:''S(E)'' is the linear stopping power.

The deposited energy can be obtained by integrating the stopping power over the entire path length of the ion while it moves in the material.

==Electronic, nuclear and radiative stopping==
Electronic stopping refers to the slowing down of a projectile ion due to the inelastic collisions between bound electrons in the medium and the ion moving through it.  The term inelastic is used to signify that energy is lost during the process (the collisions may result both in excitations of bound electrons of the medium, and in excitations of the electron cloud of the ion as well).  Linear electronic stopping power is identical to [[Linear energy transfer|unrestricted linear energy transfer]].

Instead of energy transfer, some models consider the electronic stopping power as momentum transfer between electron gas and energetic ion. This is consistent with the result of [[Bethe formula|Bethe]] in the high energy range.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1258065&amp;tag=1 Quantum Mechanical electronic stopping power]. Ion Implant Technology conference 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the number of collisions an ion experiences with electrons is large, and since the charge state of the ion while traversing the medium may change frequently, it is very difficult to describe all possible interactions for all possible ion charge states. Instead, the electronic stopping power is often given as a simple function of energy &lt;math&gt;F_e (E)&lt;/math&gt; which is an average taken over all energy loss processes for different charge states. It can be theoretically determined to an accuracy of a few % in the energy range above several hundred keV per [[nucleon]] from theoretical treatments, the best known being the [[Bethe formula]]. At energies lower than about 100 keV per nucleon, it becomes more difficult to determine the electronic stopping theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sigmund: [https://books.google.com/books?id=24st-gh4QHIC&amp;pg=PP1 Stopping of heavy ions]. Springer Tracts in Modern Physics Vol. 204 (2004) {{ISBN|3-540-22273-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electronic nuclear stopping Al in Al.png|thumb|Electronic and nuclear stopping power for aluminum ions in aluminum, versus particle energy per nucleon. The maximum of the nuclear stopping curve typically occurs at energies of the order of 1 [[electron volt|keV]] per [[nucleon]].]]

Graphical presentations of experimental values of the electronic stopping power for many ions in many substances have been given by Paul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exphys.jku.at/stopping/ Stopping Power for Light Ions]&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of various stopping tables has been determined using statistical comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.nimb.2006.01.059|title=A comparison of recent stopping power tables for light and medium-heavy ions with experimental data, and applications to radiotherapy dosimetry|year=2006|last1=Paul|first1=H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B|volume=247|pages=166–172|bibcode = 2006NIMPB.247..166P|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear stopping power''' refers to the elastic collisions between the projectile ion and atoms in the sample (the established designation "nuclear" may be confusing since nuclear stopping is not due to nuclear forces,&lt;ref name="ICRU85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements|title=Fundamental Quantities and Units for Ionizing Radiation|journal=Journal of the ICRU|date=October 2011|edition=Revised|volume=11|issue=1|pages=NP.2–NP|doi=10.1093/jicru/ndr012|pmid=24174259|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/class/ners580/ners-bioe_481/lectures/pdfs/2011-04-ICRU_Report85a-QuantitiesUnits(revised).pdf|accessdate=14 December 2012|editor1-first=Stephen M.|editor1-last=Seltzer|id=ICRU report 85a}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is meant to note that this type of stopping involves the interaction of the ion with the ''nuclei'' in the target). If one knows the form of the repulsive potential energy &lt;math&gt;E (r)&lt;/math&gt; between two atoms (see below), it is possible to calculate the nuclear stopping power &lt;math&gt;F_n (E)&lt;/math&gt;. In the stopping power figure shown above for aluminium ions in aluminum, nuclear stopping is negligible except at the lowest energy. Nuclear stopping increases when the mass of the ion increases. In the figure shown on the right, nuclear stopping is larger than electronic stopping at low energy. For very light ions slowing down in heavy materials, the nuclear stopping is weaker than the electronic at all energies.

Especially in the field of radiation damage in detectors, the term "'''non-ionizing energy loss'''" (NIEL) is used as a term opposite to the [[linear energy transfer]] (LET), see e.g. Refs.&lt;ref name="Huh02"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huhtinen|first=Mika|title=: Simulation of non-ionising energy loss and defect formation in silicon|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B|year=2002|volume=491|issue=1–2|pages=194–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bar95"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barry|first=AL|author2=Houdayer, AJ |author3=Hinrichsen, PF |author4=Letourneau, WG |author5= Vincent, J |title=The energy dependence of lifetime damage constants in GaAs LEDs for 1-500&amp;nbsp;MeV protons|journal=IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science|year=1995|volume=42|issue=6|pages=2104–2107|bibcode = 1995ITNS...42.2104B |doi = 10.1109/23.489259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindström|first=G|title=Radiation hard silicon detectors - developments by the RD48 (ROSE) collaboration|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A|year=2001|volume=466|issue=2|pages=308–326|bibcode=2001NIMPA.466..308L|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)00560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since per definition nuclear stopping power does not involve electronic excitations, NIEL and nuclear stopping can be considered to be the same quantity in the absence of nuclear reactions.

The total non-relativistic stopping power is therefore the sum of two terms: &lt;math&gt;F(E) = F_e (E) + F_n (E)&lt;/math&gt;. Several semi-empirical stopping power formulas have been devised. The model given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark (the so-called "ZBL" stopping, see next chapter),&lt;ref name=Z1985&gt;J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and U. Littmark. In The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter, volume 1, New York, 1985. Pergamon. {{ISBN|0-08-022053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and M. D. Ziegler: SRIM - The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter, SRIM Co., 2008. {{ISBN|0-9654207-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; implemented in different versions of the [[Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter|TRIM/SRIM]] codes,&lt;ref name=srim/&gt; is used most often today.

At extremely high ion energies,&lt;ref name=ICRU73 /&gt; one also has to consider radiative stopping power which is due to the emission of [[bremsstrahlung]] in the electric fields of the particles in the material traversed.&lt;ref name=ICRU85 /&gt; For electron projectiles, radiative stopping is always important.  At high ion energies, there may also be energy losses due to nuclear reactions, but such processes are not normally described by stopping power.&lt;ref name=ICRU85 /&gt;

Close to the surface of a solid target material, both nuclear and electronic stopping may lead to [[sputtering]].

==The slowing-down process in solids==
[[File:Ion slowing.png|thumb|Illustration of the slowing down of a single ion in a solid material]]
In the beginning of the slowing-down process at high energies, the ion is slowed down mainly by electronic stopping, and it moves almost in a straight path. When the ion has slowed down sufficiently, the collisions with nuclei (the nuclear stopping) become more and more probable, finally dominating the slowing down. When atoms of the solid receive significant recoil energies when struck by the ion, they will be removed from their [[crystal structure|lattice]] positions, and produce a [[collision cascade|cascade of further collisions]] in the material. These 
[[collision cascade]]s are the main cause of damage production during ion implantation in metals and semiconductors.

When the energies of all atoms in the system have fallen below the [[threshold displacement energy]], the production of new damage ceases, and the concept of nuclear stopping is no longer meaningful.
The total amount of energy deposited by the nuclear collisions to atoms in the materials is called the nuclear deposited energy.

The inset in the figure shows a typical range distribution of ions deposited in the solid. The case shown here might, for instance, be the slowing down of a 1&amp;nbsp;MeV silicon ion in silicon. The mean range for a 1&amp;nbsp;MeV ion is typically in the [[micrometer]] range.

===Repulsive [[interatomic potential]]s===
At very small distances between the nuclei the repulsive interaction can be regarded as essentially Coulombic. At greater distances, the electron clouds screen the nuclei from each other. Thus the repulsive potential can be described by multiplying the Coulombic repulsion between nuclei with a screening function φ(r/a),

: &lt;math&gt; V(r) = { 1 \over 4 \pi \varepsilon_0} {Z_1Z_2 e^2 \over r} \varphi(r/a)&lt;/math&gt;

where φ(r/a) → 1 when r → 0. Here &lt;math&gt;Z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_2&lt;/math&gt; are the charges of the interacting nuclei, and ''r'' the distance between them; ''a'' is the so-called screening parameter.

A large number of different repulsive potentials and screening functions have been proposed over the years, some determined semi-empirically, others from theoretical calculations. A much used repulsive potential is the one given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark, the so-called ZBL repulsive potential. It has been constructed by fitting a universal screening function to theoretically obtained potentials calculated for a large variety of atom pairs.&lt;ref name=Z1985/&gt; The ZBL screening parameter and function have the forms

: &lt;math&gt; a = a_u = { 0.8854a_0 \over Z_1^{0.23} + Z_2^{0.23} }&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x) = 0.1818e^{-3.2x} +0.5099e^{-0.9423x} +0.2802e^{-0.4028x}  +0.02817e^{-0.2016x} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x = r/a&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Bohr atomic radius = 0.529 Å.

The standard deviation of the fit of the universal ZBL repulsive potential to the theoretically calculated pair-specific potentials it is fit to is 18% above 2&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref name=Z1985/&gt; 
Even more accurate repulsive potentials can be obtained from self-consistent total energy calculations using [[density-functional theory]] and the [[local-density approximation]] 
(LDA) for electronic exchange and correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(97)00447-3|title=Repulsive interatomic potentials calculated using Hartree-Fock and density-functional theory methods|year=1997|last1=Nordlund|first1=K|last2=Runeberg|first2=N|last3=Sundholm|first3=D|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B|volume=132|issue=1|pages=45|bibcode = 1997NIMPB.132...45N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Channeling===
{{Main|Channelling (physics)}}
In crystalline materials the ion may in some instances get "channeled", i.e., get focused into a channel between crystal planes where it experiences almost no collisions with nuclei. Also, the electronic stopping power may be weaker in the channel. Thus the nuclear and electronic stopping do not only depend on material type and density but also on its microscopic structure and cross-section.

===Computer simulations of ion slowing down===
Computer simulation methods to calculate the motion of ions in a medium have been developed since the 1960s, and are now the dominant way of treating stopping power theoretically. The basic idea in them is to follow the movement of the ion in the medium by simulating the collisions with nuclei in the medium. The electronic stopping power is usually taken into account as a frictional force slowing down the ion.

Conventional methods used to calculate ion ranges are based on the [[binary collision approximation]] (BCA).&lt;ref name="Rob74"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.9.5008|title=Computer simulation of atomic-displacement cascades in solids in the binary-collision approximation|year=1974|last1=Robinson|first1=Mark|last2=Torrens|first2=Ian|journal=Physical Review B|volume=9|pages=5008|bibcode = 1974PhRvB...9.5008R|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these methods the movement of ions in the implanted sample is treated as a succession of individual collisions between the recoil ion and atoms in the sample. For each individual collision the classical scattering integral is solved by numerical integration.

The impact parameter ''p'' in the scattering integral is determined either from a stochastic distribution or in a way that takes into account the crystal structure of the sample. The former method is suitable only in simulations of implantation into amorphous materials, as it does not account for channeling.

The best known [[binary collision approximation|BCA]] simulation program is [[Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter|TRIM/SRIM]] ([[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] for TRansport of Ions in Matter, in more recent versions called Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter), which is based on the ZBL electronic stopping and [[interatomic potential]].&lt;ref name=Z1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=srim&gt;[http://www.SRIM.org SRIM web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0029-554X(80)90440-1|title=A Monte Carlo computer program for the transport of energetic ions in amorphous targets☆|year=1980|last1=Biersack|first1=J|last2=Haggmark|first2=L|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods|volume=174|issue=1|pages=257|bibcode = 1980NucIM.174..257B }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a very easy-to-use user interface, and has default parameters for all ions in all materials up to an ion energy of 1&amp;nbsp;GeV, which has made it immensely popular. However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure, which severely limits its usefulness in many cases. Several BCA programs overcome this difficulty; some fairly well known are MARLOWE,&lt;ref name="Rob92"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0168-583X(92)95839-J|title=Computer simulation studies of high-energy collision cascades1|year=1992|last1=Robinson|first1=M|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research B|volume=67|issue=1–4|pages=396–400|bibcode = 1992NIMPB..67..396R |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1090151/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCCRYS and crystal-TRIM.

Although the BCA methods have been successfully used in describing many physical processes, they have some obstacles for describing the slowing down process of energetic ions realistically. Basic assumption that collisions are binary results in severe problems when trying to take multiple interactions into account. Also, in simulating crystalline materials the selection process of the next colliding lattice atom and the impact parameter ''p'' always involve several parameters which may not have perfectly well defined values, which may affect the results 10–20% even for quite reasonable-seeming choices of the parameter values. The best reliability in BCA is obtained by including multiple collisions in the calculations, which is not easy to do correctly. However, at least MARLOWE does this.

A fundamentally more straightforward way to model multiple atomic collisions is provided by [[molecular dynamics]] (MD) simulations, in which the time evolution of a system of atoms is calculated by solving the equations of motion numerically. Special MD methods have been devised in which the number of interactions and atoms involved in MD simulations have been reduced in order to make them efficient enough for calculating ion ranges.&lt;ref name="Nor95"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0927-0256(94)00085-Q|url=http://beam.acclab.helsinki.fi/~knordlun/mdh/mdh_captions.ps|title=Molecular dynamics simulation of ion ranges in the 1–100&amp;nbsp;keV energy range|year=1995|last1=Nordlund|first1=K|journal=Computational Materials Science|volume=3|pages=448–456|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bea98"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.57.7278|title=Efficient molecular dynamics scheme for the calculation of dopant profiles due to ion implantation|year=1998|last1=Beardmore|first1=Keith|last2=Grønbech-Jensen|first2=Niels|journal=Physical Review E|volume=57|pages=7278–7287|arxiv = physics/9901054 |bibcode = 1998PhRvE..57.7278B|issue=6 |citeseerx=10.1.1.285.6727}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MD simulations this automatically describe the nuclear stopping power.

==Minimum ionizing particle==
Beyond the maximum, stopping power decreases approximately like ''1/v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' with increasing particle velocity ''v'', but after a minimum, it increases again.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdg.lbl.gov/2005/reviews/passagerpp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum ionizing particle (or mip) is a particle whose mean energy loss rate through matter is close to the minimum. In many practical cases, relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic-ray [[muon]]s) are minimum ionizing particles.

[[Image:Lucas Cranach (I) - Adam and Eve-Paradise - Kunsthistorisches Museum - Detail Tree of Knowledge.jpg|thumb|"The Fall of Man" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. The Tree of Knowledge is on the right.]]
The '''tree of the knowledge of good and evil''' ({{hebrew|עֵץ הַדַּעַת טוֹב וָרָע}}; {{IPA-he|Etz ha-daʿat tov wa-raʿ}}) is one of two specific trees in the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] in Genesis 2–3, along with the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]].

==In Genesis==

===Narrative===
Genesis 2 narrates that [[God]] places the first man and woman in a garden with trees of whose fruits they may eat, but forbids them to eat from "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil". When, in Genesis 3, a [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] seduces the woman to eat from its [[forbidden fruit]] and she also lets the man taste it, God expels them from the garden and thereby from eternal life.

===Meaning of ''good and evil''===
The phrase in {{Hebrew Name 1|טוֹב וָרָע|tov wa-raʿ||nobold}}, literally translates as ''good and evil''. This may be an example of the type of figure of speech known as [[merism]], a [[Literary technique|literary device]] that pairs [[Opposite (semantics)|opposite]] terms together in order to create a general meaning, so that the phrase "good and evil" would simply imply "everything". This is seen in the Egyptian expression ''evil-good'', which is normally employed to mean "everything". In Greek literature, Homer also uses the device when he lets [[Telemachus]] say, "I know all things, the good and the evil" (Od.20:309-10).&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Cyrus H.|last2=Rendsburg |first2=Gary A. |title=The Bible and the ancient Near East |year=1997 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-31689-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWmBUBre55QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Bible+and+the+Ancient+Near+East+gordon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UnLGWjWlY_&amp;sig=I0IV9A6pkpZjRWXR5rTCqfetph8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=as4xUNLHAsjNiwKCp4CYBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20merism&amp;f=false |edition=4th |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''tree of the knowledge of good and evil'' is to be understood to mean a tree whose fruit imparts knowledge of ''everything'', this phrase does not necessarily denote a moral concept. This view is held by several scholars.&lt;ref name=Gordon-Rendsburg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s notes to the NJPS Torah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space and Time in the Religious Life of the Near East |last=Wyatt |first=Nicolas |page=244 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-567-04942-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, given the context of disobedience to God, other interpretations of the implications of this phrase also demand consideration. [[Robert Alter]] emphasizes the point that when God forbids the man to eat from that particular tree, he says that if he does so, he is "doomed to die". The Hebrew behind this is in a form regularly used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] for issuing death sentences.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=21}}

==Religious views==

===Judaism===
In Jewish tradition, the Tree of Knowledge and the eating of its fruit represents the beginning of the mixture of good and evil together. Before that time, the two were separate, and evil had only a nebulous existence in potential. While free choice did exist before eating the fruit, evil existed as an entity separate from the human psyche, and it was not in human nature to desire it. Eating and internalizing the forbidden fruit changed this and thus was born the ''[[yeitzer hara]]'', the Evil Inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Rashi to Genesis 2:25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramban to Genesis 3:6&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rashi]]'s notes on Genesis 3:3, the first sin came about because Eve added an additional clause to the Divine command: ''Neither shall you touch it.'' By saying this, Eve added to YHWH's command and thereby came to detract from it, as it is written: ''Do not add to His Words'' (Proverbs 30:6). However, In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', it was Adam who had devoutly forbidden Eve to touch the tree even though God had only mentioned the eating of the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol1/two.htm#9 The Legends of the Jews, Vol. I: The Fall of Man], (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|When Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge, all the animals ate from it, too &lt;ref&gt;[[Bereishit Rabbah]] 19: 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Kabbalah]], the sin of the Tree of Knowledge (called ''Cheit Eitz HaDa'at'') brought about the great task of ''[[beirurim]]'', sifting through the mixture of good and evil in the world to extract and liberate the sparks of holiness trapped therein.&lt;ref&gt;Epistle 26, Lessons in Tanya, Igeret HaKodesh&lt;/ref&gt; Since evil has no independent existence, it depends on holiness to draw down the Divine life-force, on whose "leftovers" it then feeds and derives existence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 22, Tanya, Likutei Amarim&lt;/ref&gt; Once evil is separated from holiness through ''beirurim'', its source of life is cut off, causing the evil to disappear. This is accomplished through observance of the [[613 commandments]] in the Torah, which deal primarily with physical objects wherein good and evil are mixed together.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 37, Lessons in Tanya, Likutei Amarim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torah Ohr 3c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torat Chaim Bereishit 30a&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the task of ''beirurim'' rectifies the sin of the Tree and draws the [[Shechinah]] back down to earth, where the sin of the Tree had caused Her to depart.&lt;ref&gt;Bereishit Rabbah 19:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramban to Genesis 3:8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[Image:Orvieto061.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A marble [[bas relief]] by [[Lorenzo Maitani]] on the [[Orvieto Cathedral]], Italy depicts Eve and the tree]]
In [[Christian theology]], consuming the fruit of the ''tree of knowledge of good and evil'' was the sin committed by Adam and Eve that led to the [[fall of man]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2-3.

In [[Catholicism]], [[Augustine of Hippo]] taught that the ''tree'' should be understood both symbolically and as a real tree - similarly to Jerusalem being both a real city and a figure of [[Heavenly Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; Bibliothèque Augustinniene 49, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine underlined that the fruits of that tree were not evil by themselves, because everything that God created ''was good'' (Gen 1:12). It was disobedience of Adam and Eve, who had been told by God not to eat of the tree (Gen 2:17), that caused disorder in the creation,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6.12 and 13.28, Bibliothèque Augustinniene 49,28 and 50-52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371-372 [v. 26-31;1-36]; ''De natura boni'' 34-35; [[CSEL]] 25, 872; PL 42, 551-572&lt;/ref&gt; thus humanity inherited sin and guilt from Adam and Eve's sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120113.htm |title=The City of God (Book XIII), Chapter 14 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Christian art, the fruit of the tree is commonly depicted as the [[Apple (symbolism)|apple]], which originated in [[central Asia]]. This depiction may have originated as a Latin pun: by eating the ''mālum'' (apple), Eve contracted ''malum'' (evil).&lt;ref name="dope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2682/was-the-forbidden-fruit-in-the-garden-of-eden-an-apple|title=The Straight Dope: Was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden an apple?|accessdate=2008-10-06|last=Adams|first=Cecil|authorlink=Cecil Adams|date=2006-11-24|work=The Straight Dope|publisher=Creative Loafing Media, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that this depiction originated simply because of the religious painters' artistic licence.

===Islam===
{{see also|Tree of life (Quran)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The [[Quran]] never refers to the tree as the "Tree of the knowledge of good and evil" but rather typically refers to it as "the tree" or (in the words of [[Iblis]]) as the "tree of immortality".&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 20:120&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that when God created Adam and Eve, he told them that they could enjoy everything in the Garden except this tree, and so, [[Devil (Islam)|Satan]] appeared to them and told them that the only reason God forbade them to eat from that tree is that they would become [[Islamic view of angels|Angels]] or become immortals.

When they ate from this tree their nakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden. The Quran mentions the sin as being a 'slip', and after this 'slip' they were sent to the destination they were intended to be on - Earth. Consequently, they repented to God and asked for his forgiveness&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 7:23&lt;/ref&gt; and were forgiven.&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an 2:37&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that those who obey God and follow his path shall be rewarded with everlasting life in ''[[Jannah]]'', and those who disobey God and stray away from his path shall be punished in ''[[Jahannam]]''.

God in Quran (Al-A'raf 27) states:
"[O] Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he brought your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their garments to show them their shameful parts. Surely he [Satan] sees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not. We have made the Satans the friends of those who do not believe."

===Other cultures===
A [[cylinder seal]], known as the [[Adam and Eve cylinder seal]], from post-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] periods in [[Mesopotamia]] (c. 23rd-22nd century BCE), has been linked to the [[Adam and Eve]] story. [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]] [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith (1840-1876)]] describes the seal as having two facing figures (male and female) seated on each side of a tree, holding out their hands to the fruit, while between their backs is a serpent, giving evidence that the [[fall of man]] account was known in early times of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="Temptation Seal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=T.C.|title=The Bible in the British Museum : interpreting the evidence|year=2004|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=9780809142927|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5f4EO5t8BYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mitchell,+The+Bible+in+the+British+Museum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=31qHJbuz7Y&amp;sig=B2lDgJh0eTTohmW7szow0Oi0fPM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ktcxUO3AC8KJiAK8qYC4BQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=temptation%20seal&amp;f=false|edition=New|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The British Museum disputes this interpretation and holds that it is a common image from the period depicting a male deity being worshipped by a woman, with no reason to connect the scene with the Book of Genesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/asset/adam-and-eve-cylinder-seal/JgFYWzVXpBoYoQ |title='Adam and Eve' cylinder seal |author=The British Museum |publisher=Google Cultural Institute |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamil poem "Tala Vilasam" recounts a legend of the tree that parallels the Biblical account. In it, the Creator Brahma finally allows the people access to the tree- which, in this case, is the palmyra palmtree [[Borassus flabellifer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=William|title=The Palmyra Palm, Borassus Flabelliformis: A Popular Description of the Palm and Its Products, Having Special Reference to Ceylon : with a Valuable Appendix Embracing Extracts from Nearly Every Author that Has Noticed the Tree|date=1850|publisher=Observer Press|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7YaAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA4|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomycological hypothesis===
American [[ethnomycology|ethnomycologist]], [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanist]], and [[philosopher]] [[Terence McKenna]] proposed that the Forbidden Fruit was [[entheogen]]ic, identifying it as the ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushroom, consistent with his "[[Terence McKenna#"Stoned ape" theory of human evolution|Stoned Ape]]" model of human [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge.''  McKenna, Terence.  1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Visst katten har djuren själ - En samling historier av och för djurvänner''''' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and '''''Jovisst har dyrene sjel''''' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (in English ''Sure an Animal Has a Soul - An Anthology of Tales about and for our Animal Friends''; this book has not been translated into English) is a non-fictional theme book about animals written by Norwegian-Swedish author [[Margit Sandemo]]. There is a [[pun|word play]] in the original Swedish title of book, because the word "katten," in addition to meaning "cat," is also used in the Swedish phrase which means "damn it!"  As literally translated, the title of book is ''An Animal Has a Soul, (a Cat) Damn It!''

This book was created in the same way as ''[[Vi är inte ensamma]]'', a book about guardian angels. Sandemo asked readers of the Norwegian weekly magazine ''[[Hjemmet]]'' and the Swedish ''[[Hemmets Journal]]'' if they believed that animals have souls. She received over 1500 letters from magazine readers, without a single negative answer among them. These answers were used as the primary material of the book. ''Visst katten har djuren själ'' consists of several humorous short stories and photographs chiefly about pets, as well as wild animals. The stories quote from reader responses, and the book contains very little text by the author herself—primarily the foreword, the afterword and a few casual comments.

Margit Sandemo has always loved animals, and it stands out in her novels. She is an honorary member of the Kjemp för Dyrene, the Norwegian animal rights organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5817">'''William F. Sturgis''' (February 25, 1782 &amp;ndash; October 21, 1863) was a [[Boston]] merchant in the [[Old China Trade|China trade]], the [[California hide trade]] and the [[Maritime fur trade]].

==Early life==
Sturgis was born in [[Barnstable, Massachusetts]], to Hannah Mills and William E. Sturgis, a ship master and lineal descendant from Edward Sturgis of [[Yarmouth, Massachusetts]], the first Sturgis in America (arrived 1630).

In 1796, he joined the [[counting house]] of his uncle [[Russell Sturgis (1750–1826)|Russell Sturgis]] (1750–1826), and less than two years later became connected with James and [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]]'s [[maritime fur trade]] between the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast and China.

Upon his father's death in 1797, he went to sea to support the family as assistant trader on the ''Eliza'', then as [[First Mate|chief mate]] of the ''Ulysses''. He then served under Captain Charles Derby on the ''Caroline'' until Derby died and Sturgis took command. In 1804 the ''Caroline'' sailed from the [[Columbia River]] to Kaigahnee, just south of [[Prince of Wales Island, Alaska]], acquiring some 2,500 sea otter skins that netted $73,034.

In 1809, his ship the ''Atahualpa'', owned by [[Theodore Lyman (disambiguation)|Theodore Lyman]], was attacked by Chinese pirates while moored at [[Macau]] Roads. Sturgis managed to get the ship underway and fought off the pirates using four small cannons he had brought on board against the wishes of the ship's owner. Using these, they managed to fight long enough to sail within range of the protective guns of the harbor, and the pirates were captured, their commander Apootsae later being tortured to death by the Mandarin authorities. Sturgis had been prepared to blow up the ship if the pirates caught them in order to save the crew and passengers from being tortured. Lyman reportedly chastised Sturgis for having violated his instructions by bringing the cannon on the voyage.

==Bryant &amp; Sturgis==
In 1810, he returned to Boston formed a trading partnership with John Bryant as Bryant &amp; Sturgis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~bak00113 Bryant &amp; Sturgis (Boston, Mass.) records, 1801-1872 (inclusive): A Finding Aid; Bryant Library, Harvard Business School]&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1810 to 1850 more than half of the trade carried on between the Pacific Northwest coast and China was under their direction, including substantial parts of the California hide trade.

==Personal life==
On his return to Boston in 1810 he married Elizabeth M. Davis, with whom he had one son and five daughters. One daughter, [[Ellen Sturgis Hooper]], was a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] poet and was the mother of [[Marian Hooper Adams]]. 
 
Sturgis was a longtime member of the Massachusetts House and Senate, a member and sometime president of the [[Boston Marine Society]], and a member of the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].

==Legacy==
Sturgis donated his childhood home to be the Barnstable public library, now called the Sturgis Library,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sturgislibrary.org Sturgis Library]&lt;/ref&gt; and his papers are collected there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sturgislibrary.org/collections/special Sturgis Library Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant &amp; Sturgis business records are preserved at the Bryant Library of the [[Harvard Business School]].

A Sturgis descendant donated the [[Tanglewood]] estate to the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. There is a Sturgis Charter Public School, an IB For all 9-12 school in Hyannis, MA.
===The ship ''William Sturgis''===
The ''William Sturgis'' of Boston was an 1849 ship of 649½ tons, built by James O. Curtis in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], MA for [[William Fletcher Weld|William F. Weld &amp; Co]]. She sailed from Cardiff to [[Iloilo]] with a cargo of coal. On Sept. 19, 1863, she was off the coast of [[Guimaras]]. She struck the Magicienne Bank, then sank on Ottorg Bank.&lt;ref name = "gleason" &gt;

In [[Toronto]], Canada, a self-styled YIMBY movement was established in 2006 by community members in response to significant development proposals in the [[Queen Street West#Bathurst Street to Gladstone Avenue: West Queen Street West (the Art and Design District)|West Queen West]] area, and a YIMBY festival, launched the same year, has been held annually since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yimbytoronto.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toronto_Ziedler_interview &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://spacing.ca/toronto/2010/11/12/head-space-christina-zeidler-yimby-festival-organizer/ | doi= | title=Head Space: Christina Zeidler, YIMBY festival organizer | last=De Franco | first=Luca | publisher=''[[Spacing (magazine)]]'' | date=2010-11-12 | accessdate=2018-06-26 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020083907/http://spacing.ca/toronto/2010/11/12/head-space-christina-zeidler-yimby-festival-organizer/ | archive-date=2017-10-20 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt; The festival's organizer, Christina Zeidler, states that &lt;blockquote&gt;YIMBYism is a community mindset that’s open to change and development.&lt;ref name=Toronto_Ziedler_interview /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yimby is an independent political party network founded in Stockholm in 2007, which advocates physical development, [[densification]] and promotion of urban environment.

===California - San Francisco Bay Area===

Since 2014, in response to California's [[California housing shortage|housing affordability crisis]], several YIMBY groups have sprung up in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], including the [[San Francisco Bay Area Renters' Federation]], headed by Sonja Trauss, as well as YIMBY Action, East Bay for Everyone, Palo Alto Forward, Catalyze SV, and CaRLA.&lt;ref name=YIMBY_groups_fundraiser&gt; {{ cite news | url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/12/homes-for-human-beings-millennial-driven-anti-nimby-movement-is-winning-with-a-simple-message/ | title=‘Homes for human beings’: Millennial-driven anti-NIMBY movement is winning with a simple message | last=Murphy | first=Katy | date=2017-11-12 | accessdate=2018-06-14 | publisher=''[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]'' | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123063839/https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/12/homes-for-human-beings-millennial-driven-anti-nimby-movement-is-winning-with-a-simple-message/ | archive-date=2017-11-23 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_Build_baby_Build &gt; {{ cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html | doi= | title=In Cramped and Costly Bay Area, Cries to Build, Baby, Build | last=Dougherty | first=Conor | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2016-04-16 | accessdate=2018-07-02 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425221812/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html | archive-date=2016-04-25 | dead-url=no }} &lt;/ref&gt;  These groups lobby both locally and at the state level for increased housing production at all price levels, as well as using California's [[California Housing Accountability Act|Housing Accountability Act]] ("the anti-NIMBY law") to sue cities when they attempt to block, restrict, or down-size housing development.&lt;ref name=YIMBY_groups_fundraiser/&gt; As ''[[The New York Times]]'' explains about Trauss' organization: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums."&lt;ref name=NYT_Build_baby_Build/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 2018, a newly-formed group named California YIMBY, which received $100,000 from [[Yelp]] CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, as well as $1 million from San Francisco tech company [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], lobbied for and joined over 100 Bay Area tech executives in supporting state senator [[Scott Wiener]]'s [[California Senate Bill 827]], which would have required cities to permit higher density housing near public transit stops, as well as eliminated minimum parking requirements for those developments.{{ r | SFC_Yelp_CEO | p=1 | q=Stoppelman gave $100,000 to California YIMBY, a grassroots pro-housing group that sponsored Wiener’s bill, SB827. The measure would have stopped cities from using planning, zoning and other barriers to block certain high-density housing projects up to five stories near public-transit stops. ... More than 100 Bay Area tech executives, including Stoppelman, Marc Benioff of Salesforce, and Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square, signed a letter to Wiener supporting his bill. }} {{ r | SJMN_Stripe | p=1 | q=Stripe on Thursday became the latest tech company to funnel money toward the Bay Area’s housing crunch, donating $1 million to pro-development political group California YIMBY.  The San Francisco-based online payments company, valued at $9 billion, says the money will help YIMBY push policies with the ultimate goal of increasing California’s building rate from 80,000 homes a year to 500,000. ... Other tech leaders are weighing in on housing policy. In January more than 100 California tech leaders, including the CEOs of Salesforce, Lyft, Yelp and Mozilla, signed a letter supporting SB 827 — the failed bill that would have forced cities to allow denser housing developments near transit hubs. Now Stripe is upping the ante by $1 million with its contribution, the first the company has ever made to a political organization. The sum is the largest single donation California YIMBY has received, and it will increase the organization’s total coffers by about 50 percent, said California YIMBY executive director Brian Hanlon. Prior to Thursday, the organization had raised nearly $2 million from donors including Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. }}
