The '''Amik''', '''Amuk''', or '''Amuq''' '''Valley''' ({{lang-ar|الأعماق}} ''al-A’maq'') is located in the southern part of [[Turkey]], in the [[Hatay Province]], close to the city of [[Antakya]] ([[Antioch]] on the Orontes). Along with [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]] in north western [[Syria]], it is believed to be one of the future sites of the battle of [[Armageddon]] according to [[Islamic eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kerimusta.com/melhame-i-kubra-armageddon-savasi/ |title=MELHAME-İ KÜBRA (ARMAGEDDON) SAVAŞI  |access-date=2015-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102010/http://www.kerimusta.com/melhame-i-kubra-armageddon-savasi/ |archive-date=2015-12-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadislerde-mehdi.blogspot.com.tr/2014/08/melhame-i-kubra-ve-amik-ovas-gercegi.html Amik Ovası ve Armageddon Savaşı {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yeniakit.com.tr/yazarlar/abdurrahman-dilipak/isidin-nihai-hedefi-7940.html IŞİD’in nihai hedefi {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaybihaberleri.blogspot.com.tr/2013/02/melhame-i-kubra-buyuk-savas.html MELHAME-İ KÜBRA / BÜYÜK SAVAŞ {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yazete.com/genc-kalemler/mesut-akbaba/buyuk-savas-melhamei-kubra/2191/ Büyük savaş melhamei kübra {{tr}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Eschatology==
[[Abu Hurayrah]], a [[sahabi|companion]] of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], reported in a [[hadith]] that the Prophet said:

{{quote|The Last Hour would not come until the Romans land at al-A’maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of Earth at that time will come from [[Medina]] (to counteract them).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theonlyquran.com/hadith/Sahih-Muslim/?volume=41&amp;chapter=9 Sahih-Muslim Hadith, Vol. 41, Chap. 9, Hadith 6924, per Abu Huraira] from Quran/Hadith study site: [http://www.theonlyquran.com/index.php The Only Quran]. Retrieved 16 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Islamic scholar]]s and hadith commentators suggest that the word ''Romans'' refers to Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farzana Hassan|title=Prophecy and the Fundamentalist Quest: An Integrative Study of Christian and Muslim Apocalyptic Religion|date=15 Jan 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786480791|page=41|edition=illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hadith further relates the subsequent Muslim victory, followed by the peaceful takeover of [[Constantinople]] with invocations of [[takbir]] and [[tasbih]], and finally the defeat of the [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Anti-Christ]] following the return and descent of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farzana Hassan|title=Prophecy and the Fundamentalist Quest: An Integrative Study of Christian and Muslim Apocalyptic Religion|date=15 Jan 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786480791|pages=41–2|edition=illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman|title=The Meaning and Explanation of the Glorious Qur'an (Vol 2)|date=2009|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|isbn=9781861797667|pages=311–12|edition=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other hadiths relate the appearance of [[Imam Mahdi]] immediately before the [[Second Coming of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sonn (2004) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], an '''anagārika''' ([[Pali]], "homeless one", {{IPA-sa|əˈnəɡɑːrɪkə|}}; f. ''anagārikā'' {{IPA-sa|əˈnəɡɑːrɪkɑː|}}) is a person who has given up most or all of their worldly possessions and responsibilities to commit full-time to Buddhist practice. It is a midway status between a [[bhikkhu]] or [[bhikkhuni]] (fully ordained monastics) and [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|laypersons]]. An anagārika takes the [[Eight Precepts]], and might remain in this state for life.

Anagārikas usually wear white clothes or robes, depending on the tradition they follow. Some traditions have special ordination ceremonies for anagārikas, while others simply take the eight precepts with a special intention.

Given the lack of full ordination for women in modern [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], women who wish to renounce live as anagārikās under names such as [[maechi]] in [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thailand]], [[thilashin]] in [[Buddhism in Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[dasa sil mata]] in [[Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. They make take the Eight or [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|Ten Precepts]]. In [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]], many nuns are technically anagārikās or [[samanera|śrāmaṇerikā]]s (novitiates).

==History==
In monastic settings, lay attendants for monks or nuns are needed. The monastic rules restrict monks and nuns from many tasks that might be needed, including the use of money, driving, cooking, digging and cutting plants, so lay attendants help bridge this gap. Anagārikas differ from laity by their commitment to Buddhism, to their precepts, and to monastics. There is usually a notable difference in their manner, appearance and attire. In many cases, they are full-time residents at the [[vihara]] where they ordained. Anagārikas often have the intention of becoming a monk or nun at a later point, though not always. In some monasteries a period as an anagārika, often one year, is required in order to take novice ordination. 

The main difference between the Eight Precepts of an anagārika and the Ten Precepts of a novitiate is the rule of not handling money. Therefore, anagārika ordinations usually take place in [[vihara]]s where the [[vinaya]] (monastic rules), including the rules about not handling money, are strictly followed.

'''Antonin Gadal''' (1877–1962) was a French [[mysticism|mystic]] and historian who dedicated his life to study of the [[Cathar]]s in the south of France, their spirituality, beliefs and ideology.

==Life==
Gadal was born in 1877 in the Pyrenean town of [[Tarascon-sur-Ariège|Tarascon]] in the [[Ariège (department)|Ariège]] region in the south of France,&lt;ref name="goldenr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrosycross.org.au/authors/authors_AGadal.htm |title=Antonin Gadal biography at GoldenRosycross.org |accessdate=24 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719224749/http://www.goldenrosycross.org.au/authors/authors_AGadal.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was one of the centres of the heretical [[gnostic]] [[Christian]] movement known as the [[Cathars]] or the [[Albigensians]] in the 12th and 13th Centuries. Another major Cathar centre, [[Montségur]], the castle where their leaders made their last stand against the [[Crusaders]], is not far away to the north-east. [[Montaillou]], the village which continued as a secret community of Cathars until the 14th Century and the [[Inquisition]]'s records of which went up to make Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's book ''Montaillou: Promised Land of Error'' (1975), is also nearby.

Gadal grew up in a house next to the Tarasconian historian [[Adolphe Garrigou]] who specialised in the history of the Cathars (along with his son he is honoured by a plaque on the building he lived in one of the squares in Tarascon). Garrigou saw himself as a preserver of the memory of the Christian sect and, seeing a kindred spirit in the young man took him under his wing as an inheritor of his knowledge. As an adult, Gadal worked as a schoolteacher but his fascination with the Cathars lead him to work for the Tourist Board Of [[Ussat Ornolac]]. In doing so he was able to explore the Pyrenean caves himself, which he believed were hiding places and sites of worship for the Cathars. Through his investigations he developed a detailed picture of what he believed were the inner mysteries of their faith. [[Otto Rahn]], the [[Nazi]] historian and occultist, is believed to have approached him in his own quest for the secrets of the Cathars (Rahn believed that the Cathars were the trustees of the [[Holy Grail]]). Although some have suggested that Gadal refused to assist Rahn, it seems likely that in fact Gadal personally took Rahn on a tour of the various Cathar Cave locations.

Gadal also worked with an English student of the Cathars, Walter Birks, and their association is described in the book "The Treasure of Montségur" by Birks and his collaborator R. A. Gilbert (1987).&lt;ref&gt;London (Aquarian Press) {{ISBN|9780850304244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not always clear whether the assertions in this book are by Birks, or by the younger scholar Gilbert, who held strong views about Gadal's work.

==Gadal and Cathar spirituality==
Gadal's belief was that the spirituality of the Cathars traced back through various Gnostic beliefs (such as [[Manicheanism]], [[Christian]] [[Gnosticism]]) to the most ancient sources of the Western Mystery Tradition - the [[Essenes]], [[Hermeticism]], the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]] Mysteries and so on - but seen in a Christian context. He argued that in the Ariège basin, and particularly the Lombrives caves, Cathar Perfecti (the spiritual elite of the movement) underwent a three-year period of initiation in which they experienced a transformation of the human soul, much like that experienced by Christ in the Gospels - [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Death]] &amp; [[Resurrection]]. Transformed by the [[Holy Spirit]], the Perfecti then went out into the world, having 'died' to it, to spread the Cathar faith and minister to the Credentes, or Believers. Gadal's belief was that this process of Initiation was contained within the Christian message of the Gospels and the cycle of the Christ story and was the hidden meaning of the [[Grail]] Legend.

Through his interest in the Gnostic Christianity of the Cathars and his belief in its connection with an ancient tradition, in his later years Gadal made contact with the leaders of the neo-[[Gnostic]], [[Christian]] [[Rosicrucian]] movement, the [[Lectorium Rosicrucianum]] - [[Jan van Rijckenborgh]] and [[Catharose de Petri]].&lt;ref name=Triumph&gt;{{cite book|last=Gadal|first=Antonin|title=Der Triumph der Universellen Gnosis|year=2006|publisher=In de Pelikaan|location=Amsterdam|isbn=90 71608 19 0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gadal's theories and ideas subsequently became a very important element in the cosmology of the Lectorium and to this day members of the society embark on pilgrimages to the Ariège and the Lombrives caves every five years.

==Later life and work==

As well as his work in the Ariège region, Gadal travelled widely through Europe and the world lecturing on the [[Cathars]], his findings and theories, many of which were rejected by academics as being too mystical or speculative. His books include ''The Inheritance of the Cathars'' and ''On the Path to the [[Holy Grail]]'' ({{ISBN|9067322857}}), both printed by the Rosycross Press, the printing arm of the Lectorium. He died in 1962.

'''Beit Shemesh''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שֶׁמֶשׁ}},; {{lang-ar|بيت شيمش}}; {{lang-la|Bethsames}}, ''Beth Shamesh'', ''Bethshamesh'' or ''Bet shemesh'' and most often '''Beth-Shemesh''' in [[English translations of the bible|English translations]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]) is a [[city council (Israel)|city]] located approximately {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of [[Jerusalem]] in [[Israel]]'s [[Jerusalem District]], with a population of {{Israel populations|Bet Shemesh}} in {{Israel populations|Year}}.{{Israel populations|reference}} The history of Beit Shemesh goes back to pre-biblical times. The modern city of Beit Shemesh was founded in 1950.

==History==

===Canaanite and Israelite town===
The ancient city of Beit Shemesh ("house of the sun" or "temple of the sun" in Hebrew) was originally named after the [[Canaan]]ite sun-goddess [[Shapash (Canaanite goddess)|Shemesh]], who was worshipped there in antiquity. The ruins of the ancient biblical city  are located at a site called Tel Beit Shemesh (Tell er-Rumeileh), a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] located near the modern city.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; In the [[Amarna letters]] Shamash is mentioned several times, along with Addu, as one of the greatest gods: the Pharaoh is "like Addu and Shamash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DnWGAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=beth+shemesh+shamash&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Israel |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Beth-Shemesh was shared by (at least) two other places in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and one more in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;BibleHub.com, ''Beth Shemesh'', quoting [[Strong's Concordance]] etc.  [http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1053.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit Shemesh is first mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the [[Book of Joshua]],&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 15:10&lt;/ref&gt; as a city in the territory of the [[tribe of Judah]] on the border between their territory and that of the [[tribe of Dan]]. In {{bibleverse||Joshua|21:16|HE}}, this city was set aside as one of the [[13 Kohanic cities]] for the priests of the [[Levite|tribe of Levi]], the [[Kohen|Kohanim]].

Another city by the same name, Beit Shemesh, is later mentioned in {{bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}, being situated in the territory of the [[tribe of Naphtali]].

The city located in the territorial bounds of the tribe of Judah is mentioned in the 6th chapter of [[1 Samuel]] as being the first city encountered by the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on its way back from [[Philistines|Philistia]] after having been [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|captured]] by the [[Philistines]] in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:12-21|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone on which the Ark was placed is recorded as still being located there at the time of writing the Books of Samuel. In the [[King James Version]] this stone is described as "the great stone of Abel".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|6:18|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Books of Kings|2 Kings 14]], Beit Shemesh is again mentioned as being the site of the battle between [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]] king of [[Judea]] and [[Jehoash of Israel|Jehoash]] king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].

After the destruction of much of Judah by [[Sennacherib]] in 701 BCE, the city was abandoned for a while, but there seems to have been an attempt by a group of Judahites at resettling Beth Shemesh, judging by the refurbishing of the water reservoir in the 7th century BCE.&lt;ref name="TAU2000"/&gt; However, after the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] conquest of Judah in the early 580s, either the new Babylonian rulers, or the nearby Philistine metropolis of Ekron favoured by them, apparently put an end to the initiative by sealing and covering over the vital water reservoir,&lt;ref name="TAU2000"&gt;Shlomo Bunimovitz and Zvi Lederman, ''Beth-Shemesh: A Biblical Border City between Judah and Philistia'', Tel Aviv University, 2000  [http://www.tau.ac.il/~archpubs/projects/bethshemesh_project.html], retrieved 2016-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; which was not uncovered until 2004. During the first Jewish [[Babylonian captivity|return]], at the beginning of the [[Second Temple period]], there was no lasting revival of the city, as opposed to many other places in the vicinity such as [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]],{{dubious|Did any settlement even exist at Bet Guvrin at the time of the Return? BG came up only after the destruction of Maresha in 40 BCE|date=January 2016}} [[Maresha]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}{{dubious|W/o source, it is hard to know if these places were continuously populated by Judahites remaining on the land, or by the (relatively very few) returnees from Babylon.|date=September 2016}} Consequently, the small Arab towns of Dayr Raban and [[Dayr Rafat]] used rocks for building from this very ancient source.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Byzantine period===
A monastery and other remains from the Byzantine period have been found on the tell.&lt;ref name="Dauphin"&gt;{{cite book |author=Claudine Dauphin |title=La Palestine byzantine, Peuplement et Populations, Vol. III: Catalogue |series=BAR International Series 726 |year=1998 |publisher=Archeopress |location=Oxford |page=909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Ottoman period===
{{Main article|Dayr Aban}}
In the late 19th century the area was known as 'Ain Shems or Khirbet 'Ain Shems and was used as a temporary harvest-time residence by local Arabs.&lt;ref name="SWPIII"&gt;{{cite book |author1=C. R. Conder |author2=H. H.

===1948 War===
During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian army]] invaded the area and set up a fortified post, called "Mishlat" in Hebrew, on a hill overlooking Beit Shemesh, within the Arab-village [[Dayr Aban]]. The post changed hands several times during fighting. The [[Harel Brigade]] occupied part of the post for several months giving rise to the name "the joint post" or the "Mishlat HaMeshutaf" with 60 meters dividing them and the enemy forces. The Mishlat was finally taken by the Harel force in the [[Operation Ha-Har|Ha-Har offensive]] during the night of 19–20 October 1948.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Beit Shemesh is the point from which the so-called [[Convoy of 35]] set out to bring provisions to besieged [[Gush Etzion]]. On 15 January 1948 a group of 38 [[Palmach]] volunteers left [[Hartuv]] near Beit Shemesh. After one member of the group sprained his ankle, the group, now numbering 35, continued on its way. Their presence was discovered by two Arab women who encountered two scouts of the group near [[Surif]]; an earlier version, that the soldiers were discovered by an Arab shepherd who they graciously let go, was based on a eulogy written by Ben-Gurion and is apparently apocryphal).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5043465 The legend of ambushed Palmach squad '35'] Haaretz, 27 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of Israel===
On 6 December 1950, the [[Hartuv]] [[displaced person]]s camp "[[Ma'abarot|Ma'abarat]] Har-Tuv" was established on the site of the current-day Moshav [[Naham]]. The first inhabitants were [[History of the Jews in Bulgaria|Jewish Bulgaria]]n immigrants. They were joined by more Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria, [[History of the Jews in Iran|Iran]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraq]], [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania]], [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Morocco]] and [[Kurdish Jews|Kurdistan]]. In 1952 the first permanent houses were built in Beit Shemesh. Prior to 1948 the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood area was the site belonging to the Arab village [[Bayt Nattif]]. This village was built on remnants of an ancient Judean town, with various remnants of Jewish settlement from the time, such as a mosaic floor, wineries and other remains, especially from the period of the [[Hasmonean]] kings and earlier. This area is currently under dispute about preservation, having been the subject of a [[grassroots]] campaign.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In its early years, Beit Shemesh came to typify the "[[Development town|Development Town]]" with a largely [[North Africa]]n immigrant population. In 1977, following a writeup in [[Haaretz]] newspaper, Beit Shemesh was perceived as the main outpost for [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party. He promised to rehabilitate neighborhoods and when Likud came to power that year, investment in the city increased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

When the city was built in the 1950s, it was initially settled by [[olim|new immigrants]] from [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]. In the 1990s, the city saw a large influx of new immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[English-speaking countries]], turning it into a major center for Anglo immigrants. Considerable numbers have come from [[North America]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]]. This population tends to be Orthodox, educated and from middle income groups. At the same time, Orthodox Jews from within Israel also began moving to the city, seeking roomier, low-cost housing.&lt;ref name=times&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-growing-pains-of-beit-shemesh/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forward1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Building a Bit of America in Beit Shemesh |author=Nathan Jeffay|url=http://forward.com/articles/14949/ |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a city councillor, there were no [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] in Beit Shemesh before the 1990s.&lt;ref name="GuardianOct2001"/&gt; Since then, Beit Shemesh has become increasingly [[Orthodox Judaism|religious]], with a large Haredi sector. Many [[synagogue]]s and [[yeshiva]]s have been built in the city. Religious communities represented in Beit Shemesh include [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Ger]], [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]], [[Shomer Emunim (Hasidic dynasty)|Shomer Emunim]], [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] and [[Neturei Karta]]. In 2011 Haredim made up 40% of the population, of which an estimated 50 or 60 families with great influence are militant.&lt;ref name="GuardianOct2001"/&gt; According to statistics published by the municipality, 63% of the city's schoolchildren in 2010 were Haredim.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; 75% of the children entering the first grade in the 2012/2013 academic year will be registered in official Haredi institutions.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.411748"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/three-quarters-of-beit-shemesh-first-graders-will-attend-ultra-orthodox-schools-next-year-1.411748| title= Three quarters of Beit Shemesh first-graders will attend ultra-Orthodox schools next year| work=[[Haaretz]]| author=Ettinger, Yair| date= 8 February 2012| accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Beit Shemesh is expected to reach 150,000 in 2020.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/black-and-white-in-color-1.312923| title= Black and white in color| work=[[Haaretz]]| author=Ettinger, Yair| date= 8 September 2010| accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban development==
{{See also|Ramat Beit Shemesh}}
Two new areas, the Nahala UMenucha neighborhood, and Ramat Beit Shemesh, were built in the 1990s, doubling the size of the city.

[[Ramat Beit Shemesh]] ("Beit Shemesh Heights") is an expansion that lies directly adjacent to, and to the south of, the original part of Beit Shemesh, colloquially referred to as "Old Beit Shemesh". It is located on a hill overlooking the old town. Ramat Beit Shemesh has a large, diverse Orthodox population. Originally, it consisted of two areas: ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef'' and ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet''. In ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet'', families belonging to [[Eda Haredit]] constitute the majority.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In 2002, following tensions between the Haredi and non-religious population, plans were drawn up to build another secular neighborhood, HaShachar. In 2007, [[Ramat Shilo]], considered a [[subdistrict]] of Ramat Beit Shemesh, with both [[Dati Leumi]] and Haredi residents was built. In 2009, it was announced that a new neighborhood, ''[[Ramat_Beit_Shemesh#Ramat_Beit_Shemesh_Gimmel|Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel]]'', would be built as a largely Haredi neighborhood on a large block of state-owned land bordering southern Beit Shemesh.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In 2016 the Israeli Land Authority published tenders for 3,268 new apartments, to be built in the newly proposed areas of ''Ramat Beit Shemesh Dalet and Hey.'' According to plans, ultimately there are to be 8,300 new apartments in ''RBS Dalet'' alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/374066/tender-publicized-for-3268-housing-units-in-beit-shemesh.html|title=Tender Publicized for 3,268 Housing Units in Beit Shemesh |date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beit Shemesh also has an [[urban kibbutz]] affiliated with the [[Kibbutz Movement]], Tamuz, founded in 1987.

The large English-speaking community is concentrated in Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef, as well as in the Sheinfeld, Nofei Aviv, Migdal HaMayim and Givat Sharett neighborhoods of "Old Beit Shemesh".

Beit Shemesh is developing rapidly, and under a current masterplan approved by the Israeli government in 2017, Beit Shemesh will double in population, to more than 200,000 residents, with 17,000 new housing units built along with 130 acres zoned as new commercial space for businesses and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamodia.com/2017/04/03/netanyahu-beit-shemesh-will-double-size/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-beit-shemesh-to-double-in-size-1001184442&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that the city could be home to as many as 250,000 residents by 2025. A new commercial center in the Ramat Beit Shemesh neighborhood is planned to be the city's largest.&lt;ref&gt;https://real-invest.co.il/?p=3558&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
The mayor of Beit Shemesh, Moshe Abutbul, is a member of [[Shas]]. The deputy-mayor, Shmuel Greenberg, is a member of [[United Torah Judaism]] (UTJ).&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.411748"/&gt; ''Haaretz'' quotes Abutbul as saying: "Beit Shemesh is not a Haredi city and will not be one."&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt; In the 2009 elections, Shas and UTJ won nine seats in the 21-seat municipal council, one seat went to a new Haredi party called Tov.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt;

Formerly a Likud stronghold, in the 2006 Knesset elections United Torah Judaism became the city's strongest party, with 22.2 percent of the votes and Shas getting 19.9 percent. In 2009 Likud regained its primacy, obtaining 22.2 percent of the votes, and Shas also gained, garnering 20.9 percent, with United Torah Judaism a close third at 20.6 percent. Eda Haredit boycott the elections.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.312923"/&gt;

===2013 municipal elections===
During the municipal elections held on 22 October 2013, acting on several anonymous tips, police raided several private residences and recovered 200 ID cards and disguising materials such as hats, glasses and wigs which law enforcement suspected were used or going to be used for fraudulent voting. Additionally, eight people were arrested on suspicion for engaging and coordinating fraudulent voting activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/200-fake-IDs-seized-in-Beit-Shemesh-in-attempted-voter-fraud-329446 200 IDs seized in Beit Shemesh in suspected voter fraud] The Jerusalem Post, 22 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2013 a three judge panel of the Jerusalem District Court nullified the results of the October municipal elections due to voter fraud and ordered a new election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Court-orders-new-elections-in-Beit-Shemesh-nullifies-old-results-due-to-massive-fraud-336240 Court orders new elections in Beit Shemesh] The Jerusalem Post, 26 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an unprecedented 76% voter turnout rate, incumbent mayor Moshe Abutbul beat contender Eli Cohen with a 51% majority vote during the reelection which took place on 11 March 2014.

After the opening of Orot Banot [[National Religious|national-religious]] girls’ school in September 2011, groups of Haredi extremists gathered in front of the school, calling the girls names and spitting at them when they headed to and from school.

in February 2015 Judge David Gideoni accepted a claim filed by four women who protested an illegal "modesty sign" posted in Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet. The judge ordered Mayor Moshe Abutbul and the Beit Shemesh Municipality to pay each of the women complainants NIS 15,000. The city then saw further signs of "religious radicalization" when the word "woman" was repeatedly erased from a sign at a women's health center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4634605,00.html Word 'woman' erased from HMO sign] YNET, 9 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Beit Shemesh - New and Old.jpg|thumb|Old wall of the ancient ruin, Beit Shemesh]]
[[File:Mb gate tbs.png|thumb|right|Middle Bronze gate system unearthed at Tel Beth-Shemesh]]

In 1971, excavations at Givat Sharett conducted by Israeli archaeologist Claire Epstein revealed a residential settlement of the Middle Bronze Age, including a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/epstein-claire |title=Claire Epstein, Jewish Women Archive |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most ancient [[History of ferrous metallurgy|iron workshop]] in the world was discovered in Beit Shemesh in 2003. The only remnants of a [[Defensive wall|fortified city]] with an advanced water system, from the time of the early [[Kingdom of Judah]] was found here. The bones of animals found in the 12th–11th centuries BCE layer indicate a diet typical of the [[Israelites]] who inhabited the hill country in this period. These together with the pottery finds indicate the cultural influences on the inhabitants of this border town. However, it is not possible to determine their specific ethnic identity, which could be [[Canaan]]ite, [[Philistine]] or [[Israelite]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

In August 2012 archaeologists from [[Tel Aviv University]] announced the discovery of a circular stone seal, approximately 15 millimetres in diameter. The seal was found on the floor of a house at Beit Shemesh and is dated to the 12th century BCE. According to [[Haaretz]], "excavation directors Prof. Shlomo Bunimovitz and Dr. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University say they do not suggest that the human figure on the seal is the biblical Samson. Rather, the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal, show that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal."&lt;ref name="Hasson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=National Seal found by Israeli archeologists may give substance to Samson legend|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/seal-found-by-israeli-archeologists-may-give-substance-to-samson-legend-1.454504|accessdate=3 September 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=30 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal bones found nearby may also be a clue to boundary disputes between different cultures. Pig bones have been found a few kilometres from Beit Shemesh, but only a few have been found actually at Beit Shemesh and at some point during the 11th century BCE it appears that the local population stopped eating pig. Haaretz reports that "According to Bunimovitz, when the pork-eating Philistines arrived in the country from the Aegean, the local people stopped eating pork to differentiate themselves from the newcomers."&lt;ref name="Hasson"/&gt;

In 2014, archaeologists Irene Zilberbod and Tehila Libman announced the nearby discovery of a large compound from the Byzantine period that was most probably a monastery.&lt;ref name=Monastery&gt;{{cite news | title = Archaeologists discover impressive Byzantine-era compound near Beit Shemesh | author = Nir Hasson | newspaper = Haaretz | date = 20 September 2014 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-1.616721}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a residential area and an industrial area with wine and olive presses.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt; The remains of buildings with two or three stories and impressive mosaic floors were discovered.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt; The compound ceased to function in the early Muslim period and was subsequently occupied by other residents.&lt;ref name=Monastery/&gt;
The excavations were continuing with additional finds through late 2017.&lt;ref name="JPostMonasteryDecember2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Artifacts-from-1500-year-old-monastery-and-church-unearthed-in-Beit-Shemesh-518558 |title= Artifacts from 1,500-year-old Monastery and Church unearthed in Beit Shemesh |author= Daniel K.

'''Billy Burke''' (born May 24, 1953) is an American [[Pentecostal]] healing evangelist and the president of his itinerant healing ministry, [http://billyburke.org/ Billy Burke World Outreach], headquartered in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa, FL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Burke's Story|url=http://billyburke.org/BillyBurke%E2%80%99sStory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke is also the senior [[pastor]] of the [http://billyburke.org/BillyBurke%E2%80%99sStory/MiracleCenterWorldOutreach Miracle Center World Outreach] in Tampa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miracle Center World Outreach|url=http://billyburke.org/BillyBurke%E2%80%99sStory/MiracleCenterWorldOutreach}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His healing ministry is founded on his testimony of being healed of terminal brain cancer when he was 9 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Burke's Story|url=http://billyburke.org/BillyBurke%E2%80%99sStory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touching Toronto|url=http://touchingtoronto.com/billy-burke-biography|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224202329/http://touchingtoronto.com/billy-burke-biography|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Billy Burke was born in Greensburg, PA. When he was 9 years old, Burke was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. After undergoing an unsuccessful operation that left him partially paralyzed, and given three days to live, his grandmother removed him from the hospital against doctors orders. Her goal was to bring him to a [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] healing service at the First Presbyterian Church in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh, PA]]. Burke says that while at this service Ms. Kuhlman touched him, allegedly healing him from cancer which has never returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Burke's Story|url=http://billyburke.org/BillyBurke%E2%80%99sStory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then at the age of 19, Burke’s younger brother was killed by a drunk driver. This devastated him and he began to search for the reason of why he was spared from a horrible disease. He was miraculously healed and yet his younger brother was taken. It was then that he was called back to another Kathryn Kuhlman service in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown, OH]]. From there he decided to enter the ministry and attended [[Melodyland Christian Center|Melodyland School of Theology]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim, CA]].

After graduating from [[Melodyland Christian Center|Melodyland School of Theology]], Burke returned to Pittsburgh and started his ministry in Northeast. In 1989, Burke moved his ministry to [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]. In 1995, he founded the Miracle Center World Outreach.  Since then he has traveled all over the United States and the world, spreading God's message of healing and faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Man of Faith|url=http://www.csfreshink.com/group/faith/forum/topics/healed-of-cancer-he-now-spends-his-time-praying-for-others-a-man?commentId=3831802%3AComment%3A203671&amp;xg_source=activity&amp;groupId=3831802%3AGroup%3A51582}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Burke shared his testimony on [[Sid Roth's It's Supernatural|Sid Roth's "It's Supernatural".]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Roth|url=http://sidroth.org/sites/default/files/convio-migrated/transcripts/IS560Transcript_Burke.pdf?docID=2701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu''' ({{IPA-ro|boɡˈdan petriˈt͡ʃejku haʃˈdew|-|Ro-Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu.ogg}} 26 February 1838 &amp;ndash; {{OldStyleDate|7 September|1907|25 August}}) was a [[Romania]]n writer and philologist, who pioneered many branches of Romanian [[philology]] and history.

==Life==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
He was born '''Tadeu Hasdeu''' in [[Kerstenzy|Cristineştii Hotinului]] (now [[Khotyn Raion|Kerstentsi]] in [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]), northern [[Bessarabia]], at the time part of [[Imperial Russia]]. His father was the writer [[Alexandru Hâjdeu]], a descendent of  the [[Hâjdău]] family of [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] boyars, with noted [[Poland|Polish]] connections.

After studying law at the [[Kharkiv National University|University]] of [[Kharkiv]], he fought as a Russian [[hussar]] in the [[Crimean War]]. In 1858 he settled in [[Iaşi]] as a high school teacher and librarian. In 1865, Hasdeu published a [[monograph]] on [[Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit|Ioan Vodă the Terrible]], renaming him for the first time ''cel Viteaz''—"the Brave". The portrayal of this violent, short rule as a glorious moment (and of Ioan himself as a reformer) drew criticism from the ''[[Junimea]]'' society, a conflict which was to follow Hasdeu for the rest of his life. Still, Hasdeu's version of Ioan's character and his anti-[[boyar]] actions were to be reclaimed as a founding myth by [[Communist Romania]].

In 1863, Hasdeu again moved his residence, from Iaşi to [[Bucharest]]; he began editing the [[Satire|satirical]] magazine ''Aghiuţă'', which ceased publication the following year.

===Scientific works===
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
In Romania, Hasdeu started work on the ''Arhiva historică a României'' (1865-1867), the first history work to use sources in [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. He also published the 1870 philological review ''Columna lui Traian'', the best at the time in Romania. With the work ''Cuvente dân Batrâni'' (2 volumes, 1878-1881), he was the first to contribute to the history of apocryphal literature in Romania.

His ''Istoria critică a Românilor'' (1875), though incomplete, marks the beginning of critical investigation into the history of Romania. Hasdeu edited the ancient ''Psalter of [[Coresi]]'' of 1577 (''Psaltirea lui Coresi'', 1881).

His ''Etymologicum magnum Romaniae'' (1886) was the beginning of an encyclopaedic dictionary of the Romanian language, though he never covered letters after ''B''. While the completed parts of the work do aim to be exhaustive, and are remarkably detailed, many of its entries reflect more of Hasdeu's own vision than historical facts (in one famous entry, he claims to be able to trace [[Basarab I]]'s ancestry in a direct line to the [[Dacia]]n rulers, with Dacia as a developed state that would have had, at times, dominated the [[Roman Empire]]—to the point where the single ruling family would have given Rome a large number of emperors).

Hasdeu got involved in the dispute over the [[Latin]] origin of the Romanian language. Being challenged by numerous arguments which pointed to the central position occupied by words of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin in the [[Romanian language]], Hasdeu developed an influential verdict, deemed ''the theory of words' circulation''. The conclusion he reached was that Slavic words were never as widely used as Latin ones, with usage giving the language its character.

In 1876 he was appointed head of the [[National Archives of Romania|State Archives]] in [[Bucharest]], and in 1878 professor of philology at the [[University of Bucharest]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1877, Hasdeu was elected a titular member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=H Membrii Academiei Române din 1866 până în prezent] at the Romanian Academy site&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activities===
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2017}}
Hasdeu was a politician often at odds with the Romanian establishment. For example, he was placed under arrest for a nine-day interval after Captain Alexandru Candiano-Popescu's "[[Republic of Ploieşti]]" conspiracy (1870). Although he had been a staunch defender of the deposed [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], he eventually backed the movement against him (led by [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]]), and was not opposed to the new ''[[Domnitor]]'' (future [[King of Romania]]) [[Carol I of Romania|Carol]].{{cn|date=March 2017}} 

However, Hasdeu was a [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]] activist (he was elected to Parliament on its list for two non-consecutive terms), and close to its most radical, republican wing—the one led by [[C. A. Rosetti]]. As the republican experiment coincided with worsened relations between [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion Brătianu]] and Carol, all Liberal Party members became suspect of involvement. Together with several Party leaders, Hasdeu was tried and acquitted.

==Last years/death==
After the death of his only child, his daughter [[Iulia Hasdeu|Iulia]], in 1888, he became a spiritualist and a firm adept of the [[spiritism]]. He retreated to a [[Câmpina]] mansion, and arranged it as a temple to his newly found beliefs and to his daughter. He died there and was buried in [[Bellu Cemetery|Bellu cemetery]], [[Bucharest]].

His works include two dramas, ''[[Răsvan şi Vidra]]'' (romanticizing the actions of an obscure 1590s Moldavian-[[Romani people|Romani]] [[Voivode]], [[Ştefan Răzvan]]), and ''Domniţa Ruxandra''. In 1891-92, he wrote ''Sic Cogito'', a theoretical work of spiritism as a philosophy. In addition to his interest in science, Hasdeu was the author of many poems, usually short ones. The Romanian critic [[Mircea Eliade]] described him as a "genius of an amazing vastness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cimec.ro/Muzee/hasdeu/2.htm The B. P. Hasdeu Memorial House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609132004/http://cimec.ro/Muzee/hasdeu/2.htm|date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note on his name==
''Hasdeu'' is pronounced as if spelled with the Romanian version of ''[[ş]]'' (''Haşdeu''); Hasdeu never spelled it with any diacritic (most likely because the [[Romanian alphabet]] appeared and went through several major changes during his lifetime).

Although many times taken for a first surname, ''Petriceicu'' is in fact his second name. The confusion can be ascribed to the name's uniqueness, and to the misguided assumption that ''cu'' is the same as the extremely common suffix for Romanian family names. The name was chosen by the writer himself, and it reflected the Hasdeu family claim to have descended from 17th century Moldavian ruler [[Ştefan Petriceicu]].

The '''Bruderhof''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|uː|d|ər|ˌ|h|ɔː|f}}; {{lang-de|place of brothers}}) is a [[Christian]] movement that practices [[common ownership|community of goods]] after the example of the first church described in [[Acts 2]] and [[Acts 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cny.org/stories/radical-discipleship-lived-in-our-midst,15453|title=Radical Discipleship Lived in Our Midst - Catholic New York|website=www.cny.org|access-date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have communities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Paraguay, and Australia. The Bruderhof is seen as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptist]] due to its beliefs and practice, and their claim that another life is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Naked Anabaptist|last=Murray|first=Stuart|publisher=Paternoster|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84227-725-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesRandall2008"/&gt;

The Bruderhof practices adult baptism, non-violence and peacemaking, full community of goods, the proclamation of the gospel and lifelong faithfulness in marriage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations|title=Foundations of our Faith and Calling|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communities are best known by the name "Bruderhof" or sometimes "Bruderhof Communities", though "Bruderhof" is the name used on their website. The communities are legally incorporated in the US as "Church Communities International".  Their corporation used to be called ''The Society of Brothers'' (1939 to 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Mow: ''Torches rekindled: the Bruderhof's struggle for renewal'', Ulster Park, NY, 1989, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Bruderhof was part of the [[Hutterite Church]], they were sometimes called "Hutterian Brethren". The word "Bruderhof" was first used by the early Anabaptists in Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof|title=Bruderhof - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|access-date=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings in Germany (1920–1937) ===
{{See also|Nazi Dissolution of the Bruderhof}}
[[File:Youth Movement Conference in Germany 1920.jpg|thumb|A gathering of the Youth Movement in 1920]]
The Bruderhof was founded in Germany in 1920 by [[Eberhard Arnold]], a philosophy student and intellectual inspired by the [[German Youth Movement]] and his wife Emmy, née von Hollander.&lt;ref name="Tyldesley2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Tyldesley|title=No Heavenly Delusion?: A Comparative Study of Three Communal Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvRwG1ahKc0C|year=2003|publisher=Liverpool University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 the young family with five children rented a house in [[Sinntal|Sannerz, Germany]] and founded a Christian community.

When the group outgrew the house at Sannerz, they moved to the nearby [[Rhön Mountains]]. While there, Arnold discovered that the [[Hutterite]]s (an Anabaptist movement he had studied with great interest) were still in existence in North America. In 1930 he traveled to meet the Hutterites and was ordained as a Hutterian minister.

With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]], the Rhön community moved its draft-age men and children to [[Liechtenstein]] around 1934 because of their [[conscientious objection|conscientious refusal]] to serve in the armed forces and to accept Nazi teachers. This community became known as the ''Alm Bruderhof''. Continuing pressure from the Nazi government caused others to move to England and found the ''[[Cotswold]] Bruderhof'' in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Christian Peace Experiment: The Bruderhof Community in Britain, 1933–1942|last=Randall|first=Ian M.|last2=Wright|first2=Nigel G.|date=March 14, 2018|publisher=Cascade Books|isbn=978-1-5326-3998-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 1937, secret police surrounded the Rhön Bruderhof, confiscated the property, and gave the remaining community members forty-eight hours to flee the country. By 1938, all the Bruderhof members had reassembled in England.

=== England (1937–1941) ===
[[File:Cotswold Bruderhof.jpg|thumb|Tea break at the Cotswold Bruderhof]]
[[File:Avila Star.jpg|thumb|Avila Star – one of the boats that transported the Bruderhof to Paraguay.]]
While in England, the population grew to over 350 members, largely through the addition of young English members seeking an alternative to war. Even before the outbreak of [[World War II]], the community's German members and its pacifist stance attracted deep suspicion locally resulting in economic boycotts. When confronted with the option of either having all German members interned, or leaving England as a group, the Bruderhof chose the latter, and began to look for refuge abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/07/does-anyone-know-how-we-can-entice-our-house-martins-back/|title=Does anyone know how we can entice our house martins back? {{!}} The Spectator|date=2018-07-07|work=The Spectator|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paraguay (1941–1961; 2010–present) ===
[[File:Bruderhof in Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Cattle Round-up in Paraguay]]
Soon after the United Kingdom entered the war, the Bruderhof emigrated to Paraguay—the only country that would accept a pacifist community of mixed nationalities. This move was assisted and facilitated by the [[Mennonite Central Committee]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Community"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levinson|first1=David|last2=Christensen|first2=Karen|title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 3|year=2003|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA, USA|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the hostile [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] region, the Bruderhof then relocated to eastern Paraguay where three settlements were founded on a large tract of land called Primavera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=No Lasting Home: A Year in the Paraguayan Wilderness|last=Barth|first=Emmy|publisher=Plough|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87486-945-3|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruderhof members founded a hospital for community members and local Paraguayans. The only clinic in the area, it served tens of thousands for the next two decades. By the early 1960s, the community in Paraguay had grown significantly and was attracting visitors from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/354360788/Community-in-Paraguay-A-Visit-to-the-Bruderhof|title=Community in Paraguay – A Visit to the Bruderhof {{!}} Skirt {{!}} Altar|website=Scribd|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, several leaders of the community came in conflict with a group of members over the community's trajectory. This group, which included the founder's wife Emmy Arnold, argued that the founder's vision was rooted in a pietistic faith in [[Jesus Christ]], not primarily in communitarian ideals. Eventually the church leadership, headed by the founder's son-in-law Hans Zumpe, banished the dissidents from the Bruderhof. Those who supported them were silenced, often with harsh discipline.

Eventually allowed back to join their families, the dissidents re-joined the community. One of them, Johann Heinrich Arnold, a son of Eberhard and Emmy Arnold, was sent with his family to the United States to raise funds and eventually started a new community called Woodcrest, in [[Rifton, New York]], in 1954. Over the following years, conflicts between Zumpe and Arnold continued, culminating in a crisis resulting in Zumpe being relieved of his leadership role by the community. Zumpe left the community in 1960 after revelations of personal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homage to a Broken Man|last=Mommsen|first=Peter|publisher=Plough|year=|isbn=978-0-87486-613-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members who supported Zumpe, and some who were confused by the turmoil, left or were asked to leave the community. Eventually, the communities in Paraguay were dissolved and the members who remained relocated to the United States. Many of those who left the community during the 1960s later returned, but some remained outside of the community and formed a group of critics of the Bruderhof. Their stories formed the basis for the 2000 book written by Julius Rubin, ''The Other Side of Joy: Religious Melancholy among the Bruderhof.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Julius H. Rubin: ''The Other Side of Joy: Religious Melancholy among the Bruderhof'', New York and Oxford, 2000, pages 132-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin himself never visited the Bruderhof.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In 2010, the Bruderhof opened the Villa Primavera Community in [[Asunción]], Paraguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/where-we-are#paraguay|title=Where We Are|website=Bruderhof|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States (1954–present) ===
In 1954, the Bruderhof started a settlement known as the Woodcrest Bruderhof in the United States near [[Rifton, New York|Rifton]] in upstate New York, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of American guests. Woodcrest absorbed the Macedonia Cooperative Community in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and many members of the Kingwood Community in [[New Jersey]]. Through the Macedonia Cooperative Community Woodcrest inherited the business Community Playthings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com – Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|access-date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional new communities were founded in [[Pennsylvania]] (1957) and [[Connecticut]] (1958).

In 1990, the Spring Valley Bruderhof was founded adjacent to the New Meadow Run Bruderhof in [[Farmington, Pennsylvania]]. As of September 2017, there are a total of 13 Bruderhof communities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/where-we-are#united-states|title=Where We Are|website=Bruderhof|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe (1971–present) ===
In 1971, the Bruderhof purchased a property in [[Robertsbridge]], East Sussex, United Kingdom called Darvell. The property had previously been a [[tuberculosis]] hospital. In 1995 a former sports college in [[Kent]] was purchased. In 2005, the Bruderhof started a small community in [[East London]].

In 2002, the Bruderhof purchased a house in Sannerz, Germany. This location is where the Bruderhof movement had originally started.

As of September 2017, there are three Bruderhof Communities in the United Kingdom and two in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/where-we-are|title=Where We Are|website=Bruderhof|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia (1999–present) ===
The Bruderhof opened a community in [[Elsmore, New South Wales]], Australia in 1999. In 2005, the Bruderhof opened a community in [[Inverell]], New South Wales, Australia, where they operate the sign-writing business Danthonia Designs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Also in 2005, the Bruderhof opened a community in [[Armidale]], New South Wales, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/where-we-are#australia|title=Where We Are|website=Bruderhof|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practice==
{{Anabaptist vertical}}
The Bruderhof is a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], [[evangelical Christian]] group, strongly influenced by radical [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] and [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Randall|first=Ian M.|date=October 1, 2014|title=Church Community is a Gift of the Holy Spirit - The Spirituality of the Bruderhof Community|ssrn=2536364|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eberhard Arnold drew inspiration from a number of historical streams including [[early Christianity]], the [[Anabaptists]], German [[Pietism]] and the [[German Youth Movement]]. [[Johann Blumhardt]] (1805–1880) and his son [[Christoph Blumhardt]] (1842–1919), both German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theologians, are important sources of Bruderhof piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/heritage/guides|title=Guides|website=Bruderhof|access-date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof practice [[Christian pacifism]] and therefore reject the practice of conscription, reflecting the early Anabaptist beliefs formulated in the [[Schleitheim Confession]].&lt;ref name="JonesRandall2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Keith G.|last2=Randall|first2=Ian M.|title=Counter-Cultural Communities: Baptistic Life in Twentieth-Century Europe|date=December 5, 2008|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers|isbn=9781606083161|page=310|quote=Through this action, the Bruderhof remained faithful to the early Anabaptist beliefs as described in The Schleitheim Confession, in particular through the refusal to accept obligatory military service in accordance with the confession's statement that 'the rule of the government is according to the flesh, that of the Christians according to Spirit'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof tries to follow the practices of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|first church in Jerusalem]] as related in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], for example [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:32–37: where the church members were of "one heart and mind, and shared all things in common". Bruderhof members do not hold private property, but rather share everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Bruderhof|title=What is the Bruderhof?|date=October 29, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ohC8cEcdOE|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Bruderhof member receives a salary or has a bank account. Income from all businesses is pooled and used for the care of all members and for various communal outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;The Bruderhof: ''Foundations of our Faith &amp; Calling''; The Bruderhof; The Plough Publishing House, Rifton, New York 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof practices adult baptism, which does not equate to membership. Membership is lifetime and by vows after the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of our Faith and Calling|last=|first=|publisher=Plough|year=2014|isbn=978-0-87486-888-3|location=|pages=29, 50|quote=In obedience to this commission, the church community offers baptism to every person who believes in the gospel of Jesus Christ and whose repentance comes from the heart, bearing fruit in deeds. In order to receive believer's baptism as instituted by Christ for the forgiveness of sins, a person must have reached the age of accountability.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruderhof also practices what they would call "The law of love" based on the house rule of the first Bruderhof in 1925:

{{Block quote|text=It is therefore out of the question for someone in our community to hold something against a brother or sister or to talk behind his or her back. Relationships within and to the church community are spiritual bonds based on trust and on the readiness to forgive again and again.|sign=|source=Foundations of our Faith and Calling}}

The Bruderhof believes marriage to be "the lifelong union between one man and one woman" and believes that sexual love should only be shared in such a marriage relationship.  They believe divorce and remarriage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foundations of our Faith and Calling|last=|first=|publisher=Plough|year=2014|isbn=978-0-87486-888-3|location=|pages=58–61|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bruderhof has been criticized by some for its position&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/our-faith/foundations/church-actions/marriage|title=Bruderhof Marriage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on homosexuality, and for its support of the [[Nashville Statement]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheBruderhof/|title=Bruderhof Facebook page|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has supported and run marriage events to promote marriage between one man and one woman both in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eden.co.uk/blog/marriage-event-will-be-live-streamed-p1380|title=Marriage event in London|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruderhof also participated in Humanum, a conference held in the Vatican from November 17–19, 2014 and attended by [[Pope Francis]] to discuss the complementarity of man and woman.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faith.org.uk/article/man-woman-and-family-convergence-among-faiths|title=Man, Woman and Family: Convergence Among Faiths|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Anabaptist doctrine of [[nonconformity to the world]], the Bruderhof wear [[plain dress]], with women donning [[Christian headcovering]]s in accordance with their interpretation of [[1 Corinthians]] in the [[Christian Bible]].&lt;ref name="Bronner2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronner|first=Simon J|title=Encyclopedia of American Folklife|date=March 4, 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317471950|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day life==
[[File:Caring for Others.jpg|thumb|Bruderhof members by the sea]]
Most communities have a nursery, [[kindergarten]], school, communal kitchen, laundry, various workshops, and offices. Bruderhof life is built around the family, though there are also many single members. Children are an important part of each community and participate in most communal gatherings. Disabled and elderly members are loved and cared for within the community and participate in daily life and work as much as they are able.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/life-among-the-bruderhof/|title=Life Among The Bruderhof|work=The American Conservative|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof eats one meal together each day as a community.  Other meals are eaten in families. Singing is a very common form of worship in the community, and members often sing before meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/bruderhof|title=Bruderhof Communities|website=SoundCloud|access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruderhof do not prohibit the consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
The Bruderhof has a reserved attitude to the use of technology.  Bruderhof families do not watch television or use the internet at home, but some do use smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Has-anyone-had-experience-with-the-Bruderhof-community|title=Has anyone had experience with the Bruderhof community? - Quora|website=www.quora.com|access-date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Amish however, they own and drive cars and run modern businesses and factories.  The Bruderhof was an early adopter of the internet, registering the domain bruderhof.com in 1996 and using it to publish information about the Bruderhof and to publish e-books.  They shut down their websites in 2005, but brought them back online in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://revscottwells.com/2006/01/09/bruderhof-update/|title=Bruderhof update|last=Wells|first=Rev Scott|date=January 10, 2006|website=Rev. Scott Wells|access-date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They now run two main websites (bruderhof.com and plough.com) and several social media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheBruderhof|title=The Bruderhof (@TheBruderhof) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/bruderhofcommunities/|title=Bruderhof (@bruderhofcommunities) • Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com|access-date=July 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their members run video blogs that document their life on the Bruderhof that are published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/BruderhofCommunities|title=Bruderhof|website=YouTube|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
The Bruderhof runs schools for the children on each community, up to the age of 18. From there, young people go onto further education at university or do a practical training. They do not automatically become members, and many are encouraged to leave the community and live elsewhere before deciding on their own whether or not to join the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/life-in-community/education|title=Education|website=Bruderhof|access-date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people who leave the community are not cut-off from their families within the Bruderhof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/local-politics-not-trump_us_5b2ffa3de4b00295f15dd23b|title=Local Politics, Not Trump, Dominate In Key New York Swing District|last=Marans|first=Daniel|date=June 25, 2018|work=Huffington Post|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses==
The Bruderhof run a variety of businesses that provide income to run their communities and provide common work for the members who almost all work onsite.

Community Playthings was developed during the 1950s and soon became the Bruderhof's main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=Community Playthings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community Playthings designs and manufactures quality wooden classroom and play environments for schools and daycare centers.

== Involvement in the wider community ==
The Bruderhof is actively involved in the neighborhoods that surround its communities&lt;ref name="ppg1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20000721crusade7.asp|title=Bruderhof youth festival readied|date=July 21, 2000|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|author=Steve Levin|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the world at large. The Bruderhof sees justice and the works of mercy as a gospel command.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They foster many ecumenical relationships with other churches and denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://robertbuck.blog/2017/10/23/why-i-keep-talking-about-alternativity-the-bruderhof-and-church-of-all-nations/|title=Why I Keep Talking About…Alternativity, the Bruderhof, and Church of All Nations|date=October 23, 2017|work=Proximity|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruderhof members serve on school boards, volunteer at soup kitchens, prisons and hospitals, and work with local social service agencies such as the police to provide food and shelter for those in need of help. They are active supporters of various international aid organisations, such as [[Oxfam]], [[Save the Children]], [[Tearfund]] and [[World Vision International|World Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bruderhof.com/en/reaching-out/common-causes|title=Bruderhof Common Causes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6229539/k.523C/Strategic_Foundation_Partnerships.htm|title=Save the Children Strategic Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof's [[Plough Publishing House]] publishes books and a magazine called "Plough Quarterly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/alien-citizens|title=Alien Citizens {{!}} The University of Chicago Divinity School|website=divinity.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plough'' publishes spiritual classics, inspirational books, and children's books, some of which are available as free downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plough.com/en/about-us|title=Plough.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the books are written by Bruderhof members, but others are not.

In response to the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in 1999, the Bruderhof created a program of school assemblies that have now reached tens of thousands of youths in the United States and United Kingdom. Operating under the name "Breaking the Cycle", speakers with forgiveness stories speak to children at school assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.breakingthecycle.com/|title=Breaking the Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruderhof community has at various times campaigned on social issues, such as the [[death penalty]] and the [[Iraq War]]. They were involved in the campaign in opposition to the death sentence for the activist [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a Philadelphia police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/1995/november13/5td074.html|title=A Christian Community Makes Waves, Not War|author=Andres Tapia and Rudy Carrasco|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=June 21, 2007|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bruderhof and the Hutterites ==
The Bruderhof Communities and the traditional [[Hutterite]]s were in fellowship between 1930 and 1955 and between 1974 and 1990. In 1990, the [[Lehrerleut]] and the [[Dariusleut]] withdrew, while the [[Schmiedeleut]] maintained their bond to the Bruderhof. After the split among the Schmiedeleut in 1992, the more traditional group also withdrew, while the more progressive branch (led by Jacob Kleinsasser) kept the bond until 1995. Since then, the traditional Hutterites and the Bruderhof have been separate groups.&lt;ref name="Rod Janzen 2005 pages 505-544"&gt;Rod Janzen: ''The Hutterites and the Bruderhof: The Relationship Between an Old Older Religious Society and a Twentieth-Century Communal Group'' in Mennonite Quarterly Review 79 (2005), pages 505-544.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the withdrawal of the Hutterites in 1955 was a conflict about the Forest River Hutterite Colony, which joined the Bruderhof by a majority vote. In 1974 there was reconciliation between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Mow: ''Torches rekindled: the Bruderhof's struggle for renewal'', Ulster Park, NY, 1989, page 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 two of the three branches of the traditional Hutterites withdrew over concerns in regard to education, worship services and relations with outsiders.

According to Rod Janzen, there are differences between the traditional Hutterites and the Bruderhof Communities on many fields. Besides cultural differences, there are differences in regard to education, leadership, decision making, [[church discipline]], [[ecumenism]], what constitutes the "Word of God" etc. All these differences led to the final break in 1995.&lt;ref name="Rod Janzen 2005 pages 505-544" /&gt;

Buddhism is the second largest religion in [[Malaysia]], after [[Islam]], with 19.2% of Malaysia's population being Buddhist although some estimates put that figure up to 21.6% when combined with Chinese religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/my.html | title = The World Factbook: Malaysia | work = CIA World Factbook | accessdate = 2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Buddhism in Malaysia''' is mainly practised by the ethnic [[Malaysian Chinese]], but there are also [[Malaysian Siamese]], [[Sri Lankans in Malaysia|Malaysian Sri Lankans]] and [[Burmese in Malaysia]] that practice Buddhism such as [[Ananda Krishnan]] and [[K. Sri Dhammananda]] and a sizeable population of [[Malaysian Indian]]s.

==History==
[[File:Muzium Negara KL1.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Standing Buddha statue made from brass, found in a tin mine in Pengkalan Pegoh, Ipoh, Perak in 1931.]]

Buddhism was introduced by the Indians to the Malay Archipelago. [[China|Chinese]] written sources indicated that some 30 small Indianised states rose and fell in the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Buddhism began when [[Demographics of India|Indian]] traders and priests traveling the [[Ocean|maritime]] routes and brought with them Indian concepts of religion, government, and the arts. For many centuries the peoples of the region, especially the royal courts, synthesised Indian and indigenous ideas including [[Hinduism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and that shaped their political and cultural patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/early.htm |title=Early Malay Kingdoms |website=Sabrizain.org |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Malay [[Kedah Kingdom]] denounced Indian religion after the king of [[Chola]] from [[Tamil Nadu]] attacked them in the early 11th century. The king of [[Kedah]], [[Phra Ong Mahawangsa]], was the first Malay ruler to denounce the traditional Indian religion; he converted to [[Islam]], and in the 15th century, during the golden age of the [[Malacca Sultanate]], the majority of Malays converted to Islam.

According to the Malaysian constitution, the majority ethnic group, the [[Malay people|Malays]], are legally defined as Muslim. They constitute 60% of the population, with the remainder consisting mostly of [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]], who are generally Buddhists or Christians, and to the lesser extent [[India]]ns, who are generally Hindus. There are also smaller numbers of other indigenous and immigrants; among the latter are Malaysians of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]], [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]], and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] origin. Nearly all of the Buddhists in Malaysia live in urban areas, since they are mostly engaged in business or employed in various professions.

Recently, a number of Malaysian Buddhist leaders have responded to the decline in religious participation by the children of Buddhist families, have attempted to reformulate their message to address modern life more directly. Groups involved in these education efforts include the [[Buddhist Missionary Society]]. Missionary Society leaders have argued that, while many educated youths seek an intellectual approach to Buddhism, an equally large number of people prefer to approach the religion through the tradition of ceremony and symbolism. In response to these needs, religious practices are carried out, but in a way that is simple and dignified, removing what can be seen as superstition. Efforts are made to explain why sutras are chanted, lamps lit, flowers offered, and so on.

As a religion without a supreme head to direct its development, Buddhism is practised in various forms, which, although rarely in open conflict, can sometimes lead to confusion among Buddhists. In Malaysia, some ecumenical moves have been made to coordinate the activities of different types of Buddhists. One example is the formation of the Joint Wesak Celebrations Committee of the temples in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Selangor]], which coordinates the celebration of [[Wesak]], a holiday commemorating the birth of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. An initiative has also begun to form a Malaysian Buddhist Council, representing the various sects of Buddhism in the country to extend the work of the development of Buddhism, especially in giving contemporary relevance to the practise of the religion, as well as to promote solidarity among Buddhists in general.

In 2013, a video of a group of [[Buddhist]] practitioners from [[Singapore]] conducting religious ceremonies in a [[surau]] had become viral on [[Facebook]].  Malaysian police have arrested a resort owner after he allowed 13 Buddhists to use a Muslim prayer room (surau) for their meditation at  [[Kota Tinggi]], [[Johor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSBtJ1_mdk/ |title=S'porean held in Malaysia after Buddhists use Muslim prayer room  |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been a frown upon Muslims in [[Malaysia]]. It has also become a hot topic in the social media. Following up at 28 August 2013, the controversial prayer room was demolished by the resort management within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice after much protests by the residents of [[Kota Tinggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2013/08/28/surau-kota-tinggi-demolished/ |title=Surau in Kota Tinggi resort demolished  |last= |first= |publisher=The Star Online |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2013&amp;dt=0829&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Negara&amp;pg=ne_01.htm#ixzz2dJsAleEv/ |title=Surau kontroversi diroboh(Malay)  |last= |first= |publisher=Kosmo! |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Syed Ahmad Salim, the resort owner explained that he had allowed the group of Buddhists to use the surau for a [[meditation]] session as he was unaware that it was an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/one-year-after-surau-controversy-normalcy-returns-to-johor-resort/|title=One year after surau controversy, normalcy returns to Johor resort|last=|first=|publisher=Kosmo!|date=23 October 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024051619/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/one-year-after-surau-controversy-normalcy-returns-to-johor-resort|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of Buddhists==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150301154300/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/census2010/Taburan_Penduduk_dan_Ciri-ciri_Asas_Demografi.pdf 2010 Census], 5,620,483 people or 19.8% of the population identify themselves as Buddhists. Most Chinese Malaysian follow a combination of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[ancestor-worship]] but, when pressed to specify their religion, will identify themselves as Buddhists. As a result, 83.6% of all the Chinese Malaysian self-identifying as Buddhist. Information collected in the census based on respondent's answer and did not refer to any official document.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8829">The archiepiscopal see of '''Caesarea in Palaestina''', also known as [[Caesarea Maritima]], is now a [[metropolitan see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] and also a [[titular see]] of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), "Sedi titolari", p. 867&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was one of the earliest Christian bishoprics, and was a metropolitan see at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea]], but was later subjected to the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. The city remained largely Christian until the [[Crusades]], its bishop maintaining close ties to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. After the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by the Crusaders, the see was transformed into a [[Latin Church|Latin]] archdiocese, subordinate to the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]].

==History==
The [[diocese]] was an ancient one, established in [[Early centers of Christianity|one of the first Christian communities ever created]]: it was due to the work of [[St Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|St Paul]]. Records of the community are dated as far back as the 2nd century. According to the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] (7.46), the first ''Bishop of Caesarea'' was [[Zacchaeus|Zacchaeus the Publican]]. [[Caesarea Maritima]] was the capital of Roman [[Iudaea province]] and after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] it was the metropolis of the diocese of [[Palaestina Prima]]. Until the establishment of the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], it was subject to the [[Patriarch of Antioch]]. The most notable Bishop of Caesarea was [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], also known as Eusebius Pamphili. The [[Library of Caesarea Maritima|notable theological library]] established by [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] remained in existence until the Arabs [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|invaded Palestine]] in the 7th century.

The diocese suffered a troubled history following the decline of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 7th century. The city was raided by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns in the early 7th century.  Following the conquest of the Holy Land by the Islamic armies in the 630s, the diocese and city suffered tremendously and steadily declined in size and importance. It was finally conquered in 640 following a protracted siege.

Nonetheless, it remained overwhelmingly Christian, and in the absence of imperial oversight, its independence increased and the archbishop became the effective ruler of the area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} 
By the 9th century there was a substantial colony of Frankish settlers established by [[Charlemagne|Emperor Charlemagne]] to facilitate Latin [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimages]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--It seems you are talking about the former province of Syria Palestina in general, and not about the city of Caesarea in particular? Sources?--&gt; 
However, by the 10th century, as periodic Islamic persecution continued and the aura of Byzantine Imperial authority made a resurgence, the diocese fell under the influence of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] for protection and supervision and increasingly fell under Byzantine authority.

St [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] devoted his life to searching out and obtaining ancient texts which he collected in the famous [[Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima]] that [[Jerome]] was later to use, and established a school for theological study.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], "[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]," VII.xxxii.25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[scriptorium]], a necessary adjunct to all libraries of [[ancient history|antiquity]], he oversaw the production of accurate edited copies of [[Scripture]]. Testimonies to his zeal and care in this work are to be found in the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s of biblical manuscripts. Jerome's ''"[[De Viris Illustribus]]"'' (75) says that Pamphilus ''"transcribed the greater part of the works of Origen of Alexandria with his own hand,"'' and that ''"these are still preserved in the library of Cæsarea."''  The collections of the library suffered during the persecutions under the Emperor [[Diocletian]], but were repaired subsequently by bishops of Caesarea.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, "Epistles" xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted in the 6th century, but [[Henry Barclay Swete]]&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'', pp 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; was of the opinion that it probably did not long survive the capture of Caesarea by the [[Saracens]] in 638, though a modern historian would attribute more destruction to its previous capture by the [[Sassanid]] [[Persia]]ns.

Following the [[Eastern Schism|schism]] between [[Constantinople]] and [[Rome]] in 1054, the community was a [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] diocese, with only a marginal [[Roman Catholic]] community.

During the crusader period, the community became a Catholic community in 1101. The Frankish community vastly increased in size and a Latin archbishop was established.  Under the crusaders, the diocese increased over time to having ten suffragan bishops, including the bishop of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastea]]. During the remainder of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] often served first as archbishop of Caesarea, or [[archbishop of Tyre|of Tyre]].

There was a legend that the [[Holy Grail]] had been discovered in Caesarea; the ancient chalice found there in 1101 was later taken to [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L. (1957) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. London: Oxford University Press; p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975, Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of [[Caesarea]] is Basilios Blatsos, who is also an Exarch of Palaestina Prima, under the jurisdiction of the [[Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem]].

==Bishops of Caesarea==

'''Dafydd ap Bleddyn''' (died 1346) was the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Catholic Bishop of [[St. Asaph]] in Wales from 1315 to 1346, succeeding Llywelyn ap Llywelyn.

Ap Bleddyn is thought to be a descendent of the 'tribe of [[Hafod Uchtryd|Uchtryd']]. His time as bishop is thought to have been relatively uneventful, and records suggest that he remained mainly within the diocese. He is known to have attended the [[consecration]] of Roger of Lichfield at [[Halesowen]] in [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in June 1322.

Ap Bleddyn died in 1346, when he was succeeded by John Trevor.

A '''definitor''' is, in Latin, he who defines. In the [[Catholic Church]], however, this is a title with different specific uses. There are secular definitors, who have a limited amount of oversight over a part of a [[diocese]]. There are also definitors in [[religious order]]s who generally provide counsel and assistance to the [[superior general|superiors general]] and [[provincial superior]]s of their order.

==Secular definitors==

In a [[deanery]] or vicarate forane, which is a grouping of several neighboring parishes within a [[diocese]], a definitor is either the second (and unique) highest office, immediately below the [[Dean (religion)|dean]] or [[vicar forane]] and his deputy, or is the [[priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] in charge of any of a number of even smaller districts within the deanery, called ''definitio''. They oversee the ecclesiastical property and generally assist the dean, under the ordinary authority of the [[bishop]]. Alternative titles for this position are [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] or [[treasurer]]. These diocesan offices are not prescribed by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], and can be omitted.

==Regular definitors==

In the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]], the [[Abbot]] General is assisted by a council of five definitors, traditionally two French-speaking, one German-speaking, one English-speaking and one Dutch-speaking. Among the Franciscan Observants, the Definitor is the third highest office of the Order, below the [[Minister General]] and [[Procurator (Catholic Church)|Procurator General]]. In the [[Camaldolese]] Order, Definitor may be given as the personal title of a [[prior]]. In the [[Dominican Order]] a Provincial Definitor serves under the [[Provincial Superior|Prior Provincial]].

The title Definitor General is used by the [[Discalced Carmelites]], the Friars Minor and the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. These officers are generally elected by the [[General Chapter]] of their Orders for a specified period of time.

A '''Dhamma Practitioner''' is a name that is used to describe those who practice the teachings of the Buddha. It is used as an alternative to the widely used but vaguely defined term ''[[Buddhist]]''. Dhamma practitioner is seen by many as a more accurate description for those who practice the Buddha's teachings, and more fitting with classification schemes given in the [[Pali Canon]]. In contrast, the terms ''Buddhist'' and ''[[Buddhism]]'' are relatively recent inventions that some see as a Westernized framing of the teachings of the Buddha in terms fitting for religions such as Christianity, and not words that have an equivalent in the teachings of the Buddha. In the earliest sources, the Buddha himself referred to his teaching as the "[[Dhamma]] and Discipline proclaimed by the [[Tathagata]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5YfHBF10aoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA789&amp;lpg=RA2-PA789&amp;dq=dhamma+and+discipline+tathagata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HECih5APG8&amp;sig=32u4_nMASneMC4Ev7jIeKCVGHXg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=d5aKSr74Jt22jAfo1IRb&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Esukari Sutta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these reasons and the fact that the Buddha's teachings are strongly rooted in practical application, the term Dhamma Practitioner has been used by many teachers as a description of those on the Buddha's path.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Opening_Dhamma_Eye1.php "So the Dhamma practitioner must become one who witnesses the Dhamma for himself."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imisangha.org/articles/Be_A_Professional_Dharma_Practitioner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional classification schemes for those on the Buddha's path==

===The seven types of individuals===
In the Pali Canon, several suttas record a scheme of classification to denote those on the Buddha's path, classed as 'the seven types of individuals', differentiated by the degree to which they have attained liberation and the means by which they have achieved this end. One such scheme is recorded in the Kitagiri Sutta (MN 70) &lt;ref name="Kitagiri sutta"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.070.than.html|title=Kitagiri sutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/2Majjhima-Nikaya/Majjhima2/070-kitagiri-e1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Monks, there are these seven individuals to be found in the world. Which seven? One [released] both ways, one released through discernment, a bodily witness, one attained to view, one released through conviction, a Dhamma-follower, and a conviction-follower.|Kitagiri Sutta}}

The Buddha elaborated on each one as follows:

The first two are references to [[Arahants]], those who have completed the Buddha's teachings and attained enlightenment. [[Arahants]] who have mastered the formless attainments are known as "liberated both ways", whilst those who have not attained the formless dimensions are called "released through discernment". 
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, and—having seen with discernment—his fetters are ended. This is called an individual [released] both ways.}}
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, but—having seen with discernment—his fetters are ended. This is called an individual who is released through discernment.}}

Those who have become a [[stream-enterer]] and also abide in the meditative formless dimensions are known as "bodily witness".
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual remains touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, and—having seen with discernment—some of his fetters are ended. This is called an individual who is a bodily witness.}}

Those who have become a [[stream-enterer]] but have not attained the meditative formless dimensions are known respectively as "attained to view" and "released through conviction", depending on the way in which they developed the path.
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, but—having seen with discernment—some of his fetters are ended, and he has reviewed and examined with discernment the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata. This is called an individual who is attained to view.}}
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, but—having seen with discernment—some of his fetters are ended, and his conviction in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, and established. This is called an individual who is released through conviction.}}

Finally those who are yet to become a [[stream-enterer]] but are still on the path are known as a "Dhamma-follower" and a "Conviction-follower", depending on whether the faculty of widom or the faculty of faith is strongest.
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, nor—having seen with discernment—are his fetters ended. But with a [sufficient] measure of reflection through discernment he has come to an agreement with the teachings proclaimed by the Tathagata. And he has these qualities: the faculty of conviction, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of discernment. This is called an individual who is a Dhamma-follower.}}
*{{quote|There is the case where a certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful liberations that transcend form, that are formless, nor—having seen with discernment—are his fetters ended. But he has a [sufficient] measure of conviction in and love for the Tathagata. And he has these qualities: the faculty of conviction, the faculty of persistence, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, &amp; the faculty of discernment. This is called an individual who is a conviction-follower.|Kitagiri sutta}}

===The eight types of individuals===
Another classification scheme found in the Pali Canon is that based on the four stages of enlightenment, often broken down into "the eight types of individuals".

{{quote|This Doctrine and Discipline is the abode of such mighty beings as stream-winners and those practicing to realize the fruit of stream-entry; once-returners and those practicing to realize the fruit of once-returning; non-returners and those practicing to realize the fruit of non-returning; arahants and those practicing for arahantship.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That is the four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs:
# the path of one practicing for the fruit of stream-entry
# the fruition of stream-entry
# the path of one practicing for the fruit of once-returning
# the fruition of once-returning
# the path of one practicing for the fruit of non-returning
# the fruition of non-returning
# the path of one practicing for the fruit of arahantship
# the fruition of arahantship.

Taking each attainment singly gives the "eight types of individual."&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;

The '''Divine Light Mission''' (''Divya Sandesh Parishad''; '''DLM''') was an organization founded in 1960 by [[guru]] [[Hans Ji Maharaj]] for his following in northern India. During the 1970s, the DLM gained prominence in the [[Western world|West]] under the leadership of his fourth and youngest son ([[Prem Rawat]]). Some scholars noted the influence of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Sant Mat]] tradition, but the western movement was widely seen as a [[new religious movement]], a [[cult]], a charismatic [[religious sect]] or an alternative religion. DLM officials said the movement represented a church rather than a religion.&lt;ref&gt;"Miami's startled elite wish the guru, in short, a pleasant stay", By Barry Bearak, Knight-Ridder Service, 30 July 1977. INDEPENDENT PRESS TELEGRAM (Long Beach, CA) A-11 "ACCORDING to Anctil and mission president Bill Patterson, they represent a church rather than a religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

When Shri Hans Ji Maharaj died in 1966, he was succeeded as guru by Prem Rawat, then just eight years old, despite rival claims from other family members. Although Prem Rawat was accepted as his father's successor, because of his age his family retained effective control of the DLM. In 1971, Rawat defied his mother by travelling to the UK and the US, where local branches of DLM were established and rapidly expanded. By 1973, DLM had over a million followers in India and tens of thousands of followers in the West, along with dozens of [[ashram]]s and hundreds of centers.&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As Rawat grew older, he began to take a more active role in the movement and, when he turned sixteen, following the financially disastrous [[Millennium '73]] festival, he took administrative control of the US branch. His increasing independence and his marriage to a non-Indian in 1974, caused a permanent rift with his mother and two of his brothers; Satpal Ji Maharaj and Bhole Ji Maharaj. They returned to India, where his eldest brother [[Satpal Maharaj]] took over the control of the Indian DLM.

In the early 1980s, Rawat began disbanding the western DLM. He closed the ashrams and eliminated the remaining Indian influences from his presentation to make it independent of any specific culture or religion. In the US, UK, France and Australia, [[Elan Vital (organization)|Elan Vital]] was formed to replace the DLM in supporting Rawat in his role as teacher.

==History==

===Founding and early years in India===
{{details|Hans Ji Maharaj#Succession}}
[[Hans Ji Maharaj|Shri Hans Maharaj Ji]], initiated by the [[Sant Mat]] guru Sri [[Swarupanand Ji]], began teaching in the [[Sind province|Sind]] and [[Lahore]] provinces of India in the 1930s. In 1950 he began initiating ''[[Mahatmas]]'', followers who could themselves initiate devotees, and formed a magazine called "Hansadesh" which is still active in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1992), pp. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 in the city of [[Patna]], he founded the Divine Light Mission (''Divya Sandesh Parishad'') to organize followers across Northern India. At the time of his death on 19 July 1966, the Divine Light Mission had six million members in India.&lt;ref&gt;"Whatever Happened to Guru Maharaj Ji? ", Hinduism Today Magazine, October 1983 [http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1983/10/1983-10-06.shtml Available Online] (Retrieved March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the customary 13 days of mourning, his mother and senior officials of the organization discussed the succession. Prem Rawat, who was 8 years-old at the time, addressed the crowd and was accepted by them as their teacher and "[[Sant Mat#The Sants|Perfect Master]]" and was named as Bal Bhagwan.&lt;ref&gt;Aagaard (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Department of the Army (2001), pp.1-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch et al. (1998), p. 861&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of his age, effective control of the DLM was shared by the whole family.&lt;ref name="Melton 1986, pp.141-2"&gt;Melton (1986), pp.141-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Footprints===

In 1971, Rawat, then known as Guru Maharaji Ji, travelled to the West against his mother's wish &amp; will.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Lewis (1998), p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; DLM was established in the U.S. and the U.K. The U.S. branch was headquartered in [[Denver, Colorado]]. It was registered there as a non-profit corporation and in 1974 was recognized as a church by the United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] under section 501(c)(3).&lt;ref name="Hunt 2003, pp.116-7"&gt;Hunt (2003), pp.116-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=amex&amp;ein=23-7174539#rptlink1 |title=American Express Search - ELAN VITAL INC |publisher=GuideStar |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1972 DLM was operating in North and South America, Europe and Australia. By 1973, DLM was operating in 37 countries, tens of thousands of people had been initiated (become premies) and several hundred centers and dozens of ashrams formed in the U.S. and the U.K. DLM said it had 8,000 devotees and forty ashrams at that time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Oz in the Astrodome; Middle-class premies find Guru.

In the United States, the staff at the headquarters grew to 125, and [[Teletypewriter message|Telexes]] connected the headquarters with the ashrams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;"Indian Shrewdness Plus American Merchandising Equals Guru", BETTY FLYNN ''Chicago Daily News''&lt;/ref&gt; Social service facilities, including a medical clinic in New York City, were opened. A Women's Spiritual Right Organization dedicated to reaching out to persons in prisons, mental institutions and hospitals, was organized.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Melton (1986), pp. 141-145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976), pp. 52-72&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. DLM published two periodicals: ''And It Is Divine'' (''AIID''), a monthly magazine with a circulation of 90,000; and ''Divine Times'', a biweekly newspaper with a circulation of 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Snowballing Movement Centers On Teen-Age Guru From India", AP, ''THE LAWTON CONSTITUTION-MORNING PRESS'', Sunday, 29 July 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The cover price of ''AIID'' was $1 but most were given away free, as were the advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The World Peace Corps (WPC) was established as a security force to provide protection for Rawat. After Bob Mishler, the DLM President, was removed from power he said that Rawat got the idea to start a bodyguard unit after watching ''The Godfather''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=UPI|author-link=United Press International|title=Maharaj Ji has Jones-like traits|periodical=Chronicle-Telegram|location=Elyria|page=A–3|date=25 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WPC became the organizing agent of meetings and businesses.&lt;ref name="Price 1979"/&gt; A variety of businesses were founded under US DLM auspices including laundromats, used clothing stores, a plane charter agency ("Divine Travel Services"), a repair service, and the "Cleanliness-is-Next-to-Godliness" janitorial service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Guru's 17th birthday observed", KENNETH T. WALSH Associated Press, ''GREELEY (Colo.) TRIBUNE'' 11 December 1974 p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detroit incident===
&lt;div id="Pat Halley beating" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;On 8 August 1973, while Rawat was at the Detroit City Hall to receive a testimonial resolution praising his work, Pat Halley, who was at the time a reporter from Detroit's underground periodical ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', slapped him in the face with a shaving cream pie.&lt;ref&gt;"Guru Gets Testimonial And Some Pie in Face", "New York Times", 8 August 1973 Page 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"15-Year Old Guru Slapped in Face by Shaving Cream Pie", UPI, ''Los Angeles Times'', 8 August 1973; pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Rawat responded by saying that he did not want his attacker arrested or hurt, but the reporter was attacked by two men a few days later and seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;A-6 Independent (AM) Press-Telegram (PM) Long Beach, Calif., Wed., 8 August 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1992), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; When local members heard of the incident they notified Rawat in Los Angeles who extended his regrets and condolences to Pat Halley's family, and requested that the DLM conduct a full investigation. The assailants, one of them an Indian mahatma, were identified. They admitted their part in the incident and offered to turn themselves in. The Chicago police were immediately notified.&lt;ref&gt;Page 2 - Section B – Sun News – Las Cruces, New Mexico - Wednesday, 22 August 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Detroit police declined to initiate extradition proceedings, variously claiming that they were unable to locate the assailants, or that the cost of extraditing them from Chicago to Detroit made it impractical. The arrest warrant remained outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;I See The Light, by Ken Kelley, Penthouse (July 1974), page 98-100, 137-138, 146, 148, &amp; 150-151.&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of action by the Detroit police was attributed by some to Halley's radical politics. A spokesman later stated that the Indian national had been "shipped off to Europe".&lt;ref&gt;"Get Your Red-Hot Panaceas!", Ken Kelley, ''New York Times'', 19 January 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festivals===
[[Festival]]s were a regular part of the Divine Light Mission's activities and a source of revenue. Members would pay from $50 to $100 to attend, and [[Darśana|Darshan]] events would generate considerable donations.&lt;ref&gt;"Financing the New Religions: Comparative and Theoretical Considerations" JAMES T. RICHARDSON p.259&lt;/ref&gt; The DLM celebrated three main festivals: Holi, which is celebrated in late March or early April; Guru Puja, which was held in July; and Hans Jayanti, which falls in November.&lt;ref&gt;435 A.2d 1368. Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. Mark A. ''DOTTER v. MAINE EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMISSION''. Argued 2 March 1981. Decided 19 October 1981. [[s:Dotter v. Maine Employment Sec. Commission 435 A.2d 1368]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Jayanti marks the birthday of the DLM's founder.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter (1999), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marc Galanter (MD)|Marc Galanter]], the members at a festival in Orlando, Florida "looked as though they had been drawn from the graduate campus of a large university&amp;mdash;bright, not too carefully groomed, casually dressed. They were lively, good-tempered, and committed to their mutual effort. There was no idleness, brashness, marijuana, beer, loud music, or flirtation&amp;mdash;all hallmarks of a more typical assembly of people in their twenties".&lt;ref&gt;Galanter (1999), pp. 22-28&lt;/ref&gt; Other festivals were held nationally and locally, and sometimes organized with little advance notice. Attending as many as ten festivals a year meant many members were unable to hold regular full-time jobs, and required sacrificing leisure and community activities in order to devote time to earning the money needed to attend.&lt;ref&gt;DuPertuis (1986), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, seven [[Boeing 747|jumbo jet]]s were chartered to bring members from the U.S. and other countries to the Hans Jayanti festival held at the main ashram near [[New Delhi]]. 2500 foreign members camped out at the mission's "city of love" for a month.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;"Some feel the youth is fraud" Long Beach, Calif., Sun., 19 December 1972 ''INDEPENDENT, PRESS-TELEGRAM'' A-27&lt;/ref&gt;  The event attracted a reported total of 500,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;"Guru's Pupil Slates Talk", SYRACUSE POST-STANDARD'' 3 February 1973. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When Rawat flew to India to attend, he was accused of attempting to smuggle $65,000 worth of cash and jewelry into the country, but no charges were ever filed.&lt;ref name="CBY1974"&gt;Moritz, (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Indian government later issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), pp. 187-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mini-Guru: Discourse on Maharaj Ji is scheduled in Wiesbaden" J. KING CRUGER, 3 February 1973 ''THE STARS AND STRIPES'' Page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation led to negative coverage in the Indian press and hard feelings between Rawat and his mother, who had persuaded him to return to India for the festival.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In June 1973, the British DLM, with Prem Rawat's mother acting on behalf of her son, organized the "Festival of Love" at the [[Alexandra Palace]] in London. While it drew thousands of attendees, Rawat began receiving hostile press coverage, partly due to his showing up late, or not at all, at scheduled appearances. The large membership had grown up very rapidly but the organizers had no clear idea where to lead the following, nor did they have the financial resources to maintain so many full-time workers.&lt;ref name="Price 1979"/&gt;

====Millennium '73====
{{main|Millennium '73}}
The 1973 Hans Jayanti festival was held at the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston, Texas]], and publicized as "Millennium '73".&lt;ref&gt;"Under the Astrodome: Maharaj Ji – The Selling of a Guru", Gregg Kilday, Los Angeles Times, 13 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The free three-day event was billed as "the most significant event in human history" that would herald "a thousand years of peace for people who want peace", the idea being that peace would come to the world as individuals experienced inner peace.&lt;ref name = "nytmillennium" /&gt; To promote the event, Prem Rawat's 20-year-old brother, Bhole Ji Rawat toured with a 60-piece band, "Blue Aquarius" for two weeks giving free concerts.&lt;ref&gt;"'Round and About" ''The Vidville Messenger''. Valparaiso, Indiana, 25 October 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The 500-member tour was dubbed "Soul Rush" and traveled to seven cities on the way to Houston.&lt;ref&gt;Collier (1978), p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rennie Davis]], well known as one of the defendants in the [[Chicago Seven]] trial, attracted extensive media coverage as a spokesperson for Rawat.&lt;ref name="tvmeditating"&gt;"TV: Meditating on a Young Guru and His Followers", by John O'Connor, New York Times, 25 February 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytoz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Houston's Version of Peace in Our Time" GREGG KILDAY, Los Angeles Times 25 November 1973 p. S18&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, Davis declared that "All I can say is, honestly, very soon now, every single human being will know the one who was waited for by every religion of all times has actually come."&lt;ref name="Kent 2001, p. 52"&gt;Kent (2001), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[press conference]] at Millennium, Rawat denied being the Messiah, and when asked by reporters about the contradictions between what he said about himself and what his followers said about him, Rawat replied, "Why don't you do me a favor&amp;nbsp;... why don't you go to the devotees and ask their explanation about it?"&lt;ref&gt;Rolling Stone Magazine Issue N°156 - 14 March 1974 (Page 36-50)&lt;/ref&gt; While Rawat's brother Satpal was nominally in charge of the festival, Davis was the "General Coordinator" and handled the details.&lt;ref name="Collier 1978"&gt;Collier (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectations for the event were very high, with predictions that it would attract more than 100,000,&lt;ref&gt;"A LOOK BACK AT THE '70S" HENRY ALLEN, Los Angeles Times 16 December 1979; p. K30&lt;/ref&gt; or even as many as 400,000 people from Satpal. Davis privately said he thought 22,000 was a more realistic estimate and reserved 22,000 hotel beds.&lt;ref&gt;Collier (1978), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; There was even talk about a space in the parking lot reserved for a flying saucer to land.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Kent (2001), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; When Satpal heard about the flying saucer he said, "If you see any, just give them some of our literature".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
The actual attendance was estimated at 35,000, and at 10,000 by police.&lt;ref name = "nytmillennium" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foss &amp; Larkin (1978), pp. 157-164 "in fact attended by a maximum of 35,000&lt;/ref&gt;

The event featured spectacular staging, a 56-piece rock band and a giant video screen that showed a barrage of shots from the tumultuous 1960s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "nytmillennium"&gt;“Guru's Followers Cheer 'Millennium' in Festivities in Astrodome", by Eleanor Blau, New York Times, 12 November 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Maharaji Ji: The Selling of a Guru, 1973", by Gregg Killday, Los Angeles Times, 13 November 1973, p. D1&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it was not covered by the national television news, it did get extensive coverage in the print media. The premies were reported to be "cheerful, friendly and unruffled, and seemed nourished by their faith". To the 400 premie parents who attended, Rawat "was a rehabilitator of prodigal sons and daughters".&lt;ref&gt;"Oz in the Astrodome" Ted Morgen New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Media people found a "confused jumble of inarticulately expressed ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Collier (1978), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; It was depicted in the award-winning U.S. documentary [[Lord of the Universe (documentary)|"Lord of the Universe"]] broadcast by [[PBS|PBS Television]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="tvmeditating" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Videotape Explorers on the Trail of a Guru" by Dick Adler, Los Angeles Times, 23 February 1974 p. B2&lt;/ref&gt; The event was called the "youth culture event of the year".&lt;ref name="Foss &amp; Larkin 1978"&gt;Foss &amp; Larkin (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriter [[Loudon Wainwright III]] visited the festival and later remarked that while the premies inside were looking happy the ones outside were arguing with [[Jesus Freak]]s and [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]. Wainwright's song "I am the Way" was partly inspired by Prem Rawat.&lt;ref&gt;"They Won't Boo Loudon Any Longer", Grace Lichtenstein, ''New York Times'', 3 February 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

At the festival, Larry Bernstein, a prize-winning, 41-year-old architect described a "Divine City" to be built from the ground up starting the following year. It was to feature translucent hexagonal plastic houses stacked on concrete columns and connected with monorails. Polluting vehicles would be replaced by electric vehicles, and solar power would be used to provide energy. Cards would replace cash. The use of advanced technologies to ensure pollution-free air, Rennie Davis told a journalist, would be a practical demonstration of what it means to have Heaven on Earth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Kopkind (1995), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Two sites were suggested: either the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] or somewhere near [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name="nytoz"&gt;"Oz in the Astrodome", by Ted Morgan, New York Times, 9 December 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;  The former president and vice president of the DLM later said that Prem Rawat had spoken frequently of building such a city.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;"Two ex-cult officers see possible Guyana repeat", UPI, ''Newport Rhode Island Daily News'' 25 November 1978. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the city were delayed amid the fiscal crisis following the Millennium festival.&lt;ref name = "isbn0-8423-6417-X"/&gt; Incorporation papers for the formation of the "City of Love and Light Unlimited, Inc." were filed in Colorado in 1974, and there was a failed attempt in 1975 to build the community near San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Rudin &amp; Rudin (1980), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The DLM incurred a debt estimated between $600,000 and over $1 million, attributed to poor management and low attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Khalsa (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Stoner &amp; Parke (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"&gt;Pilarzyk (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The debt severely damaged the DLM's finances.&lt;ref name="Foss &amp; Larkin 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Event-related expenses were covered by short-term credit based on the expectation that contributions would pour in following the free festival.&lt;ref&gt;Collier (1978), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; DLM's post-Millennium financial troubles forced it to close ashrams, sell its printing business and real estate, and to drop the lease on its IBM computer. Monthly donations fell from $100,000 to $70,000.&lt;ref name="GuruFollDown"&gt;"Guru following down; tactics changing", UPI, ''Waterloo Courier'' 25 November 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Messer, "to pay the debts remaining from the Houston event, devotees all over the country turned over their own possessions to Divine Sales, which had crash garage sales, attended flea markets, and invented numerous activities to dispose of the goods."&lt;ref name="Messer, 1976"&gt;Messer, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976 it was able to reduce the debt to $80,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Growing Pile of Unpaid Bills Beneath Guru's Spiritual Bliss", Deborah Frazier, UPI, 23 March 1975, Lincoln, Neb., Sunday Journal and Star&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the festival necessitated policy shifts within the movement organization.&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/&gt;

===Marriage and rift===
Because of Prem Rawat's age, Jagat janni Mata Ji, his mother, and her eldest son, Satpal Rawat (Now known as Satpal Ji Maharaj) had managed the affairs of the worldwide DLM. As Prem Rawat approached sixteen he wanted to take a more active part in guiding the movement. According to Downton, "this meant he had to encroach on his mother's territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Downton (1979), ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geaves2006"&gt;Geaves (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1973, when he turned 16, Rawat took administrative control of the Mission's U.S. branch and began to assert his independence from his mother who returned to India with Satpal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;

In May 1974, a judge gave Rawat his consent to marry without parental permission.&lt;ref&gt;"Guru, 16, marries secretary" AP Tues. 21 May 1974 ''Greeley Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; His marriage to his secretary, Marolyn Johnson, a 24-year-old follower from [[San Diego, California]], was celebrated at a non-denominational church in [[Golden, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Guru's Wife Is Another Devotee", Robert P. Dalton, AP Staff Writer, ''Oakland Tribune''. 23 May 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawat's mother, Mata Ji, had not been invited.&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his marriage, Rawat became an [[emancipated minor]]. He called his wife "Durga Ji", after the Hindu goddess [[Durga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn=0040-781X| title = One Lord Too Many| work = Time| accessdate = 2009-05-31| date = 28 April 1975| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917390,00.html}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Cornerstone |isbn =978-0-940895-03-4 |last = Mangalwadi |first = Vishal |authorlink =  Vishal Mangalwadi |title = The world of gurus |location = Chicago, Ill. |year = 1992}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Garland Pub. |isbn = 978-0-8240-9036-4 |last = Melton |first = J.

Rawat's decision to marry a Westerner precipitated a struggle for control of DLM.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 pp.201-202"&gt;Geaves in Partridge (2004), pp.201-202&lt;/ref&gt; His mother claimed that Rawat had broken his spiritual discipline by marrying, and had become a "playboy". She appointed Satpal as the new head of DLM India, but the Western premies remained loyal to Rawat.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The marriage led to a permanent rift between Prem Rawat and his mother, and was also credited with causing a profound disruption in the movement. Many followers left the ashrams to get married, and the base of support inevitably shifted from the ashrams to the wider premie community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Others felt "almost betrayed", in part because he had championed celibacy, one of the requirements of ashram life, before getting married himself.&lt;ref name="Price 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson in Swatos (1998), p.141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson (2007), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;
The bad press from the festivals and the rift caused by Prem Rawat's marriage in 1974 marked the end of the movement's growth phase.&lt;ref name="Price 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Prem Rawat returned to India in an attempt to gain control of the Indian DLM. A court-ordered settlement resulted in his eldest brother Satpal retaining control of the Indian DLM, while Rawat maintained control of the DLM outside of India.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

===Westernization===
Following the rift with his mother, Rawat announced that he was replacing the predominantly Indian image with a Western one and began to wear business suits instead of his all-white Indian attire.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Indian mahatmas were replaced with Westerners, and Indian terminology fell from use. Rawat encouraged premies to leave the ashrams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; According to one estimate, the worldwide membership had declined from 6 million to 1.2 million by 1976,&lt;ref name="GuruFollDown" /&gt; and in the U.S. the 50,000 claimed initiates had dwindled to 15,000 regular contributors.&lt;ref name="GuruStyle"/&gt; A spokesman for the Mission explained in 1976 that the higher numbers had been inflated due to poor record-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;"Guru Maharaj Ji To Launch World Tour To Aid Mission" UPI, PLAYGROUND DAILY NEWS, 15 April 1976-Page 3E&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate had from 500 to 1200 members living in ashrams in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Bromley &amp; Shupe (1981), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1970s, the movement had lost an estimated 80% of its followers in the U.S.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Lewis (1998), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Bromley and Hammond attribute the decline of groups including the Divine Light Mission to internal factors, but also in part to the news media's "discrediting reports about their activities", accounts which created a "wide-spread public perception of 'mind control' and other 'cult' stereotypes."&lt;ref name="isbn0-865-54238-4"&gt;Bromley &amp; Hammond (1987), pp. 113-4, 227&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divine Light Mission also attracted the attention of the [[anti-cult movement]]. Some members were violently kidnapped and [[deprogramming|deprogrammed]].&lt;ref&gt;"Cult Deprogrammer Patrick Sentenced to Year in Kidnaping", JACK JONES. ''Los Angeles Times'' 27 September 1980, pg. SD_A1&lt;/ref&gt; Some former members became outspoken critics of the organization and attacked the group with what Melton calls "standard anti-cult charges of brainwashing and mind control".&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1986), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ex-followers, DLM spokesman Joe Anctil said that "A lot of people were just on a trip in the beginning. They felt they had to be 'hyped', and some didn't stay long enough to get beyond that. But we've changed as our understanding has changed."&lt;ref name="GuruStyle"&gt;"Guru's cult changing style" GEORGE CORNELL, AP Religion Writer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1986), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Mishler, the founding president of the DLM in the U.S., was removed by Rawat in 1977 and gave an interview in 1979, along with the former vice president, in which he said he was concerned that the DLM was becoming a "tax evasion for the guru", and said he feared a repeat of [[Jonestown]]. They also accused Rawat of engaging in inappropriate behavior.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"FIRM LOYALTY: Guru's Sect: Misgivings in Malibu" MARK FORSTER ''Los Angeles Times'' 12 January 1979; pg. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Mishler's charges found little support and did not affect the progress of the Mission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

In the 1980s, Prem Rawat removed the Indian trappings from his message, and adopted a more Western style.&lt;ref name="Hunt 2003, pp.116-7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lippy (2002) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Melton said the mission was disbanded [when] Prem Rawat personally renounced the trappings of Indian culture and religion, to make his teachings independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles.&lt;ref name="EnAmRe"&gt;Melton (2003), p.2328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnAmRe"/&gt; Prem Rawat was no longer to be venerated as a god or regarded as a Perfect Master.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name="EnAmRe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1995), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; The ashrams were closed along with the Denver headquarters (1979). The Divine Light Mission organization was replaced by [[Elan Vital (organization)|Elan Vital]];&lt;ref&gt;Abgrall (2000), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geaves, Ron. "From Guru Maharaj Ji to Prem Rawat: Paradigm Shifts over the Period of 40 Years as a 'Master'". In: {{Cite book | last = Gallagher | first = Eugene V. | last2 = Ashcraft | first2 = W.

[http://www.elanvital.org/faq/faq_EV.htm Available online] (Retrieved May, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Prem Rawat asked to be referred to as "Maharaji" instead of "Guru Maharaj Ji."

According to [[Ron Geaves]], a religious scholar who has been associated with the teachings of Prem Rawat for the last thirty years:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rongeaves.com/ |title="A Statement from Dr. Ron Geaves" September 27, 2004 |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120235856/http://rongeaves.com/ |archivedate=20 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maharaji has chosen a route of perpetual transformation in which organizational forms are created and utilized and then destroyed, thus providing flexibility to deal with rapidly changing social attitudes, to provide pragmatic solutions to internal problems, and above all to keep his students focused on the core message rather than the peripheral requirements of organizational forms.&lt;ref&gt;Geaves (2004), pp. 45-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since then the Elan Vital has been "virtually invisible." Rawat stopped granting interviews and making public announcements of his visits.&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1986), pp. 221, 222&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, he has continued to write, lecture, and tour with the support of the Elan Vital and the Prem Rawat Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contactinfo.net/previous_events.cfm|title=Contact Info - Events|publisher=contactinfo.net|accessdate=2008-04-19|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DLM in India===

In 1975, Mata Ji took control of the DLM in India as a result of the rift and installed her eldest son, [[Satpal Rawat]], as its head. A lawsuit in India resulted in his brother Satpal gaining control of the Divine Light Mission in India, and Rawat continuing to lead DLM in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Melton in Partridge (2004), pp.201-202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomsonwife"&gt;''Biography Resource Center''. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]], [[Thomson Gale]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Satpal Rawat, now known as Shri Satpal Ji Maharaj,  teaches  "Manav Dharam" (the "Dharam [Religion] of Mankind"). He is also a politician and former [[Union Minister]] in India, and founded Manav Utthan Sewa Samiti, which he describes as "an all-India registered voluntary social welfare and charitable organization", that is also "making freely available the spiritual Knowledge which is the essence of all religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2008|url = http://www.manavdharam.org | title= Manav Dharam |accessdate = 2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satpal Rawat's supporters now assert that he is the rightful successor to his father, [[Hans Ji Maharaj]].&lt;ref&gt;McKean, (1996), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manavdharam.org/ssjm/1_brief_into.html |title=Satpal Ji Maharaj |work= |accessdate=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars that have written about the succession report that Satpal and the rest of the family accepted and supported Prem's declaration of succession for eight years.&lt;ref name="Melton 1986, pp.141-2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beit-Hallahami (1997), p.85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USChaplains&gt;United States (2001), pp. 11-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divine United Organization (DUO) was an organization registered under the Societies Registration Act 21 of 1860&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/337921744/Sant-Mat-pdf|title=Sant_Mat.pdf {{!}} Bhakti Movement {{!}} Religious Comparison|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Registrar of [[Delhi]] in 1977, to disseminate the teachings of Prem Rawat in India. According to Geaves, DUO remained in India until it was replaced by '''Raj Vidya Bhavan''' [sic].&lt;ref name="Geaves2006" /&gt; '''Raj Vidya Kender''' (Center for the King of Knowledge) states on its website that it was registered under the societies Registration Act in 1977, with registration No. 8845/77, "by individuals eager to help in the dissemination of Maharaji's message of hope and peace."&lt;ref name="RVKabout"&gt;[http://www.rajvidyakender.org/aboutus.html "About Us" page on Raj Vidya Kender website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514022036/http://www.rajvidyakender.org/aboutus.html |date=14 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
{{details|Techniques of Knowledge|Teachings of Prem Rawat}}
According to some scholars, Shri Hans was influenced by both the [[Sant Mat|Sant]] tradition and the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. [[Reinhart Hummel]] wrote that from the former came the reduction of Hinduism to the inner realization of the divine and the veneration of the guru, and from the latter the emphasis on the practical life. Hummel also noted that the DLM never developed a systematic doctrine, either during Hans' time or Prem Rawat's time. Hummel further asserted that the influence of the North Indian Sant tradition was dominant in Hans' [[eclecticism|eclectic]] thinking, and that from the Sant tradition also came the rejection of outward rituals and ceremonies; the rejection of asceticism in favor of life as a householder; the rejection of veneration of idols, and the focus on the guru as the manifestation of the divine. Hummel also noted that [[Techniques of Knowledge|the four meditation techniques]] are of central importance to Prem, as they were to Hans.&lt;ref&gt;Hummel (1980), pp.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

No rules or regulations were imposed, and no beliefs or ethical practices were taught.&lt;ref name="Partridge 2004 pp.201-202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah 1976"&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental practices of inner peace were embodied and experienced through [[satsang]], service and [[meditation]], the sum of which is an experience called "Knowledge." Members of the DLM meditated formally twice daily and attended discourses on the Knowledge (known as satsang) when possible. According to Galanter "satsang could be delivered to active members or to those with only a casual interest. It was something of a polemic interspersed with parables, and because members were bright and sophisticated, these discourses tended to be engaging, making use of both Hindu mythology and Western philosophy". In a study by [[Flo Conway]] and [[Jim Siegelman]], former followers said that they had spent 32.9 hours per week in group-related processes and ritual and 19.9 hours in additional study or [[indoctrination]] (lectures, seminars, workshops etc).&lt;ref&gt;Conway &amp; Siegelman (1995), p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarianism was encouraged but not enforced except in ashrams and Divine Centers.

Five "commandments" were part of the Divine Light Mission's teachings:&lt;ref name="isbn0-8423-6417-X"&gt;Larson (2004), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
#Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
#Constantly meditate and remember the Holy Name.
#Leave no room for doubt in the mind.
#Never delay attending satsang.
#Always have faith in God.

In the United States, the early years of the Divine Light Mission were marked by the rapid growth of loosely affiliated local ashrams, united mainly by a shared devotion to Guru Maharaj Ji. As the DLM became more and more structured and centralized, leadership and power came to be concentrated in the Denver headquarters. According to scholars, Prem Rawat's desire to consolidate his power and authority over the U.S. movement led to increasing formalization, with rules and regulations for ashram living, standards for recruited "candidates," and pressure towards certification of the movement's teachers.&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meredith (2002), p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholars Foss and van der Lans, the teachings of Hans Ji Maharaj were minimized after 1975, and followers were expected to accept Prem Rawat as their personal savior.&lt;ref&gt;Foss &amp; van der Lans in Barker (1983), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David V. Barrett]] noted that the DLM movement was often criticized for emphasizing the superiority of subjective emotional experience over intellect.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett (2003), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologists [[Ralph Larkin]] and Daniel A. Foss made similar observations in 1978.&lt;ref name="Foss &amp; Larkin 1978"/&gt; In response, the religious scholar [[Ron Geaves]], himself a member of the movement, accused Foss and Larkin of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Geaves (2004), p. 45-62&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1981 article based on the Dutch branch of the Divine Light Mission, stated that the DLM had little philosophical background and that all its central creeds and tenets were described in the song associated with the Hindu ritual called [[aarti]].&lt;ref&gt;Haan in Kranenborg (1981) pp.55-57&lt;/ref&gt; Arti was sung to Prem Rawat in the morning and evening in ashrams.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Saliba|Saliba, John A.]] "The Guru: Perceptions Of American Devotees Of The Divine Light Mission", ''[[HORIZONS]]'' 7/1 (1980), 69-81&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawat says he does not charge for teaching people the techniques of Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Who Is Guru Maharaj Ji?]]'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thekeys.maharaji.net/home/index.php?_a=knowledgebase&amp;_j=questiondetails&amp;_i=392 |title=The Keys, by Maharaji  - "Is there a charge for viewing the Keys and receiving Knowledge?" | accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related organizations that support the dissemination of Rawat's message are funded by donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tprf.org/events/nam08/den0908/ |title=Maharaji in North America |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prem Rawat Foundation, it is supported by people who appreciate Rawat's message and wish to help make it available to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tprf.org/faqs.htm |title=FAQ |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
In a comparison of new religious movements, Gartrell and Shannon noted that people appeared to seek out such religious organizations to get answers to questions about ultimate meaning as well as answers to more prosaic issues. In discussing the differences in recruiting tactics employed by these groups, they placed the Divine Light Mission in the middle ground between movements in which recruits were [[Love bombing|love bombed]], or overwhelmed by waves of intense sentiment, and those in which affective bonds were discouraged. They reported that close ties between newcomers and DLM members developed gradually over a period of three to four months, between initial contact and their attending a "Knowledge session", and the emergent friendships were an important forum in which recruits aired doubts and discussed DLM beliefs. These relationships thus supplemented a very cognitive conversion process, in which active consideration of the movement's ideas and beliefs was encouraged from the outset. They found little evidence to suggest that social rewards were orchestrated by the movement, either in degree or timing.&lt;ref&gt;Gartrell &amp; Shannon (1985), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[James V. Downton]], who studied the DLM for five years, reported that the "idealism of these premies was one of the motivating forces behind their conversion [to DLM]. They wanted to create a more caring world".&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the subjects of his study became premies he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is little doubt in my mind that these premies have changed in a positive way. Today, they seem less alienated, aimless, worried, afraid, and more peaceful, loving, confident, and appreciative of life. We could attribute these changes to surrender, devotion, and their involvement in the premie community. Each of these undoubtedly had a positive impact, but, if we accept what premies say, none were as critical as their experience of the universal spirit. Meditating on the life-energy for five years, they report having more positive attitudes about themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Carroll Stoner and Jo Anne Parke, when they visited an ashram the premies "appeared to be in control of their own lives and seemed to be achieving some measure of peace as a by-product of a lifestyle they feel is constructive and healthy". When the same members attended an appearance by Prem Rawat a week later, "they lost control, sobbed and swayed and knelt to kiss his feet."&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;

According to Foss and van der Lans, members who joined before 1975 tended to be young people from the counterculture who had used psychedelic drugs. Later members, they asserted, were older and more responsible with ordinary jobs who were disillusioned with conventional religions or other Eastern movements.&lt;ref&gt;Foss &amp; van der Lans in Barker (1983), pp. 304-306&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[group cohesiveness]] carried out by [[Marc Galanter (MD)|Marc Galanter]] in 1974, based on questionnaire responses given by 119 DLM members randomly chosen from festival registration lines, found that after two years involvement with DLM, members reported a considerable decline in psychological distress and drug use compared to their pre membership status. The study found that 45% of those surveyed had used marijuana daily before joining, while only 7% did so at the time of the study. Seventy-one percent reported psychological stress before joining compared to 37% at the time of the study. Overall, 38% had sought professional help for psychological problems before joining. These observations led to what Galanter's describes as "an apparent overall improvement in psychiatric state derived from conversion and its retention through continued membership", and that members, whether they were seriously distressed or not before joining, reported an improved emotional state after joining. Galanter reports that 82% of members surveyed were single, 97% were white, and 73% were in their twenties. The percentage of these with [[Catholic]] or [[Protestant]] backgrounds mirrored the general population, while there were ten times as many members with [[Jewish]] backgrounds as in the general population (21% versus 2%). Three-quarters of them had attended college.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-512370-0"&gt;Galanter (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[James V. Downton]] conducted a comparative study of 41 DLM members from three US cities, 29 members of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement and 40 college students. Among the DLM members the average age was 23 and ranged from 19 to 29. They came from middle-class backgrounds, all were white and had attended an average of 1.5 years of college, similar to the Hare Krishna sample, though DLM members were less likely to have come from broken homes. Sixty-five percent of DLM members reported having religious experiences while tripping on [[LSD]]. Overall, 95% of DLM members had used psychedelic drugs, compared to 89% of Hare Krishna and 67% of the college student cohort. Compared to the college students, fewer DLM members had had religious upbringings and they tended to have had worse family experiences though only 17% came from "broken homes".&lt;ref&gt;Downton (1979), pp 228-230&lt;/ref&gt;

One member, writing in the 1970s said that followers were "nagged to donate funds of their own" and some devotees signed pledges to donate a dollar a day to provide the Mission with some reliable income.&lt;ref name="Messer, 1976"/&gt;  One former accountant for the DLM said that new followers were asked to turn over their entire savings, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in several cases their families contested the donations. He was quoted as saying "it takes a lot of money to keep a guru." Bob Mishler, the mission's executive director, talked one person into signing over power of attorney shortly after she joined. Mishler was sacked by Rawat in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growing Pile of Unpaid Bills Beneath Guru's Spiritual Bliss|first=Deborah| last=Frazier| agency=UPI|date=23 March 1975|work=Sunday Journal and Star|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|page=11A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Maeve (1979): The Divine Light Mission as a social organization.

==Ashrams==

=== In India ===
The Divine Light Mission began creating ashrams in India in the 1960s, starting with a small one in [[Rajasthan]] and a larger one called Satlok ("Place of Truth") between [[Delhi]] and [[Haridwar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hans Jayanti'' (2000), pp.24-37. DUO, New Delhi, Book published in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Hans Ji Maharaj's birth by Prem Rawat's Indian organization.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khushwant Singh]], who visited the Mission's headquarters in Delhi in 1973 described it as being like a fortress with {{convert|8|ft|m|sing=on}}-high walls, an iron grilled gate enclosing a courtyard and a complex of buildings capable of housing 100 and with the capacity to feed 50,000 visitors on special occasions. Singh also described "the lavish use of marble, wall-to-wall carpets, chandeliers and modern furnishings" as evidence of affluence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Guru Business | author = [[Khushwant Singh]] | work = The New York Times| date = 8 April 1973 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D11F83F5C147A93CAA9178FD85F478785F9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the West ===
Only a small fraction of the overall DLM membership lived in organized ashrams during its short history but several dozen ashrams were formed in the U.S., Britain, Europe and Australia. Ashrams were run by "general secretaries" appointed by the national office.&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Each ashram had a "house mother" who oversaw cooking, washing, ironing, and food service but the normal isolation of the housewife and cook became a communal, everyone-pitchin-and-help festival.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geaves2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-512370-0"/&gt; 
Followers ("premies") who lived in them often worked part or full time at ordinary jobs and gave a sizable portion – sometimes all – of their income to the movement. Ashrams typically had an associated business, such as a Divine Sales outlet and a Divine Service Company.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Messer in Glock &amp; Bellah (1976), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The ashram premies became the core of the Mission in the United States, but the ashrams themselves were not a source of income, never becoming more than self-sufficient.&lt;ref name="Price 1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melton (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Followers wishing to stay in the [[ashram]]s established by Rawat were required to fill out detailed applications that focused on their trust funds, insurance policies, and other assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The guru who minds his mother|first=Malcom N. |last=Carter|page=A6|work= The Stars and Stripes|date=4 November 1973|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia in the early 1970s, a small percentage of premies lived in ashrams. Some premies choose to live in an ashram for a couple of months, to get into their meditation, and then moved out into households or shared houses. Ashram rules demanded celibacy and abstinence from meat, alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. Married people, as well as single, lived in ashrams and, in their case, the practice of celibacy meant that they had sexual relations only with their marital partner. About three hundred people chose to live in communal houses and almost all households were non-smoking, non-drinking and vegetarian and, in some, the finances and energies were pooled for the good of all. Each household made its own decisions about life styles and often contained students and married couples.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Derek &amp; Michael McDonald in Smith &amp; Crossley (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ashrams, there were many more residences with less formality. "Premie Centers", were households committed to the Mission's activity that donated 30% of their income and followed dietary rules, but that allowed married, non-celibate couples and children, and which weren't subject to orders from the national Mission. "Premie houses" were informal households (with as many as 30 followers) held together by their shared commitments and values. Ashrams served as local coordinating centers for all the local devotees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

Carroll Stoner and Jo Anne Parke wrote in 1977 of their visits to several ashrams that "there was no persuasion or cajoling for us to become part of this group. We did feel a sense of calm and peace in the ashrams.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner &amp; Parker (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Galanter (MD)|Marc Galanter]], wrote in 1989 of his visit to a DLM ashram that —

&lt;blockquote&gt; "The atmosphere in the ashram was indeed quite striking.&amp;nbsp;... I was greeted in a friendly, even intimate fashion by people who were complete strangers. The intense communality of the members was immediately apparent, a quality that was clearly an important aspect of the group's function. One could sense a closeness among those present, and an absence of the minor tensions that would be expected in a setting where two dozen people were living in tight quarters.&amp;nbsp;... Caring and intimacy, reflective of the group's cohesiveness, seemed to mute any expression of animosity.&amp;nbsp;... I was made to feel as if I were entering a supportive envelope, to be protected from the rough edges of relationships in the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter (1999), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

It was referred to as a "sect" in 21.4% of headlines, with 0% for "cult".&lt;ref&gt;van Driel &amp; Richardson (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

The president and spokesman of the DLM said in 1977 that "they represent a church rather than a religion".&lt;ref&gt;"Miami's startled elite wish the guru, in short, a pleasant stay", By Barry Bearak, Knight-Ridder Service, 30 July 1977. ''Independent Press Telegram'' (Long Beach, CA) A-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, the DLM faced persecution and even banning. In 1972, in [[Argentina]], as part of a crackdown on small religious groups by the [[Argentina third military dictatorship|military junta]], 87 members of the DLM were arrested in [[Mar del Plata]] on charges of using drugs and practising their faith. The DLM, the Hare Krishnas and the Jehovah's Witnesses were banned, reportedly at the behest of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrara, Grace, M., ''Latin America - 1978, Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill (1998), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)]] arrested over 200 members, including 12 foreigners, in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;"Five sect leaders in Chile sent to desert prison camp.", Jonathan Kandell, New York Times, 24 March 1974&lt;/ref&gt; The DLM was banned by [[Singapore]] authorities in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Mauzy (2002), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromley and Hammond described the Divine Light Mission as belonging in a "medium tension category", among movements that were seen by the public as peculiar rather than threatening, and to which society responded with watchfulness and ostracism.&lt;ref name="isbn0-865-54238-4"/&gt; [[Psychiatrist]] [[Saul V. Levine]] wrote that the DLM, along with other groups such as the [[Unification Church]], was widely held in low esteem – families felt their children were being financially exploited while the groups' leaders lived in "ostentation and offensive opulence."&lt;ref&gt;Levine (1989), pp. 96, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Ron Geaves states that the Divine Light Mission "developed into a vigorous new religious movement with its own specific traits that included characteristics of a contemporary North Indian [[Sant (religion)|Sant]] panth (sectarian institution) and [[nirguna]] [[bhakti]] was combined with intense reverence for the living [[satguru]] and [[millennium|millennial]] expectations of the western [[counter-culture]]."&lt;ref name="Geaves2006" /&gt;

According to sociologist Pilarzyk the youth culture response — mainly from decidedly leftist political ideologies — was somewhat ambiguous, combining indifference with some instances of overt hostility. Pilarzyk mentioned that these criticisms usually focused on what they perceived as phoniness of the "blissed-out premies", and referring to the "hocuspocus" aspects of the meditation, and the "materialistic fixations" and physical condition of the guru. These accounts are described by Pilarzyk as being quite negative and full of distortions from the DLM's adherents point of view, which drew responses from them that varied from bewilderment and amusement to extreme defensiveness. Positive comments came from youth culture "folk heroes" as anti-war activist as Rev. [[Daniel Berrigan]], radical lawyer [[William Kunstler]], and singer-songwriter [[Cat Stevens]].&lt;ref name="Pilarzyk1978"&gt;Pilarzyk, Thomas. "The Origin, Development, and Decline of a Youth Culture Religion: An Application of Sectarianization Theory" in ''Review of Religious Research''. Fall 1978, Vol. 20, No. 1, pp. 23-43. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3509939 At JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing his 1985 review of studies of a number of new religious movements, such as [[The Jesus Movement]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[Family International|Children of God]] group in Europe and the Divine Light Mission, [[James T. Richardson]] stated that "life in the new religions is often therapeutic instead of harmful", and suggested that the young people attracted to these movements were affirming their idealism by their involvement. Richardson asserted that his review found there was little data to support the almost completely negative picture of these groups painted by a few mental health professionals and others.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1995), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divinity''' is the study of [[Christianity|Christian]] and other [[theology]] and [[Christian ministry|ministry]] at a [[school]], [[divinity school]], [[university]], or [[seminary]].  The term is sometimes a [[synonym]] for theology as an academic, speculative pursuit, and sometimes is used for the study of applied theology and ministry to make a distinction between that and academic theology. It most often refers to [[Christianity|Christian]] study which is linked with the [[professional degree]]s for [[ordination|ordained]] ministry or related work, though it is also used in an academic setting by other faith traditions.

==Areas and specializations==

Divinity can be divided into several distinct but related disciplines. These vary, sometimes widely, from church to church and from one faith tradition to another, and even among various programs within a particular church. A typical program will include many of the following:

===Philosophical theology===
* [[Systematic theology]]
* [[Dogmatic theology]]
* [[Moral theology]] or [[Christian ethics]]
* [[Natural theology]]
* [[Sacrament|Sacramental theology]]

===Practice of worship===
* [[Liturgics]]
* [[Homiletics]]
* [[Sacred music]]

===Ministry in the field===
* [[Pastoral theology]]
* [[Pastoral counseling]]
* [[Religious education]] techniques

===Scriptural study and languages===
{{See also|Sacred language}}
* [[Biblical studies]] or [[Sacred Scripture]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]]
* [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]]
* [[Latin]]
* [[Old Church Slavonic]]

===Miscellany===
* [[Canon law]]
* [[History of Christianity|Church history]]
* [[Ecclesiology]]

==Degrees ==

Studying divinity usually leads to the awarding of an [[academic degree]] or a [[professional degree]].  Such degrees, particularly in modern times the [[Master of Divinity]], are prerequisites for ordained ministry in most [[Christian denominations]] and many other faith communities. The exception to this is all "plain" churches such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Dunkard Brethren]], and many others. In fact, such churches hold to the belief that seminaries are an institution of man and not supported by Holy Scripture. Students earn such degrees at a free-standing [[seminary]], theologate or [[divinity school]], or at a university.

===List of degrees===

'''Edward Isaac Ezra''' (3 January 1883 in [[Shanghai]] – 15 December 1921 in Shanghai)&lt;ref&gt;"Sudden Death of Mr. Edward Ezra", ''North-China Herald'' (17 December 1921):27 (767); Les Fleurs de L'Orient; [http://www.farhi.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I91406&amp;tree=Farhi Farhi.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was a wealthy [[Jewish]] businessman,&lt;ref&gt;Ezra was "a Jew by birth, a [[British subject]] by [[naturalization]], and an [[opium]] trader by profession." See Kathryn Meyer and Terry Parssinen, ''Webs of Smoke: Smugglers, Warlords and the History of the International Drug Trade'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002):40. However, "at various times [he] professed citizenships of Turkey, Persia, Spain and the United States, in an attempt to avoid prosecution. See Teemu Ruskola, "Law's Empire: The Legal Construction of 'America' in the 'District of China'"; [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=440641 Papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; who was the first member of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]] who was actually born in China,&lt;ref name="Bickers-Henriot-45"&gt;Robert Bickers and Christian Henriot, ''New Frontiers: Imperialism's New Communities in East Asia, 1842-1953'' (Manchester University Press ND, 2000):45.&lt;/ref&gt; and who was at one time "one of the wealthiest foreigners in Shanghai".&lt;ref&gt;Tahirih V. Lee, ''Contract, Guanxi, and Dispute Resolution in China'' ( ):110.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one report, Ezra amassed a vast fortune estimated at from twenty to thirty million dollars primarily through the importation of [[History of opium in China|opium]],&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Miller, ''Shanghai: The Paradise of Adventurers'' (Orsay Publishing House Inc., 1937):153.&lt;/ref&gt; and successful [[real estate]] investment and management in early twentieth century Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Meyer and Terry Parssinen, ''Webs of Smoke: Smugglers, Warlords and the History of the International Drug Trade'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002):40.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra was the largest stockholder&lt;ref&gt;''Hotel Monthly'' 28 (1920):53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the managing director of Shanghai Hotels Ltd., and its major [[financier]],&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and controlled such hotels as the [[Astor House, Shanghai|Astor House Hotel in Shanghai]].

==Family background==
[[File:Map showing location of Edward Ezra Road.png|thumb|Map showing location of Edward Ezra Road]]
Edward Isaac Ezra was born in [[Shanghai, China]] on 3 January 1883, the oldest of the nine children of Isaac "Ned" Ezra (died 1892),&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, ''Webs'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first Jewish merchants in Shanghai. Ezra Road (now Shashi No.2 Road 沙市二路 - between Nanjing East Road and Jiujiang Road) was named after his farther and his mother, Flora Abraham (died 1899).&lt;ref name="farhi"&gt;[http://www.farhi.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I91413&amp;tree=Farhi Farhi.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the older brother of Rachel Ezra Levy (born 1884 in Shanghai; married Nissim Simon Levy; died 2 January 1968 in Hong Kong);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farhi.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I91418&amp;tree=Farhi Farhi.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis Isaac Ezra (born ca. 1885); and twins Isaac Isaac Ezra (born 8 February 1892) and Judah Isaac Ezra (born 8 February 1892); and four other sisters.&lt;ref name="farhi" /&gt; In 1907 Ezra married Mozelle Robinson Sopher (born 1890 in Shanghai; died August 1979 in Hong Kong),&lt;ref&gt;''South China Morning Post'' (8 August 1979); [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/44/4401905.pdf Sunzi1.lib.hku.hk]&lt;/ref&gt; and they had two children, Cecil (born 1908) and Denzil (born 1914).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farhi.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I91406&amp;tree=Farhi Farhi.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
[[File:Astor House Hotel, Shanghai, 1925.png|thumb|left|Astor House Hotel, owned by Ezra]]
In 1896 The Central Stores Company, which was largely financed by Ezra, took over the Central Hotel (later the [[Peace Hotel]]) on the southern corner of [[Nanjing Road (Shanghai)|Nanjing Road]] and [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Fieldhouse, "'The Bund' Shanghai: Historic Architecture"; [http://www.simonfieldhouse.com/shanghai.htm Simonfieldhouse.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108000000/http://www.simonfieldhouse.com/shanghai.htm |date=November 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1900 Ezra had diversified his economic activities, adding large-scale [[real estate]] [[investment]]s, construction, and management. Ezra was considered one of Shanghai's major landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Bickers, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ezra "erected - on the land bounded by Nanking, Kiujiang, Szechwan and Kiangse Roads - 1,000,000 [[tael]]s worth of residences that enjoyed modern amenities. The family interests included hotels," including the [[Astor House, Shanghai|Astor House Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;Wei Pen Ti, "A Peek Backwards into the Jewish Community of Shanghai", 149-163; [http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/44/4401905.pdf Sunzi1.lib.hku.hk]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ezra was the managing director of Shanghai Hotels Limited from 1907, chairman of the Far Eastern Insurance Company,&lt;ref name="death"&gt;"Sudden Death of Mr. Edward Ezra", ''North-China Herald'' (17 December 1921):27 (767)&lt;/ref&gt; chairman of the Shanghai Gas Company, chairman of the China Motors Ltd.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt; Additionally, he held large proprietary interests in, and was president and chairman of, the ''China Press'' and the ''Evening Star'' newspapers.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

In 1913 Ezra was elected the first president of the Shanghai Opium Combine.&lt;ref&gt;Bickers &amp; Henriot, ''New Frontiers'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Ezra was leading the legal [[cartel]], he was also organising an illegal underground opium smuggling and distribution network, involving his younger brothers, twins Isaac Isaac Ezra and Judah Isaac Ezra,&lt;ref name="farhi" /&gt; and some Chinese associates.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Marshall, "Opium and the Politics of Gangsterism in Nationalist China, 1927-1945" ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 8 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; When it was exposed, Ezra was granted immunity from prosecution by testifying against Paul Yip, his Chinese partner, who received an 18-month prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer &amp; Parssinen, 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1915 Ezra had generated enough wealth to be able to re-sell at the price he had paid for it a choice property in the most desirable part of the [[Hongkou District]] on the northern bank of the [[Suzhou Creek]] diagonally across Huangpu Road from the Astor House Hotel, to the United States for their [[Consulate General of the United States, Shanghai|consulate]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer &amp; Parssinen, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chiara Betta, "The Trade Diaspora of Baghdadi Jews: From India to China's Treaty Ports, 1842-1937", in ''Diaspora Entrepreneurial Networks: Four Centuries of History'', eds.

(Berg Publishers, 2005):269-285.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920 the Astor House Hotel was making a handsome profit under his leadership.

In 1917 Ezra purchased ''The China Press'' newspaper from its founder, American journalist [[Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard]].&lt;ref&gt;Julia Edwards, ''Women of the World: The Great Foreign Correspondents'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1988):50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social activities==
Ezra's relationship to the [[Sassoon family]] by marriage, as well as his immense wealth, allowed him both social standing and political position.&lt;ref name="Bickers-Henriot-45" /&gt; His own home on Joffre Road (now 1209 Huaihai Lu)&lt;ref&gt;"Street Names", ''Tales of Old Shanghai'', [http://www.talesofoldchina.com/shanghai/places/t-plac02.htm Talesofoldchina.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Shanghai French Concession]] was an indicator of his wealth. According to Paul French, "Ezra was extremely rich and lived in considerable style in the Ezra mansion"&lt;ref&gt;Paul French, ''Carl Crow, A Tough Old China Hand'' (Hong Kong University Press): 284.&lt;/ref&gt; with "[[Louis XV]] furniture throughout, a ballroom for 150 dancers, a music room to seat an audience of 80 in comfort, and elegantly designed [[Window#Types##French|French windows]] giving out on to {{convert|25|acres|0|abbr=on}} of gardens."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bickers and Christian Henriot, ''New Frontiers: Imperialism's New Communities in East Asia, 1842-1953'' (Manchester University Press ND, 2000):48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Ezra, also a philanthropist, helped organise and fund the Society for the Rescue of the Chinese Jews, which aimed at restoring [[Kaifeng Jews]] to [[orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;"First Mission to Colony of Chinese Orthodox Jews," ''The New York Times'' (3 May 1903):28; [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/05/03/118493101.pdf Query.NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra was the president of the Shanghai Zionist Association from its founding in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Maisie J. Meyer, ''From the Rivers of Babylon to the Whangpoo: A Century of Sephardi Jewish Life in Shanghai'' (University Press of America, 2003):171.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra was the vice-president of the Jewish Communal organisation of China, and vice-president of the [[Synagogue]].&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

Ezra was an active member and past Master of the Lodge Saltoun in East-Asia, and made his way up to the highest degrees in [[freemasonry]].&lt;ref name="death" /&gt; Ezra was a member of the Shanghai Club; the [[Shanghai Race Club]]; the Masonic Club; and the Cercle Sportif Francais.&lt;ref name="death" /&gt;

From 1912 to 1918, Ezra was one of the nine-member [[Shanghai Municipal Council]] that administered the lawless International Settlement.&lt;ref&gt;"Sudden Death of Mr. Edward Ezra", ''North-China Herald'' (17 December 1921):27 (767); Meyer &amp; Parssinen, 40; 潘光 [Pan Guang], 犹太人在中国: 中英文本 [Jews in China: Chinese and English] (五洲传播出版社, 2005):1895.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an obvious conflict of interest in relation to his opium business, Ezra refused to resign from the Council. In 1919 Ezra resigned from public life because of a gambling scandal involving his brother, Judah, who had paid the favourite team to lose in a baseball tournament in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Meyer, James H Wittebols, and Terry Parssinen, ''Webs of Smoke: Smugglers, Warlords, Spies, and the History of the International Drug Trade'' (State and Society in East Asia) (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002):52-53, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ezra died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at the Shanghai Nursing Home after collapsing in his office at Kiukiang Road about noon on Thursday, 15 December 1921, aged only 38,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1922_1923_4_YRAppendices.pdf AJarchives.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in abject poverty and isolation, abandoned by his former colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;''Hotel Monthly'' 30 (1922):59; "Sudden Death of Mr. Edward Ezra", ''North China Herald'' (17 December 1921):767; Chiara Betta, "From Orientals to Imagined Britons: Baghdadi Jews in Shanghai", ''Modern Asian Studies'' 37 (2003):999-1023.&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra was buried at the Baikal Road Jewish Cemetery in the [[Yangpu District]] after a service conducted by Rabbi Hirsch.&lt;ref&gt;"Interment of Mr. E.I. Ezra", ''North-China Herald'' (24 December 1921):25 (833).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezra's premature death accelerated the decline of the family's prestige and wealth.&lt;ref name="McCabe-p278"&gt;McCabe, 278.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas Valentine, "Left to their own devices, the degenerate Ezra brothers squandered the family fortune and by the mid-1920s had decided to trafficking in illicit drugs."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Valentine, ''The Strength of the Wolf: The Secret History of America's War on Drugs'' (Verso, 2004):11.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1925 Judah and Isaac both moved to San Francisco, where they were among the very first to import [[narcotics]] from Asia to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, ''Webs'', 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ezra brothers formed a connection with Italian [[Mafiosi]] [[Antone "Black Tony" Parmiagni]], [[Charles "Lucky" Luciano]] and [[Frank Costello]],  Jewish gangster [[Meyer Lansky]], and with Ye Ching Ho (Pinyin: Ye Qinghe), also known as Paul Yip (or Paul Yi), an agent of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Kuomintang]] and with the approval of Chiang's Nationalist government, "which relied on opium profits for its survival".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Valentine, ''The Strength of the Wolf: The Secret History of America's War on Drugs'' (Verso, 2004):11; Frederic Wakeman Jr., ''Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese Secret Service'' (A Philip E. Lilienthal Book in Asian studies) (University of California Press, 2003):482.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1933 the Ezra brothers were arrested in California for distributing narcotics on the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ina Baghdiantz McCabe, Gelina Harlaftis, and Ioanna Pepelasis Minoglou, eds. ''Diaspora Entrepreneurial Networks: Four Centuries of History'' 2nd ed.(Business, Culture and Change) (Berg, 2005):278.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their guilty pleas and co-operation with authorities in testifying against their confederates, they were fined $12,000 each and were imprisoned for twelve years,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, ''Webs'', 237.&lt;/ref&gt; thus "bringing their family's fortunes to an abrupt and dramatic conclusion."&lt;ref name="McCabe-p278" /&gt; After their release from prison, the Ezra brothers were deported.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Jacob Anslinger and William F. Tompkins, ''Traffic in Narcotics'' (Addiction in America) (Ayer Co., 1981):88.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisheva Bikhovski''' ({{lang-ru|Элишева Быховски}}) (born '''Elizaveta Ivanovna Zhirkov''' ({{lang-ru|Елизавета Ивановна Жирков}}); September 20, 1888 – March 27, 1949) — was a Russian-Israeli poet, writer, literary critic and translator, often known simply by her adopted [[Biblical Hebrew]] name [[Elisheba|Elishéva]] ({{he|אֱלִישֶׁבַע}}). Her [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] father, Ivan Zhirkov, was a village teacher who later became a bookseller and textbook publisher; her mother was descended from [[Irish Catholic]]s who had settled in Russia after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803-1815). Elisheva wrote most of her works in Hebrew, and also translated English and Hebrew poetry into Russian.

On the death of her mother in 1891,&lt;ref name="memoir"&gt;Элишева, [http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/186/elisheva.htm Как я учила Иврит], (Russian translation by Zoya Kopelman of “How I learned Hebrew” from the Elisheva Archives, Genazim, Tel Aviv), Лехаим (''Lechaim''), October 2007. Retrieved 7 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; she moved to [[Moscow]] with her aunt, an older sister of her mother, where she lived surrounded by the English language and culture. Though not culturally [[Judaism|Jewish]], she became the classmate of Jewish girls who introduced her to their culture and traditions, and she began to write poetry in 1907. Not at first differentiating between [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] as the “language of the Jews,” she began studying Yiddish — which, she wrote, because of its kinship to other European languages, especially [[German language|German]], she found easy to understand.&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt; She learned the Hebrew alphabet from a Hebrew grammar book owned by her brother, the [[philology|philologist]] and [[Esperantist]] [[Lev Zhirkov]] (1885–1963), a specialist in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref name="berlovitz"&gt;Yaffah Berlovitz, "[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/elisheva-bichovsky Elisheva Bichovsky]" in ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia,'' 1 March 2009, Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved August 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied both [[Russian literature|Russian]] and [[English literature]], graduating from a grammar school for girls and in 1910 becoming certified as a teacher at a progressive school of [[Stanislaus Shatsky]]'s and [[Alexander Zelenko]]'s Children's Work and Play Society through courses that trained preschool and elementary teachers according to the system of the innovative German educator [[Friedrich Fröbel]] (1782–1852).

==Hebrew education==
Elisheva recalls in her memoir that already in elementary school she had become familiar with names of places that featured in adventure books for young people, including several Latin American cities and [[Galveston, Texas]]. Her interest in Hebrew was kindled after she chanced upon a Hebrew-language newspaper and saw an advertisement for a steamship company recommended as an easy, convenient way to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. At that time Galveston was a major port of entry to the [[United States]] for European emigrants, and with the aid of a German-language textbook for scholars of [[Biblical Hebrew]], she was able to puzzle out first the name of Galveston and later the names of other [[dateline|geographical location]]s from which telegrams were sent for newspaper publication, such as [[London]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Berlin]]. But except for the datelines at the tops of news stories, she was unable to comprehend anything from that newspaper. Eventually, she writes, someone explained that there were two separate “Jewish” languages, both written in the same letters but very, very different in vocabulary and grammar.&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;

Thus it was that in 1913 she began studying Hebrew through evening classes at the “Общество распространения правильных сведений о евреях и еврействе”, ''Obshchestvo rasprostraneniya pravil'nykh svedeniy o yevreyakh i yevreystve'' (“Society for the dissemination of correct information about Jews and Judaism”), founded in 1906 by a group of Jewish public figures in Moscow that included [[Uri Nissan Gnessin]] (1879–1913), [[Yosef Haim Brenner]] (1881–1921), [[Echiel Tschlenow]] (1864–1918) and her future husband, [[Simeon Bikhovski]] (1880–1932),&lt;ref name="dorledor"&gt;Dorin Shlaen, [http://www.dorledor.info/node/6946 Коллекция, Рахель и Элишева] (“Collection, Rachel and Elisheva”), 11 December 2004. Еврейский новостной портал Молдовы Dorledor.info. Retrieved 8 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; who also began the publishing house ''Nisyonot'' (“Experiments”) in that year.&lt;ref name="bredstein"&gt;Andrey Alexander Bredstein, ''Uri-Nisn Gnesin: Between the Worlds, Belonging to Both'', Austin: May 2012 (Master's thesis). Accessed 8 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three months she had a young teacher whom she characterized as “both incredibly gifted and infinitely devoted to his cause.” The lessons were conducted by the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]] of “Hebrew through Hebrew”, mainly through oral instruction and without a textbook.

:“From the first lesson, I left with a precise knowledge of only two Hebrew words, but of the truth of this knowledge I did not have the slightest doubt. I know what it means when the teacher turns to his pupils and asks, “אתם&amp;nbsp;מבינים”, ''Atem mevinim?'' (‘Do you understand?’). I had not seen the Hebrew letters yet, and only learned the sounds by ear. But this knowledge — as well as what was added over time in these lessons — was solid and thorough. It was systematic and correct knowledge that was impossible for me to lose.”

Although that teacher was popular with his pupils, he aroused suspicion for going about in Moscow with a light summer coat and without galoshes. He had invited some of his students, who did not know enough Hebrew to be able to study on their own, to take Russian-language lessons in the [[Tanakh]], or Jewish scriptures. The lessons, sporadic and conducted at the homes of various students, led to the group's being perceived as a new and possibly dangerous revolutionary group, and arrests and an inquiry followed. Lacking the required “право жительства”, ''pravo zhitel'stva'' (right of residence) in the capital, the teacher was regarded as living there illegally and was forced to leave Moscow, but Elisheva continued to learn Hebrew off and on during the next two years.&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;

On the death of her father in 1917, Elisheva returned to Ryazan, the city of her birth. With that year's [[February Revolution|fall of the Russian monarchy]], she witnessed street demonstrations “in celebration of freedom”, which had been forbidden under the former regime. In one of these demonstrations, she participated with a group of Jewish youths, marching in an orderly way under the new national flag singing ''[[Hatikvah]]'', a modified version of which eventually became [[Israel]]’s [[national anthem]].&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;

In Ryazan, with some sleuthing and the help of a local rabbi, she was led to a scholar in an attic room who used to tutor boys in reciting the Jewish prayer book, the [[Siddur]]. This teacher was very young but with a thick, curly black beard, who combined, she wrote, “a taste for biblical grandeur with childlike naïveté.” After she demonstrated her ability to read the prayer book's morning blessing (''Modah ani lefanecha...'' (“I thank You...”), he consented to help her continue her Hebrew study. Unfortunately, she wrote, he tended to direct conversation towards social and political problems, and her language lessons with him did not long continue. She tried from time to time to study with Kantorovich's “Теория иврита”, ''Teoriya ivrita'', a book she disparaged as “clearly outdated” with Russian explanations, translation exercises from Hebrew into Russian and back, and many “completely meaningless”, context-free sentences like: “Reuben lay on the bed with a bandage on his forehead.” Later she found another teacher, but, Elisheva writes, neither he nor she had suitable textbooks. Though that teacher had taught for many years, he had never taught the direct method, so they had to make use of Kantorovich's book. From 1918 to 1919 she studied with another Hebrew teacher, a graduate of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] in [[Jaffa]], a city that the British forces had just captured from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and which soon became part of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]]. The young man had come to Russia to visit relatives but had been drafted into the army. Wearing his regulation bulky grey uniform and so-called beetle-crusher boots, he met Elisheva in the street and the two were able to converse in Hebrew with the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] pronunciation that [[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]], the reviver of modern spoken Hebrew, was said to have preferred to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] one. “Before then,” she said, “it had not occurred to any of my teachers that it was possible to have a conversation in Hebrew.”&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;

[[Image:Elisheva poems in russian.jpg|thumb|215px|left|Elisheva's first published poems in Russian, with the illustrations of Ben-Zion Zuckerman (1904-1992).]]

==Writing career==
Beginning in 1915, Elisheva's first translations from Yiddish into Russian were published in the Russian-language Jewish journal “Еврейская Жизнь” ''Evreskaya Zhizn'' (“Jewish Life”).&lt;ref name="jwa"&gt;Jewish Women's Archive, "[http://jwa.org/people/bichovsky-elisheva Elisheva Bichovsky biography]." Retrieved 7 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; These are mainly short stories by [[Hersh Dovid Nomberg]] (1876–1927), poems by [[Shmuel-Yankev Imber]] (1889–1942?) and indirect translations, via [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]]'s Yiddish version, of the Hebrew poems of the 12th-century [[Judah Halevi]]. Later she began to translate into Russian the works of contemporary Hebrew writers such as [[Gershon Shofman]] (1880–1972) and [[Yosef Haim Brenner]] (1881–1921).&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt;

During her time in Ryazan between 1917 and 1919, as her Hebrew skills were deepening, she composed over 200 Russian poems, published by her fiancé Simeon Bikhovski in two 1919 collections, “Минуты” ''Minuty'' (“Minutes”) and “Тайные песни” ''Tainye Pesni'' (“Secret songs”). Both were published under her pseudonym “E. Lisheva” and showed a strong attachment to and longing for Jewish culture. From 1920, when she married Bikhovski, she published her first poems in Hebrew and definitively adopted the name [[Elisheba|Elisheva]]  instead of her original Russian given name Elizaveta. Apparently influenced by both her original Hebrew teacher and by her husband, she now adopted Hebrew as her sole working language and ceased writing in Russian;&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt; Simeon himself adopted the Hebrew form of his name as Shimon. They married in a civil registry office because their difference of religions prohibited a religious wedding.&lt;ref name="dorledor"/&gt;

Elisheva's poetry also appeared in the almanac ''Ha-Tkufa'' (“Epoch”, Warsaw, 1921), the magazine ''Ha-Toren'' (“The Mast”, New York, 1922), ''[[Hapoel Hatzair]]'' (“The Young Worker”, Tel Aviv, 1923) and "Ha-Olam" ( "The World", London, 1925). In 1925 the Bikhovskis moved to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]],&lt;ref name="dorledor"/&gt; with their young daughter Miriam (b. 1924), settling near the [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] in [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt; There she published two poetry collections, ''Kos ktana'' (“Small Bowl,” Tel Aviv, 1926) and ''Haruzim'' (“Rhymes,” Tel Aviv, 1928),&lt;ref name="eee1"&gt;Society for Research on Jewish Communities, [http://eleven.co.il/article/15066 Elisheva], Электронная Еврейская Энциклопедия, Vol. 10, pp. 586-588. Retrieved 8 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and her employment of Sephardic pronunciation in her poetry became the accepted norm. As one of Palestine's first Hebrew poets, Elisheva helped give form to the literary life of the emerging country,&lt;ref name="jwa"/&gt; explaining: “I can point to but one goal in my work — to aid as much as possible in the development of Hebrew poetry in the Hebrew language that we speak among ourselves every day with the Sephardic pronunciation. Therefore I have refrained from all experimentation and pursuit of new forms or innovations in my poetry, because first and foremost I want to see Hebrew poetry that is vital, natural and inextricably linked with our language and our lives.”&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt;

The Jewish public were quite moved by Elisheva's having left her people and language behind to join the Jewish newcomers in their emergent homeland in Palestine. The literary community initially greeted her with enthusiasm, arranging readings of her works, which were widely published, even to the point that her popularity aroused resentment of some young poets (the ''Ketuvim'' “Writings” group, headed by [[Avraham Shlonsky]], 1900–1973) and made her a target in their struggle against the older poets (the ''Moznayim'' “Scales” group, led by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]], of which Elisheva herself was a member). This period lasted only seven years (1925–1932), during which Elisheva produced the bulk of her Hebrew poetry, prose, essays and literary criticism, with works published in the Hebrew press in Palestine (Moznayim, Do’ar ha-Yom) and abroad (Ha-Tkufa, Ha-Toren and Ha-Olam), or in books published by her husband's publishing house, Tomer. ''Elisheva: Kovez Ma’amarim odot ha-Meshoreret Elisheva'' (“Elisheva: Collected articles about the poet Elisheva” appeared in several editions in Tel Aviv and Warsaw, beginning in 1927, and ''Meshorer ve-Adam'' (“Poet and man”), an essay on the poetry of [[Alexander Blok]], appeared in 1929). ''Kos Ketanah'' was the first book of poems by a woman poet, and ''Simta’ot'' the first novel by a woman, to be published in Palestine.&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt; Some of her small and melodious poems have been set to music, translations of individual Hebrew poems into Yiddish, Russian, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish and Welsh have been published by various periodicals, and new translations into Russian were included in a collection entitled ''Я себя до конца рассказала'' (“I told myself before the end,” Biblioteka Alia, 1981, 1990.)&lt;ref name="eee1"/&gt;

[[Image:Kinnert Cemetery - Elisheva grave.JPG|thumb|390px|right|Elisheva's grave at Kvutzat Kinneret cemetery.]]

==In later years==
Despite her writing career and his publishing business, the couple often found themselves in dire financial straits, and Elisheva was several times forced to leave her husband and daughter behind for literary tours of Jewish communities in Europe where she did poetry readings and told stories to large audiences at specially arranged events; during the school vacation in summer, her husband and daughter would accompany her. In the summer of 1932, in the midst of such a tour in [[Chișinău]] — then in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and now in [[Moldova]] — her husband, Shimon, suddenly died. Elisheva returned to Tel Aviv, sorrowing at her husband's death, and her attempts at earning a livelihood (among other things, as a librarian at Tel Aviv's [[Beit Ariela|Sha’ar Zion public library]]) were unsuccessful. Although she had earned a living from her literary tours of Europe, she and her daughter now fell into absolute poverty.&lt;ref name="jwa"/&gt; She moved into a rundown shack on the edge of [[Tel Aviv]], where she was saved from starvation when the poet [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] secured for her a modest stipend of $15 monthly from the non-profit [[Israel Matz|Israel Matz Foundation]], a New York [[nonprofit organization]] established to aid indigent Hebrew writers.&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt;

Bitter and hurt over no longer being in literary favour among the Jews of her adopted Palestinian homeland,&lt;ref name="jwa"/&gt; she cut herself off from society and ceased publishing new work. She did some translations, which she considered insignificant,&lt;ref name="jwa"/&gt; but was forced to make ends meet by working as a laundress. Her daughter Miriam Littel served in the British [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) in [[Egypt]] during [[World War I]] and in 1946 married a British soldier, with whom she had three daughters, and in 1949 Elisheva had planned to visit them in England. Because she was not feeling well, however, some friends from the [[Davar|Davar HaPoelet]] women's magazine paid for her to have a visit to the [[hot spring]]s in Tiberias, where she died of cancer on March 27, 1949. Despite the deep affection Elisheva maintained for Jewish culture and its involvement in the eventual establishment of the state of [[Israel]], she had never converted to [[Judaism]] — a fact that she never hid; she always remained an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] — so difficulties arose as to the place of burial. Only upon the intervention of the chairman of the [[Hebrew Writers Association in Israel]] was it agreed that she could be buried in the cemetery of [[Kvutzat Kinneret]], near the grave of the poet [[Rachel Bluwstein]].&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt;

==Literary critique of Elisheva==
According to Yaffah Berlovitz, Elisheva represented the early 20th-century schools of [[Futurism|Futurist]] and [[Acmeist poetry]], which supplanted the [[Russian symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] movement of the late 19th century.

:“The Acmeist school advocates short lyrical poems phrased simply, clearly and melodically, reminiscent of a painting with rapid brush strokes and a fragile, aesthetic line. ‘My poetry is brief, a cloud in the sky,’ in Elisheva’s words; nonetheless, she also incorporates anti-Acmeist elements, for example, a longing for the mysterious and dreamlike, or a reference to Symbolist expressions. These elements are the consequence of a conflicted, questioning worldview at the centre of which lies a profound sense of alienation (‘I had no mother; I will have no son’), while at the same time there is a relentless longing for an unidentified metaphysical entity (‘a God without name’) that can promise her vitality and happiness as a human being and an artist. This melancholic spiritual confession, which does not commit itself to any specific religion, also frames her poetic space as an endless pilgrimage of wandering and despair — a journey embarked on with the clear knowledge that no utopian ‘land of Avalon’ awaits her at its end (‘All my soul yearns/for the land of false hopes’).

:“This sense of a conflicted state of existence — between a reality of abandonment and exile on the one hand, and the pursuit of a promised land on the other, between the ‘grey day’ of the secular and the ‘enchanted night’ of the sacred — draws Elisheva closer to the Jewish people. She identifies her fate with theirs: ‘Only on the setting sun will my eyes gaze/Only on the Eastern Star — your heart’s lament/Who will say to us all that there is no Homeland?’ (“Galut,” Toren 57). Thus it is not surprising that she connected with [[Zionism|Zionist]] Jewish circles in particular, nor that she chose to immigrate to Palestine, which for her represented the source of creativity and inspiration: ‘When it seems to me at times that the wellspring of my poetry has run dry, I am struck by the feeling: There, in the land of beauty, the Divine Presence will shine on me once more.’

:“The poetic ''oeuvre'' of Elisheva can be divided geographically into Russian and Palestinian chapters; not so her prose, which deals solely with the reality of the early decades of the twentieth century in Russia. Her transition to prose was inspired by the poet [[Alexander Blok]], whom she regarded as her greatest teacher (‘More than ‘simply’ a poet, he is the essence of our life’). In her essay ''Meshorer ve-Adam'', she examines his writing, stressing his uniqueness, which stems from a dynamic of expansiveness that constantly leads him to a different poetic experience (thematic, genre-related or formative) and, at the very least, avoids creative stagnation. Elisheva adopted this challenging principle, expanding her horizons from the lyric poem to the short story, and from the lyrical short story to the realistic novel.

:“Each of her six short stories revolves around a woman who speaks of herself in the third person, against the backdrop of her own life story and environment. Although the setting differs from story to story, all of the protagonists seem drawn from the same ‘confessional I’ that is so dominant in Elisheva’s poems as well. It is the portrait of a woman unable to communicate with those around her; amid the conflict between herself and her surroundings, she constructs — in a manner unique to her — her own inner spiritual dream-world, which she inhabits with intensity — as in ''Yamim Arukim'' (“Long days”) and ''Ha-Emet'' (“The truth”). This imaginary spiritual world also reinforces the Jewish-Christian conflict, which is expressed primarily within the framework of male-female relationships (Jewish woman/Christian man — ''Malkat ha-Ivrim'' (“Queen of the Hebrews”); Christian woman/Jewish man — ''Nerot Shabbat'' (“Sabbath candles”), which refers to Elisheva herself: ‘Because I have two souls — one Russian and one Hebrew.’

:“This conflict is further developed in her novel ''Simta’ot'', which deals with Moscow of the early 1920s, during the brief period when [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was in power and attempted to restore the collapsing Soviet economy. Elisheva offers us a glimpse into Moscow’s bohemian scene at this historical juncture, with its ''mélange'' of men and women, Christians and Jews, engaged in the various arts; through them, she examines the cultural-political upheaval of post-revolution Russia, combining feminist tendencies on the one hand with Zionist leanings on the other. There is no question that through this novel Elisheva contributed thematic constructs previously unknown to Hebrew literature in both Palestine and the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]]: a depiction of the “new woman” of the post-[[World War I]] era; the self-portrait of woman-as-creator; and the dialogue between Christians and Jews, as seen from a non-Jewish perspective.

:“Elisheva was received with ambivalence by the Jewish public in the Diaspora and in Palestine. On the one hand, Jews were flattered by her decision to work in Hebrew (‘the language of the heart and of twilight,’ as she put it); not without reason was she referred to as ‘Ruth from the banks of the [[Volga River|Volga]]’ (in an allusion to the biblical [[Book of Ruth|Ruth the Moabite]]). On the other hand, there were critics who attacked the quality of her writing and the level of her Hebrew, arguing that her work was highly overrated. Not so today. A fresh reading of her work, especially from a [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist perspective]], reveals a creative diversity that enriched modern Hebrew poetry and prose with a feminine voice all its own — a voice that offered not only content and range but an inner rhythm with its own unique meter and cadence. At a time when the majority of poets based themselves on the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] pronunciation of the Diaspora, she was one of the first to accentuate her verse according to the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] stress on the final syllable (which eventually became the dominant form in Palestine and, later, in Israel).”&lt;ref name="berlovitz"/&gt;

{{Spirituality sidebar}}

'''Gnosticism''' (from {{lang-grc|γνωστικός}} ''gnostikos'', "having knowledge", from {{lang|grc|γνῶσις}} {{transl|grc|''gnōsis''}}, knowledge) is a modern name for a variety of ancient religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish-Christian [[Social environment|milieux]] in the first and second century AD. These systems believed that the material world is created by an emanation of the highest God, trapping the [[divine spark]] within the human body. This divine spark could be liberated by ''[[gnosis]]''. Some of the core teachings include the following:
# All matter is evil, and the non-material, spirit-realm is good.	
# There is an unknowable God, who gave rise to many lesser spirit beings called [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeons]].	
# The creator of the (material) universe is not the supreme god, but an inferior spirit	
# Gnosticism does not deal with "sin", only ignorance.	
# To achieve salvation, one needs to get in touch with secret knowledge.

The Gnostic ideas and systems flourished in the Mediterranean world in the second century AD, in conjunction with and influenced by the early Christian movements and [[Middle Platonism]]. After the second century, a decline set in, but Gnosticism persisted throughout the centuries as an undercurrent of Western culture, remanifesting with the [[Renaissance]] as [[Western esotericism]], taking prominence with modern [[spirituality]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In the Persian Empire, Gnosticism spread as far as China with [[Manicheism]], while [[Mandaeism]] is still alive in Iraq.

A major question in scholarly research is the qualification of Gnosticism, based on the study of its texts, as either an interreligious phenomenon or as an independent religion.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Gnosis}}
''Gnosis'' refers to knowledge based on personal experience or perception. In a religious context, ''gnosis'' is [[Mysticism|mystical]] or esoteric [[knowledge]] based on direct participation with the divine. In most Gnostic systems, the sufficient cause of salvation is this "knowledge of" ("acquaintance with") the divine. It is an inward "knowing", comparable to that encouraged by [[Plotinus]] ([[neoplatonism]]), and differs from Christian proto-orthodox views.{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|p=185}} Gnostics are "those who are oriented toward knowledge and understanding&amp;nbsp;– or perception and learning&amp;nbsp;– as a particular modality for living".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valantasis |first1=Richard |title=The Beliefnet Guide to Gnosticiam and Other Vanished Christianities |publisher=Beliefnet |year=2006 |isbn=978-0385514552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual meaning of ''gnostikos'' in Classical Greek texts is "learned" or "intellectual", such as used by Plato in the comparison of "practical" (''praktikos'') and "intellectual" (''gnostikos'').{{refn|group=note|In Plato's dialogue between Young Socrates and the Foreigner in his ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' (258e).{{refn|group=subnote|perseus.tufts.edu, LSJ entry: '''γνωστ-ικός, ή, όν,''' A. of or for knowing, cognitive: ἡ -κή (sc. ἐπιστήμη), theoretical science (opp. πρακτική), Pl.Plt.258e, etc.; τὸ γ. ib.261b; "ἕξεις γ." Arist.AP0.100a11 (Comp.); "γ. εἰκόνες" Hierocl.in CA25p.475M.: c. gen., able to discern, Ocell. 2.7. Adv. "-κῶς" Procl.Inst.39, Dam.Pr.79, Phlp.in Ph.241.22.{{r|perseus_LSJ|group=web}}}}}} Plato's use of "learned" is fairly typical of Classical texts.{{refn|group=note|10x [[Plato]], Cratylus, Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman 2x [[Plutarch]], Compendium libri de animae procreatione + De animae procreatione in Timaeo, 2x [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], De musica{{r|perseus_gnostikos|group=web}}}}

By the [[Hellenistic period]], it began to also be associated with [[Greco-Roman mysteries]], becoming synonymous with the Greek term ''musterion''. The adjective is not used in the New Testament, but [[Clement of Alexandria]]{{refn|group=note|In Book 7 of his ''[[Stromateis]]''}} speaks of the "learned" (''gnostikos'') Christian in complimentary terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morton Smith]] ''History of the term gnostikos'' 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''gnostikos'' in relation to heresy originates with interpreters of [[Irenaeus]]. Some scholars{{refn|group=note|For example A. Rousseau and L. Doutreleau, translators of the French edition (1974),{{sfn|Rousseau|Doutreleau|1974}}}} consider that Irenaeus sometimes uses ''gnostikos'' to simply mean "intellectual",{{refn|group=note|As in 1.25.6, 1.11.3, 1.11.5.}} whereas his mention of "the intellectual sect"{{refn|group=note|Adv. haer. 1.11.1}} is a specific designation.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=36}}{{refn|group=note|Irenaeus' [[comparative adjective]] ''gnostikeron'' "more learned", evidently cannot mean "more Gnostic" as a name.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=36}}}}{{refn|group=note|Williams: "But several of Irenaeus's uses of the designation gnostikos are more ambiguous, and it is not so clear whether he is indicating the specific sect again or using 'gnostics' now merely as a shorthand reference for virtually all of the"; p. 37: "They argue that Irenaeus uses ''gnostikos'' in two senses: (1) with the term's 'basic and customary meaning' of 'learned' (savant), and (2) with reference to adherents of the specific sect called 'the gnostic heresy' in Adv. haer. 1.11.1."; p. 271: "1.25.6 where they think that ''gnostikos'' means 'learned' are in 1.11.3 ('A certain other famous teacher of theirs, reaching for a doctrine more lofty and learned [''gnostikoteron'']&amp;nbsp;...') and 1.11.5 ('...&amp;nbsp;in order that they [i.e.,])."{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=36}}{{clarify|post-text=(Did part of the quote get deleted?)|date=May 2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|Of those groups that Irenaeus identifies as "intellectual" (''gnostikos''), only one, the followers of [[Marcellina (gnostic)|Marcellina]] use the term ''gnostikos'' of themselves.{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=42–43}}{{refn|group=subnote|Williams: "On the other hand, the one group whom Irenaeus does explicitly mention as users of this self-designation, the followers of the Second Century teacher Marcellina, are not included in Layton's anthology at all, on the grounds that their doctrines are not similar to those of the "classic" gnostics. As we have seen, Epiphanius is one of the witnesses for the existence of a special sect called 'the gnostics', and yet Epiphanius himself seems to distinguish between these people and 'the Sethians' (Pan 40.7.5), whereas Layton treats them as both under the 'classic gnostic' category."{{sfn|Williams|1999|p=42-43}}}} Later [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] uses "learned" (''gnostikos'') of [[Cerinthus]] and the [[Ebionites]], and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] applied "learned" (''gnostikos'') to specific groups.}}

The term "Gnosticism" does not appear in ancient sources,{{sfn|Dunderberg|2008|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|Dunderberg: "The problems with the term 'Gnosticism' itself are now well known. It does not appear in ancient sources at all"{{sfn|Dunderberg|2008|p=16}}}} and was first coined in the 17th century by [[Henry More]] in a commentary on the seven letters of the [[Book of Revelation]], where More used the term "Gnosticisme" to describe the heresy in [[Thyatira]].{{sfn|Pearson|2004|p=210}}{{refn|group=note|Pearson: "As Bentley Layton points out, the term Gnosticism was first coined by [[Henry More]] (1614–1687) in an expository work on the seven letters of the Book of Revelation.29 More used the term Gnosticisme to describe the heresy in Thyatira."{{sfn|Pearson|2004|p=210}}}} The term ''Gnosticism'' was derived from the use of the Greek adjective ''gnostikos'' (Greek γνωστικός, "learned", "intellectual") by St. Irenaeus (c. 185&amp;nbsp;AD) to describe the school of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] as ''he legomene gnostike haeresis'' "the heresy called Learned (gnostic)."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Charles Haar ''Simon Magus: the first gnostic?'' p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|This occurs in the context of Irenaeus' work ''On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis'', (Greek: ''elenchos kai anatrope tes pseudonymou gnoseos'', ἔλεγχος καὶ ἀνατροπὴ τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως) where the term "knowledge falsely so-called" (''pseudonymos gnosis'') is a quotation of the [[apostle Paul]]'s warning against "knowledge falsely so-called" in {{bibleref2|1 Timothy|6:20}}, and covers various groups, not just Valentinus.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic J. Unger, John J. Dillon, 1992. ''St. Irenaeus of Lyons Against the heresies'', Vol.1 p. 3. Quote: "the final phrase of the title 'knowledge falsely so-called' is found in 1 Timothy 6:20."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins==
The earliest origins of Gnosticism are obscure and still disputed. The Christian groups called Gnostics a heresy of Christianity,{{refn|group=note|[[Clement of Alexandria]]: "In the times of the [[Emperor Hadrian]] appeared those who devised heresies, and they continued until the age of the elder [[Antoninus Pius|Antoninus]]."{{sfn|Huidekoper|1891|p=331}}}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/Early-heretical-movements#ref300775|title=Early heretical movements|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britannica.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the modern scholars the theology's origin is closely related to Jewish sectarian milieus and early Christian sects.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515-3516}}{{sfn|Cohen|Mendes-Flohr|2010|p=286}}{{refn|group=note|name="Cohen"}}{{sfn|Brakke|2011}} Scholars debate Gnosticism's origins as having roots in [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Buddhism]], due to similarities in beliefs, but ultimately, its origins are currently unknown. As Christianity developed and became more popular, so did Gnosticism with both groups often existing in the same places. The Gnostic belief was widespread within Christianity until Christianity expelled the group in the second and third centuries (C.E.). Gnosticism became the first group to be declared [[heresy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Gnosticism|title=Gnosticism|last=|first=|date=June 23, 2017|website=newworldencyclopedia.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars prefer to speak of "gnosis" when referring to first-century ideas that later developed into gnosticism, and to reserve the term "gnosticism" for the synthesis of these ideas into a coherent movement in the second century.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R. McL. "Nag Hammadi and the New Testament", ''New Testament Studies'', vol. 28, (1982), p.292.&lt;/ref&gt; No gnostic texts have been discovered that pre-date Christianity,{{refn|group=note|Robinson: "At this stage we have not found any Gnostic texts that clearly antedate the origin of Christianity."  J. M. Robinson, "Sethians and Johannine Thought: The Trimorphic Protennoia and the Prologue of the Gospel of John" in ''The Rediscovery of Gnosticism'', vol. 2, Sethian Gnosticism, ed. B. Layton (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p.662.}} and "pre-Christian Gnosticism as such is hardly attested in a way to settle the debate once and for all."&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Robinson, "Jesus: From Easter to Valentinus (Or to the Apostles' Creed)", ''Journal of Biblical Literature'', 101 (1982), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judeo-Christian origins===
{{See also|Origins of Christianity|Jewish Christian|Split of Christianity and Judaism}}
Contemporary scholarship largely agrees that Gnosticism has Jewish or Judeo-Christian origins, originating in the late first century AD in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}}{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515-3516}}{{sfn|Cohen|Mendes-Flohr|2010|p=286}}{{refn|group=note|name="Cohen"}}

Many heads of gnostic schools were identified as [[Jewish Christians]] by Church Fathers, and Hebrew words and names of God were applied in some gnostic systems.&lt;ref name="JE-G"&gt;Jewish Encyclopedia, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=280&amp;letter=G&amp;search=gnosticism#ixzz1L59waxy8 Gnosticism]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[religious cosmology|cosmogonic]] speculations among Christian Gnostics had partial origins in [[Ma`aseh Bereshit]] and [[Merkabah|Ma`aseh Merkabah]]. This thesis is most notably put forward by [[Gershom Scholem]] (1897–1982) and [[Gilles Quispel]] (1916–2006). Scholem detected Jewish ''gnosis'' in the imagery of the [[merkavah]], which can also be found in "Christian" Gnostic documents, for example the being "caught away" to the [[Third_Heaven#Christianity|third heaven]] mentioned by [[Paul the Apostle]].{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}} Quispel sees Gnosticism as an independent Jewish development, tracing its origins to Alexandrian Jews, to which group Valentinus was also connected.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3534}} According to Robert M. Grant, Gnosticism developed out of "the remains of apocalyptic eschatological expectations after the fall of Jerusalem", which shattered the hopes of the coming of God's kingdom on earth and led to a rejection of the world. Gnosticism united material from the "outer fringes of Judaism" such as the [[Essenes]] and the Diaspora Judaism of the Aramaic Syro-Mesopotamian world.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3534}}

Many of the [[Nag Hammadi texts]] make reference to Judaism, in some cases with a violent rejection of the Jewish God.{{sfn|Cohen|Mendes-Flohr|2010|p=286}}{{refn|group=note|name="Cohen"|Cohen &amp; Mendes-Flohr: "Recent research, however, has tended to emphasize that Judaism, rather than Persia, was a major origin of Gnosticism. Indeed, it appears increasingly evident that many of the newly published Gnostic texts were written in a context from which Jews were not absent. In some cases, indeed, a violent rejection of the Jewish God, or of Judaism, seems to stand at the basis of these texts. ... facie, various trends in Jewish thought and literature of the Second Commonwealth appear to have been potential factors in Gnostic origins.{{sfn|Cohen|Mendes-Flohr|2010|p=286}}}} [[Gershom Scholem]] once described Gnosticism as "the Greatest case of metaphysical anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-503607-7 | last = Gager | first = John G.  | title = The origins of anti-semitism: attitudes toward Judaism in pagan and Christian antiquity | page = 168 | date = 1985-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Steven Bayme]] said gnosticism would be better characterized as [[anti-Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries by [[Steven Bayme]] Publisher: Ktav Publishing House {{ISBN|0-88125-554-8}} {{ISBN|978-0-88125-554-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=56QJ9O7MFJ4C&amp;pg=PA122&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=gershom+scholem+gnosticism+anti-semitic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qKECnoMshu&amp;sig=wdV7x2W3FJjtdmWVCSgyrMigPyE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EAELStOJDYuMtgemr5HFAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research into the origins of Gnosticism shows a strong Jewish influence, particularly from [[Merkabah#Hekhalot|Hekhalot]] literature.&lt;ref name="Kabbalah New Perspectives"&gt;Idel, Moshe.

Within early Christianity, the teachings of Paul and John may have been a starting point for Gnostic ideas, with a growing emphasis on the opposition between flesh and spirit, the value of charisma, and the disqualification of the Jewish law. The mortal body belonged to the world of the ''archons'', and only the spirit or soul could be saved. The term ''gnostikos'' may have acquired a deeper significance here.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3516}}

Alexandria was of central importance for the birth of Gnosticism. The Christian ''ecclesia'' (i. e. congregation, church) was of Jewish–Christian origin, but also attracted Greek members, and various strand of thought were available, such as "Judaic [[apocalypticism]], [[Wisdom (personification)|speculation on divine wisdom]], Greek philosophy, and Hellenistic [[mystery religions]]."{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3516}}

Regarding the angel Christology of some early Christians, Darrell Hannah notes:
{{quote|[Some] early Christians understood the pre-incarnate Christ, ontologically, as an angel. This "true" angel Christology took many forms and may have appeared as early as the late First Century, if indeed this is the view opposed in the early chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The [[Elchasaites]], or at least Christians influenced by them, paired the male Christ with the female Holy Spirit, envisioning both as two gigantic angels. Some Valentinian Gnostics supposed that Christ took on an angelic nature that he might be the Saviour of angels. The author of the ''Testament of Solomon'' held Christ to be a particularly effective "thwarting" angel in the exorcism of demons. The author of ''De Centesima'' and Epiphanius’ "Ebionites" held Christ to have been the highest and most important of the first created archangels, a view similar in many respects to Hermas’ equation of Christ with Michael. Finally, a possible exegetical tradition behind the ''Ascension of Isaiah'' and attested by Origen's Hebrew master, may witness to yet another angel Christology, as well as an angel Pneumatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hannah|first=Darrell D.|title=Michael and Christ: Michael Traditions and Angel Christology in Early Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKtXVU9EQTIC&amp;pg=PA214|year=1999|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-147054-7|page=214f}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudepigraphical]] Christian text ''[[Ascension of Isaiah]]'' identifies Jesus with angel Christology:

[[The Shepherd of Hermas]] is a Christian literary work considered as [[biblical canon|canonical scripture]] by some of the early [[Church fathers]] such as [[Irenaeus]]. Jesus is identified with angel Christology in parable 5, when the author mentions a Son of God, as a virtuous man filled with a Holy "pre-existent spirit".&lt;ref name="Papandrea2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Papandrea|first=James L.|title=The Earliest Christologies: Five Images of Christ in the Postapostolic Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_akCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|date=24 April 2016|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-5127-0|page=29|quote=The most prominent example of Angel Adoptionism from the early Church would have to be the document known as ''The Shepherd'' of Hermass.

===Neoplatonic influences===
{{See also|Platonic Academy|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism|Neoplatonism and Christianity}}
In the 1880s Gnostic connections with neo-Platonism were proposed.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} Ugo Bianchi, who organised the Congress of Messina of 1966 on the origins of Gnosticism, also argued for Orphic and Platonic origins.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3534}} Gnostics borrowed significant ideas and terms from Platonism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearson|first=Birger A.|date=1984|title=Gnosticism as Platonism: With Special Reference to Marsanes (NHC 10,1)|journal=The Harvard Theological Review|volume=77|issue=1|pages=55–72|jstor=1509519}}&lt;/ref&gt;, using Greek philosophical concepts throughout their text, including such concepts as [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] (reality, existence), ''[[ousia]]'' (essence, substance, being), and demiurge (creator God). Both [[Sethian]] Gnostics and [[Valentinius|Valentinian]] Gnostics seem to have been influenced by [[Plato]], [[Middle Platonism]], and [[Neo-Pythagoreanism]] academies or schools of thought.{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=59}} Both schools attempted "an effort towards conciliation, even affiliation" with late antique philosophy,&lt;ref name ="Schenke1"&gt;Schenke, Hans Martin. "The Phenomenon and Significance of Gnostic Sethianism" in The Rediscovery of Gnosticism. E. J. Brill 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and were rebuffed by some [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], including Plotinus.

===Persian origins or influences===
Early research into the origins of Gnosticism proposed Persian origins or influences, spreading to Europe and incorporating Jewish elements.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3531}} According to [[Wilhelm Bousset]] (1865–1920), Gnosticism was a form of Iranian and Mesopotamian syncretism,{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} and [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931) most famously situated the origins of Gnosticism in Persia.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}

Carsten Colpe (b. 1929) has analyzed and criticised the Iranian hypothesis of Reitzenstein, showing that many of his hypotheses are untenable.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3534–3535}} Nevertheless, Geo Widengren (1907–1996) argued for the origin of (Mandaean) Gnosticism in [[Mazdean]] (Zoroastrianism) [[Zurvanism]], in conjunction with ideas from the Aramaic Mesopotamian world.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3534}}

===Buddhist parallels===
{{main|Buddhism and Gnosticism}}
In 1966, at the Congress of Median, Buddhologist [[Edward Conze]] noted phenomenological commonalities between [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and Gnosticism,{{sfn|Verardi|1997|p=323}} in his paper ''Buddhism and Gnosis'', following an early suggestion put forward by [[Isaac Jacob Schmidt]].{{sfn|Conze|1967}}{{refn|group=note|The idea that Gnosticism was derived from Buddhism was first proposed by the Victorian gem collector and numismatist [[Charles William King]] (1864).&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Clare Goodrick-Clarke ''[[G. R. S. Mead]] and the Gnostic Quest'' 2005 p8. Quote: "The idea that Gnosticism was derived from Buddhism was first postulated by Charles William King in his classic work, The Gnostics and their Remains (1864). He was one of the earliest and most emphatic scholars to propose the Gnostic debt to Buddhist thought."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Longueville Mansel|Mansel]] (1875) &lt;ref&gt;H. L. Mansel, Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries (1875); p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; considered the principal sources of Gnosticism to be Platonism, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J p. 490 ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley&amp;nbsp;— 1982. Quote: "Mansel&amp;nbsp;... summed up the principal sources of Gnosticism in these three: Platonism, the Persian religion, and the Buddhism of India."&lt;/ref&gt;}} The influence of Buddhism in any sense on either the ''gnostikos'' Valentinus (c.{{nbsp}}170) or the Nag Hammadi texts (3rd century) is not supported by modern scholarship, although [[Elaine Pagels]] (1979) called it a "possibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I8ySs4eusoC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=elaine%20pagels&amp;pg=PR21#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhism&amp;f=false|title=The Gnostic Gospels|publisher=|isbn=9780679724537|last1=Pagels|first1=Elaine H|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Cosmology===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The Syrian–Egyptian traditions postulate a remote, supreme Godhead, the [[monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]]. From this highest divinity [[emanationism|emanate]] lower divine beings, known as [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeons]]. The [[Demiurge]], one of those Aeons, creates the physical world. Divine elements "fall" into the material realm, and are locked within human beings. This divine element returns to the divine realm when Gnosis, [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] or [[Intuition (psychology)|intuitive knowledge]] of the divine element within, is obtained.

===Dualism and monism===
Gnostic systems postulate a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between God and the world,&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Gnostic Religion'', p. 42, Beacon Press, 1963, {{ISBN|0-8070-5799-1}}; 1st ed. 1958&lt;/ref&gt; varying from the "radical dualist" systems of [[Manichaeism]] to the "mitigated dualism" of classic gnostic movements. Radical dualism, or absolute dualism, posits two co-equal divine forces, while in ''mitigated dualism'' one of the two principles is in some way inferior to the other. In ''qualified monism'' the second entity may be divine or semi-divine. Valentinian Gnosticism is a form of [[monism]], expressed in terms previously used in a dualistic manner.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Moral and ritual practice===
Gnostics tended toward [[asceticism]], especially in their sexual and dietary practice.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Bentley (1987). The Gnostic Scriptures. SCM Press&amp;nbsp;— Introduction to "Against Heresies" by St. Irenaeus&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas of morality, Gnostics were less rigorously ascetic, and took a more moderate approach to correct behaviour. In normative early Christianity the [[local church|Church]] administered and prescribed the correct behaviour for Christians, while in Gnosticism it was the internalised motivation that was important. Ritualistic behaviour was not important unless it was based on a personal, internal motivation. Ptolemy's ''Epistle to Flora'' describes a general asceticism, based on the moral inclination of the individual.{{refn|group=note|[[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], in ''Letter to Flora'': "External physical fasting is observed even among our followers, for it can be of some benefit to the soul if it is engaged in with reason (''[[logos]]''), whenever it is done neither by way of limiting others, nor out of habit, nor because of the day, as if it had been specially appointed for that purpose."}}

==Concepts==

===Monad===
{{Main|Monad (Gnosticism)}}
In many Gnostic systems, God is known as the ''Monad'', [[Neoplatonism#The One|the One]].{{refn|group=note|Other names include [[Absolute (philosophy)|The Absolute]], ''Aion teleos'' (The Perfect [[Æon]]), ''Bythos'' (Depth or Profundity, Βυθος), ''Proarkhe'' (Before the Beginning, προαρχη), and ''HE Arkhe'' (The Beginning, ἡ ἀρχή).}} God is the high source of the pleroma, the region of light. The various emanations of God are called æons. According to Hippolytus, this view was inspired by the [[Pythagoreans]], who called the first thing that came into existence the ''Monad'', which begat the dyad, which begat the numbers, which begat the [[Point (geometry)|point]], begetting [[Line (geometry)|lines]], etc.

The Sethian cosmogony as most famously contained in the Apocryphon ("Secret book") of John describes an unknown God, very similar to the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[apophatic theology]], but different from the orthodox teachings that this God is the creator of heaven and earth. Orthodox theologians often attempt to define God through a series of explicit positive statements: he is [[omniscient]], [[omnipotent]], and truly [[Omnibenevolence|benevolent]]. The Sethian hidden transcendent God is, by contrast, defined through [[negative theology]]: he is immovable, invisible, intangible, ineffable; commonly, "he" is seen as being [[hermaphroditic]], a potent symbol for being, as it were, "all-containing". In the [[Apocryphon of John]], this god is good in that it bestows goodness. After the apophatic statements, the process of the Divine in action are used to describe the effect of such a god.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--The verb does not match the subject ("process"). Either the subject needs to be made plural or the verb needs to be made singular, or the sentence needs re-wording. I don't know if "the processes of the Divine in action" makes sense.--&gt;

===Pleroma===
{{Main|Pleroma}}
''Pleroma'' (Greek πληρωμα, "fullness") refers to the totality of God's powers. The heavenly pleroma is the center of divine life, a region of light "above" (the term is not to be understood spatially) our world, occupied by spiritual beings such as aeons (eternal beings) and sometimes archons. Jesus is interpreted as an intermediary aeon who was sent from the pleroma, with whose aid humanity can recover the lost knowledge of the divine origins of humanity. The term is thus a central element of Gnostic [[cosmology]].

Pleroma is also used in the general Greek language, and is used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox church]] in this general form, since the word appears in the book of [[Colossians]]. Proponents of the view that [[Gnosticism and the New Testament|Paul was actually a gnostic]], such as [[Elaine Pagels]], view the reference in Colossians as a term that has to be interpreted in a gnostic sense.

===Emanation===
{{Main|Emanationism}}
The Supreme Light or Consciousness descends through a series of stages, gradations, worlds, or hypostases, becoming progressively more material and embodied. In time it will turn around to return to the One (epistrophe), retracing its steps through spiritual knowledge and contemplation.

===Aeon===
{{Main|Aeon (Gnosticism)}}
In many Gnostic systems, the aeons are the various emanations of the superior God or Monad. From this first being, also an æon, a series of different emanations occur, beginning in certain Gnostic texts with the [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] Barbelo,&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allogenes"&gt;{{cite web | title=Allogenes | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library | url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/allogene.html | accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trimorph"&gt;{{cite web | title=Trimorphic Protennoia | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library |url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/trimorph.html | accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which successive pairs of aeons emanate, often in male–female pairings called ''syzygies''.&lt;ref name="valen_syzygy"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Pair (Syzygy) in Valentinian Thought | url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Syzygy_Valentinian.htm | accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of these pairings varied from text to text, though some identify their number as being thirty.&lt;ref name="fragments_mead"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fragments of a Faith Forgotten | last=Mead | first=G.R.S. | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | isbn=978-1-4179-8413-8 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aeons as a totality constitute the ''pleroma'', the "region of light". The lowest regions of the pleroma are closest to the darkness; that is, the physical world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gnostickabbalah.wordpress.com/gnosticism/|title=Gnosticism|date=2016-11-24|work=Gnostic Kabbalah|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most commonly paired æons were Christ and ''Sophia'' (Greek: "Wisdom"); the latter refers to Christ as her "consort" in ''A Valentinian Exposition''.&lt;ref name="valen_expos"&gt;{{cite web | title=A Valentinian Exposition | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library | url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/valex.html | accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sophia===
{{Main|Sophia (Gnosticism)}}
In Gnostic tradition, the term ''Sophia'' (Σoφíα, Greek for "wisdom") refers to the final and lowest emanation of God. In most if not all versions of the gnostic myth, Sophia births the demiurge, who in turn brings about the creation of materiality. The positive or negative depiction of materiality thus resides a great deal on mythic depictions of Sophia's actions. She is occasionally referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] equivalent of ''Achamoth'' (this is a feature of Ptolemy's version of the Valentinian gnostic myth). Jewish Gnosticism with a focus on Sophia was active by 90&amp;nbsp;AD.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

''Sophia'', emanating without her partner, resulted in the production of the ''Demiurge'' (Greek: lit. "public builder"),&lt;ref name="newad_demi"&gt;{{cite web | title=Demiurge | publisher="Catholic encyclopedia" | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm | accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also referred to as ''Yaldabaoth'' and variations thereof in some Gnostic texts.&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt; This creature is concealed outside the pleroma;&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt; in isolation, and thinking itself alone, it creates materiality and a host of co-actors, referred to as archons. The demiurge is responsible for the creation of mankind; trapping elements of the pleroma stolen from Sophia inside human bodies.&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hypostasis&gt;{{cite web | title=The Hypostasis of the Archons | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library | url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/hypostas.html | accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Godhead emanates two savior aeons, ''Christ'' and ''the Holy Spirit''; Christ then embodies itself in the form of Jesus, in order to be able to teach man how to achieve gnosis, by which they may return to the pleroma.&lt;ref name="nhlintro"/&gt;

===Demiurge===
[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'' may be a depiction of [[Demiurge#Yaldabaoth|Yaldabaoth]], the Demiurge; however, cf. [[Mithraism#Lion_headed_figure|Mithraic Zervan Akarana]]&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Joseph: ''Occidental Mythology'', page 262. Penguin Arkana, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Demiurge}}
The term ''demiurge'' derives from the [[Latin]]ized form of the Greek term ''dēmiourgos'', δημιουργός, literally "public or skilled worker".{{refn|group=note|The term ''dēmiourgos'' occurs in a number of other religious and philosophical systems, most notably Platonism. The gnostic demiurge bears resemblance to figures in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In ''Timaeus'', the ''demiourgós'' is a central figure, a benevolent creator of the universe who works to make the universe as benevolent as the limitations of matter will allow. In ''The Republic'' the description of the leontomorphic "desire" in [[Socrates]]' model of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] bears a resemblance to descriptions of the demiurge as being in the shape of the lion.{{refn|group=note|The relevant passage of ''The Republic'' was found within the [[Nag Hammadi library]],&lt;ref name="nhlrepublic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/plato.html | title = Plato, Republic 588A-589B | publisher = "The Gnostic Society Library | accessdate = 2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein a text existed describing the demiurge as a "lion-faced serpent".&lt;ref name="apocryphon"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl_sbj.htm | title = The Apocryphon of John | publisher = The Gnostic Society Library | accessdate = 2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}} This figure is also called "Yaldabaoth",&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt; [[Samael]] ([[Aramaic]]: ''sæmʻa-ʼel'', "blind god"), or "Saklas" ([[Syriac language|Syriac]]: ''sækla'', "the foolish one"), who is sometimes ignorant of the superior god, and sometimes opposed to it; thus in the latter case he is correspondingly malevolent. Other names or identifications are [[Ahriman]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Satan]], and [[Yahweh]].

The demiurge creates the [[physical universe]] and the physical aspect of [[Human nature|humanity]].&lt;ref name="na_demiurge"&gt;{{cite web | title=Demiurge | publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04707b.htm | accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demiurge typically creates a group of co-actors named [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]] who preside over the material realm and, in some cases, present obstacles to the soul seeking ascent from it.&lt;ref name="apocryphon" /&gt; The inferiority of the demiurge's creation may be compared to the technical inferiority of a work of art, painting, sculpture, etc. to the thing the art [[mimesis|represents]]. In other cases it takes on a more [[ascetic]] tendency to view material existence negatively, which then becomes more extreme when materiality, including the human body, is perceived as evil and constrictive, a deliberate prison for its inhabitants.

Moral judgements of the demiurge vary from group to group within the broad category of Gnosticism, viewing materiality as being inherently evil, or as merely flawed and as good as its passive constituent matter allows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/demiurge.aspx|title=demiurge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archon===
{{Main|Archon (Gnosticism)}}
In late antiquity some variants of Gnosticism used the term archon to refer to several servants of the demiurge.&lt;ref name=hypostasis /&gt; In this context they may be seen as having the roles of the [[angel]]s and demons of the [[Old Testament]].

According to [[Origen]]'s ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', a sect called the [[Ophites]] posited the existence of seven archons, beginning with Iadabaoth or Ialdabaoth, who created the six that follow: Iao, [[Sabaoth]], Adonaios, Elaios, Astaphanos, and Horaios.&lt;ref name="contra_celsum"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cotra Celsum | author=Origen | publisher=The Gnostic Society Library | url=http://www.gnosis.org/library/orig_cc6.htm | accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the [[Mithraic]] [[Chronos|Kronos]] and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Narasimha]], a form of [[Vishnu]], Ialdabaoth had a head of a lion.&lt;ref name=apocryphon /&gt;&lt;ref name="mithraic_art"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mithraic Art | url=http://www.public-domain-content.com/books/classic_greece_rome/mom/mom10.shtml | accessdate=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="narashimba"&gt;{{cite web | title=Narashimba | publisher=Manas: Indian Religions | url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Religions/Avatars/Narasi.html | accessdate=2009-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other concepts===
Other Gnostic concepts are:{{sfn|Pagels|1975}}
* [[sarkic]] – earthly, hidebound, ignorant, uninitiated. The lowest level of human thought; the fleshly, instinctive level of thinking.  
* [[hylic]] – lowest order of the three types of human. Unable to be saved since their thinking is entirely material, incapable of understanding the gnosis.  
* psychic – "soulful", partially initiated. Matter-dwelling spirits
* [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatic]] – "spiritual", fully initiated, immaterial souls escaping the doom of the material world via gnosis.
* [[kenoma]] – the visible or manifest cosmos, "lower" than the pleroma
* [[charisma]] – gift, or energy, bestowed by pneumatics through oral teaching and personal encounters
* [[logos]] – the divine ordering principle of the cosmos; personified as Christ. See also [[Odic force]].
* [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]] – literally "that which stands beneath" the inner reality, emanation (appearance) of God, known to psychics
* [[ousia]] – essence of God, known to pneumatics. Specific individual things or being.

==Jesus as Gnostic saviour==
Jesus is identified by some Gnostics as an embodiment of the [[God|supreme being]] who became [[incarnate]] to bring ''gnōsis'' to the earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roukema|first=Riemer|title=Jesus, Gnosis and Dogma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfcRBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-61585-5|page=53|chapter=Jesus′ Origin and Identity – Theodotus &amp;#91;of Byzantium&amp;#93;|quote=The Saviour, jesus Christ, who from the fullness (the ''pleroma'') of the Father descended on earth, is identified with the Logos, but initially not entirely with the Only Begotten Son.

==Development==
Three periods can be discerned in the development of Gnosticism:{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}}
* Late first century and early second century: development of Gnostic ideas, contemporaneous with the writing of the New Testament;
* mid-second century to early third century: high point of the classical Gnostic teachers and their systems, "who claimed that their systems represented the inner truth revealed by Jesus";{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}}
* end of second century to fourth century: reaction by the proto-orthodox church and condemnation as heresy, and subsequent decline.

During the first period, three types of tradition developed:{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}}
* Genesis was reinterpreted in Jewish milieus, viewing Jahweh as a jealous God who enslaved people; freedom was to be obtained from this jealous God;
* A wisdom tradition developed, in which Jesus' sayings were interpreted as pointers to an esoteric wisdom, in which the soul could be divinized through identification with wisdom.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Earl Doherty]], a prominent proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]], the [[Q source|Q-authors]] may have regarded themselves as "spokespersons for the Wisdom of God'', with Jesus being the [[Wisdom (personification)|embodiment of this Wisdom]]. In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus.&lt;ref name="JP-PPCO"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Jesus Puzzle: Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins |last=Doherty |first=Earl |journal=[[Journal of Higher Criticism]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1997 |url=http://jesuspuzzle.humanists.net/jhcjp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Some of Jesus' sayings may have been incorporated into the gospels to put a limit on this development. The conflicts described in 1 Corinthians may have been inspired by a clash between this wisdom tradition and Paul's gospel of crucifixion and arising;{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}}
* A mythical story developed about the descent of a heavenly creature to reveal the Divine world as the true home of human beings.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} Jewish Christianity saw the Messiah, or Christ, as "an eternal aspect of God's hidden nature, his "spirit" and "truth", who revealed himself throughout sacred history".{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3516}}

The movement spread in areas controlled by the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Arianism|Arian]] Goths,{{sfn|Halsall|2008|p=293}} and the [[Parthian Empire|Persian Empire]]. It continued to develop in the Mediterranean and Middle East before and during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, but decline also set in during the third century, due to a growing aversion from the Catholic Church, and the economic and cultural deterioration of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3519}} Conversion to Islam, and the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209–1229), greatly reduced the remaining number of Gnostics throughout the Middle Ages, though a few Mandaean communities still exist. Gnostic and pseudo-gnostic ideas became influential in some of the philosophies of various esoteric [[mystical]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe and North America, including some that explicitly identify themselves as revivals or even continuations of earlier gnostic groups.

==Relation with early Christianity==
Dillon notes that Gnosticism raises questions about the development of [[early Christianity]].{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=36}}

===Orthodoxy and heresy===
{{See also|Diversity in early Christian theology}}
The Christian heresiologists, most notably [[Irenaeus]], regarded Gnosticism as a Christian heresy. Modern scholarship notes that early Christianity was very diverse, and Christian orthodoxy only settled in the 4th{{nbsp}}century, when the Roman Empire declined and Gnosticism lost its influence.{{sfn|Pagels|1979}}{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3519}}{{sfn|Perkins|2005|p=3529}}{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=36}} Gnostics and proto-orthodox Christians shared some terminology. Initially, they were hard to distinguish from each other.{{sfn|Perkins|2005|p=3529-3530}}

According to Walter Bauer, "heresies" may well have been the original form of Christianity in many regions.{{sfn|Bauer|1971}} This theme was further developed by Elaine Pagels,{{sfn|McVey|1981}} who argues that "the proto-orthodox church found itself in debates with gnostic Christians that helped them to stabilize their own beliefs."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=36}} According to Gilles Quispel, Catholicism arose in response to Gnosticism, establishing safeguards in the form of the [[Episcopal polity|monarchic episcopate]], the [[creed]], and the [[Christian biblical canons|canon]] of holy books.{{sfn|Quispel|2004|p=9}}

===Historical Jesus===
{{See also|Jesus in comparative mythology|Christ myth theory}}
The Gnostic movements may contain information about the historical Jesus, since some texts preserve sayings which show similarities with canonical sayings.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=31-32}} Especially the ''Gospel of Thomas'' has a significant amount of parallel sayings.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=31-32}} Yet, a striking difference is that the canonical sayings center on the coming endtime, while the Thomas-sayings center on a kingdom of heaven that is already here, and not a future event.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} According to Koester, this is because the Thomas-sayings are older, implying that in the earliest forms of Christianity Jesus was regarded as a wisdom-teacher.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} An alternative hypothesis states that the Thomas authors wrote in the second century, changing existing sayings and eliminating the apocalyptic concerns.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}} According to April DeConinck, such a change occurred when the endtime did not come, and the Thomasine tradition turned toward a "new theology of mysticism" and a "theological commitment to a fully-present kingdom of heaven here and now, where their church had attained Adam and Eve's divine status before the Fall."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=32}}

===Johannine literature===
The prologue of the [[Gospel of John]] describes the incarnated Logos, the light that came to earth, in the person of Jesus.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} The ''Apocryphon of John'' contains a scheme of three descendants from the heavenly realm, the third one being Jesus, just as in the Gospel of John. The similarities probably point to a relationship between gnostic ideas and the Johannine community.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} According to Raymond Brown, the Gospel of John shows "the development of certain gnostic ideas, especially Christ as heavenly revealer, the emphasis on light versus darkness, and anti-Jewish animus."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} The Johannine material reveals debates about the redeemer myth.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} The Johannine letters show that there were different interpretations of the gospel story, and the Johannine images may have contributed to second-century Gnostic ideas about Jesus as a redeemer who descended from heaven.{{sfn|Perkins|1987|p=3530}} According to DeConinck, the Gospel of John shows a "transitional system from early Christianity to gnostic beliefs in a God who transcends our world."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}} According to DeConinck, the ''John'' shows a beginning bifurcation between Jesus' "Father in Heaven", and the Jews' "Father of the Devil", which may have developed into the gnostic idea of the Monad and the Demiurge.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=33}}

===Paul and Gnosticism===
[[Tertullian]] calls [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] "the apostle of the heretics",{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=107}} because Paul's writings were attractive to gnostics, and interpreted in a gnostic way, while Jewish Christians found him to stray from the Jewish roots of Christianity.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=107-108}} Paul wrote to the Corinthian church members as "having knowledge" ({{lang-gr|τον εχοντα γνωσιν}}, ''ton echonta gnosin'').&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|8:10|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]] claims that in some cases, Paul affirmed views that were closer to gnosticism than to proto-orthodox Christianity.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}}

According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], the disciples of Valentinus said that Valentinus was a student of a certain [[Theudas (teacher of Valentinius)|Theudas]], who was a student of Paul,{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}} and Elaine Pagels notes that Paul's epistles were interpreted by Valentinus in a gnostic way, and Paul could be considered a proto-[[gnostic]] as well as a proto-[[Catholic]].{{sfn|Pagels|1975}} Many Nag Hammadi texts, including, for example, the ''Prayer of Paul'' and the Coptic ''Apocalypse of Paul'', consider Paul to be "the great apostle".{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=108}} The fact that he claimed to have received his gospel directly by revelation from God appealed to the gnostics, who claimed ''gnosis'' from the risen Christ.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=109}} The Naasenes, Cainites, and Valentinians referred to Paul's epistles.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=109-110}} [[The Jesus Mysteries|Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy]] have expanded upon this idea of Paul as a gnostic teacher;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, ''[[The Jesus Mysteries]],'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; although their premise that Jesus was invented by early Christians based on an alleged Greco-Roman mystery cult has been dismissed by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2012). [[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|''Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth'']]. New York City, New York: HarperCollins. pp. 25–30. {{ISBN|978-0-06-220644-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The existence of Jesus is explored in other Wikipedia articles, such as: [[Christ myth theory]], [[Historicity of Jesus]], [[Sources for the historicity of Jesus]], [[Historical Jesus]], [[Quest for the historical Jesus]]}} However, his revelation was different from the gnostic revelations.{{sfn|Dunn|2016|p=111}}

==Major movements==

===Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism===
Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism includes [[Sethianism]], [[Valentinianism]], [[Basilideans]], Thomasine traditions, and Serpent Gnostics, as well as a number of other minor groups and writers.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3517-3519}} Hermeticism is also a western Gnostic tradition,{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3519}} though it differs in some respects from these other groups.&lt;ref name="Hoeller"/&gt; The Syrian–Egyptian school derives much of its outlook from Platonist influences. It depicts creation in a series of [[Emanationism|emanations]] from a primal monadic source, finally resulting in the creation of the material universe. These schools tend to view evil in terms of matter that is markedly inferior to goodness and lacking spiritual insight and goodness rather than as an equal force.

Many of these movements used texts related to Christianity, with some identifying themselves as specifically Christian, though quite different from the [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] or [[Roman Catholic]] forms. [[Jesus]] and several of his apostles, such as [[Thomas the Apostle]], claimed as the founder of the [[Saint Thomas Christians|Thomasine form of Gnosticism]], figure in many Gnostic texts. [[Mary Magdalene]] is respected as a Gnostic leader, and is considered superior to the [[twelve apostles]] by some gnostic texts, such as the [[Gospel of Mary]]. [[John the Evangelist]] is claimed as a Gnostic by some Gnostic interpreters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Pagels]], ''The Johannine Gospel'' in Gnostic Exegesis. Heracleon's Commentary on John. Nashville: SBL Monograph Series 17, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; as is even [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]].{{sfn|Pagels|1975}} Most of the literature from this category is known to us through the Nag Hammadi Library.

====Sethite-Barbeloite====
{{Main|Sethianism}}
Sethianism was one of the main currents of Gnosticism during the 2nd to 3rd centuries, and the prototype of Gnosticism as condemned by Irenaeus.{{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3510}} Sethianism attributed its ''gnosis'' to  [[Seth]], third son of [[Adam and Eve]] and ''[[Norea]]'', wife of [[Noah]], who also plays a role in [[Mandeanism]] and [[Manicheanism]]. Their main text is the ''Apocryphon of John'', which does not contain Christian elements,{{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3510}} and is an amalgam of two earlier myths.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3517}} Earlier texts such as [[Apocalypse of Adam]] show signs of being pre-Christian and focus on the Seth, third son of Adam and Eve.{{sfn|Temporini|Vogt|Haase|1983}} Later Sethian texts continue to interact with Platonism. Sethian texts such as [[Zostrianos]] and [[Allogenes]] draw on the imagery of older Sethian texts, but utilize "a large fund of philosophical conceptuality derived from contemporary Platonism, (that is, late middle Platonism) with no traces of Christian content."{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=59}}{{refn|group=note|The doctrine of the "triple-powered one" found in the text Allogenes, as discovered in the Nag Hammadi Library, is "the same doctrine as found in the anonymous [[Parmenides]] commentary (Fragment XIV) ascribed by Hadot to Porphyry [...] and is also found in [[Plotinus]]' [[Ennead]] 6.7, 17, 13–26."{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=59}}}}

According to [[John D. Turner]], German and American scholarship views Sethianism as "a distinctly inner-Jewish, albeit syncretistic and heterodox, phenomenon", while British and French scholarship tends to see Sethianism as "a form of heterodox Christian speculation".{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=257}} Roelof van{{nbsp}}den{{nbsp}}Broek notes that "Sethianism" may never have been a separate religious movement, and that the term refers rather to a set of mythological themes which occur in various texts.{{sfn|Broek|2013|p=28}}

According to Smith, Sethianism may have begun as a pre-Christian tradition, possibly a [[syncretic]] cult that incorporated elements of Christianity and Platonism as it grew.{{sfn|Smith|2004}} According to Temporini, Vogt, and Haase, early Sethians may be identical to or related to the [[Nazarenes (sect)]], the [[Ophites]], or the sectarian group called [[Heresy|heretics]] by [[Philo]].{{sfn|Temporini|Vogt|Haase|1983}}

According to Turner, Sethianism was influenced by [[Christianity]] and [[Middle Platonism]], and originated in the second century as a fusion of a Jewish baptizing group of possibly priestly lineage, the so-called ''Barbeloites'',{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=257-258}} named after [[Barbelo]], the first emanation of the Highest God, and a group of Bibilical exegetes, the ''Sethites'', the "seed of [[Seth]]".{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=258}} At the end of the second century, Sethianism grew apart from the developing Christian orthodoxy, which rejected the [[Docetism|docetian]] view of the Sethians on Christ.{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=259}} In the early third century, Sethianism was fully rejected by Christian heresiologists, as Sethianism shifted toward the contemplative practices of Platonism while losing interest in their own origins.{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=259-260}} In the late third century, Sethianism was attacked by neo-Platonists like [[Plotinus]], and Sethianism became alienated from Platonism. In the early- to mid-fourth century, Sethianism fragmented into various sectarian Gnostic groups such as the [[Archontics]], Audians, [[Borborites]], and Phibionites, and perhaps [[Stratiotici]], and Secundians).{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=260}}{{sfn|Turner|1986|p=59}} Some of these groups existed into the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Turner|2001|p=260}}

====Samaritan Baptist sects====
According to Magris, Samaritan Baptist sects were an offshoot of [[John the Baptist]].{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} One offshoot was in turn headed by [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheus]], [[Simon Magus]], and [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]]. It was in this milieu that the idea emerged that the world was created by ignorant angels. Their baptismal ritual removed the consequences of sin, and led to a regeneration by which natural death, which was caused by these angels, was overcome.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}} The Samaritan leaders were viewed as "the embodiment of God's power, spirit, or wisdom, and as the redeemer and revealer of 'true knowledge{{' "}}.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3515}}

The [[Simonians]] were centered on Simon Magus, the magician baptised by Philip and rebuked by Peter in Acts 8, who became in early Christianity the archetypal false teacher. The ascription by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and others of a connection between schools in their time and the individual in Acts 8 may be as legendary as the stories attached to him in various apocryphal books. Justin Martyr identifies Menander of Antioch as Simon Magus' pupil. According to Hippolytus, Simonianism is an earlier form of the [[Valentinianism|Valentinian doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''[[Philosophumena]]'', iv. 51, vi. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basilidian]]s or Basilideans were founded by [[Basilides]] of [[Alexandria]] in the second century. Basilides claimed to have been taught his doctrines by Glaucus, a disciple of [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], but could also have been a pupil of Menander.&lt;ref name=Eusebius4-7&gt;[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Church History of Eusebius/Book IV/Chapter 7|Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Ecclesiastical History'' Book iv. Chapter vii.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Basilidianism survived until the end of the 4th{{nbsp}}century as [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] knew of Basilidians living in the [[Nile]] Delta. It was, however, almost exclusively limited to [[Egypt]], though according to [[Sulpicius Severus]] it seems to have found an entrance into [[Spain]] through a certain Mark from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. [[St. Jerome]] states that the [[Priscillianists]] were infected with it.

====Valentinianism====
{{Main|Valentinianism}}
Valentinianism was named after its founder [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] (c. 100{{snd}}180), who was a candidate for [[bishop]] of Rome but started his own group when another was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;''Adversus Valentinianos'' 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinianism flourished after the middle of the 2nd century. The school was popular, spreading to Northwest Africa and Egypt, and through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east,&lt;ref&gt;Green 1985, 244&lt;/ref&gt; and Valentinus is specifically named as ''gnostikos'' by Irenaeus. It was an intellectually vibrant tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Markschies, ''Gnosis: An Introduction'', 94.&lt;/ref&gt; with an elaborate and philosophically "dense" form of Gnosticism. Valentinus' students elaborated on his teachings and materials, and several varieties of their central myth are known.

Valentinian Gnosticism may have been monistic rather than dualistic.{{refn|group=note|Quotes:&lt;br&gt;* Elaine Pagels: "Valentinian gnosticism [...] differs essentially from dualism";&lt;ref name="pagels"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pagels | first=Elaine | title=''The Gnostic Gospels'' | year=1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Schoedel: "a standard element in the interpretation of Valentinianism and similar forms of Gnosticism is the recognition that they are fundamentally monistic".&lt;ref name="schoedel"&gt;{{cite book | last =Schoedel | first=William | title= "Gnostic Monism and the Gospel of Truth" in ''The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, Vol.1: The School of Valentinus'', (ed.) Bentley Layton | publisher=E.J.Brill | location=Leiden | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the Valentinian myths, the creation of a flawed materiality is not due to any moral failing on the part of the Demiurge, but due to the fact that he is less perfect than the superior entities from which he emanated.&lt;ref name="val_mon"&gt;{{cite web | title = Valentinian Monism | publisher = The Gnostic Society Library | url = http://www.gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Valentinian_Monism.htm | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinians treat physical reality with less contempt than other Gnostic groups, and conceive of materiality not as a separate substance from the divine, but as attributable to an ''error of perception'' which becomes symbolized mythopoetically as the act of material creation.&lt;ref name="val_mon" /&gt;

The followers of [[Valentinius]] attempted to systematically decode the Epistles, claiming that most Christians made the mistake of reading the Epistles literally rather than allegorically. Valentinians understood the conflict between ''Jews'' and ''Gentiles'' in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] to be a coded reference to the differences between ''[[Psychics (gnosticism)|Psychics]]'' (people who are partly spiritual but have not yet achieved separation from carnality) and ''[[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|Pneumatics]]'' (totally spiritual people). The Valentinians argued that such codes were intrinsic in gnosticism, secrecy being important to ensuring proper progression to true inner understanding.{{refn|group=note|Irenaeus describes how the [[Valentinians]] claim to find evidence in [[Ephesians]] for their characteristic belief in the existence of the [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Æons]] as supernatural beings: "Paul also, they affirm, very clearly and frequently names these Æons, and even goes so far as to preserve their order, when he says, "To all the generations of the Æons of the Æon.” (Ephesians 3:21) Nay, we ourselves, when at the giving of thanks we pronounce the words, 'To Æons of Æons' (for ever and ever), do set forth these Æons. And, in fine, wherever the words Æon or Æons occur, they at once refer them to these beings." ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of Knowledge Falsely So Called]]'' Book 1. Ch.3}}

According to [[Bentley Layton]] "Classical Gnosticism" and "The School of Thomas" antedated and influenced the development of Valentinus, whom Layton called "the great [Gnostic] reformer" and "the focal point" of Gnostic development. While in Alexandria, where he was born, Valentinus probably would have had contact with the Gnostic teacher [[Basilides]], and may have been influenced by him.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures (SCM Press, London, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Simone Petrement, while arguing for a Christian origin of Gnosticism, places Valentinus after Basilides, but before the Sethians. According to Petrement, Valentinus represented a moderation of the anti-Judaism of the earlier Hellenized teachers; the demiurge, widely regarded as a mythological depiction of the Old Testament God of the Hebrews, is depicted as more ignorant than evil.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Petrement, ''A Separate God''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomasine traditions====
The ''Thomasine Traditions'' refers to a group of texts which are attributed to the apostle Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ma. Asgeirsson, April D. DeConick and Risto Uro (editors), [http://www.brill.com/thomasine-traditions-antiquity ''Thomasine Traditions in Antiquity. The Social and Cultural World of the Gospel of Thomas''], BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The texts commonly attributed to the Thomasine Traditions are:
* ''[[The Hymn of the Pearl]]'', or, the ''[[Hymn of the Pearl|Hymn of Jude Thomas the Apostle in the Country of Indians]]''
* ''The [[Gospel of Thomas]]''
* ''The [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]''
* ''The [[Acts of Thomas]]''
* ''[[Book of Thomas the Contender|The Book of Thomas: The Contender Writing to the Perfect]]''
* ''The [[Psalms of Thomas]]''
* ''The [[Apocalypse of Thomas]]''}} Karen L. King notes that "Thomasine Gnosticism" as a separate category is being criticised, and may "not stand the test of scholarly scrutiny".{{sfn|King|2005|p=162}}

====Marcion====
[[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] was a Church leader from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] (present-day Turkey), who preached in Rome around 150{{nbsp}}CE,{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3518}} but was expelled and started his own congregation, which spread throughout the Mediterranean. He rejected the Old Testament, and followed a limited Christian canon, which included only a redacted version of Luke, and ten edited letters of Paul.{{sfn|Perkins|11987|p=3530}} Some scholars do not consider him to be a gnostic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/library/marcion/Harnack.html|title=Adolf Von Harnack: Marcion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="EB"|[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "In Marcion's own view, therefore, the founding of his church—to which he was first driven by opposition&amp;nbsp;– amounts to a reformation of [[Christendom]] through a return to the gospel of Christ and to Paul; nothing was to be accepted beyond that. This of itself shows that it is a mistake to reckon Marcion among the Gnostics. A [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] he certainly was, but he was not a Gnostic".}} but his teachings clearly resemble some Gnostic teachings.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3518}} He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the [[Demiurge]], the "evil creator of the material universe", and the highest God, the "loving, spiritual God who is the father of Jesus", who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from the tyranny of the Jewish Law.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3518}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valantasis |first1=Richard |title=The Beliefnet Guide to Gnosticiam and Other Vanished Christianities |publisher=Beliefnet |year=2006 |isbn=978-0385514552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men in the shape of a human form, and not someone in a true physical body.&lt;ref name="Harnack"&gt;[[Adolf Von Harnack]] (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Marcion.html?id=aL3BSQAACAAJ Marcion: The Gospel of the Alien God]'', translated by John E. Steely, Lyle D. Bierma, Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers {{ISBN|9781556357039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcion held that the heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien god; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it.&lt;ref name="Harnack"/&gt;

====Hermeticism====
[[Hermeticism]] is closely related to Gnosticism, but its orientation is more positive.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3519}}&lt;ref name="Hoeller"&gt;Stephan A. Hoeller, [http://www.gnosis.org/hermes.htm ''On the Trail of the Winged God. Hermes and Hermeticism Throughout the Ages'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Gnostic groups====
* Serpent Gnostics. The [[Naassenes]], [[Ophites]] and the [[Serpentarians]] gave prominence to snake symbolism, and snake handling played a role in their ceremonies.{{sfn|Magris|2005|p=3518}}
* [[Cerinthus]] (c. 100), the founder of a heretical school with gnostic elements. Like a Gnostic, Cerinthus depicted Christ as a heavenly spirit separate from the man Jesus, and he cited the demiurge as creating the material world. Unlike the Gnostics, Cerinthus taught Christians to observe the Jewish law; his demiurge was holy, not lowly; and he taught the Second Coming. His gnosis was a secret teaching attributed to an apostle. Some scholars believe that the First Epistle of John was written as a response to Cerinthus.&lt;ref name = "gonzález"&gt;González, Justo L.(1970). ''A History of Christian Thought, Vol. I''. Abingdon. pp. 132–3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Cainites]] are so-named since Hippolytus of Rome claims that they worshiped [[Cain]], as well as [[Esau]], [[Korah]], and the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodomites]]. There is little evidence concerning the nature of this group. Hippolytus claims that they believed that indulgence in sin was the key to salvation because since the body is evil, one must defile it through immoral activity (see [[libertinism]]). The name Cainite is used as the name of a religious movement, and not in the usual Biblical sense of people descended from Cain.
* The [[Carpocrates|Carpocratians]], a [[libertine]] sect following only the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]
* The [[Borborites]], a libertine Gnostic [[sect]], said to be descended from the [[Nicolaism|Nicolaitans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Den Broek|first1=Roelof|title=Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism|date=2006|publisher=Brill|location=Boston|isbn=978-9004152311|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian Gnosticism===
The Persian Schools, which appeared in the western Persian province of [[Babylonia]] (in particular, within the [[Sassanid]] province of [[Asuristan]]), and whose writings were originally produced in the Aramaic dialects spoken in Babylonia at the time, are representative of what is believed to be among the oldest of the Gnostic thought forms. These movements are considered by most to be religions in their own right, and are not emanations from Christianity or [[Judaism]].

====Manichaeism====
[[File:Manicheans.jpg|thumb|Manicheanism priests writing at their desks, with panel inscription in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]. Manuscript from Khocho, [[Tarim Basin]].]]
{{Main|Manichaeism}}
Manichaeism was founded by the [[Prophet Mani]] (216–276). Mani's father was a member of the [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish-Christian]] sect of the [[Elcesaites]], a subgroup of the [[Gnostic Ebionites]]. At ages 12 and 24, Mani had visionary experiences of a "heavenly twin" of his, calling him to leave his father's sect and preach the true message of Christ. In 240–41, Mani travelled to the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] of the [[Sakhas]] in modern-day [[Afghanistan]], where he studied [[Hinduism]] and its various extant philosophies. Returning in 242, he joined the court of [[Shapur I]], to whom he dedicated his only work written in Persian, known as the ''[[Shabuhragan]]''. The original writings were written in [[Syriac Aramaic]], in a unique [[Manichaean script]].

Manichaeism conceives of two coexistent realms of light and darkness that become embroiled in conflict. Certain elements of the light became entrapped within darkness, and the purpose of material creation is to engage in the slow process of extraction of these individual elements. In the end the kingdom of light will prevail over darkness. Manicheanism inherits this dualistic mythology from [[Zurvanism|Zurvanist Zoroastrianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaehner|first=Richard Charles|title=The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism|year=1961|publisher=Putnam|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84212-165-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the eternal spirit [[Ahura Mazda]] is opposed by his antithesis, [[Angra Mainyu]]. This dualistic teaching embodied an elaborate cosmological myth that included the defeat of a primal man by the powers of darkness that devoured and imprisoned the particles of light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themystica.org/mystica/articles/d/dualism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kurt Rudolph, the decline of [[Manichaeism]] that occurred in Persia in the 5th century was too late to prevent the spread of the movement into the east and the west.&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt; In the west, the teachings of the school moved into Syria, Northern Arabia, Egypt and North Africa.{{refn|group=note|Where Augustine was a member of the school from 373–382.&lt;ref name="Oxford:Platonism"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=Frank L. |editor2-last=Livingstone |editor2-first=Elizabeth |chapter=Platonism |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location=London |pages=347–349 |isbn= 978-0-223-97728-0}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is evidence for Manicheans in Rome and [[Dalmatia]] in the 4th century, and also in Gaul and Spain. From Syria it progressed still farther, into Palestine, [[Asia Minor]] and Armenia. The influence of Manicheanism was attacked by imperial elects and polemical writings, but the religion remained prevalent until the 6th century, and still exerted influence in the emergence of the [[Paulicians]], [[Bogomil]]s and Cathari in the Middle Ages, until it was ultimately stamped out by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Kurt"&gt;Kurt Rudolph, ''Gnosis: The Nature &amp; Structure of Gnosticism'' (Koehler and Amelang, [[Leipzig]], 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east, Rudolph relates, Manicheanism was able to bloom, because the religious monopoly position previously held by Christianity and Zoroastrianism had been broken by nascent Islam. In the early years of the Arab conquest, Manicheanism again found followers in Persia (mostly amongst educated circles), but flourished most in Central Asia, to which it had spread through Iran. Here, in 762, Manicheanism became the state religion of the [[Uyghur Empire]].&lt;ref name="Kurt"/&gt;

====Mandaeanism====
{{Main|Mandaeanism}}
[[File:Mandaean-Mandi-Nasiriya-Iraq.jpg|thumbnail|right|Mandaean house of worship in [[Nasiriya]], Iraq]]The Mandaeans are [[Semitic people|Semites]] and speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. Their religion has been practised primarily around the lower [[Karun]], [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and the rivers that surround the [[Shatt-al-Arab]] waterway, part of southern Iraq and [[Khuzestan Province]] in Iran. Mandaeanism is still practiced in small numbers, in parts of southern Iraq and the Iranian province of [[Khuzestan]], and there are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide.&lt;ref name="yaledailynews"&gt;[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 Iraqi minority group needs U.S. attention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025053439/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/20341 |date=2007-10-25 }}, Kai Thaler, ''Yale Daily News'', March 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the group derives from the term ''Mandā d-Heyyi'', which roughly means "Knowledge of Life". Although the exact chronological origins of this movement are not known, John the Baptist eventually came to be a key figure in the religion, as an emphasis on baptism is part of their core beliefs. As with Manichaeism, despite certain ties with Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;King, Karen L. ''What Is Gnosticism?'' &lt;!--publisher, place, &amp; date?--&gt;, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandaeans do not believe in Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. Their beliefs and practices likewise have little overlap with the religions that manifested from those religious figures and the two should not be confused. Significant amounts of original Mandaean Scripture, written in [[Mandaean Aramaic]], survive in the modern era. The primary source text is known as the [[Ginza Rba|Genzā Rabbā]] and has portions identified by some scholars as being copied as early as the 3rd century. There is also the [[Qolusta|Qolastā]], or Canonical Book of Prayer and The Book of John the Baptist (sidra ḏ-iahia).

===Middle Ages===
After its demise in the Mediterranean world, Gnosticism lived on in the periphery of the Byzantine Empire, and resurfaced in the western world. The [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], an [[Adoptionist]] group which flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and the Eastern Themes of the [[Byzantine Empire]], were accused by orthodox medieval sources of being Gnostic and quasi [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] Christian. The [[Bogomils]], emerged in [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] between 927 and 970 and spread throughout Europe. It was as [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|synthesis]] of Armenian [[Paulicianism]] and the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] reform movement.

The [[Catharism|Cathar]]s (Cathari, Albigenses or Albigensians) were also accused by their enemies of the traits of Gnosticism; though whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is disputed. If their critics are reliable the basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser, Satanic, creator god), though they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (''gnosis'') as an effective salvific force.{{Verify source|date=November 2010}}

====Influence on Islam====
The message of the [[Islam]]ic Prophet [[Muhammad]] shows, according to the time of its promulgation, close relations to Gnostic ideas. The Quran, just as the Gnostic cosmology makes a sharp distinction between this world and the [[afterlife]]. The notion of four rivers in [[Jannah|heaven]] separating this world from the other, also appears frequently in [[Mandaean]] literature. However, according to Islam and unlike most Gnostic sects, not rejection of this world, but performing ''good deeds'' leads to the heaven. And according to the Islamic belief in strict [[Tauhid|Oneness of God]], there was no room for a lower deity; such as the [[demiurge]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Philip ''Smith The Secret History of the Gnostics: Their Scriptures, Beliefs and Traditions'' Duncan Baird Publishers 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-780-28883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islam, both ''good'' and ''evil'' come from one God, but still, God is commonly thought of as being beyond human comprehension, in some Islamic schools of thought, identifiable with the Gnostic [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]].&lt;ref&gt;Winston E. Waugh ''Sufism'' Xulon Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-597-81703-5}} page 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Nagel ''Geschichte der islamischen Theologie: von Mohammed bis zur Gegenwart'' C.H. Beck 1994 {{ISBN|9783406379819}} p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; A position especially opposed by the [[Manichaeans]]. [[Ibn al-Muqaffa]] depicted the Islamic deity as an demonic entity who "fights with humans and boasts about His victories" and sitting on a throne, from which He can descend. It would be impossible that both light and darkness were created from one source, since they were regarded as two different eternal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Nagel ''Geschichte der islamischen Theologie: von Mohammed bis zur Gegenwart'' C.H. Beck 1994 {{ISBN|9783406379819}} p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim theologist tried to counter this accusation by the example of a repeating sinner, who says: "I laid, and I repent".&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Nagel ''Geschichte der islamischen Theologie: von Mohammed bis zur Gegenwart'' C.H. Beck 1994 {{ISBN|9783406379819}} p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; This would prove that good can also result out of evil. We can also found traces of an entity given authority over the lower world in early writings: [[Iblis]] is regarded by some Sufis as the owner of this world, and humans must avoid the treasures of this world, since they would belong to him.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Awn ''Satan's Tragedy and Redemption: Iblis in Sufi Psychology'' BRILL 1983 {{ISBN|9789004069060}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ismailism|Ismailis]] work [[Umm al-Kitab (Ismaili book)|Umm al Kitab]], [[Azazil]]'s role resembles whose of the Gnostic demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 803&lt;/ref&gt; Like the demiurge, he is endowed with the ability to create his own world and seeks to imprison humans in the material world, but here, his power is limited and depends on the higher God.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 707&lt;/ref&gt; Such Gnostic [[Anthropogeny|anthropogenic]] can be found frequently among [[Ismaili]]&lt;ref&gt;Corbin ''Cyclical Time &amp; Ismaili Gnosis'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-136-13754-9}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt; traditions. However, the Ismailism were often [[takfir|criticised as non-Islamic]]. [[Ghazali]] characterized them, as a group who are just outwardly [[Shia]]s but were actually adherence of a dualistic and philosophical religion. Further traces of Gnostic ideas can be found in [[Sufi]] anthropogenic.&lt;ref&gt;Max Gorman ''Stairway to the Stars: Sufism, Gurdjieff and the Inner Tradition of Mankind'' Karnac Books 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-904-65832-0}} page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Like the gnostic conception of human beings imprisoned in matter, Sufi-traditions acknowledges the human soul is an accomplice of the material world and subject to bodily desires similar to the way [[archon]]tic spheres envelop the pneuma.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Churton ''Gnostic Philosophy: From Ancient Persia to Modern Times'' Simon and Schuster 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-594-77767-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ruh]] must therefore gain victory over the lower and material-bound psyche, to overcome his animal nature. A human being captured by his animal desires, mistakenly claims autonomy and independence from the "higher God", thus resembling the lower deity in classical gnostic traditions. However, since the goal is not to abandon the created world, but just to free oneself from ones own lower desires, it can be disputed  wether this can still be Gnostic, but rather a completion of the message of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Nagel ''Geschichte der islamischen Theologie: von Mohammed bis zur Gegenwart'' C.H. Beck 1994 {{ISBN|9783406379819}} p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that Gnostic ideas were an influential part of early Islamic development but later lost its influence. However the Gnostic light metaphorics and the idea of [[Sufi metaphysics|unity of existence]] still prevailed in later Islamic thought.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Nagel ''Geschichte der islamischen Theologie: von Mohammed bis zur Gegenwart'' C.H. Beck 1994 {{ISBN|9783406379819}} p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kabbalah====
Gnostic ideas found a Jewish variation in the mystical study of [[Kabbalah]]. Many core Gnostic ideas reappear in Kabbalah, where they are used for dramatically reinterpreting earlier Jewish sources according to this new system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershom Scholem|Scholem, Gershom]] ''Origins of the Kabbalah'', 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kabbalists originated in 13th-century [[Provence]],{{refn|group=note|Joseph Dan: "The first kabbalistic text with a known author that reached us is a brief treatise, a commentary on the Sefer Yezira written by Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham the Blind, in Provence near the turn of the Thirteenth Century.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Dan|Dan, Joseph]] ''Kabbalah: a Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}} which was at that time also the center of the Gnostic [[Cathars]]. While some scholars in the middle of the 20th century tried to assume an influence between the Cathar "gnostics" and the origins of the Kabbalah, this assumption has proved to be an incorrect generalization not substantiated by any original texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Dan|Dan, Joseph]] ''Kabbalah: a Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, other scholars, such as Scholem, have postulated that there was originally a "Jewish gnosticism", which influenced the early origins of gnosticism.&lt;ref name="Scholem Jewish Gnosticism"&gt;[[Gershom Scholem|Scholem, Gershom]]. ''Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and the Talmudic Tradition'', 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabbalah does not employ the terminology or labels of non-Jewish Gnosticism, but grounds the same or similar concepts in the language of the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1eTf-tDqDeMC&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=kabbalah%20gnostic%20torah&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q=kabbalah%20gnostic%20torah&amp;f=false Lessons from the Kabbalah and Jewish history By Josef Blaha], Page 183&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century [[Zohar]] ("Splendor"), a foundational text in Kabbalah, is written in the style of a Jewish Aramaic Midrash, clarifying the five books of the Torah with a new Kabbalistic system that uses completely Jewish terms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rQWY52H2HI4C&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=kabbalah%20gnostic%20zohar&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=kabbalah%20gnostic%20zohar&amp;f=false Jewish mysticism: an introduction By J.

===Modern times===
{{Main|Gnosticism in modern times}}
The [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]] are an ancient Gnostic sect that have survived to this day and are found today in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Rudolph2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gnosis: The Nature and History of Gnosticism|last=Rudolph|first=Kurt|year=2001|publisher=Page 343|page=343|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their namesake owes to their following [[John the Baptist]] and in that country, they have about five thousand followers.&lt;ref name="Rudolph2001"/&gt; A number of ecclesiastical bodies that think of themselves as Gnostic have set up or re-founded since World War II, including the [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], [[Johannite Church#Apostolic Johannite Church|Apostolic Johannite Church]], [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], the [[Gnostic Church of France]], the [[Saint Thomas Christians|Thomasine Church]], the Alexandrian Gnostic Church, the North American College of Gnostic Bishops,&lt;ref name="Taussig2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taussig|first=Hal|title=A New New Testament: A Reinvented Bible for the Twenty-first Century Combining Traditional and Newly Discovered Texts|year=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547792101|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Universal Gnosticism of [[Samael Aun Weor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements| year = 2004| isbn = 9781134499694| page = 236|editor1-last=Clarke |editor1-first=Peter B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of 19th-century thinkers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVIII&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Pike]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]] studied Gnostic thought extensively and were influenced by it, and even figures like [[Herman Melville]] and [[W. B. Yeats]] were more tangentially influenced.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, Richard. "The Modern Relevance of Gnosticism" in The Nag Hammadi Library, 1990 {{ISBN|0-06-066935-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Doinel]] "re-established" a [[Gnostic Church of France|Gnostic church in France]] in 1890, which altered its form as it passed through various direct successors (Fabre des Essarts as ''Tau Synésius'' and Joanny Bricaud as ''Tau Jean II'' most notably), and, though small, is still active today.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.plerome.org l'Eglise du Plérôme]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 20th-century thinkers who heavily studied and were influenced by Gnosticism include [[Carl Jung]] (who supported Gnosticism), [[Eric Voegelin]] (who opposed it), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (who included it in many of his short stories), and [[Aleister Crowley]], with figures such as [[Hermann Hesse]] being more moderately influenced. [[René Guénon]] founded the gnostic review, ''La Gnose'' in 1909, before moving to a more [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialist]] position, and founding his [[Traditionalist School]]. Gnostic [[Thelema|Thelemite]] organizations, such as Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], trace themselves to Crowley's thought.

The discovery and translation of the Nag Hammadi library after 1945 has had a huge effect on Gnosticism since World War II. Intellectuals who were heavily influenced by Gnosticism in this period include [[Lawrence Durrell]], Hans Jonas, [[Philip K. Dick]] and Harold Bloom, with [[Albert Camus]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] being more moderately influenced.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; [[Celia Green]] has written on Gnostic Christianity in relation to her own philosophy.&lt;ref name = "Green"&gt;Green, Celia (1981,2006).

[[Alfred North Whitehead]] was aware of the existence of the newly discovered Gnostic scrolls. Accordingly, [[Michel Weber]] has proposed a Gnostic interpretation of his late metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weber.

==Sources==

===Heresiologists===
Prior to the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 Gnosticism was known primarily through the works of [[heresiologist]]s, [[Church Fathers]] who opposed those movements. These writings had an antagonistic bias towards gnostic teachings, and were incomplete. Several heresiological writers, such as Hippolytus, made little effort to exactly record the nature of the [[sect]]s they reported on, or transcribe their sacred texts. Reconstructions of incomplete Gnostic texts were attempted in modern times, but research on Gnosticism was coloured by the orthodox views of those heresiologists.

[[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100/114 – c. 162/168) wrote the ''[[First Apology]]'', addressed to [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]], which criticising [[Simon Magus]], [[Menander]] and [[Marcion]]. Since this time, both Simon and Menander have been considered as 'proto-Gnostic'.&lt;ref&gt;Markschies, ''Gnosis'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202) wrote ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' (c. 180–185), which identifies [[Simon Magus]] from [[Flavia Neapolis]] in [[Samaria]] as the inceptor of Gnosticism. From Samaria he charted an apparent spread of the teachings of Simon through the ancient "knowers" into the teachings of Valentinus and other, contemporary Gnostic sects.{{refn|group=note|This understanding of the transmission of Gnostic ideas, despite Irenaeus' certain antagonistic bias, is often utilized today, though it has been criticized.}} [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (170–235) wrote the ten-volume ''[[Refutatio Omnium Haeresium|Refutation Against all Heresies]]'', of which eight have been unearthed. It also focuses on the connection between pre-Socratic (and therefore Pre-Incantation of Christ) ideas and the false beliefs of early gnostic heretical leaders. Thirty-three of the groups he reported on are considered Gnostic by modern scholars, including 'the foreigners' and 'the [[Seth]] people'. Hippolytus further presents individual teachers such as Simon, [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]], [[Secundus (gnostic)|Secundus]], [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]], [[Heracleon]], [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] and [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Colorbasus]]. [[Tertullian]] (c. 155–230) from [[Carthage]] wrote ''Adversus Valentinianos'' ('Against the Valentinians'), c.{{nbsp}}206, as well as five books around 207–208 chronicling and refuting the teachings of [[Marcion]].

===Gnostic texts===
{{See also|Gnostic texts|Nag Hammadi library}}
Prior to the discovery at Nag Hammadi, a limited number of texts were available to students of Gnosticism. Reconstructions were attempted from the records of the heresiologists, but these were necessarily coloured by the motivation behind the source accounts.

The Nag Hammadi library {{refn|group=note|Sometimes popularly known as the ''Gnostic Gospels'' after [[Elaine Pagels]]' 1979 book of the same name, but the term has a wider meaning}} is a collection of [[Gnostic texts]] discovered in 1945 near Nag Hammadi, Upper Egypt. Twelve leather-bound [[papyrus]] [[codex|codices]] buried in a sealed jar were found by a local farmer named Muhammed al-Samman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marvin Meyer]] and [[James M. Robinson]], ''The Nag Hammadi Scriptures: The International Edition''. HarperOne, 2007. pp 2-3. {{ISBN|0-06-052378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings in these codices comprised fifty-two mostly Gnostic [[treatise]]s, but they also include three works belonging to the ''[[Hermetica|Corpus Hermeticum]]'' and a partial translation/alteration of Plato's ''Republic''.  These codices may have belonged to a nearby [[Saint Pachomius|Pachomian]] monastery, and buried after [[Athanasius|Bishop Athanasius]] condemned the use of [[Biblical canon|non-canonical]] books in his [[Easter letter|Festal Letter of 367]].&lt;ref&gt;James Robinson, introduction to ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original language of composition was probably [[Greek language|Greek]], the various codices contained in the collection were written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. A 1st- or 2nd-century date of composition for the lost Greek originals has been proposed, though this is disputed; the manuscripts themselves date from the 3rd and 4th centuries. The Nag Hammadi texts demonstrated the fluidity of early Christian scripture and early Christianity itself.{{refn|group=note|According to Layton, "the lack of uniformity in ancient Christian scripture in the early period is very striking, and it points to the substantial diversity within the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;Layton, ''The Gnostic Scriptures'', xviii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Academic studies==

===Development===
Prior to the discovery of Nag Hammadi, the Gnostic movements were largely perceived through the lens of the early church heresiologists. [[Johann Lorenz von Mosheim]] (1694–1755) proposed that Gnosticism developed on its own in Greece and Mesopotamia, spreading to the west and incorporating Jewish elements. According to Mosheim, Jewish thought took Gnostic elements and used them against Greek philosophy.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3531}} J.{{nbsp}}Horn and Ernest Anton Lewald proposed Persian and Zoroastrian origins, while Jacques Matter described Gnosticism as an intrusion of eastern cosmological and theosophical speculation into Christianity.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3531}}

In the 1880s Gnosticism was placed within Greek philosophy, especially neo-Platonism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851–1930), who belonged to the ''School of the History of Dogma'' and proposed a ''Kirchengeschichtliches Ursprungsmodell'', saw gnosticism as an internal development within the church under the influence of Greek philosophy.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}{{sfn|Lahe|2006|p=221}} According to Harnack, Gnosticism was the "acute Hellenization of Christianity."{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}

The ''[[Religionsgeschichtliche Schule]]'' ("history of religions school", 19th century) had a profound influence on the study of Gnosticism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' saw Gnosticism as a pre-Christian phenomenon, and Christian ''gnosis'' as only one, and even marginal instance of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} According to [[Wilhelm Bousset]] (1865–1920), Gnosticism was a form of Iranian and Mesopotamian syncretism,{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} and [[Eduard Norden]] (1868–1941) also proposed pre-Christian origins,{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} while [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] (1861–1931), and [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884–1976) also situated the origins of Gnosticism in Persia.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}} [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] (1896–1957) and Hans Leisegang saw Gnosticism as an amalgam of eastern thought in a Greek form.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3532}}

[[Hans Jonas]] (1903–1993) took an intermediate approach, using both the comparative approach of the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' and the existentialist hermeneutics of Bultmann. Jonas emphasized the duality between God and the world, and concluded that Gnosticism cannot be derived from Platonism.{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}}

Contemporary scholarship largely agrees that Gnosticism has Jewish or Judeo-Christian origins;{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}} this theses is most notably put forward by [[Gershom G. Scholem]] (1897–1982) and [[Gilles Quispel]] (1916–2006).{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533-3534}}

The study of Gnosticism and of early Alexandrian Christianity received a strong impetus from the discovery of the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[Nag Hammadi Library]] in 1945.{{sfn|Broek||1996|p=vii}}{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3535}} A great number of translations have been published, and the works of [[Elaine Pagels]], Professor of Religion at [[Princeton University]], especially ''The Gnostic Gospels'', which detailed the suppression of some of the writings found at Nag Hammadi by early bishops of the Christian church, has popularized Gnosticism in mainstream culture,{{r|National_Book_Award|group=web}}{{r|Beliefnet|group=web}} but also incited strong responses and condemnations from clergical writers.{{sfn|Quispel|2004|p=8}}

===Definitions of Gnosticism===
According to Matthew J. Dillon, six trends can be discerned in the definitions of Gnosticism:{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}
* Typologies, "a catalogue of shared characteristics that are used to classify a group of objects together."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}
* Traditional approaches, viewing Gnosticism as a Christian heresy{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=25}}
* Phenomenological approaches, most notably [[Hans Jonas]]{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}
* Restricting Gnosticism, "identifying which groups were explicitly called gnostics",{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}} or which groups were clearly sectarian{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}
* Deconstructing Gnosticism, abandoning the category of "Gnosticism"{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}
* Psychology and [[cognitive science of religion]], approaching Gnosticism as a psychological phenomena{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27-28}}

====Typologies====
The 1966 [[Messina]] conference on the origins of gnosis and Gnosticism proposed to designate
{{quote|... a particular group of systems of the second century after Christ" as ''gnosticism'', and to use ''gnosis'' to define a conception of knowledge that transcends the times, which was described as "knowledge of divine mysteries for an élite.{{sfn|Markschies|2000|p=13}}}}

This definition has now been abandoned.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}} It created a religion, "Gnosticism", from the  "gnosis" which was a widespread element of ancient religions,{{refn|group=note|Markschies: "something was being called "gnosticism" that the ancient theologians had called 'gnosis'&amp;nbsp;... [A] concept of gnosis had been created by Messina that was almost unusable in a historical sense."{{sfn|Markschies|2003|p=14–15}}}} suggesting a homogeneous conception of gnosis by these Gnostic religions, which did not exist at the time.{{sfn|Markschies|2003|p=14–15}}

According to Dillon, the texts from Nag Hammadi made clear that this definition was limited, and that they are "better classified by movements (such as Valentinian), mythological similarity (Sethian), or similar tropes (presence of a Demiurge)."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}} Dillon further notes that the Messian-definition "also excluded pre-Christian Gnosticism and later developments, such as the Mandaeans and the Manichaeans."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=24}}

Hans Jonas discerned two main currents of Gnosticism, namely Syrian-Egyptian, and Persian, which includes [[Manichaeism|Manicheanism]] and [[Mandaeism|Mandaeanism]].{{sfn|Albrile|2005|p=3533}} Among the Syrian-Egyptian schools and the movements they spawned are a typically more Monist view. Persian Gnosticism possesses more dualist tendencies, reflecting a strong influence from the beliefs of the Persian [[Zurvanism|Zurvanist Zoroastrians]]. The medieaval the Cathars, Bogomils, and Carpocratians seem to include elements of both categories.

Gilles Quispel divided Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism further into Jewish Gnosticism (the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''){{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3510}} and Christian Gnosis (Marcion, Basilides, Valentinus). This "Christian Gnosticism" was Christocentric, and influenced by Christian writings such as the Gospel of John and the Pauline epistles.{{sfn|Quispel|2005|p=3511}} Other authors speak rather of "Gnostic Christians", noting that Gnostics were a prominent substream in the early church.{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2005}}

====Traditional approaches – Gnosticism as Christian heresy====
The best known example of this approach is [[Adolf von Harnack]] (1851–1930), who stated that "Gnosticism is the acute Hellenization of Christianity."{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=25}} According to Dillon, "many scholars today continue in the vein of Harnack in reading gnosticism as a late and contaminated version of Christianity", notably Darrell Block, who criticises Elaine Pagels for her view that early Christianity was wildly diverse.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}

====Phenomenological approaches====
[[Hans Jonas]] (1903–1993) took an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenological]] approach to Gnosticism. According to Jonas, [[Social alienation|alienation]] is a distinguishing characteristics of Gnosticism, making it different from contemporary religions. Jonas compares this alienation with the existentialist notion of ''[[geworfenheit]]'', being thrown into a hostile world.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=26}}

====Restricting Gnosticism====
In the late 1980s scholars voiced concerns about the broadness of "Gnosticism" as a meaningful category. Bentley Layton proposed to category Gnosticism by delineating which groups were marked as gnostic in ancient texts. According to Layton, this term was mainly applied by heresiologists to the myth described in the ''Apocryphon of John'', and was used mainly by the Sethians and the Ophites. According to Layton, texts which refer to this myth can be called "classical Gnostic".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}

In addition, Alastair Logan uses social theory to identify Gnosticism. He uses [[Rodney Stark]] and William Bainbridge's sociological theory on traditional religion, sects and cults. According to Logan, the Gnostics were a cult, at odds with the society at large.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=27}}

====Deconstructing Gnosticism====
According to [[Michael Allen Williams]], the concept of Gnosticism as a distinct religious tradition is questionable, since "gnosoi" was a pervasive characteristics of many religious traditions in antiquity, and not restricted to the so-called Gnostic systems.{{sfn|Williams|1999}} According to Williams, the conceptual foundations on which the category of Gnosticism rests are the remains of the agenda of the [[heresiology|heresiologists]].{{sfn|Williams|1999}} The early church heresiologists created an interpretive definition of Gnosticism, and modern scholarship followed this example and created a ''categorical'' definition. According to Williams the term needs replacing to more accurately reflect those movements it comprises,{{sfn|Williams|1999}}and suggests to replace it with the term "the Biblical demiurgical tradition".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}

According to Karen King, scholars have "unwittingly continued the project of ancient heresiologists", searching for non-Christian influences, thereby continuing to portray a pure, original Christianity.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}

====Psychological approaches====
[[Carl Jung]] approached Gnosticism from a psychological perspective, which was followed by Gilles Quispel. According to this approach, Gnosticism is a map for the human development, in which an undivided person, centered on the [[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]], develops out of the fragmentary personhood of young age. According to Quispel, gnosis is a third force in western culture, alongside faith and reason, which offers an experiential awareness of this Self.{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28}}

According to [[Ioan Petru Culianu|Ioan Culianu]], gnosis is made possible through universal operations of the mind, which can be arrived at "anytime, anywhere".{{sfn|Dillon|2016|p=28–29}} A similar suggestion has been made by Edward Conze, who suggested that the similarities between ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]]'' and ''sophia'' may be due to "the actual modalities of the human mind", which in certain conditions result in similar experiences.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=165}}

{{nihongo|'''Gohei'''|[[wiktionary:御幣|御幣]]}}, {{nihongo|'''onbe'''|[[wiktionary:御幣|御幣]]}}, or {{nihongo|'''heisoku'''|[[wiktionary:幣束|幣束]]}} are wooden [[wand]]s, decorated with two  [[Shide (Shinto)|''shide'']] (zigzagging paper streamers) used in [[Shinto]] rituals. 

The streamers are usually white, although they can also be gold, silver, or a mixture of several colors, and  are often attached as decorations to straw ropes (''[[shimenawa]]'') used to mark sacred precincts.

The [[kannushi|shrine priest]] or maiden attendants (''[[miko]]'') use the ''gohei'' to bless or sanctify a person or object in various Shinto rituals. The ''gohei'' is used for some ceremonies, but its usual purpose is to cleanse a sacred place in temples and to cleanse, bless, or exorcise any object that is thought to have negative energy. In addition to its use in [[ritual purification|purification ritual]]s, it may be included in an ''[[Ōnusa]]'' (wooden wand with many ''shide''), and serve as the object of veneration (''[[shintai]]'') in a [[Shinto shrine]].

'''Kapu''' refers to a social grouping of agriculturists found primarily in the southern Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] (the [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-speaking states). Kapus are primarily an agrarian community, forming a heterogeneous peasant caste.

They are classified as a [[Forward Caste]] in Andhra Pradesh, where they are the dominant community in the districts of [[East Godavari]] and [[West Godavari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/2692.pdf|title=Caste, Class and Social Articulation in Andhra Pradesh, India: Mapping Differential Regional Trajectories|work=ODI|access-date=2017-03-13|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kapu community in the Telugu states is predominantly concentrated in the coastal districts, North Telangana and [[Rayalaseema]] regions. They are also found in large numbers in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and some other Indian states, as well as in [[Sri Lanka]].

==Etymology==
''Kāpu'' literally means cultivator or agriculturist in [[Telugu language|Telugu]].{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=74}} Various subgroups of ''kapus'' branched off into separate communities in the post-[[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] period ([[Velama]]s, Panta Kapus and Pakanati Kapus—both of whom got labelled [[Reddy]]s, and Kapus of [[Kammanadu]]—eventually labelled [[Kamma (caste)|Kamma]]s).{{sfn|Talbot|2001|pp=192,&amp;nbsp;206}} The remaining ''kapus'' continue to use the original label. All the cultivator caste clusters have a common ancestry in the legends.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=206}} According to Cynthia Talbot, the transformation of occupational identities as caste labels occurred in the [[Vijayanagara Empire|late Vijayanagara period]] (17th century) or later.{{sfn|Talbot|2001|p=86}}

==Status==
The Kapu are considered to be a [[Shudra]] community in the traditional Hindu ritual ranking system known as [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sahitya Akademi|title=Indian literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NptjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 July 2011|year=1996|publisher=Sähitya Akademi.|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harnam Singh |last=Verma|title=The OBCs and the ruling classes in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG_aAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 July 2011|year=2005|publisher=Rawat Publications|isbn=978-81-7033-885-7|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Minna |last=Säävälä|others=Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|title=Fertility and familial power relations: procreation in south India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9FwQxGqwOUC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=9 May 2011|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1484-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kapu have been described by Srinivasulu as a "dominant peasant caste in coastal Andhra", with the Telaga listed as "a backward peasant caste" and the [[Balija]] as a peasant caste who hold [[Lingayatism|Lingayat]] beliefs. Srinisavulu has analysed the [[Census of India prior to independence|1921 census of India]] to cause alignment with the present-day state and classification system, from which he concludes that Kapus (including Reddys) amounted to around 17 percent of the state's then population and were regarded as a [[Forward caste]], whilst the Balija and Telaga were regarded as [[Backward caste]]s, comprising 3 percent and 5 percent of the 1921 population, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Caste &amp; Class Articulation of Andhra Pradesh |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/livelihoodoptions/papers/wp179.pdf#search='caste%2C%20class%2C%20and%20social%20articulation |first=K. |last=Srinivasulu |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |location=London |date=September 2002 |isbn=0-85003-612-7 |pages=Glossary of castes, 4|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Srinivasulu notes that the Reddys and Kammas are the politically dominant communities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and that the Kapus are among a group with lesser but still significant influence, despite their small population. They are particularly effective in the districts of [[East Godavari]] and [[West Godavari]], although Srinivasulu notes that "The Kapus of the coastal districts are distinct from the Munnur Kapus of Telangana. While the former are fairly prosperous, the political emergence of the latter, who are part of the OBC category, is a recent phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Caste &amp; Class Articulation of Andhra Pradesh |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/livelihoodoptions/papers/wp179.pdf#search='caste%2C%20class%2C%20and%20social%20articulation |first=K. |last=Srinivasulu |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |location=London |date=September 2002 |isbn=0-85003-612-7 |page=3|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official government classifications rarely distinguished between the Kapu sub-castes. All Kapus were classified as forming a backward caste in 1915 by the [[British Raj|British government]] of the [[Madras Presidency]], which remained in force even after the formation of [[Andhra Pradesh]] until 1956. In that year, the government of Andhra Pradesh removed Kapus from the list of backward castes. Even though various governments have since made efforts to include them again, the efforts have not been successful. In 1968, the Anantha Raman Commission set up by the Andhra Pradesh government recognised Munnuru Kapus and Turpu Kapus as backward classes, but not the Kapus as a whole. The [[Mandal Commission]] set up by the [[Government of India]] in the 1980s recommended that Kapus be included among the [[Other Backward Classes]] (OBC). But the state governments were entrusted with finalising the list of castes for the OBC category. The state commission headed by N. K. Muralidhar Rao did not recommend any change to the status of the other Kapu castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Rao |first=M. L.

In early 2016, the Kapus of the modern Andhra Pradesh state launched an agitation demanding the OBC status, leading to violent protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kapus-in-Andhra-set-6-train-bogies-2-police-stations-ablaze-for-quota/articleshow/50800081.cms Kapus in Andhra set 6 train bogies, 2 police stations ablaze for quota], The Times of India, 1 February 2016.

The '''Karla Caves''', '''Karli Caves''', '''Karle Caves''' or '''Karla Cells''', are a complex of ancient [[Buddhist]] [[Indian rock-cut architecture|Indian rock-cut caves]] at [[Karli, India|Karli]] near [[Lonavala]], [[Maharashtra]]. It is just 10.9 Kilometers away from Lonavala. The shrines were developed over the period&amp;nbsp;– from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. The oldest of the cave shrines is believed to date back to 160 BC, having arisen near a major ancient [[trade route]], running eastward from the [[Arabian Sea]] into the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. 

The group at Karla is one of the older and smaller of the many rock-cut Buddhist sites in Maharashtra, but is one of the best-known because of the famous "Grand Chaitya" (Cave 8), which is "the largest and most completely preserved" [[chaitya]] hall of the period, as well as containing unusual quantities of fine sculpture, much of it on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 374&lt;/ref&gt;   

Many traders and [[Satavahana]] rulers made grants for construction of these caves.  Karli's location in Maharashtra places it in a region that marks the division between [[North India]] and [[South India]].&lt;ref name="public"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~tart/arth382/lecture7.html |title=Later Andhra Period India |publisher= |accessdate=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhists, having become identified with commerce and manufacturing through their early association with traders, tended to locate their monastic establishments in natural geographic formations close to major trade routes so as to provide lodging houses for travelling traders.&lt;ref name="keay"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Keay |first=John |authorlink=John Keay |title=India: A History |year=2000 |publisher=Grove Press |location= New York, USA |isbn=0-8021-3797-0 | pages = 123–127| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aeQqmcXBhoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the cave complex is a protected monument under the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maharashtra.asp|title= Karla Caves|publisher=NIC|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliation==
The caves were historically associated with the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] sect of Buddhism and later with [[Hinduism]], which had great popularity in this region of India, as well as wealthy patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Dutt, Nalinaksha. ''Buddhist Sects in India.'' 1998. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gadkari, Jayant. ''Society and Religion: From Rgveda to Puranas.'' 1996. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; The caves house a [[Buddhist monastery]] dating back to the 2nd century BC. The monastery was once home to two 15-meter grand pillars outside the chaitya. Now only one of these remains, and the remaining space is occupied by a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Ekveera]], who is worshipped most notably by the [[Koli people|Koli]] community of [[Mumbai]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Path to Karla caves.jpg|thumb|Path to the Karla caves.]]
The Karla cave complex is built into a rocky hillside around {{convert|60|km|mi}} from [[Pune]], with large windows cut into the rock to light the cave interiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturalindia.net/indian-architecture/ancient-architecture/cave-architecture.html |title=Cave Architecture |publisher= |accessdate=2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The caves are among a large numbers of similar caves excavated in the [[Sahyadri]] Hills in the early 1st millennium CE. There are altogether 16 caves in the group, with 3 of them being [[Mahayana]] caves. Most of the caves are ''lenas'', with the major exception being the Great Chaitya, Cave No. 8.&lt;ref name="Le 108"/&gt;

===Great Chaitya cave===
The main cave, called the Great [[Chaitya]] cave, or Cave No.8, features a large, intricately carved [[chaitya]], or prayer hall, dating back to 120 CE. This is the largest rock-cut chaitya in India, measuring {{convert|45|m|ft}} long and up to {{convert|14|m|ft}} high. The hall features sculptures of both males and females, as well as animals such as [[lion]]s and [[elephant]]s.

This Great Chaitya cave, the largest in [[South Asia]], was constructed and dedicated in 120 CE by the [[Western Satraps]] ruler [[Nahapana]].&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India, Volume 1 ʻAlī Jāvīd, Tabassum Javeed, Algora Publishing, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fg-lGID3WpQC&amp;pg=PA42 p.42]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern India: A Guide to Monuments Sites &amp; Museums, by George Michell, Roli Books Private Limited, 1 mai 2013 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GdBbBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72 p.72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This hall is assigned to the brief period of [[Kshatrapas]] rule in the western Deccan during the 1st century." in Guide to Monuments of India 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu - by George Michell, Philip H. Davies, Viking - 1989 Page 374&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chronology
[[File:Karla Great Chaitya front view.jpg|thumb|The Great Chaitya, partially obscured from view, in the 19th century.]]
The Great Chaitya cave of Karla follows, but improves upon, several other Chaitya caves which had been built in [[Western India]] under royal sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Spink 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spink|first1=Walter M.|title=Ajanta: Painting, sculpture, architecture|date=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=900414983X|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3me7pY6zJyEC&amp;pg=PA1|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the chronology of these early Chaitya Caves is as follows: first Cave 9 at [[Mahakali Caves|Kondivite Caves]], then Cave 12 at the [[Bhaja Caves]] and Cave 10 of [[Ajanta Caves]], around the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name="Le 108"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Huu Phuoc|title=Buddhist Architecture|date=2010|publisher=Grafikol|isbn=9780984404308|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA108|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in chronological order: Cave 3 at [[Pitalkhora]], Cave 1 at [[Kondana Caves]], Cave 9 at Ajanta, which, with its more ornate designs, may have been built about a century later,&lt;ref name="Spink 1"/&gt; Cave 18 at [[Nasik caves|Nasik Caves]], and Cave 7 at [[Bedse Caves]], to finally culminate with the "final perfection" of the Great Chaitya at Karla Caves.&lt;ref name="Le 108"/&gt;

;Characteristics
The chaitya follows the usual pattern for the period, but is unusually large. It is exceptional for preserving original elements in wood: the prominent lateral ribs and other roof timbers, and the [[umbrella]] over the [[stupa]].  The chaitya hall only survives in rock-cut examples, but these replicate in stone the form of examples in wood and thatch.  In most rock-cut chaityas, the roof timbers are replicated in stone, to considerable visual effect, but in others actual timber was used, for purely aesthetic rather than structural reasons.  In most of these cases the timber has long decayed away, as for example in the chaitya at Cave 3, [[Kanheri Caves]].  Here, although some were replaced under [[Lord Curzon]] in the 19th century, most are original.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 374; Harle, 48 and note 21 at 493&lt;/ref&gt; 
    
[[R. C. Majumdar]] quoting [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] explains:
{{quote|"It resembles an early [[Christian church]] in its arrangement; consisting of a [[nave]] and side-aisles terminating in an [[apse]] or semi-dome, round which the aisle is carried... Fifteen pillars on each side separate the nave from the aisle; each pillar has a tall base, an octagonal shaft, and richly ornamented capital, on the inner front of which kneel two elephants, each bearing two figures, generally a man and a woman, but sometimes two females, all very much better executed than such ornaments usually are; behind are horses and tigers, each bearing a single figure"&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India, Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1977 [https://books.google.com/books?id=XNxiN5tzKOgC&amp;pg=PA225 p.225]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

|It is certainly the largest as well as the most complete chaitya cave known in India, and was excavated at a time when the style was in its greatest purity. In it all the architectural defects of the previous examples are removed: the pillars of the nave are quite perpendicular. The screen is ornamented with sculpture -its first appearance apparently in such a position- and the style had reached a perfection that was never afterwards surpassed.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The general dimensions of the interior are 124&amp;nbsp;ft. 3 in. from the entrance to the back wall, by 45&amp;nbsp;ft. 6 in. in width. The side-aisles, however, are quite narrow, the central one being 
25&amp;nbsp;ft. 7 in., so that the others are only 10&amp;nbsp;ft. wide, including the thickness of the pillars. In height, however, Karla is only 45&amp;nbsp;ft. from the floor to the apex.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In advance of the Chaitya stands the lion-pillar, in this instance a plain shaft with sixteen flutes, or rather faces, surmounted by a capital not unlike that at Kesariya, but at Karle supporting four lions instead of one. They seem almost certainly to have supported a [[chakra]] or Buddhist wheel. A similar pillar probably stood on the opposite side, but it had either fallen or been removed to make way for the little Hindu temple that now occupies its place.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;

|[[File:Karli Chaitya entrance.jpg|200px]]&lt;br&gt;Panorama of the entrance
|The entrance, consists of three doorways under a gallery, one leading to the center, and one to each of the side-aisles; and over the gallery the whole end of the hall is open, as in all chaitya halls, forming one great window, through which all the light is admitted. This great window is formed in the shape of a horseshoe, and exactly resembles those used as ornaments on the facade of this cave, as well as on those of Bhaja, Bedsa, and at Nasik, and which are met with everywhere at this age. Within the arch is a framework or centering of wood standing free. It is, like the ribs of the interior, coeval with the building.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The sculpture on the screen wall between the doors is mostly of much later date than the cave itself. All the figures of Buddha there represented are of late date and belong to the [[Mahayana]] school; the larger pairs of figures, however, are earlier and may be original. The later inscriptions are of the time of the [[Satavahana]] king Pulumavi.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"&gt;Text adapted from public domain History of Indian and Eastern architecture by Fergusson, James, 1910 [https://archive.org/stream/historyofindiane01ferguoft p.142ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior is solemn and grand.An undivided volume of light coming through a single opening overhead at a very favorable angle, and falling directly on the dagoba or principal 
object in the building, leaving the rest in comparative obscurity. The effect is considerably heightened by the closely set thick columns that divide the aisles from the nave, as they suffice to prevent the boundary walls from ever being seen, and, as there are no openings in the walls, the view between the pillars is practically unlimited.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;
|Immediately under the semidome of the apse, and nearly where the altar stands in Christian churches, is placed the [[Stupa|Dagoba]], in this instance a plain dome, on a two-storeyed circular drum, the upper margins of each section being carved with rail ornaments. Just under the lower of these are holes or mortices for woodwork, which may have been adorned with hangings, which some of the sculptured representations would lead us to suppose was the usual mode of ornamenting these altars. It is surmounted by a capital or Tee, and on this still stand the remains of an umbrella in wood, somewhat decayed and distorted by age. This canopy was circular and minutely carved on the under surface.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fifteen pillars on each side separate the nave from the aisles; each pillar has a tall base, an octagonal shaft, and richly ornamented capital, on the inner front of which kneel 
two elephants, each bearing two figures, generally a man and a woman, but sometimes two females, all very much better executed than such ornaments usually are; behind are horses and tigers, each bearing a single figure. The seven pillars behind the altar are plain octagonal piers, without either base or capital, and the four under the entrance gallery differ considerably from those at the sides. The sculptures on the capitals supply the place usually occupied by frieze and cornice in Greek architecture; and in other examples plain painted surfaces occupy the same space.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Above this springs the roof, semicircular in general section, but somewhat stilted at the sides, so as to make its height greater than the semi-diameter. It is ornamented even at this day by a series of wooden ribs, probably coeval with the excavation, which prove that the roof is not a copy of a masonry arch, but of some sort of timber construction.&lt;ref name="Fergusson"/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

An important inscription relates to [[Nahapana]] in the Great Chaitya (Valukura is thought to be an ancient name for Karla Caves):

{{quote|[[File:Karla Caves inscription 13 of Nahapana.jpg|thumb|Great Chaitya inscription 13 of Nahapana.]]

There are also inscriptions by private donors, who contributed parts of the Great Chaitya, including self-described [[Yavana]] (Asiatic Greek or [[Indo-Greek]])&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, by Huu Phuoc Le, Grafikol, 2010 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA108 p.108]&lt;/ref&gt; donors, who donated six of the pillars, although their names are Buddhist names.&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;Some Early Dynasties of South India, by Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya [https://books.google.com/books?id=78I5lDHU2jQC&amp;pg=PA83 p.83]&lt;/ref&gt; They account for nearly half of the known dedicatory inscriptions on the pillars of the Chaitya.&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica Vol.18 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.367557 p.326-328] and Epigraphia Indica Vol.7 [Epigraphia Indica Vol.7 [https://archive.org/details/epigraphiaindica014351mbp p.53-54]&lt;/ref&gt;

* 3rd pillar of the left row:

:"Of Dhamma, a Yavana from Dhenukakata"&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica Vol.7 [https://archive.org/details/epigraphiaindica014351mbp p.55-56 Inscription No.10] and Epigraphia Indica Vol.18 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.367557 p.327 Inscription No.7] differ on the content of this inscription. Here, Epigraphia Indica Vol.7 was chosen, as Epigraphia Indica Vol.18 only mentions an inscription similar to that of pillar No.3, a possible mixup.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 9th pillar of the left row:
:"(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Yasavadhana from Denukakata"&lt;ref name="p.328 Inscription No10"/&gt;

:"(This) pillar (is) the gift of the Yavana Chulayakha from Dhenukakata". Next to the inscription is a Buddhist [[Swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica Vol.18 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.367557 p.327 Inscription No6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Dhenukakata is thought to be Danahu near the city of [[Karli, India|Karli]].&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; It is said by another donor in another inscription that it has a "vaniya-gama" (A community of merchants).&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphia Indica Vol.18 [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.367557 p.326 Inscription No3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yavanas are also known for their donation of a complete cave at the [[Nasik caves]] (cave No.17), and for their donations with inscriptions at the [[Junnar|Junnar caves]].

===Sri Pulumayi===
Inside the Great Chaitya, facing the inscription of Nahapana and posterior to it by a generation, there is also an inscription by Satavahana ruler Sri Pulumayi, that is, [[Vasishthiputra Pulumavi]] (130-159 CE):
{{quote|In the seventh year of the king Sri Pulamavi, son of Vasithi, in the fifth fortnight of summer, on the first day, on the above, by the Maharathi Somadeva son of Vasithi, the son of the Maharathi Mitradeva son of Kosiki, of the Okhalakiyas, there was given to the community of Valuraka, of the Valuraka caves, a village with its taxes ordinary and extraordinary, with its income fixed or proportional.|Inscription 14 of Sri Pulumavi.&lt;ref&gt;Royal patronage of Buddhism in ancient India, by Kanai Lal Hazra - 1984 - Page 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other Chaityas and Viharas===
[[File:KarlaCavesExtView.jpg|thumb|View of the [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]s.]]
[[File:Karla caves (3) in pune by vaibhav rane.jpg|thumb|Another portion of the caves.]]
Within the complex are a great many other carved chaityas, as well as [[vihara]]s, or dwelling places for the caves' [[Buddhist monks|monks]]. A notable feature of these caves is their [[arch]]ed entrances and [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]ed interiors. Names of donors are inscribed on pillars in Brahmi script in these caves. The outside facade has intricate details carved into it in an imitation of finished wood. The central [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] is a large [[horseshoe]] [[arch]]. There is an Ashokan pillar at the front, with a closed stone facade and [[torana]] in between.&lt;ref name="public"/&gt;

One of the Vihara cells bears an inscription of the [[Satavahana]] ruler [[Vasishthiputra Pulumavi]] (130-159 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xTW6XNxOxbkC&amp;pg=PA40 p.40]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later imitations===
[[File:Kanheri Great Chaitya panorama.jpg|thumb|400px|Great Chaitya hall at [[Kanheri]] in [[Mumbai]]. A slightly late imitation of the Great Chaitya at Karla caves.&lt;ref name="Fergusson 348"/&gt;]]
[[File:One of the Cave in Ajanta Caves.jpg|thumb|Cave 19 at [[Ajanta caves]] was also modeled after the Karla Great Chaitya, built in the 5th century CE.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Ramesh Chandra|title=Bharhut Sculptures|date=1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170173083|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIiOsQSUbBwC&amp;pg=PA51|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several Chaitya Caves were built in imitation of the Great Chaitya at Karla. This is especially the case of the Great Chaitya at [[Kanheri]], in the northern suburb in [[Mumbai]], probably built during the reign of [[Yajna Sri Satakarni]] (circa 150 CE).&lt;ref name="Fergusson 348"/&gt; According to Fergusson, it is certain that the plan of the Chaitya Cave at Kanheri is a literal copy of that at Karle, but the architectural details show exactly the same difference in style as is found between Cave 17 (period of [[Nahapana]] circa 115 CE) and Cave 3 (period of [[Sri Pulumavi]], circa 170 CE) at the [[Nasik caves]].&lt;ref name="Fergusson 348"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=James|last2=Burgess|first2=James|title=The cave temples of India|date=1880|publisher=London : Allen|pages=348–360|url=https://archive.org/stream/cavetemplesofind00ferguoft#page/348/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], such as Cave 19, built in the 5th century CE, were also modeled after the Karla Great Chaitya.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

'''Karram-Allah-u Wajhah''' ({{Lang-ar|'''كرم الله وجهه'''}}; {{Lang-en|'''May God exalt his face'''}}) is almost solely used to honor [[Ali]] as the only early [[Muslim]] who never knelt down to an idol following his guardian and teacher [[Muhammad]] in [[Jahilyah]]. This honorific is mostly used by some [[Sunni]]s and is acceptable to [[Shi'a]]. However, Shi'a prefer using [['Alayh-es-Salam]] or "Peace be upon him."

[[File:Antalya - Kesik Minare - Temple.jpg|thumb|Ruins of mosque]]
The '''Kesik Minare Cami''' (Broken Minaret Mosque), '''Korkut Cami''' or '''Cumanın Cami''' standing in the streets of Kaleiçi (Old [[Antalya]]) in southern [[Turkey]], was originally built as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] temple in the 2nd century AD. In the 7th century, it was converted into a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church in honor of the [[Virgin Mary]], but it was heavily damaged in the 7th century during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars|Arab invasions]]. In the 9th century it was repaired again. The church was converted into a mosque when the [[Sultanate of Rum]] acquired Antalya in the early 13th century, which was when the actual minaret was added. In 1361, when the crusader [[king of Cyprus]] took Antalya from the Seljuks, it became a church again, only to become reconverted into a mosque during the rule of [[Sehzade Korkut]]. The main building was destroyed in a fire of th. 1800, but the minaret survived as the Kesik Minare.

'''''Kushti''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|ʃ|t|iː}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; also: '''''Kusti''''', '''''Koshti''''') is the sacred girdle worn by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] around their waists. Along with the ''[[Sedreh]]'', the ''Kushti'' is part of the ritual dress of the Zoroastrians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsikhabar.net/customs/significance-of-sudreh-and-kusti/1119/ Parsi Khabar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyracantha.com/Z/sudreh.html Zoroastrians sudreh / kushti]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kushti'' is worn wound three times around the waist. It is tied twice in a double knot in the front and back, the ends of the ''Kushti'' hanging on the back. The ''Kushti'' is made of 72 fine, white and woolen threads, which represent the 72 chapters of the ''[[Yasna]]'', the primary liturgical collection of texts of the ''[[Avesta]]''.

The ritual of untying and tying the ''Kushti'' is performed several times a day and is called ''Nirang-i Kushti''. During this ritual, the individual must remain standing in one spot, and may not speak to anyone. If the individual speaks, the ritual must be recommenced.

[[Image:AmalricPatriarchOfAntioch.JPG|thumb|Coin of the Latin Patriarch of Antioch [[Aymery of Limoges]] (1139-1193), with bust of Aimery on the obverse]]
The '''Latin Patriarch of Antioch''' was a religious office of the [[Latin Church in the Middle East|Latin Church]] of the [[Catholic Church]] created in 1098 by [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], founder of the [[Principality of Antioch]], one of the [[crusader states]].

The jurisdiction of the Latin patriarchs in Antioch extended over the three feudal principalities of Antioch, Edessa, and Tripolis. Towards the end of the twelfth century the island of Cyprus was added. In practice they were far more dependent upon the popes than their predecessors, the Greek patriarchs.  After the fall of Antioch (1268) the popes still appointed patriarchs, who, however, were unable to take possession of the see. Since the middle of the fourteenth century they were only titular dignitaries. The title of Latin Patriarch of Antioch was conferred until the early 1950s; but the recipient resided in Rome and was a member of the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|basilica of St. Mary Major]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; The Basilica of St. Mary Major was the Antioch patriarchium, or  papal major basilicas assigned to the Patriarch of Antioch to officiated if they came to Rome, near which they dwelt.&lt;ref name=ce0&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Patriarch and Patriarchate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The seat of the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] was one of the oldest and most prestigious in Christendom. At one time it was the principal city of Syria; the third largest city of the Roman Empire, after Rome and Alexandria. When the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] took place in 1054, the four [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] Patriarchs of [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] "formed" the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], while the [[Pope]] of Rome "formed" the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. ("formed" is used in quotations because neither side started anything new after the schism and both continued unaltered and the same as they did pre-schism - the Western Church being under the jurisdiction of Rome, and the Greek Church under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]].)

After 1054, the See of Antioch came under the influence of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. As part of his [[grand strategy]], the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos]] sought to utilize the military elan and prowess of the Frankish and European princes of the [[First Crusade]] in recovering for him the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], including Antioch and its See.

However, after the [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1098, [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] refused to submit Antioch to Byzantine rule and set himself up as [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]].

==History==
The crusaders reinstated at first the Greek patriarch, then [[John the Oxite|John IV]]&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Church of Antioch}}&lt;/ref&gt; as long as the Orthodox patriarch remained there they tried to make him a Catholic instead of appointing a rival. However, when at last he fled to Constantinople they considered the see vacant.&lt;ref name=ce0/&gt; Thereupon the Latin Christians elected (1100) a patriarch of their own, an ecclesiastic by the name of [[Bernard of Valence|Bernard]] who had come to the Orient with the crusaders. From that time Antioch had its Latin patriarchs until the last incumbent Christian was put to death by the [[Sultan of Egypt|Sultan]] [[Baibars]] during the conquest of the city in 1268. The Greeks also continued to choose their patriarchs of Antioch, but these lived generally in Constantinople.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

The [[Byzantine Empire]] was greatly offended by this and tried to re-establish either a Greek patriarchate or a joint patriarchate. Though the [[Treaty of Devol]] in 1108 nominally restored a Greek patriarch, the treaty was never enforced. Under [[Manuel I Komnenos]] there was briefly a joint patriarchate when [[Antioch]] fell under Byzantine control, but for the most part there was only a Latin patriarch.  The Byzantine Empire recognized this de facto control of the See of Antioch and the Latin Patriarch soon played a key role in solidifying ties between the Crusader states and the Byzantine Empire.  This represented one of the sole instances of coordinated action by Byzantine and the Franks throughout the crusader period, and led to a number of joint political, diplomatic, military, and marriage alliances. The Latin Patriarch of Antioch was established to serve the Catholic members of the diocese and represent all Christians living in its territory and was one of the major ecclesiastical authorities in the [[Crusader states]]. Throughout the Crusader period both Greeks and Latins served under its hierarchy which included numerous suffragan bishops, abbots, cathedrals, monasteries, and churches under its ecclesiastical rule.  Damascus quickly grew in dominance, eclipsing Antioch, and the Greek Patriarchate's seat was transferred there in 1342.

Both Latin and Greek Patriarchs continued to be appointed by the Pope and the Byzantine Emperor respectively during the following centuries. However, the Latin Patriarch was a [[titulus (Roman Catholic)|titular]] office, with its seat at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome. It continued to play a role in helping to protect various isolated Christian communities in the Near East and eventually secured their unity with Rome. The last holder of this office was [[Roberto Vicentini]], who died without a successor in 1953.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The post itself was abolished in 1964.

'''Leo Baeck''' (23 May 1873&amp;nbsp;– 2 November 1956) was a 20th-century German rabbi, scholar and theologian. He served as leader of [[Liberal Judaism]] in his native country and internationally, and later [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden|represented all German Jews]] during the Nazi era. After the war, he settled in [[London]], UK, where he served as the chairman of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]].
[[File:Bust of Leo Baeck.jpg|thumb|Bust of Leo Baeck at the [[Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide]] in London, UK]]

== Early years ==
Baeck was born in [[Leszno|Lissa]] (Leszno) (then in the German [[Province of Posen]], now in Poland), the son of Rabbi [[Samuel Baeck]], and began his education at the  [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] in 1894. He also studied [[philosophy]] in Berlin with [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], served as a rabbi in [[Opole|Oppeln]], [[Düsseldorf]], and Berlin, and taught at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]] (Higher Institute for Jewish Studies). In 1905 Baeck published ''The Essence of Judaism'', in response to [[Adolf von Harnack]]'s ''What is Christianity?''. This book, which interpreted and valorized Judaism through a prism of [[Neo-Kantianism]] tempered with religious existentialism, made him a famous proponent for the Jewish people and their faith. During [[World War I]], Baeck was a  [[chaplain]] in the [[German Imperial Army]].

== Nazi persecution and deportation ==
In 1933, after the [[Nazis]] took power, Baeck worked to defend the Jewish community as president of the [[Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden]], an [[umbrella organization]] that united [[German Jewry]] from 1933 to 1938. After the Reichsvertretung was disbanded during [[Kristallnacht|the November Pogrom]], the Nazis reassembled the council's members under the government controlled [[Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland|Reichsvereinigung]].  Leo Baeck headed this organization as its president until his deportation. On 27 January 1943, he was deported to the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt concentration camp]].

Leo Baeck became the "honorary head" of the Council of Elders ([[Judenrat]]) in Theresienstadt. As such, he was protected from transports and with his protection list, could also save his relatives from transports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theresienstadt 1941–1945 |last=Adler |first=Hans Günther |authorlink=H. G. Adler |year=2004 |publisher=Wallstein Verlag |location=Göttingen |isbn=978-3-89244-694-1 |language=German}}, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; among others his grand-niece Ruth (b. 1925). Moreover, Baeck became "prominent", which meant that he had better accommodation, better food and could receive mail more often.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.ghetto-theresienstadt.de/pages/p/prominente.htm
|title= Theresienstadt Lexikon – Prominente |publisher = ghetto-theresienstadt.de |language= German |accessdate= 2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hannah Arendt]] in her book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' examined Jewish cooperation with the Nazi authorities during the Holocaust, and names Baeck as one of those functionaries who withheld the truth from their communities of the end awaiting them, believing it more 'humane' to bear the secret since "living in the expectation of death by gassing would only be the harder'. Baeck, according to Arendt, also thought the existence of a Jewish police force within the camps would render the 'ordeal easier' whereas in her view they turned out to be more brutal.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Arendt, ''Eichmann in Jerusalem,'' (1963) Viking Press 1965 pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave lectures, was active in the interfaith dialogue between traditional Jews and [[Jewish Christians|Christians of Jewish origin]], worked in the youth care sector, which he directed from November 1944 on, and was friendly with many of the [[prisoner functionary|functionaries]]. After liberation, he headed the Council of Elders; the last Elder of the Jews was the Czech communist [[Jiří Vogel]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Theresienstadt 1941–1945 |last=Adler |first=Hans Günther |authorlink=H. G. Adler |year=2004 |publisher=Wallstein Verlag |location=Göttingen |isbn=978-3-89244-694-1 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baeck's lectures were credited with helping prisoners survive their confinement. [[Heinrich F. Liebrecht]] said Baeck's lectures helped him to discover wellsprings of strength and the conviction that his life had a purpose. "From here came the impulse to really endure, and the belief that we were able to do so."&lt;ref name="ts-nohate"&gt;[http://www.times-standard.com/localnews/ci_12670135 "Not To Hate..."] ''The Times-Standard'', Eureka, California (June 23, 2009). Retrieved October 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until his deportation, numerous American institutions offered to help him escape the war and immigrate to the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Leo Baeck refused to abandon his community and declined the offers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Nevertheless, he managed to survive the [[Holocaust]], though three of his sisters perished in the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;Friederike Feldmann, Rosa Mandl and Elise Stern&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-war life and work ==
After the war, Baeck relocated to [[London]], where he accepted the Presidency of the [[North Western Reform Synagogue]] in [[Temple Fortune]].  He taught at [[Hebrew Union College]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="JTA 1949"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jta.org/1949/10/26/archive/dr-leo-baeck-arrives-in-u-s-reform-rabbis-oppose-government-aid-to-religious-bodies#ixzz2z2lEFRZv | title=Dr. Leo Baeck Arrives in U.S.; Reform Rabbis Oppose Government Aid to Religious Bodies | work=JTA | date=26 October 1949 | accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually became Chairman of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]. It was during this time he published his second major work, ''This People Israel'', which he partially penned during his imprisonment by the Nazis. His increased interfaith work also meant that he revised and, to an extent, reclaimed for Judaism, the founding figures of Christianity, Jesus and Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langton|first1=Daniel|title=The Apostle Paul in the Jewish Imagination|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=63–65, 84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 2 November 1956, in London, England.

==The International Leo Baeck Institute==
In 1955, the [[Leo Baeck Institute]] for the study of the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry was established, and Baeck was the first international president of this institute. The [[asteroid]] [[100047 Leobaeck]] is [[Meanings of asteroid names|named in his honour]], as is [[Leo Baeck College]], the Reform/Progressive rabbinical college in London. The Institute now includes branches around the world including the [[Leo Baeck Institute, New York]], and the [[Leo Baeck Institute#London|Leo Baeck Institute, London]].  There are institutions named after Leo Baeck, on every inhabited continent, including the Leo Baeck Centre for Progressive Judaism, in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lbc.org.au |title=Leo Baeck Centre for Progressive Judaism |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo Castelli was born Leo Krausz,&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;Dwight Garner (May 18, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/books/19book.html A Smooth Operator, at the Vanguard of the Gallery World in the 1960s] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Trieste]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the second of three children of Italian and Austro-Hungarian Jewish origin.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"&gt;[[Peter Schjeldahl]] (June 7, 2010), [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/06/07/100607crbo_books_schjeldahl Leo the Lion - How the Castelli gallery changed the art world] ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Ernest Krauss, a Hungarian by birth, who had gone to Trieste as a young man and married wealthy heiress Bianca Castelli,&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;Myrna Oliver (August 24, 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/24/news/mn-3077 Leo Castelli; Influential Dealer Promoted Careers of Artists From Johns to Warhol] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from a family of coffee importers&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Gerald Clarke (February 26, 1979), [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20073021,00.html Dealer Leo Castelli Sold the World on Pop Art, and Now He's Cleaning Up] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which had long been based there.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;John Russell (August 23, 1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/23/arts/leo-castelli-influential-art-dealer-dies-at-91.html Leo Castelli, Influential Art Dealer, Dies at 91] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, which the family spent in Vienna (where Leo Castelli learned perfect German), they returned to Trieste.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; The family changed its name to "Krausz-Castelli" and then "Castelli" in the mid-1930s, when Mussolini's government required names to be Italianized.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt;

After earning a law degree at the [[University of Milan]] in 1924, Castelli returned to Trieste, where his father had secured a job for him with an insurance company.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; In 1932, he went to work for an insurance company in Bucharest, where he married [[Ileana Sonnabend|Ileana Schapira]] one year later. After their marriage, the couple honeymooned in Vienna and bought their first artwork, a [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] watercolor.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Castelli's father-in-law, Mihai Schapira, helped him to be transferred in 1935 to the [[Banca d'Italia]] in Paris. There, Ileana's taste and money helped him start his first gallery at [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, which was named for its co-director, the decorator René Drouin,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; and situated between the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel]] and the couturier [[Elsa Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Leo Castelli's FIRST STEPS in the art world: a "Surrealist" event in Paris in '39 – by Michèle C. Cone. [[Artnet]], July 21, 2010. http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/cone/leo-castelli-surrealist-design7-21-10.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in surrealistic art,&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; the gallery opened in July 1939, with a show of modern and antique furniture, including commissioned pieces by Drouin, [[Max Ernst]], [[Meret Oppenheim]], [[Leonor Fini]] (a former girlfriend of Castelli's from Trieste), [[Eugene Berman]], and other artists in the force field of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Ileana's connections enabled the couple to flee to America at the start of World War II. Castelli's parents did not escape but died in Budapest, hounded by members of Hungary's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon (June 11, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/books/review/Solomon-t.html Leo Castelli’s New York Story] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple would remain married for more than 25 years, and were friends and partners even after their divorce, when Ileana married Michael Sonnabend and that couple opened its own gallery.&lt;ref name="Garner"/&gt; Castelli arrived in the United States in 1941, by way of Marrakesh, Tangier, Algeciras, Vigo and Havana.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; He took graduate history courses in economic history&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;  at [[Columbia University]]&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; until volunteering for the Army, serving in the intelligence service in Europe. After the liberation of France, he was sent to Bucharest as an interpreter for the Allied commission that controlled the city. As a result of Castelli's military service, he was given American citizenship.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Returning to New York, Castelli took a managerial position with his father-in-law's clothing factory.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

==Leo Castelli Gallery==
In New York, the Castellis were two of only three non-artist members (the other was dealer [[Charles Egan Gallery|Charles Egan]])&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; of the Club, an influential coterie founded in 1949 that included [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Ad Reinhardt]]. Castelli's first exercise as a private dealer came through Drouin, in 1947: some hundred canvases by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], consigned by his widow, Nina.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; His first American curatorial effort was the [[Ninth Street Show]] of 1951, a seminal event in the emergence of Abstract Expressionism. He soon attached himself to the pioneering gallerist [[Sidney Janis]], one of the early proponents of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lamster (May 23, 2010), [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/23/entertainment/la-ca-leo-castelli-20100523 Book Review: A dealer and his galaxy of art stars in 'Leo and His Circle"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, he opened the Leo Castelli Gallery in a townhouse at 4 E. 77th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenues in New York City. From the mid-1960s through the 1970s, the gallery was perhaps the most prominent commercial venue for art in the world.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;Daniel Grant (February 24, 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703960804576120434103905642 Leo Castelli's Cache Of Art-History Gold] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the gallery showcased European [[Surrealism]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and other European artists. However the gallery also exhibited American [[Abstract Expressionism]]. [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Norman Bluhm]] were some artists who were included in group shows.

In 1958, [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] joined the gallery, signaling a turning away from [[Abstract Expressionism]], towards [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]] and [[Conceptual Art]].[[File:Warhol Flowers, offset lithograph.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelli Gallery's first [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] exhibition, ''Flowers'', November, 1964]] From the early 1960s through the late 70s, [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Ed Ruscha]], [[Salvatore Scarpitta]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Lawrence Weiner]] and [[Joseph Kosuth]] joined the stable of Castelli artists. He gave Johns, Stella and Lichtenstein their first one-man shows.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli opened a temporary annex, the Castelli Warehouse, on West 108th Street, with a show organized by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], of environmental sculpture by nine artists, including Nauman, Serra, and [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; In 1971 Leo Castelli opened a downtown [[SoHo]] branch of the Leo Castelli Gallery at 420 West Broadway, in a building bought by the Hague Art Delivery Company and a cooperative of dealers: Castelli took the second floor; his former wife's [[Sonnabend Gallery]] the took the third floor, and [[André Emmerich]] (later replaced by [[Charles Cowles (art dealer)|Charles Cowles]]) took the top floor; while John Weber, (former director of the [[Virginia Dwan (art dealer)|Dwan Gallery]]) rented his gallery on the fourth floor. In the 1980s, Castelli opened a second larger downtown exhibition space at a 142 Greene Street also in [[SoHo]]. He later mounted joint shows with [[Mary Boone]], of [[Julian Schnabel]], in 1981, and [[David Salle]], in 1982.&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt;

Castelli also pioneered a stipend system that was unknown in New York when he opened his gallery. He put his artists on a payroll whether or not their work sold. For this and other reasons, desertions were initially rare among his artists. When Castelli discovered Serra in 1967, for example, he offered him a guarantee of three years of monthly payments even though he did not expect to sell any of the unknown sculptor's lead-plate work in that time.&lt;ref name="Russell"/&gt; Castelli also was known for spotting new talent and insisting on European exposure for his American artists, leading to Rauschenberg in 1964 becoming the first American to win the [[Venice Biennale]]'s international grand prize in painting.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt; His most important clients included [[Museum Ludwig|Peter Ludwig]] and [[Giuseppe Panza]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;

Castelli's second wife, Antoinette Fraissex du Bost,&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; opened Castelli Graphics, an art gallery devoted to the prints and photographs of Castelli Gallery and other artists.&lt;ref name="NYT87"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/obituaries/antoinette-castelli-58-dies-president-of-graphics-gallery.html Antoinette Castelli, 58, Dies; President of Graphics Gallery] ''New York Times'', September 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple also had a son together, Jean-Christophe Castelli, but Antoinette Castelli died in 1987.&lt;ref name="NYT87"/&gt; In 1995 Leo Castelli married the Italian art historian Barbara Bertozzi Castelli.

In 2015, Bertozzi Castelli opened a one-room satellite gallery at 1046 Madison Avenue, near 80th Street, with [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]]'s installation ''Lead and Felt'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Hilarie M. Sheets (September 24, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/arts/design/richard-prince-takes-a-new-approach-to-cowboys.html Changing Galleries] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Castelli received the rosette of the [[French Legion of Honor]], allegedly in exchange for donating works by Johns to the [[Centre Pompidou]].&lt;ref name="Schjeldahl"/&gt; The mayor of Trieste made him the honorary director of the [[Revoltella Museum]]. In 1998, the [[National Arts Club]] awarded Castelli its Centennial Medal of Honor. On this occasion, [[Dennis Hopper]] called Castelli "the godfather of the contemporary art world."&lt;ref&gt;[[Phoebe Hoban]] (March 29, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/29/style/the-night-a-pearl-beyond-price.html A Pearl Beyond Price] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a traveling exhibit honoring the 25th anniversary of Castelli Gallery visited the [[San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art|La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art]]. The [[Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale|Museum of Art]], Fort Lauderdale, showed "Three Decades of Exploration: Homage to Leo Castelli", an exhibit of more than 30 works by artists discovered, shown and encouraged by Castelli in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rober Hurlburt (November 1, 1987), [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-11-01/features/8702030168_1_leo-castelli-american-art-contemporary-art Exhibition A Tribute To Noted Art Dealer] ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the [[Butler Institute of American Art]] presented "Leo Castelli: a tribute exhibition". In 1996, [[Gagosian Gallery]] mounted the exhibition "Leo Castelli: An Exhibition in Honor of His Gallery and Artists" in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Many artists have enshrined Castelli in their works. [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Richard Artschwager]] painted his portrait, Warhol made a silkscreen of him in a jacket and tie. Frank Stella named a work after him, in 1992 he posed for the French artist [[Klaus Guingand]] who immortalized his shadow, and a sculpture by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], ''Leo'', places a brain at the center of a target.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Strickland (May 12, 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/12/nyregion/leo-castelli-meets-film-maker-and-fan.html Leo Castelli Meets Film Maker and Fan] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, on the occasion of Castelli's death, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published a eulogy by [[James Rosenquist]].

In 1988, when there were no tax deductions for gifts to museums, Castelli gave one of the icons of postwar American art, Robert Rauschenberg's ''Bed'' (1955) to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1992, amid rumors that Castelli was negotiating to sell his archives to the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles, his collection was said to be worth some $2 million.&lt;ref name="CAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/arts/design/19voge.html|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Castelli Archives Going to Smithsonian|publisher=New York Times|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, Castelli's heirs – his widow, Barbara Bertozzi Castelli, and his two children, Jean-Christopher Castelli and Nina Castelli Sundell – announced the donation of the gallery's archives from 1957 through 1999 to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Archives of American Art]]. Castelli had been interviewed for the archive's oral-history project in 1969, 1973 and 1997.&lt;ref name="Grant"/&gt;

The Leo Castelli Gallery continues to operate at 18 East 77th Street in New York under the direction of his wife showing many of the same artists from the gallery's past.&lt;ref name="CAG" /&gt; The Leo Award, presented annually by the [[Independent Curators International (ICI)|Independent Curators International]] (ICI), is named after the late Castelli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artinfo.com/news/story/818024/is-dasha-zhukova-the-next-leo-castelli-possible-da-vinci-found-on-scottish-farm-and-more-must-read-art-news Is Dasha Zhukova the Next Leo Castelli?] ''ARTINFO'', August 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
As the basic unit of society, the family is also the fundamental organization within the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Packer |first= Boyd K. |authorlink= Boyd K. Packer |title= The Family and Eternity |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=February 1971 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1971/02/the-family-and-eternity?lang=eng |quote= The preservation of the family is one of the great missions of the Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LDS Church]] members tend to be very family-oriented, and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, often through regular [[family reunion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url = http://www.mormon.org/family |title= Strengthening Families |work= mormon.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; For LDS Church members a knowledge and appreciation of one's lineage and heritage is closely connected to the sacred [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] conducted in [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]].

In its most general sense, the term "family organization" as used within the church refers to the fundamental concept of eternal family structure encompassed by the [[Plan of Salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Plan of Salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Woodruff |first= Wilford |authorlink= Wilford Woodruff |title= Discourse |newspaper= [[Deseret News|Deseret Weekly]] |date= 30 August 1890 |url= http://udn.lib.utah.edu/u?/deseretnews4,15008 |page= 308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, "family organization" refers to organizations created to provide structure and direction in meeting immediate and long-term family objectives and purposes. In connection therewith, LDS Church leaders have regularly taught the importance of establishing and supporting family organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Burton |first= Theodore M. |authorlink= Theodore M.

During the 20th century as part of the church's semi-annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conferences]], a "Priesthood Genealogy Seminar" was conducted by LDS Church leaders in which the importance of family organizations was frequently emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;One outcome of such emphasis was the development of a filmstrip, ''Turning the Hearts of the Children'', for usage at "family organization meetings." See {{ citation |title= Keeping Pace |journal= Ensign |date=January 1979 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1979/01/keeping-pace?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[E]stablishing and maintaining family organizations for the immediate and extended family"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= News of the Church: Church Consolidates Meeting Schedules: Suggestions for Individual and Family Sabbath-Day Activities |journal= Ensign |date=March 1980 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1980/03/news-of-the-church?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been expressly listed as an appropriate way to observe the importance of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] day in General Conference addresses and other church publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Perry |first= L.

==Purpose and organization==
In 1978 the church asked all families to organize themselves at three levels: as "immediate" families, "grandparent," and "ancestral."&lt;ref name=EoM-FamilyOrganizations&gt;{{Citation |last= Kunz |first= Phillip R. |year= 1992 |contribution= Family Organizations |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3680 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H. |editor-link= Daniel H.

More formal family organizations consist of the descendants of a common [[ancestor]]. The purposes of such family organizations may include coordinating family efforts in promoting [[welfare]], education, conducting [[family history]] research, holding reunions, compiling family newsletters and publications, and other family-related LDS practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= De Platt |first= Lyman |title= Organization Begins at Home |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1976 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1976/10/organization-begins-at-home?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Perkins |first= Lorrie |title= News of the Church: Policies and Announcements: Ancestral File |journal= Ensign |date=November 1981 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1981/11/news-of-the-church?lang=eng |quote= To avoid duplication, it would be helpful if records were submitted through family organizations. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorating family heritage and legacy is another typical purpose and activity for family organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Walton |first= Wendel K. |title= Extending the Family |journal= Ensign |date=July 1995 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1995/07/extending-the-family?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Sowby |first= Laurie Williams |title= Meeting Our Relatives on Paper |journal= Ensign |date=July 1993 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1993/07/meeting-our-relatives-on-paper?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Heaton |first= Alma |title= Really Getting Together: Your Family Reunion |journal= Ensign |date=June 1975 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1975/06/really-getting-together-your-family-reunion?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Hamer |first= Ginger |title= Family Fun with Genealogy |journal= Ensign |date=September 1984 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1984/09/family-fun-with-genealogy?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2016, LDS Ancestral Families Association (LDSAFA) was established as a "free registration, publication and support consortium for LDS Ancestral Family Organizations (AFOs)." &lt;ref name="LDS Ancestral Families Association"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/ldsafa/home|title=LDS Ancestral Families Association|publisher=sites.google.com/view/ldsafa|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Formally constituted family organizations figure prominently among descendants of some [[Mormon pioneer]]s and other early converts to the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=EoM-FamilyOrganizations/&gt; The longevity of and degree of organization found among many Mormon ancestral family organizations is noteworthy. For example, the Jared Pratt Family Organization was founded in 1881, making it one of the oldest family organizations in the [[United States]] in continuous existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Pratt |first= R. Steven |title= The Five Sons of Jared and Charity Pratt |journal= Ensign |date=October 1979 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1979/10/the-five-sons-of-jared-and-charity-pratt?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jared.pratt-family.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jared.pratt-family.org/|title=Jared Pratt Family Association &amp;#8211; Parley P. Pratt &amp;#038; Orson Pratt|publisher=jared.pratt-family.org|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 the [[Internal Revenue Service]] of the [[United States]] issued a Revenue Ruling determining that non-profit family organizations that are expressly "formed to compile genealogical research data on its family members in order to perform religious ordinances in accordance with the precepts of the religious denomination to which family members belong" are exempt under Section [[501(c)(3)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr71-580.pdf IRS Rev. Rul. 71-580] The Revenue Ruling noted that "[a]s part of the discipline of the Church, the members are encouraged to create family groups to study the genealogy of the family back to Adam and Eve. This is part of a broader program of the Church, apparent in its doctrine to record the names of all deceased persons and to perform baptism and other temple ordinances upon them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |last= Swans |first= Howard K. |title= Our Readers Write: Family Organizations |journal= Ensign |date=November 1972 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1972/11/our-readers-write?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their extensive documentation of lineages connecting many thousands of living individuals to a single common ancestor, their relatively larger extended family size (attributable in part to the early Mormon practice of [[plural marriage]]), relatively larger immediate family size, religious emphasis on "clean" or healthy living, and relative longevity, the genealogical data maintained by many Mormon ancestral family organizations have also been instrumental in medical research of [[genetic disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ citation |title= Discovery: The 'Genes' in Genealogy |journal= Ensign |date=August 1978 |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1978/08/discovery/the-genes-in-genealogy?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Utah]] has made unique contributions to the study of [[genetics]] due in part to long-term [[genealogy]] efforts of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]], which has allowed researchers to trace genetic disorders through several generations. The relative homogeneity of Utah's population also makes it an ideal laboratory for studies of population genetics.&lt;ref name="genetics"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sussingham | first = Robin |author2=Stephanie Watson |author3=Jennifer Logan  | year = 2006 | url = http://gslc.genetics.utah.edu/features/utah/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070219145225/http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/features/utah/index.cfm | archivedate=2007-02-19 | title = Utah: A Gold Mine for Genetic Research |work = Features: Genetic Science Learning Center | publisher = University of Utah | accessdate = 2006-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is home to the Genetic Science Learning Center, a resource which educates the public about genetics through its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Learn.Genetics | url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/ | publisher=Genetic Science Learning Center | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several large Mormon ancestral family organizations, notable for their longevity, quality or degree of organization, or connection to well-known deceased or currently living persons.&lt;ref name= "For the Fun of It" /&gt; A non-exhaustive list appears below.

'''Pharnabazus III''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Φαρνάβαζος; c. 370 BC - after 320 BC) was a Persian [[satrap]] who fought against [[Alexander the Great]].

==Youth==
Pharnabazus was the son of [[Artabazus of Phrygia|Artabazus]], satrap of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]]. However, Artabazus was exiled after a failed rebellion against [[Artaxerxes III]] in 358 BC. The family went into exile to [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], where they met the young Alexander. With Artabazus and Pharnabazus was [[Memnon of Rhodes]], a Greek mercenary and relative by marriage. 

Artabazus, Pharnabazus and Memnon were later allowed to return to Persia, where Memnon took command of the Persian navy in the Aegean with Pharnabazus in support.

==War against Alexander==
When Alexander invaded the Persian empire, Memnon defended the strategically important town of [[Halicarnassus]], which Alexander was then diverted to capture, forcing him to seek reinforcements.  This allowed the Persians time to regroup.

Memnon and Pharnabazus then directed their strategy to disrupt Alexander's supply lines by taking Aegean islands near the Hellespont and by fomenting rebellion in southern Greece.&lt;ref name = "bra"&gt;Pierre Briant, ''From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire'', Translated by Peter T. Daniels, Eisenbrauns, 2006, pp.826-832.&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, the Spartan king [[Agis III]] and the Athenian statesman [[Demosthenes]] organised forces to liberate their cities from the Macedonians. Memnon and Pharnabazus took [[Kos|Cos]] and [[Chios]], but during the siege of [[Mytilene]], the capital of Lesbos, Memnon died of a fever. 

Pharnabazus took control of the Persian forces in the Aegean, assisted by [[Autophradates]]. They captured Mytilene and the isle of [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]], which gave him control over the Hellespont.&lt;ref name = "bra"/&gt;

Pharnabazus further threatened Alexander's supplies by establishing a fortified position near Halicarnassus, which made the harbour inaccessible. He also took [[Samothrace]], [[Siphnos]] and [[Andros]] and seized all Greek supply ships. 

However, after the Persian king [[Darius III]] lost the decisive [[Battle of Issus]] in November 333 BC, Pharnabazus became increasingly isolated. The Spartan king, Agis III, whilst still dispatching ten ships and thirty talents of silver &lt;ref&gt;Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander,p.125 &lt;/ref&gt; withdrew from outright rebellion. Pharnabazus had to deal with rebellions in his conquered territory and many of his troops deserted him.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.: a historical biography'', 1974, p.254.&lt;/ref&gt; His much reduced navy was defeated near Chios and Pharnabazus was captured.&lt;ref name = "bra"/&gt; While being taken to Alexander, he managed to escape and went to Cos.

==Later life==
What happened after his escape is not known. There is a gap in the records.&lt;ref name = "bra"/&gt; It is assumed that he eventually submitted to Alexander, since in 324 BC, Artonis, the sister of Pharnabazus, was given in marriage to [[Eumenes]] by Alexander the Great; and in 321 BC we find Pharnabazus commanding a squadron of cavalry for Eumenes, in the battle in which he defeated [[Craterus]] and [[Neoptolemus (general)|Neoptolemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, vii. 4; Plutarch, Parallel Lives, "Eumenes", 7; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, xviii. 30-32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portrayals of [[God]] in popular media''' have varied from a white-haired old man in ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' to a woman in ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', from an entirely off-screen character to a figure of fun.&lt;ref name=Marsh&gt;{{cite book|title=Theology goes to the movies|author=Clive Marsh|pages=48|publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis|year=2007|isbn=9780415380126}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[trinitarianism|trinitarian]] Christianity, [[Jesus Christ]] is God, so [[cultural depictions of Jesus]] in film and television are also portrayals of God.&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt;

== Religious views on portraying God ==
Islam and Judaism both [[aniconism|prohibit pictorial representations of God]]. However, television and [[Hollywood]] cinema emerged from a largely Christian tradition—that whilst it shared the prohibition on [[idolatry]] was more relaxed about religious [[iconography]]—and the many [[Christian iconography|cultural depictions of God]] in that tradition that preceded the invention of television and cinema.&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;

Whilst even the humorous portrayals of God are rarely irreverent,&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt; portraying God is not without controversy. The animated television series ''[[God, the Devil and Bob]]'' portrayed God as being a beer-swilling, ex-hippie character who closely resembled [[The Grateful Dead]] guitarist [[Jerry Garcia]], which raised objections from [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups in the United States, causing the show to be pulled from broadcasting in the United States after just 3 episodes (although the entire series was broadcast in the United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Animation and America|author=Paul Wells|pages=76|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2002|isbn=9781853312038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;{{cite book|title=Drawn to television|author=M. Keith Booker|pages=77, 93|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=9780275990190}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the last films that British activist [[Mary Whitehouse]] campaigned against was [[Irvine Welsh]]'s ''[[The Granton Star Cause]]'', which portrayed God as drunken and abusive. Ironically, the campaign backfired, only serving the advertise the film more widely.&lt;ref name=Nash&gt;{{cite book|title=Blasphemy in the Christian world|author=David Nash|pages=230|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780199255160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Casting and acting the role of God ==
The role of God is a difficult one to play, and also a difficult one to cast.&lt;ref name=Marsh /&gt; The casting of [[Alanis Morissette]] as God in ''Dogma'' was influenced by the singer's own public dialogue with her faith, as expressed in her songs.&lt;ref name=Nash /&gt; The casting of African American [[Morgan Freeman]] as God in ''[[Bruce Almighty]]'' took the movie stereotype of a "[[Magical Negro|black angel]]" to a new level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Black magic|author=Krin Gabbard|pages=165|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8135-3384-8&lt;!--|ISBN=9780813533841 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of playing the role, Ella Shohat observes that God is a "rare challenge" for actors, raising the questions of how a [[method acting|method actor]] could possibly prepare for the part, and what possible personal feelings or experiences an actor could draw upon in order to portray a character that is [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and the creator of the universe.&lt;ref name=Shohat&gt;{{cite book|title=Taboo memories, diasporic voices|author=[[Ella Shohat]]|chapter=Sacred Word, Profane Image: Theologies of Adaptation|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780822337713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God has largely been cast as white and male, Freeman and Morrissette being exceptions to this, that line up alongside [[William Keighley]]'s 1936 film ''[[The Green Pastures]]'', where all characters, including God, are played by African American actors ([[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]] in the case of what the movie calls "De Lawd"). The opening prologue of that film included what amounted to a disclaimer, to make the movie palatable to the white audiences in the United States of the time, asserting that:&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisenfeld&gt;{{cite book|title=Hollywood be thy name|author=Judith Weisenfeld|pages=70–71|chapter="De Lawd's a Natchel Man": ''The Green Pastures'' in the American Cultural Imagination|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=0-520-25100-8&lt;!--|ISBN=9780520251007 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|God appears in many forms to those who believe in him. Thousands of Negroes in the Deep South visualize God and Heaven in terms of people and things they know in their everyday life. ''The Green Pastures'' is an attempt to portray that humble, reverent conception.|sign=''[[The Green Pastures]]''&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisenfeld /&gt;}}

A similarly unusual piece of casting can be found in [[Lars von Trier]]'s 1996 movie ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'', where God is both a woman and identical to the movie's (human) protagonist.&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;

Whilst in silent movies, the voice of God was simply an on-screen written caption, in the talkies, God's voice has presented a particular casting challenge, in biblical epics especially, since vocal intonation and accent carry with them implications of class, gender, and race. Although in both the Bible and the Qur'an God speaks, that voice is nowhere described. A filmmaker thus faces a choice about the voice to use, with no scriptural guidance to work from. This conflicts with the filmmaker's perceived task, in the case of biblical epics, of presenting scripture without interpretation or [[exegesis]].&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;

In biblical epics and similar movies, God's voice is generally cast to provide a sense of authority. It is deep, resonant, and masculine, and usually the [[California English|American English of Southern California]] (sometimes with a touch of [[British English]]).&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt; One unique approach, used by the movie ''[[Switch (1991 film)|Switch]]'', was to have God as two voices, one male and one female, speaking simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Giving up the ghost|author=Katherine A.

== Different portrayals ==
God has in fact been portrayed in movies ever since the days of silent cinema, in biblical epics, experimental films, everyday dramas, and comedies. A cantankerous animated God instructs [[King Arthur]] and his knights with their mission in the 1975 comedy ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jCt2lK9gBWAC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=god+%22monty+python%22&amp;ei=GcHjSbvrAZ_AzATg1KSuDQ | title=A Knight at the Movies: Medieval History on Film |author=John Aberth | publisher=Routledge | page=24 | year=2003 | isbn=0-415-93886-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Mitchum]] portrayed a cigar-smoking, American, God in Frédéric Fonteyne's 1992 comedy ''[[Les Sept péchés capitaux]]''.&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt; A suicidal supreme being identified as "God Killing Himself" expires in an act of self-immolation in [[E. Elias Merhige]]'s 1991 [[avant-garde]] feature ''[[Begotten (1991 film)|Begotten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Janet Maslin | title =Begotten: Breaking New Ground and Finding the Grotesque | publisher =[[The New York Times]] | date =June 5, 1991 | url =https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E0D7123AF936A35755C0A967958260 | accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Carlos Diegues]]' 2003 movie ''[[Deus é Brasileiro]]'', God is a down-to-Earth character, exhausted from his labours, who is taking a rest in the north east of Brazil.&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;

God as a character is often mentioned or intervenes in the plot of the CW show Supernatural. He seems as a loving, smart, serious, strategic, all-seeing, father, that observes events play out, but ignores them unless he absolutely needs to fix something 

=== Oblique portrayals ===
One new portrayal of God was in the television series ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. In that series, God is portrayed, in accordance with the programme's theme song ([[Joan Osborne]]'s "[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]"), as simply a proverbial "stranger on a bus". God is portrayed as taking on human form in a wide variety of shapes, from a piano tuner to a telephone repairman. Neuhaus characterizes this portrayal as an "unknowable but visible God, who sees and is seen and is among us always, in all kinds of forms, participating in our everyday life but not interfering with humanity's free will, and who nonetheless calls us into service". This portrayal was criticized in the first series for being [[ecumenical]], almost to the point of being [[secular]]. The creator of the series, [[Barbara Hall (TV producer)|Barbara Hall]], set out how God would be portrayed in some directives to the series' writers, named the "Ten Commandments of ''Joan of Arcadia''".&lt;ref name=Neuhaus&gt;{{cite book|chapter=''Joan of Arcadia'' and Fulfilling Your True Nature|author=Jessamyn Neuhaus|title=Doing more with life|editor=Michael R. Miller|publisher=Baylor University Press|year=2007|isbn=9781932792805}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, in the words of [[Amber Tamblyn]], ''Joan of Arcadia'' is "not religious, we're philosophical". Neuhaus deduces that this portrayal of God was in part motivated by the fact that ''Joan of Arcadia'' is a television show, a product, that has to appeal to a broad a range of viewers. Thus God, as portrayed in the show, does not call for [[proselytisation]]. Similarly, the portrayal of God is prepared to poke fun at Christian [[doctrine]]. Further, ''Joan of Arcadia'''s God spurns the [[supernatural]].

A more oblique portrayal of God occurs in the television series ''[[Wonderfalls]]'', where God appears not as a person, but as a series of inanimate objects, that lead the protagonist of the series to perform good works in other people's lives. The word "God" is never mentioned in the show in relation to these encounters.&lt;ref name=Neuhaus /&gt;

=== Off-screen portrayals ===
Some portrayals of God are entirely off-screen. For example: The God who gives the stone tablets to Moses in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' is, in the words of [[Paul Schrader]]'s commentary to the film, "off-screen to the right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblical epics|author1=Bruce Babington  |author2=Peter William Evans |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=15|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7190-4030-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such biblical epics have less trouble with this obliquity than non-biblical works. This because whilst there is no visual representation of God himself in the source text that such movies are based upon, there ''are'' visually representable elements that can be used, from burning bushes to clouds and fire, in the [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]]s of God. So whilst biblical epics are constrained by their source text to aniconism, they are not denied spectacle.&lt;ref name=Shohat /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">'''Prohairesis''' ({{lang-grc|προαίρεσις}}; variously translated as "moral character", "will", "volition", "choice", "intention", or "moral choice"&lt;ref&gt;Keith Seddon, ''Epictetus' Handbook'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fundamental concept in the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy of [[Epictetus]]. It represents the choice involved in giving or withholding assent to impressions ([[Phantasia (philosophy)|phantasiai]]). The use of this Greek word was first introduced into philosophy by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain C.: "The meaning of ''Prohairesis'' in Aristotele's Ethics" in ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' 114 (1984) 147-157&lt;/ref&gt; To Epictetus, it is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. The concept of prohairesis plays a cardinal role in the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' and in the ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Manual]]'': the terms "prohairesis", "prohairetic", and "aprohairetic" appear some 168 times.&lt;ref&gt;Cassanmagnago C.: "Il problema della ''prohairesis'' in Epitteto" in ''Rivista di Filosofia Neoscolastica'' LXIX, 232-246 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobbin R.: "''Prohairesis'' in Epictetus" in ''Ancient Philosophy'' XI, 111-135 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation by Epictetus==
According to Epictetus, nothing is properly considered either good, or bad, aside from those things that are within our own power to control, and the only thing fully in our power to control is our own volition (prohairesis) which exercises the faculty of choice that we use to judge our impressions. For example, if a person says something critical to us, that is not bad; or, if something complimentary is said, that is not good, because such things are externals and not in our power to control. By exerting the power of choice, it is possible to maintain [[equanimity]] in the face of either criticism and praise, which is a moral good. On the other hand, when people become troubled by criticism, or elated by praise, that is a moral evil because they have misjudged impressions by thinking that things not in their power (such as criticism or praise) have value, and by doing that they place a measure of control of their own life in the hands of others.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', p. 114-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

The importance of prohairesis for Epictetus is that it exerts a power that allows people to choose how they will react to impressions rationally:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remember that what is insulting is not the person who abuses or hits you, but the judgment that these things are insulting. So when someone irritates you, realize that it is your own opinion that has irritated you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be carried away by the impression; for if you once gain time and respite, you will find it easier to control yourself.&lt;ref&gt; ''The Handbook of Epictetus'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

By exerting their prohairesis (will, volition, or choice), people can choose rationally how to react to impressions. Prohairesis is the faculty that distinguishes human beings from all other creatures. Epictetus defines it as:
#a rational faculty able to use the impressions and to which all other human faculties are subordinated (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.23.6-15; II.23.20-29)
#a faculty capable of using impressions and understanding their use (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.8.4-8) 
#a self-theoretical faculty able to evaluate all other human faculties (e.g., ''Discourses'' I.1.1-13; I.17.1-3; I.20.1-6)
#a faculty impossible to be enslaved (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21) and impossible to subordinate (e.g., ''Discourses'' II.10.1; I.17.21; IV.1.161)

'''''Saved!''''' is a 2004 American [[Teen film|teen]] [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] involving elements of [[religious satire]]. It was directed by [[Brian Dannelly]] and written by Dannelly and [[Michael Urban]]. It stars [[Jena Malone]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Patrick Fugit]], [[Eva Amurri]], [[Martin Donovan]], and [[Mary-Louise Parker]].  The film touches on the issues of [[religion]], [[Social rejection|ostracism]], [[Christianity and homosexuality|homophobia]], [[teen pregnancy]], [[divorce]], and [[disabilities]].

==Plot==
Teenager Mary Cummings ([[Jena Malone]]), who has "been [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]] her whole life," is about to enter her senior year at American Eagle Christian High School near [[Baltimore]].  She and her two best friends, Hilary Faye ([[Mandy Moore]]) and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), have formed a [[girl group]] called the Christian Jewels. Mary’s "perfect Christian boyfriend" Dean Withers ([[Chad Faust]]) tells her, as they’re swimming underwater, that he thinks he's [[Homosexual|gay]]. In her shock, Mary hits her head in the pool, and has a vision in which [[Jesus]] tells her that she must do everything she can to help Dean. Hoping for a sign, Mary goes to a shooting range with Hilary Faye, who has a "spiritual solution for everything," and tells Mary (not knowing about the situation with Dean) that, if all else fails, Jesus could still restore their "spiritual and emotional virginity." Believing that Jesus will restore her purity, Mary sacrifices her virginity to have sex with Dean in an attempt to restore his heterosexuality.

Despite Mary's efforts, when she comes by Dean's house on the morning of the first day of school, Dean's parents tell her that they found gay [[pornography]] under his bed, and that they're sending him to Mercy House, a Christian treatment center. Mary tells her friends, as well as Hilary's brother Roland ([[Macaulay Culkin]]), who uses a [[wheelchair]], about Dean's homosexuality, and makes them promise to keep it a secret. When they arrive at school, they see Cassandra Edelstein ([[Eva Amurri]]), the school's only Jewish student, and a rebel who despises Hilary. In homeroom, Mary meets new student Patrick ([[Patrick Fugit]]), who is the son of the school's principal, Pastor Skip Wheeler ([[Martin Donovan]]), a skateboarder who has been doing [[missionary]] work (through skateboarding) in South America. Mary tries to put up a good front at the assembly, in which Cassandra fakes [[speaking in tongues]] in order to get under the skins of the other students.

Mary soon realizes that she is pregnant from her encounter with Dean. When she goes to [[Planned Parenthood]] to confirm the pregnancy, she is seen by Roland and Cassandra. Roland reveals that he is not really a Christian, unlike his fanatically religious sister.  Cassandra reveals she is only at American Eagle after being thrown out of her old school, and decided she could "handle the freaks" at American Eagle over being home-schooled by her parents.  Roland and Cassandra bond over their shared skepticism. Mary finds out that she's not due to give birth until after her high school graduation and decides to hide her condition from her friends and family until then.  However, she feels forsaken by Jesus and loses her faith, causing her to be ostracized by Hilary, and replaced in the Christian Jewels with a previously unpopular girl, Tia ([[Heather Matarazzo]]), who's been struggling to get into the Christian Jewels for years. Later, after Pastor Skip gets word about Mary, he tells the Jewels to help Mary regain her faith, but they seem to misunderstand him and stop Mary in the street and try to [[exorcise]] her of demons instead.

By Christmas, Mary is still hiding her pregnancy. Cassandra mocks her about it when they are alone in the bathroom, but when she realizes Mary's anguish, Cassandra changes her tone and offers her support. They cut school with Roland, and the three of them become good friends. When they run into Patrick and Hilary at the mall, Cassandra distracts Hilary (pretending she wants to be [[religious conversion|converted]]) while Patrick and Mary sneak away, and Patrick confesses his feelings for Mary. Pastor Skip warns his son against dating Mary, even as Pastor Skip (still married to his wife, although they live separate lives) has been secretly dating Mary's mother, Lillian ([[Mary-Louise Parker]]).

A few months later, after multiple fights at school between Hilary Faye and Cassandra, Pastor Skip puts Roland, Cassandra and Mary on the school prom committee (chaired by Hilary Faye) to punish them. While working together, Patrick asks Mary to go with him to the prom, which Mary accepts, but as friends. Later that day, Roland and Cassandra get their hands on a picture of a younger, much heavier, and much more awkward Hilary Faye, and load it onto the desktop of every computer in the school. The next day, someone vandalizes the school with [[graffiti]]. Mary and Cassandra are initially the prime suspects, and to their shock, the spray cans are found in their lockers. While searching the lockers with the Jewels looking on, Mary's homeroom teacher finds a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] of Mary's baby. She tries to hide it, but it drops to the ground in front of Pastor Skip's feet. Cassandra is expelled from school, while Mary is banned from the prom.

Pastor Skip tells Lillian that he will break off their relationship if she does not send Mary to Mercy House. Lillian decides that she's going to send Mary away, saying that it's the best thing for Mary and the baby, but secretly because she doesn't want Skip to break up with her. Despite being banned, Cassandra and Roland scheme to go to prom, and to bring Mary with them, providing her with a dress and inviting Patrick to meet them.  Roland also finds that Hilary Faye charged several cans of spray paint to her credit card just hours before the attack — indicating that ''she'' was the one who spray-painted the school.

Hilary Faye, Tia, and Veronica head to the prom. On their way in, Tia finds a credit-card receipt for the spray paint—signed by Hilary Faye. When Mary, Patrick, Cassandra and Roland arrive, Hilary attempts to have Mary and Cassandra thrown out, but Pastor Skip decides to let them stay. The four then accuse Hilary Faye of committing the vandalism herself, and framing Mary and Cassandra for it as revenge for humiliating her. Hilary Faye attempts to swear before God that she is innocent, but Tia, fed up with Hilary Faye's lies and [[hypocrisy]], reveals the signed receipt to everyone, exposing Hilary as the true vandal. Veronica turns on Hilary as well, calling her a fake.

As the now-exposed Hilary Faye flees with the others in pursuit, Dean suddenly arrives with other teenagers from Mercy House. Dean is surprised, but not upset, by Mary's pregnancy; he meets Patrick warmly, and Mary is similarly accepting towards Dean's roommate/boyfriend Mitch. Pastor Skip tries to send the new arrivals back to Mercy House, but they refuse, and Mary and her friends support them. Suddenly, Hilary crashes her van into the school's huge effigy of Jesus. Realizing what she has done, she breaks down in tears of regret. Cassandra shows some sympathy towards Hilary, feeling sorry for her. As paramedics arrive to the accident scene, Mary abruptly goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. There, Mary gives birth to a girl.

In her hospital room, Mary's and Dean's friends and family crowd around the baby girl, while Pastor Skip waits outside debating whether to come in. In a voice-over, Mary tells the audience how she has returned to believing in a God who loves and helps the ones that love and help others in need.

==Cast==
* [[Jena Malone]] as Mary Cummings, a quiet girl who attempts to help her gay ex-boyfriend, Dean, by giving him her virginity, [[Unintended pregnancy|unintentionally becoming pregnant]].
* [[Mandy Moore]] as Hilary Faye Stockard, the leader of the Christian Jewels and initially Mary's best friend.  She is an extremely devout conservative Christian, though very self-righteous and overbearing, much to the annoyance of others. She reluctantly cares for her handicapped brother, Roland, keeping him on a tight leash.
* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Roland Stockard, Hilary Faye's [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] brother. He fell out of a tree as a child, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.  Unlike his sister, he does not identify as Christian "I'm not really a Christian." (said to Cassandra)
* [[Eva Amurri]] as Cassandra Edelstein, the only Jewish girl to ever attend American Eagle. She is naturally rebellious and devious on the outside, but when she becomes friends with Mary and lovers with Roland, her true colors show in that she is actually very loyal and open.
* [[Patrick Fugit]] as Patrick Wheeler, the son of Pastor Skip, the school's principal and Mary's love interest.
* [[Elizabeth Thai]] as Veronica; adopted from Vietnam by a pair of missionaries, she is the third Christian Jewel.
* [[Chad Faust]] as Dean Withers, Mary's boyfriend at the beginning of the film. He comes out to Mary as gay.
* [[Martin Donovan]] as Pastor Skip Wheeler, the principal of American Eagle. A superficially pious and devout minister who is cheating on his wife, Pastor Skip tries to remain "young and cool".
* [[Heather Matarazzo]] as Tia; somewhat of an outsider in the beginning, Tia takes Mary's place in the Jewels when Mary is kicked out. Her father has a drinking problem which disturbs her deeply.
* [[Mary-Louise Parker]] as Lillian Cummings, Mary's mother, a widow from an early age.
* [[Dave Rosin]], guitarist of the Canadian pop-rock band [[Hedley (band)|Hedley]], appears as the guitarist for the band playing in the prom scene.

==Reception==
''Saved!'' received positive reviews from critics; at critics aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film currently holds a 60% rating of 82 positive reviews against 54 negative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saved/ |title = Saved! (2004) |accessdate = 2009-07-26 |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive reviews praised the film's blending of teen comedy with serious issues not normally associated with the genre. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it "a pointed satire in the form of a teen comedy". He and his partner [[Richard Roeper]] awarded the film "Two Thumbs Up!" on their show ''Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies''.

Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: "Not only is ''Saved!'' subversively funny, it is unexpectedly sweet."  David Sterritt of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' called it, "One of the season's brightest attractions."  Randy Shulman of the ''[[Washington D.C. Metro Weekly]]'' said, "Saved! hits precisely the right balance between commercial appeal and independent fortification, between bold satire and abiding respect for its subject." ''[[Film Threat]]''{{'}}s Don. R Lewis praised it: "Equal parts satire, spoof and teen comedy, ''Saved!'' is just a sweet and funny movie that starts off with bite but settles into an honest feeling of happiness and acceptance for all types of people and their choices."  Clint Morris of ''Movie Hole'' wrote that "As witty as it’s well performed and as novel as it is daring...God Bless Mandy Moore and her fantastic set of acting chops"! ''[[Apollo Guide]]''{{'}}s J. Allen Speer wrote: "Ends up genuinely thought-provoking while putting the “fun” back in 'fundamentalist'."  Brian McKay of eFilm Critic wrote: "while it offers some hilariously scathing commentary on the inherent dangers of hypocrisy . . . above all the film preaches a message of tolerance to both sides of the fence."

Other critics, however, criticized the film for alleged anti-Christian views. ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' was overwhelmingly negative on this issue, giving the film only half a star out of five and calling it the worst movie of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/saved|title=Saved!|author=ED GONZALEZ|date=April 14, 2004|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saved!'' grossed $10,156,933 worldwide at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=saved.htm |title = Saved! (2004) |accessdate = 2009-07-26 |publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sikh Rajputs''' are followers of [[Sikhism]] belonging to the [[Rajput]] [[caste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The A to Z of Sikhism |first=W. H. |last=McLeod |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |page=127 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgixwfeCyDAC |isbn=978-0-81086-344-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relocating Gender in Sikh history: Transformation, Meaning and Identity |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=236 |first=Doris R. |last=Jakobsh |isbn=978-0-19566-315-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1901 British census of India collected data on caste, tribe and religious affiliations of Indians. The census recorded 20,000 rajput converts to Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.55952/page/n3&lt;/ref&gt;

These are a group of rebel [[Rajput]] princes and their descendants who converted to [[Sikhism]] under the great influence of the [[Sikh]] Gurus after their release from Gwalior. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vZFBp89UInUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

These Rajput princes played an important role in the [[Khalsa]] army by militarising common Sikhs who were mostly peasants and traders into well trained soldiers. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/LifeOfBandaSinghBahadurBasedOnContemporaryAndOriginalRecordsDr.GandaSingh/page/n1&lt;/ref&gt;

They taught their Shastravidya to the [[Khatri]] Sikh Gurus and the common Sikhs, which was before that exclusive to Rajput princes only.

Such was the affection of the Sikh Gurus that these Rajput princes sacrificed their lives in saving the Guru's Panth which awarded them high ranking positions in the Khalsa army.
&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/SriGurPratapSurajGranthSteek-Volume1/page/n15&lt;/ref&gt; 

These Rajputs had successfully annexed the [[Punjab]] from [[Mughal Empire]] rule and established a new Sikh rule under the rakhi system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/martyrs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5054">'''Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism''' is a political ideology which combines a focus upon Sinhalese culture and ethnicity with an emphasis upon [[Theravada Buddhism]], which is the majority belief system of most of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It mostly originated in reaction to the colonisation of Sri Lanka by the British Empire and became increasingly assertive in the years following the independence of the country. 

==Contributions of Anagarika Dharmapala==
[[Anagarika Dharmapala]] was one of the leading contributors to the Buddhist revival of the 19th century that led to the creation of Buddhist institutions and Buddhist schools to match those of the Christian missionaries, and to the independence movement of the 20th century. He illustrated the first three points in a public speech:

::"This bright, beautiful island was made into a Paradise by the Aryan Sinhalese before its destruction was brought about by the barbaric vandals. Its people did not know irreligion... Christianity and polytheism are responsible for the vulgar practices of killing animals, stealing, prostitution, licentiousness, lying and drunkenness... The ancient, historic, refined people, under the diabolism of vicious paganism, introduced by the British administrators, are now declining slowly away."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ananda Guruge|Guruge]] 1965:482&lt;/ref&gt;

He called upon the Sinhalese people to rise. He strongly protested against the killing of cattle and eating of beef and promoted vegetarianism. 

==Relationship with other religions in Sri Lanka==
Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism has a fractious relationship with other religious communities like Christians, with protests often being organised by Buddhist nationalist organisations against [[Christianity in Sri Lanka|Christians in the governance of the country through movements like Catholic Action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-89656262.html Sri Lankan Buddhist monks protest against proselytizing Christians] AP Worldstream - January 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Buddhist nationalists and [[Hinduism in Sri Lanka|Hindus]] are more peaceful and friendly, with numerous Hindu figures, including [[Kandiah Neelakandan]] and [[T. Maheswaran]] working with Buddhist groups on the anti-Conversion bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/181704/Lanka-Buddhists-take-on-Church.html Lanka Buddhists take on Church] Daily Pioneer - June 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[D. B. S. Jeyaraj]] noted that both Sri Lankan Hindu nationalism and Buddhist nationalism rose as reactions to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/20040118/issues-more.htm Maheswaran threatens Tamil religious unity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304150628/http://www.thesundayleader.lk/20040118/issues-more.htm |date=2009-03-04 }} The Sunday Leader - January 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu-Buddhist collaboration is growing more prevalent in Sri Lanka, with the rise of groups such as the Hindu-Buddhist Friendship Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/05/30/new27.html Hindu-Buddhist Friendship Society soon] Sunday Observer - May 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spiritualism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[belief]] that the [[world (philosophy)|world]] is made up of at least two fundamental [[Substance (philosophy)|substances]], [[matter (philosophy)|matter]] and [[spirit]]. This very broad [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] distinction is further developed into many and various forms by the inclusion of details about what spiritual entities exist such as a [[soul]], the [[afterlife]], [[spirits]] of the dead, [[deities]] and [[Mediumship|mediums]]; as well as details about the nature of the relationship between spirit and matter. It may also refer to the [[philosophy]], doctrine, or [[religion]] pertaining to a spiritual aspect of existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/spiritualism], Spiritualism in Answers.com, retrieved February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, every religion that has ever been, has registered Spirit manifestations. Most all of the great spiritual leaders conversed or communicated with spirits although they were called other names, such as devas, pitris, gods, ancestral spirits, ghosts and magic.

A psychic is defined as someone endowed with exceptional sensitivity to the [[occult]] dimension, who experiences visions and revelations.

 | quote = Spiritualistic traditions are deeply rooted in shamanism, and, as such, are perhaps the oldest forms of religion. The medium is the modern urban shaman. In the séance she enters into a deep trance. While she is in that state, a control from "the other side" takes possession of her vocal cords and sense organs. The control is also a medium, a departed spirit who has capacities analogous to those of the psychic. Those who have "passed over" are thought to be still embodied, but their bodies are much more subtle than ours, though not perfect. Some occultists speak of the "beyond" as the "astral plane" inhabited by "astral bodies."  This idea is very much like that discussed by the nineteenth-century ethnologist E. B. Tylor in his theory of animism. There is another world parallel to our own, though invisible to us and not accessible to us in our state. However, all forms of organic life as well as inorganic matter is eternal and is translated from one sphere of reality to the other. The connecting link is the [[Mediumship|medium]], the person endowed with exceptional sensitivity to the hidden or occult dimension, who experiences visions and revelations.

==Definition==
Spiritualism is the belief that [[soul|spirits]] are able to communicate with the living by agency of a medium. The earliest recorded use of the word is 1796&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/spiritualism spiritualism&amp;nbsp;– Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was used by the prominent 18th-century spiritualist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. The term "spiritualism" has come to have different meanings. A broad working definition of the term would include the multi-faceted belief in a vital principle within living beings, a [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]], [[divinity|divine]], incorporeal being–force, [[spirit]]–[[wikt:anima|anima]] animating bodies etc. Adherents of spiritualistic movements believe that the spirits of the dead survive [[Wikt:mortal|mortal]] life, and that [[sentient]] beings from [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spiritual worlds]] can and do communicate with the living. Since ancient times, this has been an element in traditional [[indigenous religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Lawrence"&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Lawrence

 | title = Spiritualism Among Civilized and Savage Races
 | origyear = 1921| year = 2003
 | quote = What spiritualism is&amp;nbsp;— The belief that beyond the present natural, visible, material universe there exists another world&amp;nbsp;— real, but invisible; of a super-natural character; a sort of spiritual replica of the present, inhabited by the disembodies souls of men&amp;nbsp;— is not only the most primitive concept of the human race, but the most far-reaching dogma, ethically and religiously, ever enunciated by man. It is a belief that meets us in every stage of the culture, and forms the foundation upon which the varied creeds of savage and civilised races have been reared. Under its modern name, [[Spiritualism]], or [[Spiritism]], we are assured by its exponents that this spirit world can be scientifically attested, and that there exists no longer any satisfactory reason to doubt its truth.  As we shall see, such manifestations are not restricted to the seances held by modern Spiritualist but form the common procedure among barbaric and civilised peoples alike. Intelligent intercourse between these embodied or disembodied spirits is asserted to be possible by means of specially endowed persons called mediums.

Many reference works [http://www.onelook.com/?w=spiritism&amp;ls=a] also use the term ''[[spiritism]]'' to mean the same thing as "spiritualism" but ''Spiritism'' is more accurately used to mean [[Kardecist spiritism]]. Central to adherents' faith is a belief that spirits of the dead communicate with the living usually through a [[Mediumship|medium]].

The word also takes on specific alternative meanings in various differing fields of [[academia]], see below.

==Usage==
'''Spiritualism''' is used in English to mean either;
* 1) (''Religion'')&amp;nbsp;– the belief that people can and do communicate with dead people and the practices and doctrines of people with this belief.

{{Main|National Spiritualist Association of Churches}}
The Nine Principles of the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, USA are;

# We believe in Infinite Intelligence.
# We believe that the phenomena of Nature, both physical and spiritual, are the expression of Infinite Intelligence.
# We affirm that a correct understanding of such expression and living in accordance therewith, constitute true religion.
# We affirm that the existence and personal identity of the individual continue after the change called death.
# We affirm that communication with the so-called dead is a fact, scientifically proven by the phenomena of Spiritualism.
# We believe that the highest morality is contained in the Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
# We affirm the moral responsibility of individuals, and that we make our own happiness or unhappiness as we obey or disobey Nature’s physical and spiritual laws.
# We affirm that the doorway to reformation is never closed against any soul here or hereafter.
# We affirm that the precepts of Prophecy and Healing are Divine attributes proven through Mediumship.

Spiritualism is the process whereby all religions came into being as a result of communication with God and God's Kingdom of Spirit. Our Spiritualism is both universal and ancient. We seek to understand the many and varied aspects of Spiritualism which have existed upon our planet from the moment we stepped into physical form. We are Christian Spiritualists in that we look to the Master Jesus as a most profound example of Spirit alive in the world. We embrace his teachings and accept his challenge to do even greater things than he.

===France Pre-1848===
{{main|Spiritism}}French spiritualism, better known as [[Spiritism]]; popular throughout France and Latin American countries.
&lt;!-- develop with citations here, not to be confused with the philosophical school.--&gt;

Spiritualist beliefs are found from time to time in the early literature of the French "[[Animal magnetism|magnetists]]". As early as 1787 M. Tardy de Montravel wrote that in the trance the soul of the "somnambule" became freed from its body and was able to intercourse with other spirits. Dr G.P. Billot, and J. P. F. Deleuze and recorded discussing and documenting seances from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;Billot, G. P.. Recherches psychologiques sur la cause des phénomènes extraordinaires observés chez les modernes voyans, improprement dits somnambules magnétiques, ou correspondance sur le Magnétisme vital, entre un solitaire et M. Deleuze (2 vols.) . Paris, 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the early French Spiritualist, Alphonse Cahagnet, publisher of spirit messages such as "Arcanes de la vie future devoiles" (1848), is one of its foremost cases. Familiar with the teachings of [[Swedenborg]], and  interest evoked by contemporary German clairvoyants, in Paris of his day Cahagnet stood almost alone belonging to no school. For the advent of [[Modern Spiritualism]] in America, Cahagnet would have found few readers but his documentation of his work with the medium Adele Maginot were at once amongst the most remarkable and the best-attested documents on which the early case for Spiritualism depended.&lt;ref name=Podmore2000&gt;{{cite book

The spread of these beliefs began with a number of literary hoaxes undertaken by non-Indians such as [[Carlos Castaneda]] and [[Jamake Highwater]]. Several Native Americans have also sought to exploit interest in Native American spiritualism, writing distortions of indigenous spiritual practices and knowledge for consumption in the mass market. This situation has been attacked by legitimate Indian scholars and by activists such as the [[American Indian Movement]], Survival of American Indians and the late Gerald Wilkenson, head of the National Indian Youth Council.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book

===The Caribbean===
Spiritualism in the Caribbean has taken different roads of expression based on its contact with other religious systems. In urban areas, for example, Spiritualists were highly literate and more apt to indulge the concepts of foreign authors. In the rural areas, however, illiteracy was widespread and practitioners held a diverse array of beliefs and practices.

In [[Cuba]], for instance, two fundamental variants of espiritism exist:

* '''La Mesa Blanca Spiritualism''' is highly colonialized, meaning the European influence is quite evident. Catholicism, Native and African meld together into a syncretic belief system. This variant is designated by the use of La Mesa Blanca or "White Table".
* '''[[Egungun]] Spiritualism''' has strong [[Kongo people|Kongo]]–[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] roots. Elements from [[Lucumi religion|Lucumi]]/Regla de Ocha are evident. This type of practice, designated by the use of chants and dancing (performed by the mediums) in a line or chain to the beat of songs, hymns and invocations that ultimately lead to a state of trance or possession by the [[Spirit]], is seen in rural areas and in the province of [[Santiago de Cuba Province|Santiago]].

La Mesa Blanca Spiritualism is the type of [[Espiritismo]] that made its way to US. The old line Eggungun form of service has not made much headway on the mainland. Séances, in Latino cultures, are called ''misas''. [[Santería]], more properly called ''La Regla Lucumi'' (as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] were called in Cuba) is famous for its magic based on a knowledge of spirits and how to interact with them.

===South America===
{{main|Candomblé|Orixá|Vodun}}
Definitions of spirit possession, channelling and mediumship within the Brazilian 'cultos' is recognised to correspond with what appears to be the majority  view as described by ethnographers of spirit possession worldwide. There are a number of descriptions available concerning what happens when someone becomes possessed. Practises brought over by African [[slaves]] from West Africa,&lt;ref&gt;The Voduns of Maranhão: Maria AP Barretto, San Luis, Fund. Cultural of Maranhao, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed with indigenous South American tradition to develop their own flavour. During the suppression of Culto Omoloco or [[Umbanda]] by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] a period of syncretism commenced that included the introduction of images of the saints present in the churches presenting a new look for repressors behind which the Africans worshipped their gods and ancestors.&lt;ref name=Luz&gt;{{cite book

Spiritualism is also practised within India in both modern and ancient forms involving contacting the spirits, knowledge and wisdom of ancestors who are then worshiped for generations.

Possession by a spirit, even by those who are considered good, is typically construed as undesirable.

===Eastern Asia===
Noted as early as 1850 by J. R. Logan in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago IV. 552 who illustrated the different forms of spiritualism which prevailed in Eastern Asia at that time".

===China===
[[Way of Former Heaven|Hsien-t'ien Tao]] sects claim to represent a way (Tao) that transcends and unites all other religions. Explicit syncretism is a noticeable feature of these groups who claim that their teachings aim to unify the "Three Religions" (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism), the "Five Religions"  or even the former three plus Christianity and Islam. Most Hsien-tien Tao groups rely heavily on  [[spirit-writing]] as a means of communicating with "the Mother" as well as lower-ranking deities. Amongst practitioners, the T'zu-hui Tang differ from the other Hsien-t'ien Tao sects, which were all originally based on the Chinese mainland, in that it originated in Taiwan in post-World War II years. It was founded in 1949, when the "Golden Mother of the Jasper Pool" revealed herself through a [[Mediumship|medium]] in the northeastern Taiwanese city of Hualien.

in Japan, spirit mediums are called Reibai. Although the primary religion of Japan, [[Shintoism]] is essentially [[Animism|animistic]], relating to [[Kami]], or [[spirits]], [[psychical research]] typical of the West was introduced to Japan by Wasaburou Asano (1874–1937). Wasaburou established the Society for Spiritual Science Research in Japan and is recognized as creating modern Japanese Spiritualism. His successor Takeo Waki further developing the movement. Later Hiroyoshi Kuwahara created Neo Spiritualism which combined Japanese Spiritualism with the content of British spirit messages.&lt;ref name="Watanabe-1"&gt;{{cite journal

During this liminal period, spirits must learn how to "be dead", while the living struggle to reconcile themselves to the corporeal death and new spiritual life of the departed. Spirit possession and other forms of spirit communication, including the popular use of [[ouija]] boards, help to facilitate the process of "becoming dead" on both sides of the cosmological divide. Spiritualistic practices play an important role in helping individuals to understand death as a journey when it is also marked by social rupture and the problems of grief and attachment.&lt;ref name=Dernbach&gt;{{cite journal

Such universal practises and the giving of spiritual guidance, the different manifestations of spiritualistic activities were categorised by Sir William Crookes, a highly distinguished British physicist and chemist, as being:
*  The movement of heavy bodies with contact, but without mechanical exertion
*  The phenomena of percussive and other allied sounds
*  The alteration of weights of bodies
*  Movements of heavy substances when at a distance from the medium
*  The rising of tables and chairs off the ground, without contact with any person
*  The levitation of human beings
*  Movement of various small articles without contact with any person
*  Luminous appearances
*  The appearance of hands, either self-luminous or visible by ordinary light
*  Direct (automatic) writing
*  Phantom forms and faces
*  Special instances which seem to point to the agency of an exterior intelligence
*  Miscellaneous occurrences of a complex character.

'''Vern Harper''' (Traditional Name: Asin, meaning Stone/Grandfather) born on June 17, 1936&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UJoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=vern+harper+17+June+1936&amp;dq=vern+harper+17+June+1936&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD2_KN29PbAhXBbsAKHRJrCcIQ6AEIJDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; in Regent Park [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] – May 12, 2018) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[First Nations]] [[Cree]] [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]], [[medicine man]], and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] [[rights]] [[activist]]. 

The “Urban Elder” was a fifth generation grandson of Mistawasis, a hereditary Cree chief, and a sixth generation grandson of [[Big Bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dodemkanonhsa.ca/portfolio/verne-harper/|title=Vern Harper {{!}} Dodem Kanonhsa'|website=dodemkanonhsa.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vern-harper-1.4666986|title=Urban elder and Indigenous rights activist Vern Harper 'understood the realities of Toronto' {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a difficult and traumatic childhood, and was placed into the foster care system.

==Service in the Military==

Vern Harper was an American Military Veteran. At the young age of 17, from 1952-1953 he served in The Korean War in the 82ND Airborne Division.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.socialist.ca/node/3589|title=Asini Vern Harper: Red Power leader|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a paratrooper specializing in parachute assault operations into denied areas. 

==Political activism ==
In the mid to late 1960's he was the personal body guard of legendary singer Janis Joplin.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

And beginning in the late 1960’s, he was the Leader of The American Indian Movement (AIM) in Toronto, Canada. 

Harper became politically active as Vice-President of the Ontario Metis and Non-Status Indian Association in 1972.
 
Vern united The Toronto Warrior Society with The Ojibway Warrior Society of Kenora (led by Louis Cameron) and The Regina Warrior Society (led by Wayne Stonechild) to create the Native People’s Caravan in 1974, a cross Canada trek to raise awareness of broken treaties and grievances against the Canadian government. Together they were Dissidents for Native Peoples Rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1976, he founded the Wandering Spirit Survival School of Toronto (now known as First Nations School of Toronto).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/vern-harper/|title=Vernon Harper|last=McCardle|first=Bennett|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the author of Following The Red Road: The Native People’s Caravan, 1974 (1979).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Later life and career==
Mr. Harper was one of a few First Nations Elders with [[Chaplain]] Status, as recognized by the [[Correctional Service of Canada]]. As such, he provided spiritual services, [[sweat lodge]] ceremonies and traditional counseling to Aboriginal inmates. He also counseled Aboriginal youth offenders.

In 1997, Mr. Harper was the subject of the documentary ''Urban Elder'' which chronicled his life and role of community leader and Traditional Elder in an urban setting.

Mr. Harper served as Resident Elder at the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] (CAMH) in Toronto further promoting the role of First Nations spirituality in the treatment of [[mental health]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/10/25/no_more_burn_with_vern_for_native_people_at_camh_fiorito.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Elder Vern Harper-Asin was the Elder for the "Reaching Out: Child Abuse Monument" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.childabusemonument.com&lt;/ref&gt;. He performed traditional aboriginal blessings, purification and healing ceremonies as part of Child Abuse Monument events, quilt square workshops and during activities in the sculpting studio and bronze casting foundry. The imagery in the palm of his hand on his monument quilt square is a spider &lt;ref&gt;http://www.irvingstudios.com/child_abuse_survivor_monument/images/quilt_inventory/005B2_square.htm&lt;/ref&gt; representing his identification as "Heyoka". The Heyoka's humor and role as a clever and compassionate trickster were always close a hand in the traditional storytelling and ceremonies he performed. The written message Elder Harper-Asin engraved in the permanence of bronze beside his monument hand laments, "''I pray that the memory of the pain will leave forever – All my relations. Asin''”.

He resided in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. He died on May 12, 2018, at the age of 81, and was laid to rest at Pine Hills Cemetery, in Toronto, on May 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/05/16/indigenous-rights-activist-vernon-harper-dies-in-toronto.html Indigenous rights activist Vernon Harper dies in Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''worship pastor''' usually refers to a person who ministers using [[contemporary worship music]] or other [[Christian music]], as well as counseling and pastoring members of the church's music team and worship ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worship.calvin.edu/resources/resource-library/does-your-church-have-a-worship-pastor-yet-/ |title=Does Your Church Have a Worship Pastor Yet? |publisher=Calvin.edu |accessdate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theresurgence.com/Keldie_and_Boswell-Worship_Pastor_part1] {{dead link|date=October 2014}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206020709/http://theresurgence.com/Keldie_and_Boswell-Worship_Pastor_part1|date=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a distinct role within a church, that contains elements of, and overlaps with some of the roles of a church [[music director]] and [[pastor]], while being neither. Usually a worship pastor will also be considered a [[worship leader]] of the church with the added responsibilities of caring for members of a team, including other worship leaders and musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/tgcworship/2014/03/03/worship-pastor-a-biblical-job-description/|title=Worship Pastor: A Biblical Job Description - TGC|first=Matt|last=Mason|website=blogs.thegospelcoalition.org|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yahweh ben Yahweh''' (born '''Hulon Mitchell Jr.'''; October 27, 1935 – May 7, 2007) was an American man who in 1979 founded and led the [[Nation of Yahweh]], a [[new religious movement]] headquartered in Florida that had thousands of African-American devotees at its peak. Born into a family affiliated with the Antioch [[Church of God in Christ]] in [[Enid, Oklahoma]], his father, Reverend Dr. Hulon Mitchell Sr., was the minister and his mother, Dr. Pearl Mitchell, was the pianist.

In 1991, Mitchell was convicted of [[conspiring to murder]], though his followers committed the actual crimes. They murdered white people as an initiation rite to his cult, as well as killing former members who disagreed with him, in one case by [[decapitation]]. He was released on parole in 2001 on the condition of not reconnecting with his old congregation. He died of [[prostate cancer]] in 2007.

==Leader of Nation of Yahweh==
The Nation of Yahweh set up its headquarters in [[Liberty City, Florida]] in 1979. Broadly classified as a branch of the [[Black Hebrew Israelite]] movement, 
Mitchell's doctrine emphasized that God and all the prophets of the [[Bible]] were black and blacks would gain the knowledge of their true history through him. He also characterized whites and particularly Jews {{citation needed|date=October 2018}} as infidels and oppressors. Lastly, he emphasized loyalty to himself as the son of God, Yahweh.

Mitchell's business and charity efforts earned him respect in the community. The mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] [[Xavier Suárez]], declared "Yahweh ben Yahweh Day" on October 7, 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/us/09yahweh.html|title=Yahweh ben Yahweh, Leader of Separatist Sect, Dies at 71 |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=October 22, 2009|author=Douglas Martin|date=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a month before his indictment for alleged crimes.

== Crimes and aftermath ==
Although his followers remained devoted to him, by the 1990s, he was in trouble with the law. From 1990 until his release on September 26, 2001, he served 11 years of an 18-year sentence on a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) conviction after he and several other Nation of Yahweh members were convicted of conspiracy in more than a dozen murders. [[Robert Rozier]], former NFL player and devotee of Mitchell, confessed to seven murders.&lt;ref name="Walsh2005"&gt;Walsh, Anthony (2005). African Americans and Serial Killing in the Media: The Myth and the Reality. Homicide Studies Vol. 9 No. 4, November 2005 271-291 DOI: 10.1177/1088767905280080&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment charged 18 specific instances of racketeering, including  14 killings, two attempted killings, extortion and arson. He was acquitted of first degree murder charges in 1992.

Mitchell was released on parole in 2001, and returned to Miami, but his activities were strongly restricted until a few months before his death. He was prohibited from reconnecting with his old congregation. To assure this, he was restricted from any form of speech by telephone, computer, radio or television that could place him in contact with any congregational members. 
In 2006, as he became increasingly ill with [[prostate cancer]], his attorney, Jayne Weintraub, petitioned the U.S. District Court for his release from parole to permit him to "die with dignity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta-religion.com/New_religious_groups/crime_religion/Christianity/linked_beheadings.htm Cult leader linked to beheadings asks to 'die with dignity'], [[CNN.com]], October 6, 2006, [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A ruling on a failed appeal, U.S. v. Yahweh Ben Yahweh (792 F. Supp. 104) starts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Violent crime cases are the exception in federal courts. The instant case is arguably the most violent case ever tried in a federal court: the indictment charges the sixteen defendants on trial with 14 murders by means such as beheading, stabbing, occasionally by pistol shots, plus severing of body parts such as ears to prove the worthiness of the killer. They were also charged with arson of a slumbering neighborhood using [[molotov cocktail]]s. The perpetrators were ordered to wait outside the innocent victims' homes wearing ski masks and brandishing machetes to deter the victims from fleeing the flames. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, his lawyers’ attempt to end the conditions for his parole eventually succeeded.

Yahweh ben Yahweh faced conviction only for conspiracy to murder. A primary component of the prosecution's case was the testimony of [[Robert Rozier]], a former [[NFL]] player and Yahweh ben Yahweh follower, who admitted to several of the murders and testified in return for a lighter sentence.  Rozier later entered the [[Witness Protection Program]], but returned to prison after being given a 25 years to life sentence under California's [[three strikes law]], following a [[check kiting]] conviction.

He had the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] ID# 22031-034.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=yahweh&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=yahweh&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=70&amp;y=13 Yahweh ben Yahweh]." [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. Retrieved on May 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahweh ben Yahweh died May 7, 2007, from [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,270792,00.html |title='Temple of Love' Black Supremacist Cult Leader Yahweh Ben Yahweh Dies at 71 |date=May 8, 2007 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
The story of the police investigation and prosecution of Yahweh ben Yahweh is the subject of an episode of ''[[The FBI Files]]'' entitled "Temple of Fear" [[List of The FBI Files episodes|(Season 3, Episode 10)]] as well as an Investigation Discovery Channel episode of ''Most Infamous''.  On November 2, 2016 [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show|Rachel Maddow Show]]'' featured an exposé on Yahweh Ben Yahweh and his followers connection to the 2016 [[Donald Trump]] presidential campaign. A 2018 episode of People Magazine - Cults entitled "Yahweh Nation," also on Investigation Discovery, tells the story of Hulon Mitchell Jr.
