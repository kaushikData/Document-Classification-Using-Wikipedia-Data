[[File:Kvindernes Udstilling 1895.gif|thumb|Sketch of the Women's Exhibition from ''Illustreret Tidende'']]
The '''Women's Exhibition from the Past and Present''' ({{lang-da|'''Kvindernes Udstilling fra Fortid og Nutid'''}}) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1895 was an art and culture exhibition for women from the [[Nordic countries]]. Inspired by the [[1893 Chicago's World's Fair|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]], it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.&lt;ref name=eg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/udstillinger/1895-kvindernes-udstilling-iii.html|title=Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|author=Hald, Tonny|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/1294/%20-/|title=Emma Gad (1852 - 1921)|author=Ludvigsen, Christian|publisher=Kvinfo|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kvindeudstillingens-gamle-og-nye-koekken.jpg|thumb|Old and new kitchen exhibit]]
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|Woman's Building]] containing presentations of art and literature. [[Sophie Oxholm]] (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/eg-omtale/omtale/2004-eva-lous.html|title=Eva Lous: Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the [[Danish Women's Society|Women's Society]] but it was [[Emma Gad]] (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (''Industriforeningen''), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of [[Den Frie Udstilling]]. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]].&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;

==Exhibition==
[[File:Den-groenlandske-Afdeling-paa-Kvindeudstillingen enhanced.jpg|thumb|The Greenland exhibit]]
In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories ([[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Danish West Indies]]) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and [[whitework]]), music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/e-mat/dod/112308017118.pdf|title=Fortegnelse over Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.&lt;ref name=frie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstbib.dk/samlinger/udstillingskataloger/samlingen/000084459|title=Kunst: Den frie Udstillings bygning|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key organizers==
The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/49591|title=Kvinnornas utställning i Köpenhamn|publisher=''Idun'' (Årg. 8, N:r 26)|date=28 June 1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent "Women's Building" (''Kvindernes Bygning'') with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/|title=Kvindernes Bygning|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/historie|title=Kvindernes Bygnings historie|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Girl at My Door''''' ({{ko-hhrm|도희야||Dohui-ya}}) is a 2014 South Korean [[drama film]] directed by [[July Jung]] and stars [[Bae Doona]] as a policewoman who takes in an abused girl played by [[Kim Sae-ron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Kevin|title=A Girl at My Door's July Jung|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/a-girl-at-my-doors-july-jung|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=22 May 2014|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Kevin|title=Korean actors on A Girl at My Door|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/korean-actors-on-a-girl-at-my-door|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=24 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531225045/http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/korean-actors-on-a-girl-at-my-door|archive-date=31 May 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=BAE Doo-na and KIM Sae-ron Team up with Producer LEE Chang-dong|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&amp;seq=2662|work=Korean Film Biz Zone|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Cannes: Korean Star Bae Doona on How Hollywood Loneliness Informs Her Acting|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-korean-star-bae-doona-705832|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=22 May 2014|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Soon-jin|title=KIM Sae-ron of A Girl at My Door: The girl who stands by herself|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/webzine/sub/people.jsp?mode=A_VIEW&amp;wbSeq=48|website=Korean Cinema Today|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Cannes2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/60533.html |title=2014 Official Selection |accessdate=18 April 2014 |work=Cannes Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=A Girl At My Door Invited to Un Certain Regard|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&amp;seq=2996|work=Korean Film Biz Zone|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=Three Korean films to be featured at Cannes|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140418000748|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=19 April 2014|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sunwoo|first=Carla|title=July Jung work selected by Cannes|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2989202|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the film's portrayal of a lesbian relationship, and the contentiousness of [[LGBT rights in South Korea]], as well as the initial ambiguous relationship of the two main characters, the film had to be financed largely by the [[Korean Film Council]]. Because of this, the budget was limited to {{USD|300,000}}; Bae and Kim agreed to not be paid.&lt;ref name=lefigaro /&gt;

==Plot==
Following a personal scandal, police academy instructor Lee Young-nam is transferred from [[Seoul]] to take office as chief of the police substation in a quiet seaside town in [[Yeosu]]. Young-nam keeps a low profile and tolerates the drunken excesses of the locals, but drinks heavily at home, decanting [[soju]] into water bottles.

Young-nam meets Sun Do-hee, a timid and withdrawn 14-year-old girl covered with cuts and bruises. Do-hee is bullied by classmates and beaten by both her drunk stepfather Yong-ha and drunk grandmother; her biological mother abandoned them. The locals keep quiet about Yong-ha's injustices as he is the town's main employer, an oyster farmer.

After the body of Yong-ha's mother is found floating in the water, ruled an accidental death caused by drunk driving, Yong-ha attacks Do-hee again. Concerned for Do-hee's safety, Young-nam offers to let her stay with her during the summer vacation, despite scrutiny from the villagers. For the first time, Do-hee has someone who does not hit her and who calls her by her name instead of swearing at her. Do-hee bathes with Young-nam and imitates her, wearing her uniform and cutting her hair in the same style.

Young-nam is tracked to Yeosu by her ex-girlfriend, who asks her to move to Australia with her. They argue and kiss, and are seen by Yong-ha. When Young-nam discovers that he employs underpaid illegal immigrants, Yong-ha tells the police that Young-nam sexually abused Do-hee. Young-nam is taken into custody. She states she had no improper contact with Do-hee and that taking in an abused child was her duty; the investigator responds that this was inappropriate behavior for a gay woman. Do-hee tells the investigator that Young-nam sexually abused her, and Young-nam is imprisoned. Do-hee is returned to the care of her father and given a number to call if her father beats her again.

At her family home, Do-hee undresses, dials the number and hides the phone, then caresses her sleeping father. He wakes and begins shouting at her. She cries in protest, telling him "it hurts". The police break in and arrest the father. Do-hee tells the investigators that her father told her to lie that Young-nam abused her. Young-nam is released and receives an apology. She visits Do-hee and asks her if she made what happened to her father and grandmother happen on purpose, then leaves. As she is being driven out of town, she tells the officer to stop the car. She finds Do-hee and asks her to come with her.

==Reception==
At the film's official Cannes screening at the Theatre Debussy, the audience gave it a three-minute [[standing ovation]] and it received mostly positive reviews from the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Kyung-min|title=Bae Doo-na appears at Cannes fest with Jim Sturgess|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2014/05/201_157516.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ko|first=Dong-hwan|title=''A Girl At My Door'' rocks Cannes 2014|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/issues/2014/05/182_157569.html|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=20 May 2014|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=Cannes Takes to A GIRL AT MY DOOR|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/news/news.jsp?mode=VIEW&amp;seq=3041|work=Korean Film Biz Zone|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' called it "a resolutely left-field and refreshingly off-kilter drama [...] a deftly intriguing tale of [[alcoholism]] and [[physical abuse|abuse]] that starts off as a seemingly familiar domestic drama before spiralling off into something more unnerving and vaguely disturbing. It is driven by a strong cast and makes the most of it rural location that should be an idyllic but in fact its surface beauty covers up a series of rather dysfunctional people. The film is given heart and soul by a magnetic performance by the excellent Doona Bae."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Mark|title=A Girl At My Door|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/a-girl-at-my-door/5072172.article|work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the "wrenching drama" is a "layered expose of violence and bigotry in provincial Korean society" powered by "mesmerizing" performances by Bae Doona and Kim Sae-ron. It described Bae's portrayal as "both towering and frail," while "Kim is electrifying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Maggie|title=Cannes Film Review: ''A Girl at My Door''|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-a-girl-at-my-door-1201186678/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Twitch Film]]'' praised it as "Korean cinema at its finest," "gripping from start to finish [...] with its fair share of high drama, but unlike most of its Korean compatriots, it never overplays its hand and treats its audience with respect," and "so well-wrought that one can't help but be swept up in its artistry, which effortlessly plunges us into an intellectual reverie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conran|first=Pierce|title=Cannes 2014 Review: A GIRL AT MY DOOR Is Korean Cinema At Its Finest|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/05/cannes-2014-review-a-girl-at-my-door-is-korean-cinema-at-its-finest.html|work=[[Twitch Film]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=16 May 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140520122059/http://twitchfilm.com/2014/05/cannes-2014-review-a-girl-at-my-door-is-korean-cinema-at-its-finest.html|archive-date=20 May 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Korea Herald]]'' said it "deftly blends mystery and thriller," "does an impressive job of tackling modern Korean social issues, including alcoholism, [[LGBT rights in South Korea|homosexuality]], small-town politics, [[Migrant worker#South Korea|migration]] and labor," and praised "the three lead actors, especially Bae," who "offer memorable performances as troubled, lonely and searching souls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=Herald Review: ''A Girl at My Door'' powerful, resonating study of the alienated|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140513001203|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was less impressed: "While Jung's efforts to avoid [[sensationalism]] and employ multiple threads are very admirable, the result is a mild-mannered piece short of a sufficiently substantial exposition of its plethora of characters and the problem they face. All this leads to Bae giving an internalized performance dangerously close to blankness; fortunately, Kim is on hand with a turn that suitably brings to the screen the psychotic state of her battered character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tsui|first=Clarence|title=''A Girl At My Door'' (''Dohee-ya''): Cannes Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-girl-at-my-door-705257|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Film Business Asia]]'' also singled out Kim as "the standout performance in a generally impressive first feature by 34-year-old writer-director July Jung, that could have been even better with one more script revision and more animated playing by Bae. Despite that, it's still an involving drama with few dull moments, continually shifting the power balance between the three main protagonists. [...] All of this is a rich concoction that Jung generally brings off. But there are also annoying loose ends that weaken its dramatic impact, [such as] the backgrounds of the three leads are thinly drawn; and the final act has a slightly too manufactured feel. The film could easily lose 10 minutes to its benefit, by shortening or eliminating the repetitive scenes of the girl's beatings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=A Girl at My Door|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/a-girl-at-my-door|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|accessdate=20 May 2014|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">'''Ancient''' and '''modern''' are terms used in [[heraldry]] to differentiate two different coats of arms used at different periods by a family or other bearer. Reasons for changing arms have been numerous, the most famous being the change in the [[Royal arms of France|French royal arms]] to show three fleurs-de-lis instead of ''semee de lis'', possibly to symbolize the Holy [[Trinity]]. The reasons for other changes were more prosaic, for example where a court of chivalry ordered a change or [[Difference (heraldry)|differencing]] where two families claimed the same arms, as in the famous case of [[Scrope v Grosvenor]]. The resulting two versions of arms are referred to as "France ancient" and "France modern",  "Grosvenor ancient" and "Grosvenor modern".

'''Antonio Muñoz Degrain''' (18 November 1840 &amp;ndash; 12 October 1924) was a Spanish painter who began in the [[Academic art|Eclectic]] style, later in his career he moved towards [[Impressionism (art)|Impressionism]]. He is best known for his landscapes and scenes inspired by works of literature.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Valencia]]; his father was a watchmaker. Following his parent's wishes, he began studying architecture, but soon switched to painting &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmenthyssenmalaga.org/es/artist/54 Brief biography] @ the [[Carmen Thyssen Museum]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; and enrolled at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Carlos de Valencia]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/munoz-degrain-antonio/ Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; His time there was also short lived, as he soon moved to Rome and led a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life, becoming largely an [[autodidact]]. The rigors of surviving there prompted him to choose to return to Spain.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;[http://www.mcnbiografias.com/app-bio/do/show?key=munnoz-degrain-antonio Brief biography] @ MCN Biografías.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, he displayed his work for the first time at the [[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|National Exhibition of Fine Arts]] with a painting of the [[Pyrenees]], which gained an honorable mention.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; After that, he became a regular exhibition participant.

In 1870, his friend [[Bernardo Ferrándiz Bádenes]] obtained a commission for him to decorate the ceiling of the Teatro Cervantes in Málaga. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Charles III]]&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; in 1878 for his painting of [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] giving her jewelry to [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; The following year, he became a Professor at the "Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Telmo".&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

He made a second trip to Rome in 1882, this time on a government fellowship, and remained for two years. Upon his return, he won First Prize at the National Exhibition for his depiction of a scene from the ''[[Lovers of Teruel]]''.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; In 1893, as part of the [[Columbian Issue]], his painting of Isabella was used on a $1 U.S. postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usstampgallery.com/view.php?id=9ffd1ae121c4f26fe7f0c45ecdc85fa6ac245bf0&amp;Queen_Isabella_pledging_her_jewels U.S. Stamp Gallery]: Image and description.&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years later, he replaced [[Carlos de Haes]] in the chair of landscape painting at the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]]. He became the Director there in 1901.&lt;ref name="M" /&gt; In 1913, upon his retirement, he donated many of his works to the Academy of San Carlos and the [[Museu de Belles Arts de València]]. He died in [[Málaga]], aged 83.

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The '''''Bardo Thodol''''' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}, "Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State") is a text from a larger corpus of teachings, the ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro''{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}}}} revealed by [[Karma Lingpa]] (1326–1386). It is the best-known work of [[Nyingma]] literature,{{sfn|Coleman|2005}} and is known in the West as the '''''Tibetan Book of the Dead'''''.

The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the [[bardo]], the interval between death and the next [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. The text also includes chapters on the [[signs of death]] and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place.

==Etymology==
''Bar do thos grol'' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}) translates as:

* ''bar do'': "[[bardo|intermediate state]]", "transitional state", "in-between state", "[[Liminality|liminal]] state" (which is synonymous with the [[Sanskrit]] ''antarabhāva''). Valdez: "Used loosely, the term "bardo" refers to the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}} Valdez: "[The] concept arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}}
* ''thos grol'': "liberation", which is synonymous with the Sanskrit word ''[[bodhi]]'', "awakening", "understanding",  "enlightenment", and synonymous with the term ''nirvana'', "blowing out", "extinction", "the extinction of illusion".{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=21}}

==Original text==

===Origins and dating===
[[File:Zhi-Khro Bardo Thodol.jpg|thumb|265x265px|Centuries old [[Zhi-khro|Zhi-Khro]] [[mandala]], a part of the Bardo Thodol's collection, a text known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which comprises part of a group of bardo teachings held in the [[Nyingma]] (Tibetan tradition) originated with [[guru]] [[Padmasambhava]] in the [[8th century|8th Century]].]]
According to Tibetan tradition, the ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' was composed in the 8th century by [[Padmasambhava]], written down by his primary student, [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a [[Tibet]]an [[terton]], [[Karma Lingpa]], in the 14th century.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960|p=liv}}{{sfn|Fremantle|Fremantle|Trungpa|2003|p=xi}}{{sfn|Forbes|Henley|2013}}

===''bar do thos grol''===
The Tibetan title is ''bar do thos grol'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}} ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State''.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} It consists of two comparatively long texts:{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata" (''chos nyid bar do'i gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of dharmata (including the bardo of dying); 
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo of Existence" (''strid pa'i bar do ngo sprod gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of existence. 
Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as ''Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo'', ''Great Liberation through Hearing'', or just ''Liberation through Hearing''.{{refn|group=note|In Tibetan, ''bar do thos grol,'' ''thos grol chen mo'', and ''thos grol''}}

===''kar-gling zhi-khro''===
It is part of a larger terma cycle, ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}} popularly known as "Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones."{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

The ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation'' is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the ''bar do thos grol'' that are concerned with the bardo-state.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

===Three bardos===
{{main|Bardo}}
The ''Bardo Thodol'' differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: 
# The ''chikhai bardo'' or "bardo of the moment of death", which features the experience of the [[Ösel (yoga)|"clear light of reality"]], or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable;
# The ''chonyid bardo'' or "bardo of the experiencing of reality", which features the experience of [[Dzogchen#Tögal|visions]] of various [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] forms, or the nearest approximations of which one is capable;
# The ''sidpa bardo'' or "bardo of rebirth", which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth, typically [[Yab-Yum|yab-yum]] imagery of men and women passionately entwined.

The ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' also mentions three other bardos:{{refn|group=note|See also [[Trikaya]], [[Kosha]] and [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)]]}}
# "Life", or ordinary waking consciousness; 
# "Dhyana" (meditation); 
# "Dream", the dream state during normal sleep.

Together these "six bardos" form a classification of [[state of consciousness|states of consciousness]] into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of "intermediate state", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.

===Evans-Wentz's ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''===

The ''bar do thos grol'' is known in the west as ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', a title popularized by [[Walter Evans-Wentz]]'s edition,{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} but as such virtually unknown in Tibet.{{sfn|Lopez|2011|p=127}}{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was first published in 1927 by [[Oxford University Press]]. Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]].{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960}}

According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' introduced a number of misunderstandings about [[Dzogchen]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} In fact, Evans-Wentz' collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as "The Tibetan Book of Death." Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=72–73, 78}} Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was "fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist."{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=78}} He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical beliefs]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.&lt;ref&gt;Paul van der Velde&lt;/ref&gt;

C. G. Jung’s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz ed.|1965}} The commentary also appears in the Collected Works.{{sfn|Jung|1977}} Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically.{{sfn|Coward|1985|}} He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung’s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.{{sfn|Coward|1985|p=79-92}}

===''The Psychedelic Experience''===
{{See also|Ego death}}

''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'', published in 1964, is a guide for [[LSD|LSD-trips]], written by [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Richard Alpert]], loosely based on Evan-Wentz's translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} [[Aldous Huxley]] introduced the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Timothy Leary.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert, the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' is 
{{quote|... a key to the innermost recesses of the human mind, and a guide for initiates, and for those who are seeking the spiritual path of liberation.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=11}}}}

They construed the effect of LSD as a "stripping away" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and the stages of psychological "death" and "rebirth" which Leary had identified during his research.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218-219}} 
According to Leary, Metzner and Albert it is:
{{quote|... one of the oldest and most universal practices for the initiate to go through the experience of death before he can be spiritually reborn. Symbolically he must die to his past, and to his old ego, before he can take his place in the new spiritual life into which he has been initiated.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Albert|1964|p=12}}}}

===Musical and cinematic works===
*Finnish composer Erik Bergman composed a work titled Bardo Thödol in 1974 for a speaker, mezzo-soprano, baritone, mixed choir and orchestra; the text was based on a German translation of the Book of the Dead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information on Bardo Thödol in Finnish|url=http://composers.musicfinland.fi/musicfinland/fimic.nsf/WWOR/E03A946D1C98840DC22574AB002AEBA0?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "When I Was Done Dying", by American musician and composer Dan Deacon, is strongly inspired by the Bardo Thodol.

Two [[Broadway theatre]]s have been named the '''Bijou Theatre'''.

==1239 Broadway==
[[File:Bijou Theatre, 1239 Broadway, Manhattan.jpg|thumb|upright|1239 Broadway]]
The '''Theatre Brighton''',&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sun (New York)|''The Sun'' (New York)]]. August 25, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; at 1239 Broadway between 30th and 31st Streets, had been converted from a drinking and gambling establishment into a theatre for variety, and opened August 26, 1878 with [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]] as proprietor.&lt;ref&gt;Brown:273&lt;/ref&gt; The house had many changes and names until [[McCaull Comic Opera Company|John A. McCaull]], a Baltimore lawyer, and Charles E. Ford took charge of it. Considerable money was spent and when they reöpened the house on March 31, 1880, as the '''Bijou Opera-house''', it looked like a modern and well-regulated theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brown:274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' April 1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 and 1882, [[Lillian Russell]] appeared in three different operettas.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York). October 30, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' 1881-10-30, 1881-12-20, and June 6, 1882&lt;/ref&gt;

But the house proved too small to be profitable,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The plot is only 40 feet wide. See ''The New York Times.'' January 10, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; so after the performance of July 7, 1883 preparations for tearing it down were at once commenced:&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' July 29, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; R. E. J. Miles and Gen. W. B. Barton leased the premises for five years from its owner, Edward F. James. They agreed to advance sufficient funds to erect a new house, which was designed by J. B. McElfatrick &amp; Son and opened December 1, 1883 as the '''Bijou Theatre'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Real Estate Record.'' July 21, 1883&lt;/ref&gt; The first production was ''Orpheus and Eurydice,'' an adaption by [[Vera Freeman|Max Freeman]] of [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld|Orfée aux enfers]].''"&lt;ref&gt;Brown:281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' August 19, 1883&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York). December 2, 1883&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Adonis (musical)|Adonis]]'', starring [[Henry E. Dixey]], played its record-breaking run of 603 performances at the Bijou beginning  September 4, 1884. Another long run was ''[[The Music Master]]'', starring [[David Warfield]], transferred from the [[New Victory Theatre|Belasco Theatre]] on January 9, 1905,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' January 10, 1905&lt;/ref&gt; and playing 511 performances, for a total at the two theaters of 635, before closing September 29, 1906. The next big hit was ''A Gentleman from Mississippi'', starring [[Thomas A. Wise]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], which opened September 29, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' September 30, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; From June 29 to August 7, 1909, it played at the Aerial Gardens atop the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], with new scenery and costumes,&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York). June 30, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; moving back to the Bijou August 9. After giving its 400th performance (counting the Aerial Gardens) on August 25, the play closed on September 18.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York). August 22, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sun'' (New York). September 10, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bijou was later used as a silent movie house. It was demolished in 1915 and replaced by the present high-rise office building, which opened in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Broadway Database'' website. "Bijou Theatre"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Emporis'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

==209 West 45th Street==
[[File:Bijou Theatre, W. 45th St., Manhattan.jpg|thumb|209 W. 45th St.]]
The second '''Bijou Theatre''' was built by the [[Shubert family]] in 1917 at 209 W. 45th Street in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Broadway Database'' website. "Toho Cinema"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cinema Treasures'' website. "Bijou Theatre"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' April 13, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of three theaters that hosted the premiere season of the musical ''[[Fancy Free (musical)|Fancy Free]]''—but primarily it presented plays by many writers, including [[Sacha Guitry]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[A. A. Milne]], [[J. M. Barrie|James M. Barrie]], [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[William Saroyan]], and [[Seán O'Casey]].

In 1950, as the Bijou, it hosted one film, ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'', starring [[José Ferrer]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times.'' November 17, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, it became a [[CBS]] radio studio, then{{mdash}}as the '''[[D. W. Griffith]] Theatre'''{{mdash}}it presented [[art film]]s. It was reinstated as the Bijou Theatre in 1965, but was demolished in 1982 to make room for the [[New York Marriott Marquis|Marriott Marquis Hotel]].

The '''Blue Mosque''' ({{lang-az|گؤی مسجید}}, ''Goy Masjed''; {{lang-fa|مسجد کبود}}, ''Masjed-e Kabūd'') is a famous historic [[mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]]. The mosque and some other public buildings were constructed in 1465 upon the order of [[Jahan Shah]], the ruler of [[Kara Koyunlu]].{{sfn|Newman|2006|p=158}}
[[File:Blue Mosque interior.jpg|thumb|vault corridors of Blue Mosque, Tabriz]]
The mosque was severely damaged in an [[earthquake]] in 1780,{{sfn|Melville|1981|p=170}} leaving only the [[iwan]] (entrance hall).{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=224}} Reconstruction began in 1973 by [[Reza Memaran Benam]] under the supervision of [[Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (Iran)|Iranian Ministry of Culture]]. However, it is still incomplete.

==History==
[[File:blmreconstruction.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Plan of the Blue Mosque reconstruction.]]
The Blue mosque of Tabriz was built upon the order of [[Jahan Shah]], the ruler of the [[Kara Koyunlu]].{{sfn|Newman|2006|p=158}} His domain covered major parts of modern Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. Jahan Shah's wife, Khatun Jan Begum (died 1469), estestablished the endowment (''[[waqf|vaqf]]'') for the mosque's construction.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} However, just a few years later, Jahan Shah and his Kara Koyunlu were toppled by [[Uzun Hassan]] of the Ak Koyunlu, and Tabriz was taken.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} Jahan Shah's daughter, Saleha Khatun, was allowed to oversee the rest of the construction work by the new rulers.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} During the reign of [[Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan]], "the [[cupola]] of the mosque's mausoleum as well as its main parts were completed".{{sfn|Aube|2011}} Sandra Aube adds: "A few details from the mausoleum’s interior, such as alabaster pieces from the wall panels and the main prayer niche (''[[Mihrab|meḥrāb]]''), reveal that the mausoleum was never completely finished  (Golombek and Wilber, p. 407; Aube, p. 248)".{{sfn|Aube|2011}}  

Though the mausoleum was never completed, when the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] assumed control over Tabriz and made it their capital, the Blue Mosque itself served the new rulers as a mosque during the first half of the 16th century.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} In 1514, after the Safavids were defeated at the decisive [[Battle of Chaldiran]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] occupied and looted Tabriz, including the Blue Mosque.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} Aube notes that at least eight carpets were looted by the Turks and taken to [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Aube|2011}} Aube notes that even though it is not known whether the Turks attacked the structure itself during the capture and occupation of the Blue Mosque, several earthquakes did damage the building between the 16th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} It was especially severely damaged by the earthquake of 1780.{{sfn|Melville|1981|p=170}}{{sfn|Aube|2011}} However, in the 17th century, the Blue Mosque was already reportedly "completely destroyed and abandoned".{{sfn|Aube|2011}} In the 19th century, the local people of Tabriz looted the building's ruins.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} In the 20th century, during the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] era, the mosque was finally rebuilt.{{sfn|Aube|2011}} Reconstruction is performed by plans and supervision of Mohammad Reza Memaran Benam, a traditional architect from Tabriz, with authority of the [[Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization|Iranian Organization of Cultural Heritages]].

==Calligraphy==
The diverse [[Kufic]], and [[Thuluth]] scripts, the arabesque patterns, and the choramatic compositions of these facades, were created by [[Nematollah-ben-Mohammad-ol-Bavab]], the famous calligrapher. The walls inside and outside had been covered with mosaic tiles.

'''''But I'm a Cheerleader''''' is a 1999 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Jamie Babbit]] and written by [[Brian Wayne Peterson]]. [[Natasha Lyonne]] stars as Megan Bloomfield, a high school cheerleader whose parents send her to a residential inpatient [[conversion therapy]] camp to cure her [[lesbianism]]. There Megan soon comes to embrace her sexual orientation, despite the therapy, and falls in love. The supporting cast includes [[Melanie Lynskey]], [[Dante Basco]], [[Eddie Cibrian]], [[Clea DuVall]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], Katrina Phillips, [[RuPaul]], [[Richard Moll]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Kip Pardue]], [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]], and [[Bud Cort]].

''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s and [[heteronormativity]]. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as [[NC-17]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R]]. When interviewed in the documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.

Many critics did not like the film, comparing it unfavorably with the films of [[John Waters]] and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, some of the characters were described as [[stereotype|stereotypical]].

== Plot ==
Seventeen-year-old Megan ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a sunny high school [[Twelfth grade|senior]] who loves cheerleading and is dating a [[American football|football player]], Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in [[vegetarianism]] and [[Melissa Etheridge]], her family and friends suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike ([[RuPaul]]), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a [[reparative therapy]] camp which uses a five-step program (similar to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]' [[twelve-step program]]) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.

At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown ([[Cathy Moriarty]]), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock ([[Eddie Cibrian]]),{{refn|In ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', Nikki Sullivan calls Rock "overtly homosexual" and says that Mary's desire to cure her son of homosexuality is the inspiration for the True Directions program. (According to the film's backstory, she started True Directions after her husband left her for another man.)&lt;ref name=Sullivan55 /&gt;|group="nb"}} and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program). This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton ([[Dante Basco]] and [[Kip Pardue]]), [[making out]]. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their [[gender identity]] by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the [[Root cause|root]] of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, Graham ([[Clea DuVall]]) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.

The True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, [[ex-ex-gay]]s Larry and Lloyd ([[Richard Moll]] and [[Wesley Mann]]), who take the campers to a local [[gay bar]] where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all [[Picketing (protest)|picket]] Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting [[Homophobia|homophobic]] abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.

Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away. Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines. Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents ([[Mink Stole]] and [[Bud Cort]]) attending a [[PFLAG]] meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

== Background and production ==
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first feature film.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; She had previously directed two [[short subject|short films]], ''Frog Crossing'' (1996) and ''[[Sleeping Beauties]]'' (1999), both of which were shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. She went on to direct the 2005 [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[The Quiet]]'' and the 2007 comedy ''[[Itty Bitty Titty Committee]]''. Babbit and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Insurance]] (now Vice Chairman of [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]) after showing him the script at Sundance.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; According to Babbit, their one-sentence [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] was "Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp."&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; Burns gave them an initial budget of [[US$]]500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;

=== Conception ===
Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Advocate /&gt; With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she came up with the idea for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is "...&amp;nbsp;the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity."&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the [[Butch and femme|femme]] perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'' and ''[[The Watermelon Woman]]'').&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; She also wanted to satirize both the [[Christian right|religious right]] and the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] [[Brian Wayne Peterson]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Set and costume design ===
[[File:Cheerleader-pickets.jpg|thumb|alt=Three young women and three young men stand in a line, with an older woman and an older man. One young woman stands behind the rest, with her back to a bright pink van. The women wear vivid pink skirts and tops and the men wear vivid blue shorts and shirts. They hold placards, in bright blue and pink, which display statements including "Silly Faggots&amp;nbsp;— Dicks are for Chicks" and "Procreate". One young woman, without a placard, throws a rock in front of her.|The True Directions campers picket the ex-ex-gays. The intense colors were intended to show the artificiality of gender construction.]]
Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, [[David LaChapelle]], ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and [[Barbie]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;
She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of [[Gender studies|gender construction]]).&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; According to Babbit, the [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] character of Mary Brown represents [[AIDS]] paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] outfits.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink [[picket fence]] were filmed in [[Palmdale, California]].&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

=== Casting ===
Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film ''Sleeping Beauties'', to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and [[Melanie Lynskey]].&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt; She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short ''Sleeping Beauties'' and was eager to work with the director.&lt;ref name=Judd /&gt; She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster.&lt;ref name=Warn /&gt; Babbit briefly considered [[Rosario Dawson]] as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], would not be right for the All-American character.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;

Babbit made a conscious effort to cast [[Person of color|people of color]] for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as "racism at every level of making movies."&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph ([[Dante Basco]]) and Andre ([[Douglas Spain]]) to be [[African American]], [[Asian people|Asian]] and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered [[Arsenio Hall]] for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role.&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt; As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Fine /&gt;

== Themes ==
[[File:Grahammeg.jpg|alt=Two young women face forwards, standing over a pink wooden cradle. Both are wearing pink outfits and the background is a pink room. The woman on the left has chin-length dark hair and holds in her right hand a plastic lifelike baby doll. With her left hand she pushes the other woman, who has long, light brown hair and also leans over the doll.|thumb|Graham and Megan attempt to reinforce their gender roles through performing traditional female tasks.]]
''But I'm a Cheerleader'' is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the [[social construction]] of [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; One of the ways in which Babbit highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; Chris Holmlund in ''Contemporary American Independent Film'' notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes "gender-tuned."&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Ted Gideonse in ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.&lt;ref name=Gideonse /&gt;

Gender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." Nikki Sullivan in ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'' says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality.&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society and renders them strange or "queer."&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt; Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt; Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' an exemplification of [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name=Sullivan52 /&gt;

== Rating and distribution ==
When originally submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] rating board, ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' received an [[NC-17]] rating. In order to get a commercially viable R rating, Babbit removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a [[Panning (camera)|camera pan]] up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan "ate Graham out" (slang for [[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name=Taubin /&gt; Babbit was interviewed by [[Kirby Dick]] for his 2006 documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]''.&lt;ref name=DickFilm /&gt; A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; It compares this movie to ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though ''American Pie'' also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). Babbit says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film.&lt;ref name=GayWired /&gt; The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.

The film [[premiere]]d on September 12, 1999 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was shown in January 2000 at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It went on to play at several international film festivals including the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] festival and the [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]]. It first appeared in U.S. theaters on July 7, 2000, distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; [[Fine Line Features]] had intended to distribute the film but dropped it two months before it was due to open following a dispute with the film's production company, [[Ignite Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Churi /&gt; It closed after 8 weeks, with its widest release having been 115 theaters.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt;

The film was released on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD by Lions Gate on July 22, 2002 and by [[Universal Studios]] on October 3, 2002.&lt;ref name=Movieweb /&gt; Other than the [[film trailer|theatrical trailer]], it contains no extras.&lt;ref name=DVDReview /&gt; It was released on Region 2 DVD on June 2, 2003 by [[Prism Leisure]].

== Reception ==

In its opening weekend, showing at four theaters, it earned $60,410 which was 2.7% of its total gross.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; According to [[Box Office Mojo]], it ranked at 174 for all films released in the US in 2000 and 74 for R-rated films released that year.&lt;ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /&gt; {{As of|December 2011}}, its all time box-office ranking for [[LGBT]]-related films is 73.&lt;ref name=MojoGay /&gt;

The film was a hit with festival audiences and received [[standing ovation]]s at the [[San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Grady /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mandelb /&gt; It has been described as a favorite with gay audiences and on the [[art film|art house]] circuit.&lt;ref name=Tropiano /&gt;&lt;ref name=Benshoff /&gt;

=== Critical reception ===
Initial mainstream critical response to ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was mostly negative. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it a score of 34% based on 47 reviews,&lt;ref name=Tomatoes /&gt; and [[Metacritic]] gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref name=MetaCritic /&gt; The overall theme of reviews is that it is a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt; Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with "genuine laughs", however.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the kind of movie that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit."&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elvis Mitchell]] described the character of Megan as a sweet heroine and Lyonne and DuVall were praised for their performances.&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] called Lyonne wonderful and said that she was well matched by DuVall.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Marjorie Baumgarten said that they "hit the right notes."&lt;ref name=Baumgarten /&gt; Alexandra Mendenhall, writing for [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterEllen.com]] felt that the relationship between Graham and Megan, having great chemistry, does not get enough screen time.&lt;ref name=Mendenhall /&gt; Mitchell called their love scenes "tender."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;
Other characters, particularly the males, were described as "offputting" and "nothing but stereotypes."&lt;ref name=Mitchell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt;

Several reviewers compared the film to those of director [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] but felt that it fell short of the mark.&lt;ref name=Noh /&gt; Stephanie Zacharek called it a "Waters knockoff"&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Babbit says that although Waters is one of her influences, she did not want her film to have the "bite" of his.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt; The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film,&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and [[James Berardinelli]] called it a standout feature.&lt;ref name=Berardinelli /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt; Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.&lt;ref name=FuchsInterview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt;

Stephanie Zacharek, writing for [[Salon.com]] said that with regard to issues of sexual orientation and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted.&lt;ref name=Zacharek /&gt; Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" and that "the audience who might benefit most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point."&lt;ref name=FuchsReview /&gt; [[David Edelstein]] said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda.&lt;ref name=Edelstein /&gt; In contrast, LaSalle said that "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" and [[Timothy Shary]] said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers.&lt;ref name=LaSalle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shary /&gt; Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that [[queer]] identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan that there is no one way to be a lesbian.&lt;ref name=Holmlund /&gt;

Reviews from the [[List of LGBT periodicals|gay media]] were more positive, and the film has undergone a critical reassessment over time as it has been understood more to have been deliberately satirical and campy, drawing on John Waters' techniques. Feminist website Autostraddle declared the film to be #1 of 100 best lesbian movies of all time in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/100-best-lesbian-queer-bisexual-movies-285412/|title=The 100 Best Lesbian Movies Of All Time|date=August 11, 2015|work=Autostraddle|access-date=June 2, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AfterEllen.com (which covers the feminist "lesbian/bi pop culture beat"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/about|title=About – AfterEllen|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has called it "one of the five best lesbian movies ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/454739-sapphic-cinema-im-cheerleader|title=Sapphic Cinema: "But I'm a Cheerleader" – AfterEllen|date=September 25, 2015|work=AfterEllen|access-date=June 3, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That site had originally called the movie's story predictable and the characters stereotypical in its initial 2007 review, with the reviewer saying the film was, overall, funny and enjoyable.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall" /&gt;  ''[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]'' called the film an "incredible comedy" and said that Babbit has "redefined lesbian film" with this movie and her other work.&lt;ref name="Curve" /&gt; Praise was not universal, however. Jan Stuart, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', said that although the film tries to subvert gay stereotypes, it is unsuccessful. She called it "numbingly crude" and said that the [[kitsch]] portrait of [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]] is out of touch with today's gay teenagers.&lt;ref name=Stuart /&gt;

=== Awards ===
The film won the Audience Award and the Graine de Cinéphage Award at the 2000 [[Créteil International Women's Film Festival]], an annual French festival which showcases the work of female directors.&lt;ref name=SullivanM /&gt; Also that year it was nominated by the [[Political Film Society]] of America for the [[Political Film Society Awards|PFS award]] in the categories of [[Political Film Society Award for Human Rights|Human Rights]] and [[Political Film Society Award for Exposé|Exposé]], but lost out to ''[[Remember the Titans]]'' and ''[[Before Night Falls (film)|Before Night Falls]]'', respectively.&lt;ref name=PFS /&gt;

Artists featured include [[independent music|indie]] acts [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]], [[Dressy Bessy]] and [[April March]].&lt;ref name=soundtrack /&gt; RuPaul contributed one track, "Party Train," which Eddie Cibrian's character, Rock, is shown dancing to.

'''''Contra vim mortis non crescit herba in hortis''''' (or '''''Contra vim mortis non crescit salvia in hortis''''', [[Latin language|Latin]] meaning "''No herb grows in the gardens against the power of death''", or "''No [[Salvia|sage]] grows in the gardens against the power of death''", respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casperson|first1=John W.|title=A Chalice of Miracles|isbn=9781434395016|page=422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpIlp-e7JQC&amp;pg=PA422}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a phrase that appears in [[medieval literature]]. The broader meaning of the maxim is, "''Although you search any garden, you won't find a medical remedy against the lethal power of death''". The second wording that uses ''salvia'' in place of ''herba'' is a [[wordplay]] with the name of "[[salvia]]" (sage), which literally means healer or healthmaker.

Like many adages and maxims handed on from the Latin cultural tradition, this line is a [[hexameter]], the rhythmical verse typical of the great epic poetry in both [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature]].

According to [[Jan Wielewicki]] in his ''Dziennik spraw Domu zakonnego OO. Jezuitów u św. Barbary w Krakowie'', these words were said by [[Sigismund III Vasa]] on his deathbed. In ''[[Das Buch der Zitate]]'' by [[Gerhard Hellwig]], the phrase appears in ''[[Flos medicinae]]''.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CwG-books-Neale-Donalnd-Walsch-photo-by-Gil-Dekel.jpg|thumb|UK edition of 'Conversations with God' books (Book 1 is known as the 'blue cover'.)]] --&gt;
'''''Conversations with God''''' ('''''CwG''''') is a sequence of books written by [[Neale Donald Walsch]]. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and [[God]] answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book of the ''Conversations with God'' series, ''Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue'', was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on ''[[The New York Times Best Sellers List]]'' for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.

In an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of the dialogue ==
Containing nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.

=== CwG's basic messages ===
In ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:

# We are all one.
# There's enough.
# There's nothing we have to do.
# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.
# God is a collective, that is, there are many Gods and Goddesses who have been delegated some work each, respectively.

[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.

According to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.

=== God's motive for creation ===
In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that "knowing" and "experiencing" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.

This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just "know" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over "time" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.

=== Nature of the dialogue ===

Book 1 (page 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is "taking dictation" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. "All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me." (CwG1, page 58). [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, "I am the way and the life, follow me". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, "I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). Jesus is said to have said, "without the father (God), I am nothing". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). In Book 3 of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.&lt;ref&gt;Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; When Neil asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &amp;mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&amp;mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That lead to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&amp;mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).

== Parallels in other belief systems ==
In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and "God" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:

* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).
* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).
* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').
* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])
* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])
* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are. ([[Sikhism]])
* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insight.poeticmind.co.uk/12-application/12-2-space-pt-4-of-6/  'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Drewermann]])
* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). ([[Nietzsche]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Reality is a representation created by will. ([[Schopenhauer]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Nobody knowingly desires evil. ([[Socrates]]/[[Sikhism]])

''Home With God'', we are told, is the final book in this series of two-way written communication&lt;ref&gt;''Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-74326-716-8}}, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt; {see HwG page 308, "Our final conversation in public."}. In August 2016, however, Neale stumbled upon a "new and unexpected dialogue" continuing the original trilogy with a fourth installment released on March 27, 2017.

The first three books in the series are often called the CwG trilogy. In 2005, the trilogy was re-released as one combined 'Gift Edition' book. This edition contains the entire text of the first three books with 'God's words in blue ink and Neale's in black ink, and features a combined 3-in-1 index at the back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14749">'''''Cosmographia''''' ("[[Cosmography]]"), also known as '''''De mundi universitate''''' ("On the totality of the world"), is a [[Latin language|Latin]] philosophical [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegory]], dealing with the [[Cosmogony|creation of the universe]], by the twelfth-century author [[Bernardus Silvestris]]. In form, it is a ''[[prosimetrum]]'', in which passages of prose alternate with verse passages in various [[Meter (poetry)#Greek and Latin|classical meters]]. The philosophical basis of the work is the [[Platonism]] of contemporary philosophers associated with the [[School of Chartres|cathedral school of Chartres]]—one of whom, [[Thierry of Chartres]], is the dedicatee of the work. According to a marginal note in one early manuscript, the ''Cosmographia'' was recited before [[Pope Eugene III]] when he was traveling in France (1147–48).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Dronke]], ed., ''Cosmographia'', by Bernard Silvestris (Leiden: Brill, 1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bgAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The work is divided into two parts: "Megacosmus", which describes the ordering of the physical universe, and "Microcosmus", which describes the creation of man.

===Megacosmus===
'''1''' (verse): Natura ([[Nature (philosophy)|Nature]]) complains to [[Nous|Noys]] ([[Divine Providence]]; Greek {{lang|grc|νοῦς}}) that [[Hyle]] (Primordial Matter; Greek {{lang|grc|ὕλη}}), although held in check by Silva (the Latin equivalent of ''hyle''), is chaotic and unformed and asks that Noys impose order and form on the confused matter.&lt;br&gt;
'''2''' (prose): Noys reveals her status as the daughter of God and asserts that the time is right for Natura's plea to be granted. She then separates out the [[Classical element#Greece|four elements]] of fire, earth, water, and air from primordial matter. Seeing that the results are good, she begets the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], or [[Potentiality and actuality#Entelechy or entelechia|Endelechia]], as a bride for Mundus (World). Their marriage is the source of life in the universe.&lt;br&gt;
'''3''' (verse): This long poem in [[elegiac couplet]]s presents the results of the ordering of the universe. [[Aether (classical element)|Ether]], the [[Celestial spheres|stars and sky]], the earth, and the sea have become distinguished, and the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine orders of angels]] attend on the God who exists outside the universe. There follows a catalogue of the stars and [[constellation]]s, along with the [[Classical planet|planets]] and their natures. Then the earth and its creatures are described, with catalogues of mountains, beasts, rivers, plants (which are treated in particular detail),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Nigel F. |date=1994 |title=Plant Names in the ''Cosmographia'' of Bernardus Silvestris |url=https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/293604 |journal=Scientiarum Historia |publisher= |volume=20|issue= |pages=39–56 |doi= |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; fish, and birds.&lt;br&gt;
'''4''' (prose): The relationships between the powers operating in the universe are analyzed. All things under the heavens form part of a cosmic cycle, controlled by Natura, which will never cease, since its maker and cause are eternal. Hyle is the basis, whom the rational plan of God and Noys has ordered in an everlasting system, although subject to time: "For as Noys is forever pregnant of the divine will, she in turn informs Endelechia with the images she conceives of the eternal patterns, Endelechia impresses them upon Nature, and Nature imparts to [[Heimarmene|Imarmene]] [Destiny; Greek {{lang|grc|εἰμαρμένη}}] what the well-being of the universe demands."&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Wetherbee, trans., ''The'' Cosmographia ''of Bernardus Silvestris'' (New York: Columbia UP, 1973), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microcosmus===
'''1''' (prose): Noys displays the created universe to Natura and points out its various features.&lt;br&gt;
'''2''' (verse): With the work of Noys, Silva has recovered her true beauty. Noys (still speaking to Natura) declares herself proud of the harmony she has brought to the universe.&lt;br&gt;
'''3''' (prose): Noys says that for the completion of the cosmic design, the creation of man is needed. For this it is necessary that Natura seek out [[Urania]] (the celestial principle) and [[Physis]] (the material principle). Natura sets forth and searches through various regions of the heavens. When she reaches the outermost limit of the heavens, she encounters the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] whose responsibility it is to delineate the celestial [[Theory of forms|forms]] on the individual objects of the universe. He greets Natura and points out Urania, whose brightness dazzles Natura.&lt;br&gt;
'''4''' (verse): Urania agrees to descend to Earth and collaborate in the creation of man. She will take with her the human soul, guiding it through all the heavens so that it may become acquainted with the laws of fate and learn the rules that govern its behavior.&lt;br&gt;
'''5''' (prose): To gain the sanction of the divine powers, Natura and Urania travel outside the cosmos, to the sanctuary of the supreme divinity, Tugaton (the [[Form of the Good|Good]]; Greek {{lang|grc|τὸ ἀγαθόν}}), whose favor they pray for. They then descend, one by one, through the planetary [[Celestial spheres|spheres]].&lt;br&gt;
'''6''' (verse): Having reached the lower boundary of the sphere of the Moon, where the [[Aether (classical element)|quintessence]] meets the terrestrial elements, Natura pauses to look about her.&lt;br&gt;
'''7''' (prose): Natura and Urania see thousands of spirits. Urania tells Natura that, in addition to the angels who dwell beyond the created universe and in the heavenly spheres, there are [[Daemon (classical mythology)|spirits below the Moon]]—some good, some evil.&lt;br&gt;
'''8''' (verse): Urania bids Natura to review the totality of the universe and note the principles of divine concord that it manifests.&lt;br&gt;
'''9''' (prose): Natura and Urania descend to Earth and reach a secluded ''[[locus amoenus]]'' (called Gramision or Granusion—the readings of the manuscripts are disputed). There they meet Physis, accompanied by her daughters Theorica (Contemplative Knowledge) and Practica (Active Knowledge), who is rapt in contemplation of created life in all its aspects. Suddenly, Noys appears.&lt;br&gt;
'''10''' (verse): Noys explains that Natura, Urania, and Physis can collaborate to complete the creation by fashioning a creature who participates in both the divine and earthly realms.&lt;br&gt;
'''11''' (prose): Noys assigns Urania, Physis, and Natura specific tasks in the creation of man, providing a model for each. Urania, using the Mirror of Providence, is to provide him with a soul derived from Endelechia; Physis, using the Book of Memory, is to provide him with a body; and Natura, using the Table of Destiny, is to unite the soul and the body.&lt;br&gt;
'''12''' (verse): Natura summons her two companions to begin the work. Physis, however, is somewhat angry, since she sees that matter is ill-suited for the fashioning of a being that requires intellect. Urania assists her by eliminating the evil taint from Silva and containing the matter within definite limits.&lt;br&gt;
'''13''' (prose): Physis—making use of the imperfect aspects of Silva that had (somewhat uncertainly) submitted to the will of God and had been left over from the rest of creation—fashions a body. The [[Humorism|four humors]] are described, along with the tripartite division of the body into the head (seat of the brain and the sensory organs), the breast (seat of the heart) and the loins (seat of the liver).&lt;br&gt;
'''14''' (verse): The powers of the senses and the brain, heart, and liver are detailed. The [[Reproductive system|organs of generation]] will prevent human life from wholly passing away and the universe from returning to chaos.

==Platonic background==
The ultimate source for much of Bernardus' allegory is the account of creation in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', as transmitted in the incomplete Latin translation, with lengthy commentary, by [[Calcidius]]. This was the only work of Plato's that was widely known in western Europe during the Middle Ages, and it was central to the renewed interest in natural science among the philosophers associated with the school of Chartres:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chartres … would long remain the fertile soil in which this conception [of man as [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]]] would grow, and this the more as the ''Timaeus'', itself constructed upon the parallelism between microcosm and macrocosm, became a central preoccupation of teaching at Chartres. This was the first age, the golden age, of Platonism as such in the West, an age which found in the ''Timaeus'' an entire physics, an anthropology, a metaphysics, and even a lofty spiritual teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Domenique Chenu, "Nature and Man—the Renaissance of the Twelfth Century", in ''Nature, Man, and Society in the Twelfth Century'', trans. Jerome Taylor and Lester K. Little (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1968), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From the ''Timaeus'' Bernardus and the Chartrian thinkers, such as [[Thierry of Chartres]] and [[William of Conches]], adopted three fundamental assumptions: "that the visible universe is a unified whole, a 'cosmos'; that it is the copy of an ideal exemplar; and that its creation was the expression of the goodness of its creator".&lt;ref name="Platonism and Poetry"&gt;Winthrop Wetherbee, ''Platonism and Poetry in the Twelfth Century: The Literary Influence of the School of Chartres'' (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1972), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Thierry had written a ''Tractatus de sex dierum operibus'', in which he had essayed to elucidate the biblical account of creation "iuxta physicas rationes tantum" ("purely in terms of physical causes");&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Klibansky, "The School of Chartres", in ''Twelfth-Century Europe and the Foundations of Modern Society'', ed. Marshall Claggett, Gaines Post, and Robert Reynolds (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 1961), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and this perhaps accounts for Bernardus' dedication of the ''Cosmographia'' to Thierry.

Along with the ''Timaeus'' and Calcidius' commentary, Bernardus' work also draws on Platonic themes diffused throughout a variety of works of [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]], such as [[Apuleius]]' philosophical treatises, [[Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius|Macrobius]]' commentary on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', the [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ''Asclepius'', the ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' of [[Martianus Capella]], and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref name="Platonism and Poetry" /&gt; In addition to their Platonic elements, the latter two works would have provided models of the ''prosimetrum'' form;&lt;ref&gt;F. J. E. Raby, ''A History of Secular Latin Poetry in the Middle Ages'' (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1934), vol. 2, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and Macrobius' commentary had authorized the use of allegorical (''fabulosa'') methods in philosophers' treatment of certain subjects, since "sciunt inimicam esse naturae apertam nudamque expositionem sui" ("they realize that a frank, open exposition of herself is distasteful to Nature").&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Commentarii in somnium Scipionis'', ed. James Willis (Leipzig: Teubner, 1970), p. 7. The translation is that of William Harris Stahl in Macrobius, ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio'' (New York: Columbia UP, 1952), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
That the ''Cosmographia'' survives, in whole or in part, in about fifty manuscripts&lt;ref&gt;André Vernet, "Bernardus Silvestris et sa ''Cosmographia''", ''École nationale des chartes: Positions des thèses 1937'' (Nogent-le-Rotrou, 1937), pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that it enjoyed a good deal of popularity in the Middle Ages. Scholars have traced its influence on "a wide variety of medieval and renaissance authors, including [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]—whose annotated copy of the work we possess".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stock (historian)|Brian Stock]], ''Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester'' (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1972), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Bernardus' conceptions of Natura and Genius would be echoed and transformed in the works of [[Alain de Lille]], in the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', in Chaucer's ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', and in [[John Gower|Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''passim'', George D. Economou, ''The Goddess Natura in Medieval Literature'' (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1972), and Jane Chance Nitzsche, ''The Genius Figure in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'' (New York: Columbia UP, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craft Northern Ireland''' is the regional development agency for [[craft]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. In 2000, the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] took formal steps to establish "an organisation to help shape and define the craft sector in Northern Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Arts Council of Northern Ireland (2000), ''Review of the Crafts Sector in Northern Ireland: A Consultation Document.&lt;/ref&gt; Craft NI was set up in 2004 and is located in Cotton Court, [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast]].

Craft NI produces information and publicity about the craft sector. It represents Northern Ireland on national and international bodies including the UK National Advisory Panel for Craft, [[World Crafts Council]], NI Employers Panel for Creative and Cultural Sector Skills Council. It develops partnerships with other agencies for strategic investment in the sector including the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] and Invest NI.

In 2007, Craft NI hosted its first exhibition of contemporary craft from Northern Ireland. The work represented gave the first multi-disciplinary overview of craft in the region in the period from the 1980s to the first few years after 2000.&lt;ref&gt;McBrinn, J. (2007), ''Making changes: contemporary craft in Northern Ireland''.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, the exhibition travelled to the S Dillon Ripley Centre, [[Smithsonian Institution]] as part of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure]]'s Rediscover Northern Ireland programme.

'''August Craft Month''' is Northern Ireland's annual celebration of [[craft]] - a coordinated programme of events and activities that showcase the work of craft makers in Northern Ireland and from across the UK, Ireland and Europe.

Craft NI also runs a 2-year business incubation programme for designer-makers entitled 'making it'.

'''Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' or '''Old Croatian Art''' is [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]] [[Art of Croatia|of Croats]] from their arrival at [[Balkans]] till the end of the 11th century when begins the dominance of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style in art; that was the time of Croatian rulers ([[Dukes of Croatia|Croatian dukes]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]]).

==Historical background==
{{main|Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)}}
[[File:Dolazak Hrvata Celestin Medović.JPG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Celestin Medović]], ''[[Arrival of Croats]]'', before 1920, [[Croatian History Institute]], [[Zagreb]].]]
[[Croats]] have moved from northern Europe, together with other Slavs and Avars, to the area of former Roman provinces of Pannonia, Dalmatia and Istria, where they live til the present day. There they founded several [[principality|principalities]]: [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] in the north around the river [[Sava]], and [[Dalmatian Croatia]] along the western and southern [[Adriatic]] coast. Together they were known as [[White Croatia]], while to the east there were [[medieval principalities in southern Dalmatia]] which were at times collectively called [[Red Croatia]].

Croats have been developed to the stage of Iron Age, and they didn’t know how to enjoy the riches of Roman cities, so they inhabited not the city itself but its suburbs (like the river island on the delta of river Jadro next to city of Salona). Croats have assimilated Avars, accepted Christianity, and the ruling cast learned to speak and write Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Art of Early Medieval Croatia at culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt; Croats have accepted Christianity from Franks to the west and from Byzantium from the east. Most of the principalities have turned to Christianity in the 9th century except Pagania which was true to old Slav mythology until the 13th century.

[[File:Branimir.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with the inscription of [[duke Branimir]]’s name from year 880.]]
First Croatian ruler that was recognized by the [[pope]] was [[duke Branimir]], who was called by pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]] ''dux Chroatorum'' in his letter in 879.
First king of [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] from the [[House of Trpimirović]] was crowned around year 925 as ''rex Chroatorum'' and he united Pannonian Principality and Littoral Croatian Duchy into respectable medieval country  which peaked during the reign of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Petar Krešimir IV]] (1058-1074).

During the time of Croatian rulers the country was rarely ruled from one place and royal court would move from town to town in which there was a royal castle. The most important royal cities were [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], [[Biograd na Moru]] and [[Knin]]. Other bigger cities were [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Krk]], [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], Trogir, Ston and Dubrovnik, in which big number of original Roman population resided that was eventually croaticized.

After the death of last ruler from the dynasty of Trpimirović in 1091 most of Croatian nobility has accepted the [[Hungarian Kingdom|Hungarian]] king [[Coloman]] as a king of unified kingdom of Croatian and [[Hungary]], stated by the deal ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta Conventa]]'' from year 1102. In Hungarian Kingdom, in Croatia all art already has all characteristics of Romanesque style.

==Old Croatian architecture==

[[File:Zadar Sankt Donat 04.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of St. Donatus]] from the 9th century in Zadar]]
During 7th and 8th century in Croatia there is a trend of building smaller buildings from the material and decorative elements of ruined older Roman buildings. During the 9th century, parallel with the establishment of Croatian principalities, new architecture of pre-Romanesque characteristics emerged. It was based on numerous influences of which the Frankish and Byzantine were the strongest. Slowly these inherited influences were degrading in favour of original architectural forms.

[[File:Crkva sv. trojice.jpg|thumb|150px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Church of Three Saints]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (9th-11th century)]]
From this time, there are dozens of large ones and over a hundred small churches preserved across entire Croatian coastline and islands. They are all built out of roughly broken stones covered with thick layer of moulter inside and out, and with narrow decorative niches with arched top (like church of st. Peter in Priko near [[Omiš]] and St. Michael near Ston). Also, they often have stone [[Vault (architecture)|vault]]s, [[apse]]s and [[dome]]s, as well as stone furniture (frames of doors and windows, perforated stone windows, and altar fences) columns, beams and portals. Instead of classical Roman forms where every part of the building was articulated and had its own recognizable form, new pre-Romanesque buildings have those parts united in unified mass. Therefore, the point where the wall turns to vault, or to drum of the dome is almost unnoticeable. Even though they were built roughly with unsophisticated materials they have excellent and often perfect understanding of architectural space.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Radovan Ivančević from Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller churches are called “churches of free shapes”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art (Hr)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as which the medieval architects wanted to explore all possibilities of shaping on the circular and rectangular base. Cube churches with dome are a bit simple (St. Pelegrin, Dugi otok), rectangular with elliptical base are a bit more complex (St. George, Ravanjska), as well as single nave churches with dome above middle section (St. Peter in Omiš) and cube based churches elongated with two apses (Church of St. Donatus on Krk) and the most complicated ones are those based on Greek cross with dome on the centre and large apse in eastern wing and two smaller apses in northern and southern wing ([[Church of Saint Cross]] in Nin).&lt;ref name="culturenet1"&gt;[http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089 Culturenet.hr]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Church of St. Mihailo.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The Church of St. Michael in [[Ston]] from 1080, a foundation of [[Duklja|Doclea]] king [[Mihailo Voislav]].]] --&gt;
[[File:Crikva sveti Dunat 1.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Church of St. Donatus on the island of [[Krk]].]]
The most original churches are churches based on a circle with multiple apses that are spread around in radial rhythm. [[Church of St. Three]] in Split has radial 6 apses, while Church in Ošlje (Ston) is the ony one with 8 apses. The biggest church with circular base is ''[[Church of St. Donatus]]'' in Zadar from the 9th century. Around its circular base that has a dome there is a ring nave with gallery and three apses on the east. From that time in central Europe there is only Charlemagne’s ''[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]]'' that can be compared with its size and beauty.

Large churches often have one or three naves, like ''[[St. Saviour, Cetina]]'' from the 9th century which has rounded [[buttress]]es and a [[bell tower]] above the western portal ([[westwork]]).

In the 10th century Croatian queen [[Jelena of Zadar]], the wife of king [[Mihajlo Krešimir II]], built in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] two churches: [[Church of St. Stephen of the Island]] which was used as a royal mausoleum, and [[Church of Our Lady of the Island]], one of the biggest in Croatia which was used as crown [[basilica]]. Church of St. Stephen was built in Carolingian style with entrance hall above which was a gallery surrounded with two towers (westwork) from each sides of a [[narthex]]&lt;ref&gt;In its ruins was found famous sepulchral tablet of queen Jelena († 976) in which was stated that she was "widow of king Michael, mother of Stephan the king". http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?ID=23089&lt;/ref&gt; which led to tree nave church with two rows of pillars and a square apse at the end of central nave.

In the 11th century, next to older “Church on the Hill” in Solin, [[Crown church of St. Peter and Moses]] (better known as “[[Hollow church]]“) was built. The church was of unified Croatian pre-Romanesque forms and those Romanesque that appeared with the arrival of Benedictine monks in these parts. It has three naves, many thin niches inside and three apses of which middle is square and other are semicircular from inside and square outside. In this church the legate of Pope Gregory VII has crowned Croatian [[Dmitar Zvonimir]].

In northern Croatia there are only few fragments of interlace found in [[Sisak]], the capital of [[Ljudevit Posavski]]. When the bishopric was founded in [[Zagreb]] (1090), Croatian culture at the coast has already flourished for 300 years and Croatia was at the end of its independence.

==Sculptural ornaments==

[[File:10cent pleter Drzislav.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Croatian interlace]] with inscription of king [[Stjepan Držislav]] from the 10th century.]][[File:Bascanska ploca.jpg|mini|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Baška tablet]], the most famous glagolitic monument written with transversal type of glagolitic script from the 11th century.]]

Pre-Romanesque Croatian churches are also the most important historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and ciboriums we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke [[Trpimir]] (''PRO DVCE TREPIMERO''), from around year 850, while on the inscription of [[duke Branimir]] from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: ''CRVATORVM''. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes [[Muncimir of Croatia]], [[Držislav]] and [[Svetislav]], all the way to [[king Zvonimir]] from the end of the 11th century.
That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in [[Croatian language]], written in [[Glagolitic script]] ([[Baška tablet]]).

Double literacy and two scripts have been noticed in several monuments as [[Plomin tablet]] (Istria) and [[Valun tablet]] ([[Cres]], 11th century) where we have Latin language and script as well as Croatian translation in Glagolitic script. Nevertheless, soon the Latin script replaced the Glagolitic which was the only way that Croats would be accepted into still Romanized Medieval Europe. However, Croats will use their native language and script all the way to the 16th century, especially in Istria, Kvarner and on the Croatian coast.&lt;ref name="culturenet1"/&gt;

[[File:Reljef splitska krstionica.jpg|thumb|left|150px|&lt;center&gt;Baptistery with figure of Croatian king from the 11th century; now in the [[Split Cathedral]].]][[File:Plomin tablet 1.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;center&gt;[[Plomin tablet]]]]
Altar fences and stone perforated windows were decorated with shallow interlace ornament which we call [[Croatian interlace]]. Motifs of this interlace are often of classical origin (waves, three string interlace, pentagrams, nets of rhomboids, etc.), but while in the Roman art it was used only as a frame, here they cover the entire surface. Sheer number, but also the quality of stonework, of these monuments tells us of rich masonry tradition of numerous masters and workshops on the east coast of Adriatic. Comparing to thousands of fragments found in Dalmatia, in the northern Croatia there are only two confirmed founds: one in [[Lobor]] and one in [[Ilok]].&lt;ref&gt;Radovan Ivančević, ''Umjetnost razdoblja život I.'', Profil, Zagreb, 2001, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the interlace is replaced with figures of Gospels (like on the altar fence of Holy Sunday Church in Zadar), but those figures are flatten and their character lines are reduced to graphic lines in outmost linear stylization. The same is the relief from Crown Hollow church of [[king Zvonimir]] in Solin with the figure of ''(Croatian) king'' on the throne with [[Franks|Frankish crown]], beside him is a page, and on the ground is a bowing subject. This relief is from the 15th century a front part of a baptistery in Split Cathedral.

In church of St. Mary from the 11th century in Bishopric (Biskupija) near [[Knin]] the oldest figure of Holy Mary in Croatia was found.&lt;ref&gt;Josip Soldo: History of Church in Croatia, Zagreb-Frankfurt/M., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Romanesque painting in Croatia==

Croatian interlace was originally painted, usually every string would be coloured brightly yellow, red or blue. Since the wall paintings that are mentioned in several literal sources (like the portraits of Trpimirović dynasty in church of St. George in Putalj above [[Kaštel Sućurac]]) are not preserved, they are only type of pre-Romanesque Croatian painting.

[[File:Fresco of Mihailo Vojislavljević, njegos.org.jpg|thumb|150px|right|&lt;center&gt;Portrait of [[Mihailo I of Duklja]], the first recognized ruler of Duklja on a fresco in the ''Church of St. Michael'' in ''[[Ston]]''.]]
The only preserved paintings are found in the [[church of St. Michael near Ston]] from the 11th century . They were ordered by [[Duklja|Doclea]]n ruler [[Mihailo Vojislav]], and were a work of local artist who with rough form and primitive materials achieved strong and suggestive expression in portrayed characters. The figure of a king that holds a model of a church has the same crown as the king depicted in the relief in Split baptistery. His portrait is also remarkable, it shows bony person with high eyebrows and wrinkled forehead, while his long hair and beard are already partly gray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 Ljubo Karaman, Old Croatian Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728165026/http://www.vucafe.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=7517 |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately significant number of church [[codex|codices]] were preserved. They were done on pergam with pre-Romanesque [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s of high quality and technique. The oldest one is [[Split Breviary]] that was written and painted from the 8th to 11th centuries, based on famous Breviaries from pre-Carolingian era. In [[Zagreb]] there is a [[Liber psalmorum]] which was illuminated in [[Benedictine]] style by [[prior]] Majon for archbishop Paul of Split (c. 1015–1030). In [[Vatican City|Vatican]] there is a Breviary, also in monte-cassino Benedictine style (initials of intertwined leaves, interlace and animal heads) which originates from monastery of St. Nicola in Osor. The same style of illumination we can found in Breviars in [[Trogir]], [[Šibenik]] and [[Dubrovnik]] but there are many that were recorded (like 47 books in only one church in monastery of St. Peter in Seka) but not preserved.

The '''Design Research Unit''' (DRU) was one of the first generation of British [[design|design consultancies]] combining expertise in architecture, graphics and industrial design. It was founded by the managing director of [[Stuart Advertising Agency]], Marcus Brumwell with [[Misha Black]] and [[Milner Gray (designer)|Milner Gray]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/oct/12/design-research-unit-branding-britain Guardian 12 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It became well known for its work in relation to the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951 and its influential [[corporate identity]] project for [[British Rail]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''Creative Review'' December 201&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, DRU merged with [[Scott Brownrigg]] architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottbrownrigg.com/our_services/design_research_unit/ Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:40034 Sheffield.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Rail Class 40|British Rail class 40 locomotive]], featuring the 1965 corporate branding by DRU]]

The group officially formed in 1943 following discussions begun by Marcus Brumwell, and the poet and writer [[Herbert Read]] the previous year. An early set of notes proposed a "service equipped to advise on all problems of design", addressing the needs of "the State, Municipal Authorities, Industry or Commerce." They anticipated a post-war demand for technical expertise and a need for "the reconditioning and re-designing public utility services" recommending "contact... with the railway companies, motor coach lines and so on."&lt;ref &gt;Milner Gray "Notes on the Formation and Operation of a Design Group" 20 October, 1942 (unpublished) p.1 &lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Read became their first member of staff, sharing offices in [[Kingsway (London)|Kingsway]] with [[Mass-Observation]], another initiative that Brumwell supported under the umbrella of the Advertising Services Guild. Read was joined by [[Bernard Hollowood]] in 1944 and after an unsuccessful tour of factories in the Midlands they engaged the sculptor [[Naum Gabo]] to design a new car for [[Jowett]]. The contract was terminated by the company in 1945.&lt;ref &gt;James King, "The Last Modern: A Life of Herbert Read" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: London, 1990) p. 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

Black and Gray were initially committed to wartime roles within the Exhibitions Department for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. Under their leadership, DRU made important postwar contributions to the [[Britain Can Make It]] exhibition (1946) and [[Festival of Britain]] (1951). At the invitation of the Council of Industrial Design (afterward [[Design Council]]), DRU designed the Quiz Machines that sought to gauge public taste at BCMI, as well as the highly didactic ‘What [[Industrial Design]] Means’ display (by Black, [[Bronek Katz]], and R. Vaughan). This marked the beginning of a long association between the two bodies. For the Festival of Britain they were the architects for the Regatta Restaurant and designed a series of displays for the [[Dome of Discovery]].

[[File:Bayswater Road.001 - London.JPG|thumb|right|City of Westminster street name signs by [[Misha Black]]]]

Key DRU commissions included the 1954 Electricity Board Showrooms, by Black, Gibson, and H. Diamond, the [[BOAC]] engineering hall at London Airport (Heathrow) by Black, Kenneth Bayes, and BOAC staff from 1951 to 1955, and a number of interiors for the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] [[Orient Line]]'s new liner ''[[SS Oriana (1959)|Oriana]]'' by Black and Bayes in 1959. Other companies for whom DRU worked included [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]], [[Courage (brewery)|Courage]], [[Watney Combe &amp; Reid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.artupdate.com/2010/09/uk-touring-exhibition-design-research-unit-1942-72/ DRU touring exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]], and [[British Railways]]. The 1968 [[City of Westminster]] street name signs by Misha Black (typography and implementation by Christopher Timings and Roger Bridgman) have become an integral part of London's streetscape.

Since this time, DRU has worked for many high-profile companies, in interior design, graphic design and architecture. Projects of note include:
* Architectural design for: [[London Underground]]'s [[Jubilee line]] extension works, [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR), [[Copenhagen Metro]], [[Mass Transit Railway|Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway]], [[Nottingham]]'s guided bus system
* Graphic design &amp; wayfinding for: [[Network Rail]], Lee Valley, [[Tarmac (company)|Tarmac]]

Their work is the subject of a [[Cubitt Artists]] touring exhibition and publication by Michelle Cotton.

'''Edouard Duval-Carrié''' (born 1954) is a [[Haiti]]an-born American painter and sculptor.

==Life==
Edouard Duval-Carrié was born in [[Port-au-Prince]]. His family emigrated to [[Puerto Rico]] while he was a child during the [[François Duvalier]] regime.&lt;ref name="congdon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artists from Latin American Cultures: A Biographical Dictionary|pages=74–76|author=Kristin G.

He later attended the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], from 1988 to 1989.  He resided in France for many years and currently lives in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  "I didn't want to go back to Haiti because of the political turmoil there.

Duvalier en Folle de Marié'' (''[[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] as Mad Bride'') is a criticism of the country's controversial leader.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  Later in ''Mardigras at [[Fort Dimanche]]'' Duval-Carrié juxtaposes Duvalier against a torture chamber, an army general, and other symbols of the repressive regime.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;  [[New York University]] classified his output as [[magical realism]] for an event to accompany the book launch of ''Continental Shifts: The Art of Edouard Duval-Carrié'', which was published by the university's press.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/2000|title=’’Continental Shifts: The Art of Edouard Duval-Carrié’’ Book Launch at NYU, Mar. 27|publisher=New York University|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He operates in a variety of media: altarpieces, lacquered tiles, and reliquaries in addition to painting and sculpture.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt;  Installations have become more prevalent in his recent output.&lt;ref name="congdon" /&gt;

As Duval-Carrié explained his artistic motivations for a Miami art gallery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have tried to analyze the historical context of the genesis of that partial island nation [Haiti], looked at the strife and suffering that brought the then society of slaves and slave masters to the point of ebullition. I look closely at the savagery on both parts of the struggle, understanding and giving my total sympathy to the downtrodden, not realizing that patterns are easily learned and extremely resilient to alteration... I have scrutinized the successive generations of pathetic leaders and their sordid entourages...  But that is politics and an artist should be well cautioned to keep at bay that kind of poetry, which should be resumed as that of futility. So a step further or a level deeper was reached when the fabulous world of spirits, old and new, true and false, real and imagined, made themselves felt at different planes of consciousness. They come under many names, all quite entrancing. “Loas”, “Espirits”, or “Mysteres” all conveying a sense of foreboding inspiring the nebulousness from whence they come.&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/statement_duval-carrie.html |title=Artist Statement |author=Edouard Duval Carrié |publisher=Bernice Steinbaum Gallery |accessdate=2009-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217084242/http://bernicesteinbaumgallery.com/artists/duval_carrie/statement_duval-carrie.html |archivedate=2009-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duval-Carrié's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated [[Vodun art]] from Benin and the African Diaspora in [[Ouidah]], Benin in February 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=33 |last=Rush|first=Dana |title=Contemporary Vodun Arts of Ouidah, Benin|journal=African Arts|volume=34|issue=4  |date=Winter 2001|publisher=UCLA James S.

'''File sharing''' is the practice of distributing or providing access to [[digital media]], such as computer programs, [[multimedia]] (audio, images and video), documents or [[E-book|electronic books]]. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transmission]] and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on [[computer network]]s, World Wide Web-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networking.

==Types==

===Peer-to-peer file sharing===
[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] is based on the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) application architecture. [[Shared resource|Shared files]] on the computers of other [[User (system)|users]] are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like [[Napster]] and [[Limewire]]. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].

===File sync and sharing services===
[[Cloud computing|Cloud-based]] [[file synchronization|file syncing and sharing]] services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented [[file hosting service]]s such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Google Drive]].

[[rsync]] is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.

[[Data synchronization]] in general can use other approaches to share files, such as [[distributed filesystem]]s, [[version control]], or [[Web mirror|mirrors]].

==History==
{{Main|File sharing timeline}}
&lt;!-- pre-1999 --&gt;Files were first exchanged on [[removable media]]. Computers were able to access remote files using [[filesystem]] mounting, [[bulletin board systems]] (1978), [[Usenet]] (1979), and [[FTP]] servers (1985). [[Internet Relay Chat]] (1988) and [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]] (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through [[online chat|chat]] and to exchange files. The [[mp3]] encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of [[Audio file format|audio files]], grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, [[MP3.com]] and [[Audiogalaxy]] were established, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was unanimously passed, and the first [[Portable media player|mp3 player]] devices were launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 1999, [[Napster]] was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |title=Reliable distributed systems: technologies, Web services, and applications - Kenneth P. Birman - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905151657/https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery. It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.

[[Gnutella]], [[eDonkey2000]], and [[Freenet]] were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. [[Gnutella]], released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no [[Single point of failure|central point of failure]]. In July, [[Freenet]] was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the [[eDonkey2000]] client and server software was released.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2001, [[Kazaa]] and [[Poisoned]] for the Mac was released. Its [[FastTrack]] network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] off of the FastTrack network.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=RIAA Sues Music Startup Napster for $20 Billion | date=December 9, 1999 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601112815/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | archivedate=June 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Napster, it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the "transitory network transmission" safe harbor in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] if they had control of the network with a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |title=EFF: What Peer-to-Peer Developers Need to Know about Copyright Law |publisher=W2.eff.org |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034129/http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its loss in court, Napster was shut down to comply with a court order. This drove users to other P2P applications and file sharing continued its growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=Napster Clones Crush Napster.

Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled [[malware]] and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.

[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators protesting [[The Pirate Bay raid]] in 2006]]

From 2002 through 2003, a number of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] services were established, including [[Suprnova.org]], [[isoHunt]], [[TorrentSpy]], and [[The Pirate Bay]]. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the [[Razorback2]] eDonkey server and temporarily took down [[The Pirate Bay]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

“The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in 2009, this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another. On the other hand, only specific file sharing application were made available to federal computers” (United States.Congress.House). In 2009, the [[Pirate Bay trial]] ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like [[Frostwire]] and [[gtk-gnutella]]. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as [[MLDonkey]] and [[Shareaza]] adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

On January 19, 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] shut down the popular domain of [[Megaupload]] (established 2005). The file sharing site has claimed to have over 50,000,000 people a day.&lt;ref name="megaupload_wp"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/department-of-justice-site-hacked-after-megaupload-shutdown-anonymous-claims-credit/2012/01/20/gIQAl5MNEQ_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop |title=Department of Justice site hacked after Megaupload shutdown, Anonymous claims credit.

==Public opinion of file sharing==
In 2004 there were an estimated 70 million people participating in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |title=Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing|last = Delgado |first = Ray |work=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=March 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030926/http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |archivedate=June 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll in 2009, 58% of [[United States|Americans]] who follow the file sharing issue, considered it acceptable "if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances"; with 18- to 29-year-olds this percentage reached as much as 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |title=Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130162846/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |archivedate=November 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of file-sharing culture, Caraway (2012) noted that 74.4% of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|title = Survey of File-Sharing Culture|date = 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = [[International Journal of Communication]]|publisher = [[USC Annenberg Press]], [[Creative Commons license]] (by-nc-nd)|last = Caraway|first = Brett Robert |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090451/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
According to David Glenn, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', "A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales".&lt;ref name="HigherEdu"&gt;Glenn, David. Dispute Over the Economics of File Sharing Intensifies, ''[[Chronicle.com]]'', July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found 22 [[independent study|independent studies]] on the effects of music file sharing. "Of these 22 studies, 14 – roughly two-thirds – conclude that unauthorized downloads have a 'negative or even highly negative impact' on recorded music sales. Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Terry. [http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ More Evidence for Copyright Protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205093806/http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}, copyhype.com, February 1, 2012. "The literature review looked at a 23rd study but did not classify it here since the author presented a mixed conclusion: the overall effect of unauthorized downloads is insignificant, but for unknown artists, there is a 'strongly negative' effect on recorded music sales."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AJ Sokolov, Daniel . [http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html Wissenschaftler: Studien über Tauschbörsen unbrauchbar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603034104/http://www.heise.de/ct/meldung/Wissenschaftler-Studien-ueber-Tauschboersen-unbrauchbar-1020532.html |date=June 3, 2013 }}, ''[[c't]]'' magazine, June 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by economists [[Felix Oberholzer-Gee]] and Koleman Strumpf in 2004 concluded that music file sharing's effect on sales was "statistically indistinguishable from zero".&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Robert. ''Free Ride: How the Internet Is Destroying the Culture Business and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back'', Bodley Head,  February 2011, {{ISBN|1847921485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis|last=Oberholzer|first=Felix|author2=Koleman Strumpf|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613031108/http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research was disputed by other economists, most notably Stan Liebowitz, who said Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry "that are just not correct."&lt;ref name="levine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1014399|title=How Reliable is the Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf Paper on File-Sharing?|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Key Instrument in the Oberholzer-Gee/Strumpf File-Sharing Paper is Defective|last=Liebowitz|first=Stan J.|accessdate=June 13, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827225353/http://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/paper-stan-j-liebowitz1.pdf|archivedate=August 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, ''Billboard'' reported that Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf had "changed their minds", now finding "no more than 20% of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing".&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

June 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, citing [[Nielsen SoundScan]] as their source, the co-authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original. "In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply."&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf.

A 2006 study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, published by [[Industry Canada]], was "unable to discover any direct relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchases in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File-Sharing on the Purchase of Music: A Study for Industry Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914010619/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by Dr. George R.

Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free."

===Market dominance===
A paper in journal ''[[Operations Research: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Management Science]]'' found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts, allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often. This had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharjee, Sudip., Gopal, Ram D., Lertwachara, Kaveepan. Marsden, James R. &amp; Telang, Rahul. [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html The Effect of Digital Sharing Technologies on Music Markets: A Survival Analysis of Albums on Ranking Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214152135/http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html |date=February 14, 2012 }} ''Management Science'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study that examined pre-release file sharing of music albums, using BitTorrent software, also discovered positive impacts for "established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists." According to Robert G. Hammond of [[North Carolina State University]], an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales. "This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"File-sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by 'leveling the playing field' for new/small artists relative to established/popular artists, by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience, lessening the advantage held by established/popular artists in terms of promotional and other support. My results suggest that the opposite is happening, which is consistent with evidence on file-sharing behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. Robert G. "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf Profit Leak? Pre-Release File Sharing and the Music Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523032458/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}" May 2012. File sharing benefits mainstream albums such as pop music but not albums in niche genres such as indie music. ... Further, the finding that file sharing redistributes sales toward established/popular artists is inconsistent with claims made by proponents of file sharing that file sharing democratizes music consumption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Billboard'' cautioned that this research looked only at the pre-release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date. "The problem in believing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]] helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal ... Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre-release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales. Without iTunes, Amazon and Best Buy, file-sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers. If you carry out the 'file sharing should be legal' argument to its logical conclusion, today's retailers will be tomorrow's file-sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

===Availability===
Many argue that file-sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet. In a 2011 report by [[Sandvine]] showed that [[Netflix]] traffic had come to surpass that of [[Bittorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf Global Internet Phenomena Report - Spring 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113020428/http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf |date=January 13, 2012 }} Sandvine Global Internet Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

==Copyright issues==
{{main|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
File sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits. In the [[United States]], some of these lawsuits have even reached the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. For example, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.|MGM v. Grokster]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P2P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement.

On the other hand, not all file sharing is illegal. Content in the [[public domain]] can be freely shared. Even works covered by [[copyright]] can be shared under certain circumstances. For example, some artists, publishers, and [[record label]]s grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works, sometimes with conditions, and they advocate [[free content]] and file sharing as a promotional tool.

Glory to the heroes!'') is a commonly used greeting and slogan in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-worldcup-cro-ukraine/angry-ukraine-fans-deluge-fifas-facebook-page-with-posts-idUKKBN1K01DX|title=Angry Ukraine fans deluge FIFA's Facebook page with posts|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2018 ''Glory to Ukraine'' is an official greeting of the [[Ukrainian Armed Forces]] and the [[Ukrainian National Police]].&lt;ref name="interfaxua535728"/&gt;

==History==
===20th century===
[[Image:Pomnik UPA w Bazaltowe d.Janowa Dolina.jpg|thumb|World War II-era monument in memory of UPA freedom fighters with inscription ''"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!"'', in place of the Janowa Dolina massacre, [[Bazaltove]], Ukraine]] 

The phrase “''Slava Ukrayini!''” (Glory to Ukraine!) first appeared in different military formations during the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]] (from 1917 to 1921).&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE&gt;[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/why-is-international-media-still-repeating-kremlin-propaganda-about-ukraine Why Is the International Media Still Repeating Kremlin Propaganda about Ukraine?], [[Atlantic Council]] (13 July 2018)&lt;br&gt;{{uk icon}} [https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/28565063.html "Glory to Ukraine!" - the story of the slogan of the struggle for independence], [[Radio Free Europe]] (19 June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; It became part of the lexicon of [[Ukrainian nationalists]] in the [[1920's]].&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt;{{#tag:ref|In his monumental book ''Kholodny Yar'', [[Yuriy Horlis-Horskyi]] writes that he heard this phrase from several insurgents, who fought in the [[Kholodny Yar]] Ukrainian partisan movement (1918-1923). They routinely greeted each other with the phrase “''Slava Ukrayini!''”, and the response had to be “''Ukrayini Slava!''” (which also means "Glory to Ukraine" but with words swapped around).&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt;|group=nb}}

The modern response "''Heroyam slava!"'' (Glory to the heroes!) appeared in the 1930s among members of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) and [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) who started using this slogan&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt;, replacing all former responses with it as a mark of deep respect for all the men and women who had laid down their lives for their country. The partisans thus honoured the memory of all the brave soldiers and passed it on to future generations. The greeting ''Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!'' became an official slogan of [[Stepan Bandera]]'s [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN-B]] in April 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Katchanovski (2004). "[https://www.academia.edu/3378079/The_Politics_of_World_War_II_in_Contemporary_Ukraine The Politics of World War II in Contemporary Ukraine]". The Journal of Slavic Military Studies. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt;

“''Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam slava!"'' became very popular in the 1940s and 1950s when the OUN/UPA partisan movement fighting against the [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupiers swept across most of western Ukraine.{{fact|date=July 2018}} "Glory to the heroes!" was also used by the [[Kuban Cossacks]] dating back to at least 1944 with the return of the Cossack Rebel Army who fought with the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyzhden.ua/World/25418|title=Родом з України|trans-title=Born in Ukraine|language=Ukrainian|work=[[The Ukrainian Week]]|date=29 June 2011|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Soviet Union]] the slogan “Slava Ukrayini!” was forbidden and discredited in a decades long propaganda campaign alongside the Ukrainian nationalists who used it.&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle 24818 GtU"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt; They were dubbed "[[Nazi]] henchmen".&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle 24818 GtU"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://m.dw.com/en/new-glory-to-ukraine-army-chant-invokes-nationalist-past/a-45215538|title=New 'Glory to Ukraine' army chant invokes nationalist past|last=|first=|date=24 August 2018|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[1980's]] and early [[1990's]] the slogan began to be heard at rallies and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=AC28565063RFE/&gt; After Ukraine [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared independence]] in 1991, the phrase "Glory to Ukraine" became a common patriotic slogan. In 1995, President of the United States [[Bill Clinton]] used the phrase in his speech in [[Kiev]] (together with "God bless America").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/13/world/thousands-turn-out-to-cheer-clinton-in-ukraine.html|title=Thousands Turn Out to Cheer Clinton in Ukraine|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|date=13 May 1995|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The phrase has undergone a resurgence in recent times, becoming a popular and prominent refrain during the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]].&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle 24818 GtU"/&gt; In September 2014, after addressing a gathering of the [[United States Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Ukrainian president [[Petro Poroshenko]] concluded his speech by uttering the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?321426-1/ukrainian-president-petro-poroshenko-address-congress|title=Ukrainian President Address to Congress|date=18 September 2014|work=C-SPAN|last=Poroshenko|first=Petro|authorlink=Petro Poroshenko|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also commonly used in greeting to Ukraine from the world leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kotyhoroh|title=How FIFA chose to become part of the Russian propaganda narrative (Short version)|date=2018-07-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u5vSgClL9w|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On July 10, 2018, Ukrainian supporters flooded the [[Facebook]] page of football governing body [[FIFA]] with over 158,000 comments, most saying "Glory to Ukraine", after FIFA fined Croatia's assistant coach for a video in which he used the same slogan after Croatia's [[2018 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] victory. Russia alleged that the chant has ultra-nationalist connotations, as it was popularized by World War II era groups, such as the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), who collaborated with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/world-cup-2018-gets-political-the-nazi-of-glory-to-ukraine-1.6271893|title=World Cup 2018 Gets Political: The Nazi and anti-Russian Roots of 'Glory to Ukraine'|work=Ha'aretz|language=en|date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] said in a statement that "''Glory to Ukraine'' is a commonly used greeting in Ukraine ...

On 9 August 2018 Ukrainian President [[Petro Poroshenko]] announced that ''Glory to Ukraine'' will be the official greeting of the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine]], replacing ''Hello Comrades'' (''Вітаю товариші'', ''Vitayu tovaryshi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Poroshenko |first1=Petro |title=President: The words "Glory to Ukraine!

The '''Museum of Gold''' ({{lang-es|El Museo del Oro}}) is a [[museum]] located in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]]. It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bogotatravelguide.com/places-to-go-in-bogota/gold-museum.php | title=The 22 Places To Go in Bogotá: Museum of Gold | publisher=Bogotá Travel Guide] | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year.&lt;ref name=SemanaMuseo&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/cultura/articulo/los-75-del-museo-del-oro/409766-3 Los 75 del Museo del Oro] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum displays a selection of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] gold and other metal alloys, such as ''[[Tumbaga]]'', and contains the largest collection of gold artifacts in the world in its exhibition rooms on the second and third floors. Together with [[pottery]], stone, [[Animal shell|shell]], wood and textile objects, these items, made of a– to [[amerindian|indigenous]] cultures – sacred metal, testify to the life and thought of the different societies which lived in present-day Colombia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas]].

== History ==
In 1934, the [[Bank of the Republic]] began helping to protect the [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[National patrimony|patrimony]] of [[Colombia]].{{fact|date=January 2014}} The object known as [[Poporo Quimbaya]] was the first one in a collection. It has been on exhibition for 70 years.{{when|date=January 2014}}  The Museum is today administered by [[Bank_of_the_Republic_(Colombia)#Banrepcultural|Banrepcultural]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Banrepcultural |url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/en |website=Red Cultural del Banco de la República en Colombia |accessdate=13 September 2018 |quote=The cultural activity of Banco de la República extends as a network through 29 cities in the Colombian territory, and is carried out in the Gold Museum in Bogota, five Gold Museums in Armenia, Cali, Cartagena, Pasto and Santa Marta, the Ethnographic Museum in Leticia, the Luis Ángel Arango Library and the Casa Gómez Campuzano in Bogotá, the Library Network that extends through 28 Colombian cities, the Luis Ángel Arango Library Concert Hall, and Bogotá museums: Casa de Moneda, Botero Museum and, Miguel Urrutia Museum of Art (MAMU).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses the famous [[Muisca raft|Muisca golden raft]] found in [[Pasca]] in 1969, that represents the ceremony of the new ''[[zipa]]'' (ruler) of Bacatá, the basis for the ''[[El Dorado]]'' myth. The heir to the chieftaincy assumed power with a great offering to the gods. In this representation he is seen standing at the centre of a raft, surrounded by the principal chieftains, all of them adorned with [[gold]] and feathers.

After a decade of work, the museum was expanded and renovated in October 2008. With the renovation, the museum organized the permanent exhibition in five rooms with archaeological objects and an interactive room. It also added an auditorium, some temporary exhibitions rooms, a cafe, a restaurant, and a souvenir store.

== Description ==
The museum has a collection of 55,000 pieces, 6,000 of which are on display in their expanded building. There are bilingual descriptions of almost all exhibits. On the first floor houses the museum's main entrance, a shop, and a restaurant.

Exhibitions begin on the second floor. The main room is called "People and Gold in pre-Hispanic [[Colombia]]". In glass vitrines display goldsmiths' work from the different cultures which inhabited Colombia before the Spanish colonists arrived. The permanent exhibition is divided into different halls for every culture: [[Calima culture|Calima]], [[Quimbaya]], [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Zenú]], [[Tierradentro]], [[San Agustín Archaeological Park|San Agustín]], [[Panche people|Tolima]], [[Tairona]], and Urabá, and a special room called "After [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]" (''Después de Colón'').

The exposition continues on the third floor, with "The Flying Chamanic" and "The Offering." The first shows the process of a [[shaman]]ic ceremony with its different gold pieces, the second is divided into three parts: the "Offering Room", the "Offering Boat", and the "Lake".

At the end of the exposition, there is a "Profunditation Room" with artistic videos about the most important gold pieces of the museum.

In traditional [[Persian architecture]], a [[dome]] is referred to as a '''gonbad''' ({{lang-fa|گنبد}}). 
[[Image:Gonbad-e Qabus.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The tower at [[Gonbad-e Qabus (tower)|Gonbad-e Qabus]], a remnant of [[Ziyarid]] architecture]]
[[File:Seh gonbad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Segonbad]]]]
The history of designing gonbads dates back to pre-Islamic Persia. The [[Parthia]]ns in particular were very keen in using such structures in their designs. The [[Sassanid]]s inherited them and elevated their designs into full maturity.

A gonbad is often double layered, and can have many shapes, such as semi-spherical, partial spherical, onion shaped, [[paraboloid]], polygonal [[cone (geometry)|conical]], and circular conical.

In pre-Islamic times, the gonbad was a sign of imperial grandeur for the king. In Islamic times, the tradition continued, and the interiors were made to simulate the [[Celestial sphere|celestial dome]], reminding the Muslim of Man's place in the cosmos compared to God and creation.

==Kümbet==

'''Kümbet''' is the name given to Seljuq [[mausoleum]]s. Kümbet are an important part of [[Seljuq architecture]]. In [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Iran]] where the Turks set up states and ruled for centuries, there are a number of examples of such mausoleums. Particularly fashionable in the thirteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;''The heritage of Eastern Turkey: from earliest settlements to Islam'', [[Antonio Sagona]], 2006, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; these monuments, referred to in Turkish as ''kümbet'', are a continuation of the Turkish burial customs of Central Asia. These structures are either polygonal or cylindrical in shape arid are covered with a dome. The main body of the monument rests on a cubic base, the corners of which are bevelled. In the examples built before the 16th century, the dome is covered with a conical or pyramidal spire. Most of these monuments are two storied. Concealed inside the base, half of which is below ground level, is a crypt; the latter is covered by a vault and its floor is earth. The deceased was buried in the earth. The crypt had small loop-hole windows. Most kümbet in Turkey are found in the provinces of [[Kayseri Province|Kayseri]], [[Erzurum Province|Erzurum]], [[Konya Province|Konya]], [[Ahlat]] and [[Bitlis Province|Bitlis]]

===Hudavend Hatun===
[[File:Hüdâvend Hatun Kümbeti.jpg|400px|thumbnail|right|Kümbet of Hudavend Hatun in [[Niğde]]]]
The [[Hudavend Hatun Türbe|Kümbet of Hudavend Hatun]] is located in [[Niğde]] city. It was built in 1312 and was commissioned by Hudavend Hatun, daughter of the Seljuk Sultan [[Kilij Arslan IV]], and was restored by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) in 1962. The tomb is made of yellow cut stone and is covered by a dome topped with an eight-faceted pyramidal crown on the exterior. Total height is 15.5 meters.  White marble was used in the lintels, the arches, the inscription plaques, and the cornice of the dome. The tomb is most known for its elaborate vegetal and zoomorphic carvings.

===Döner Kümbet===

The Revolving Tomb is in the way to [[Talas, Turkey|Talas]] in [[Kayseri]], as it is called, does not revolve, but its cylindrical form makes it look as though it might. Built in 1276 as the final resting-place of Şah Cihan Hatun, an imperial princess, it is covered in high-relief arabesque decoration depicting animals and plants. The nearby Sirçali Kümbet is not quite as elaborate. The Çifte Kümbet (Double Tomb) (also in Kayseri), 5&amp;nbsp;km along on the way to [[Sivas]], is yet another of these characteristic [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] royal tombs.

===The Kümbet of Halime Hatun===
[[File:085 Sivas.07.2006 resize.JPG|thumbnail|150px|left|Ahi Emir Ahmet Türbe, a Kümbet in [[Sivas]], Turkey]]

About 2&amp;nbsp;km to the north of the [[Gevaş]] district on the shore of [[Lake Van]] there is an old graveyard that has been in use ever since the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] period. One of the most impressive pre-Ottoman grave monuments is the Kümbet of Halime Hatun, which is in the same graveyard. This monument was recently repaired and changes made to the entrance to the crypt. It attracted the attention of a number of travellers who visited the area in the last century, prompting W. Bachmann to make a serious study of it. However, the fırst scientifıc study of this monument was carried out by Prof. Dr. Oktay Aslanapa.

===The Kümbet of Kadem Pasa Hatun===
This monument lies 1–2&amp;nbsp;km to the east of Erciş, at the junction of the [[Erciş]]&amp;ndash;[[Van, Turkey|Van]] and [[Patnos]]&amp;ndash;Van roads. It was repaired in the 1970s, when crumbling stones on the base and main body of the monument were replaced. Stone staircases leading to the crypt and to the upper floor were built at the same time. A wall was also built around the garden in which the monument lies.

===The Zortul Kümbet===
This monument, which lies on level ground to the left of the [[Erciş]]&amp;ndash;[[Patnos]] road above 5&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Erciş]] itself, has no special name. Abdürrahim Şerif Beygu, who visited the monument in 1931, stated that its east window part of the spire had crumbled away. Oktay Aslanapa confirms this information, stating that the upper part of the roof had collapsed and that the monument was in a very poor state. Repairs have been carried out which have halted its deterioration.

===Gol Gumbaz===

[[Gol Gumbaz]] (Kannada: ಗೋಲ ಗುಮ್ಮಟ) (Urdu: گول گمبد) is the mausoleum of [[Mohammed Adil Shah]] (1627–55) of the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]] of [[Indian sultans]], who ruled the [[Sultanate of Bijapur]] from 1490 to 1686.

The tomb, located in the city of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], or Vijapur in [[Karnataka]], southern India, was built in 1659 by the famous architect, [[Yaqut (architect)|Yaqut]] of Dabul. The structure consists of a massive square chamber measuring nearly 50&amp;nbsp;m (160&amp;nbsp;ft) on each side and covered by a huge dome 43.3&amp;nbsp;m (142&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter making it among one of the largest dome structures in world. The dome is supported on giant squinches supported by groined pendentives while outside the building is supported by domed octagonal corner towers.

The Dome is the second largest one in the world which is unsupported by any pillars.

The acoustics of the enclosed place make it a whispering gallery where even the smallest sound is heard across the other side of the Gumbaz. At the periphery of the dome is a circular balcony where visitors can witness the astounding whispering gallery. Any whisper, clap or sound gets echoed around 7 times. Anything whispered from one corner of the gallery can be heard clearly on the diagonally opposite side. It is also said that the Sultan, Ibrahim Adil Shah and his Queen used to converse in the same manner. During his time, the musicians used to sing, seated in the whispering gallery so that the sound produced could reach every corner of the hall.

One can easily make out the restoration carried out on the structure by comparing the photographs. The surroundings have been converted into a splendid garden and the site is maintained by The [[Archaeological Survey of India]].'''[http://asi.nic.in/ The Archaeological Survey of India]'''.

==Development in China==
The word "gonbad" was borrowed into Chinese as "[[Gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]", where it refers to Islamic tombs (originally, domed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22570">[[File:Goncourt.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Edmond and Jules de Goncourt&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''The Goncourt Journal''' was a diary written in collaboration by the brothers [[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]] from 1850 up to Jules' death in 1870, and then by Edmond alone up to a few weeks before his own death in 1896.  It forms an unrivalled and entirely candid chronicle of the literary and artistic Parisian world in which they lived, "a world", it has been said, "of bitter rivalries and bitterer friendships, in which every gathering around a café table on the [[Boulevards of Paris#The grands boulevards|Grands Boulevards]] [was] a chance to raise one's status in the byzantine literary hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/07/21/whats-the-use |title=What's the Use? |last=Burton |first=Tara Isabella |date=21 July 2015 |website=The Paris Review |access-date=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fear of lawsuits by the Goncourts' friends and their heirs prevented publication of anything but carefully chosen selections from the Journal for many years, but a complete edition of the original French text appeared in the 1950s in 22 volumes, and there have been several selective translations into English.

==The process of collaboration==

The [[Goncourt brothers]] formed a very close literary partnership. Not only were all of their novels, dramas and non-fiction works written in collaboration until Jules' death but, more surprisingly, so was their Journal.{{sfn|Lyons|2012}}  The Journal was produced by a process [[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] called "dual dictation", one brother dictating to the other and each revising the other's work. Their styles were so similar that it is impossible to tell which brother was writing any particular passage.{{sfn|Robb|2007|ref=harv}}{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=ix}} For the most part they wrote the Journal late at night, without much consideration about literary style, and there are therefore few of the laboured mannerisms that characterize their novels. Edmond himself admitted that because the journal entries were "hastily set down on paper and not always re-read, our syntax is sometimes happy-go-lucky and not all our words have passports",{{sfn|Baldick|1984|pp=xiv, xix-xx}} and they particularly delighted in accurately recording the slanginess and vulgarity of ordinary speech.{{sfn|Becker|Philips|1971|p=10}}  The collaboration came to an end with Jules' decline and early death from syphilis, recorded by his brother in excruciating detail. When that story drew to its close Edmond initially decided to abandon the Journal, but he took it up again in time to give a detailed description of life during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|siege of Paris]], and the [[Paris Commune|Commune]].{{sfn|Dyer|2006}} Some critics find that the Journal improved when Edmond resumed it without Jules.{{sfn|Anonymous|1962}}{{sfn|Anonymous|n.d.}}

==The Journal's accuracy==

The many accounts of conversations in the Journal were aided by Edmond's excellent memory, and, according to [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], by Jules' habit of jotting notes on his shirt-cuff on the spot.{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=viii}}  [[Ludovic Halévy]], who was present at many of these conversations, gave the brothers credit for extreme accuracy, and similarly the narrator of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time#Volume Seven: Time Regained|Le Temps retrouvé]]'' thought that Edmond de Goncourt "knew how to listen, just as he knew how to see"; but some among the Goncourts' contemporaries claimed that the brothers either consciously or unconsciously distorted the conversations they recorded.  The painter Jacques Blanche, for example, said that "nothing is less true than their journals", though [[André Gide]], who thoroughly enjoyed the Journal's accounts of conversations, retorted that that would make the Goncourts' achievement as original artists all the greater.{{sfn|Dyer|2006}}{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=xiv}}

==Treatment of their friends==

The Goncourt's Journal was started on the same day that they published their first novel, 2 December 1851, which was unluckily also the day that [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoleon]] launched his ''coup d' état'', leading to the imposition of martial law in Paris.  In this turmoil the novel passed almost unnoticed.  The Goncourts' disappointment over this failure was duly recorded in the Journal, thereby setting the dominant tone for the remaining 45 years.  Poor sales, poor reviews, and the undeserved successes of their literary friends are recorded in meticulous detail.  "Oh, if one of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky]]'s novels, whose black melancholy is regarded with such indulgent admiration, were signed with the name of Goncourt, what a slating it would get all along the line."{{sfn|Dyer|2006}}  [[Émile Zola|Zola]] was one friend who came in for especially barbed comment, since the Goncourts felt that his subject matter and literary techniques had been borrowed from theirs. "The critics may say what they like about Zola, they cannot prevent us, my brother and myself, from being the John-the-Baptists of modern neurosis."{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=238}}{{sfn|Dyer|2006}}  Some few friends did come in for sympathetic treatment, notably Princess [[Mathilde Bonaparte]], [[Paul Gavarni]], [[Théophile Gautier]], [[Alphonse Daudet]] and, initially at least, Gustave Flaubert and [[Paul Bins, comte de Saint-Victor|Paul de Saint-Victor]].{{sfn|James|1984|pp=413-414}}{{sfn|Becker|Philips|1971|pp=5-6}}  The critic [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] regularly appeared in the Journal, as did the painter [[Edgar Degas]] and the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]].{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=xiv}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grout |first1=Caroline Franklin |year=1999 |title=Heures d'autrefois (Mémoirs inédits), Souvenirs intimes et autres textes |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r7q4BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241&amp;dq=%22Zola+et+Daudet+Flaubert%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGp9yS49XYAhUCUlAKHeRpCuMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Zola%20et%20Daudet%20Flaubert%22&amp;f=false |language=French |location=[Mont-Saint-Aignan] |publisher=Publications de l'Université de Rouen |page=241 |isbn=9782877752701 |access-date=13 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appearances are also made by [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Ernest Renan]], [[Hippolyte Taine]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Alexandre Dumas|Alexandre Dumas ''père'']] and ''[[Alexandre Dumas, fils|fils]]'', [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Georg Brandes]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.perlentaucher.de/buch/edmond-de-goncourt-jules-de-goncourt/journal-1851-1896.html |title=Edmond de Goncourt, Jules de Goncourt.

Das Kulturmagazin |language=German |access-date=14 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Becker|Philips|1971|p=8}}  Not surprisingly, the often backbiting tone of the Journal led to strained relations with Edmond's surviving friends when they came to read his treatment of them in the published volumes.  As late as the 1950s the Daudet family, concerned for the reputation of their ancestor Alphonse, were still trying to block publication of the complete Journal.{{sfn|Baldick|1984|pp=ix-xiii}}

==Publication==

A few carefully chosen selections from the Journal were published by the Goncourts in a now little-known book, ''Idées et Sensations'' (1866; new edition 1877).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bersani |first1=Jacques |date=2008 |title=''Idées et Sensations'' ou les Goncourt en court |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/cejdg_1243-8170_2008_num_1_15_999 |journal=Cahiers Edmond et Jules de Goncourt |volume=15 |page=53 |language=French |access-date=14 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886 Edmond published in ''Le Figaro'' some extracts from the Journal dating from the years before Jules' death, and the following year a more substantial selection of letters from the same years appeared in book form under the title ''Journal des Goncourt: Mémoires de la vie littéraire''.  Eight more volumes were published at the rate of roughly one a year, some being first serialized in ''[[L'Écho de Paris]]''.  The last volume appeared in May 1896, two months before Edmond's death.{{sfn|Baldick|1984|pp=ix-xii}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/28362297?style=html&amp;title=Journal%20des%20Goncourt.%20Me%CC%81moires%20de%20la%20vie%20litte%CC%81raire. |title=Catalogue entry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=Copac |access-date=15 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Le Figaro]]'' called the first volume a masterpiece of conceit.  Worse, after three weeks only 2000 copies had been sold, provoking Edmond to say "Really, for a result like that it is not worth risking duels".{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=ix}}  ''Le Figaro'' continued its attacks, writing on the publication of Edmond's fourth volume "He listens and thinks he can hear, he looks and thinks he can see…Of the literary élite of his age…the best of their kind, all that he has managed to give us most of the time is a grotesque and often repulsive picture".  The seventh volume called forth hostile articles in the ''[[Journal des débats]]'' and the ''[[Le Courrier français (1884–1914)|Courrier français]]'', while ''Le Figaro'' reported that a Funeral Committee was being set up on Edmond's behalf.  Excrement was sent to him through the post.{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=xi}}  

On the other hand [[Anatole France]] wrote that "this perfectly private 
journal is at the same time perfectly literary", and absolved the Goncourts of indiscretion because "[t]hey neither heard nor saw except in art and for 
art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=France |first1=Anatole |translator-last=Evans |translator-first=A. W. |year=1922 |title=On Life &amp; Letters.

The ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' thought that in fifty years time it would be "the most fascinating and vivid history in existence of the literary and artistic life of Paris during the last half of [the 19th] century", but that its portrait of the close partnership of the Goncourts themselves was of still greater interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1893 |title=Contributors' Club |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=q4kRAAAAMAAJ |journal=The Atlantic Monthly |volume=72 |page=857 |access-date=14 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry James]], writing in ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'', thought that both the Journal and its authors would have been improved if they had not restricted their social life to a narrow coterie: "The Journal…is mainly a record of resentment and suffering, and to this circumstance they attribute many causes; but we suspect that the real cause is for them too the inconvenience from which we suffer as readers – simply the want of space and air."{{sfn|James|1984|p=413}}  

After Edmond's death Proust paid the Journal the tribute of including a pastiche of it in his ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]'', and indeed the Journal's obsessive collecting of the most minute details of its authors' social life and rendering of them into literary art has been said to anticipate the supposed innovations of Proust.{{sfn|Noiray|2005|p=198}}&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last1=Bouillaguet |first1=Annick |year=1996 |title=Proust et les Goncourts: le pastiche du ''Journal'' dans ''Le temps retrouvé'' |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yQsQAQAAIAAJ |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Lettres modernes |pages=passim |nopp=y |isbn=9782256904608 |access-date=14 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1940 [[Christopher Isherwood]] confided in his own journal that "Here, gossip achieves the epigrammatic significance of poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |year=2011 |title=Diaries.

Becker and Edith Philips wrote of the emotional detachment, even heartlessness, to be found everywhere in the journal except in those passages that depict Edmond's relationship with his brother and with Daudet.{{sfn|Becker|Philips|1971|pp=10-11}}  In more recent years Jacques Noiray called it "a modern ''[[La Comédie humaine|Comédie humaine]]'' of the republic of letters",{{sfn|Noiray|2005|p=197}} while according to another literary scholar, David Baguley, the Journal is "an immense machine for transforming lived experience into documentary form", to be used as raw material by the Goncourts when writing their novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baguley |first1=David |year=1997 |chapter=Le ''Journal'' des Goncourt, document naturaliste |editor1-last=Cabanès |editor1-first=Jean-Louis |title=Les frères Goncourt: art et écriture |language=French |location=Talence |publisher=Presses universitaires de Bordeaux |page=107 ''et seq.'' |isbn=2867812011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 21st century the Journal's repute is as high as ever.  The German satirist [[Harald Schmidt]] has called it "the greatest gossip in world literature – it's sensational!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Jochen |date=28 November 2014 |title="Endlich mal Geistesverwandte entdeckt" |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/leben/gesellschaft/Endlich-mal-Geistesverwandte-entdeckt/story/10871152  |work=Tages-Anzeiger |language=German |location=Zurich |access-date=14 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the historian [[Graham Robb]] it is "one of the longest, most absorbing, and most enlightening diaries in European literature".{{sfn|Robb|2007|ref=harv}}  The critic [[Adam Kirsch]] attributes the modern age's interest in late-19th century French literary life to the Goncourt Journal.{{sfn|Kirsch|2006}}

==Modern editions==

By Edmond's will, the manuscripts of the Journal were bequeathed to the [[Académie Goncourt]], itself a creation of the same will, with instructions that they be strictly protected from public scrutiny for 20 years in the vaults of the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'', after which they were to be made public either by allowing access to them or by publication in print.  In the event, the Académie did neither of these things in 1916, fearing libel actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Goncourt Journal |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=bright&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS118690066&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0

No complete translation of the Goncourt Journal into English has ever appeared, but there have been several selections.  The first, ''Edmond and Jules de Goncourt: With Letters and Leaves from their Journals'', compiled and translated by [[Marie Belloc Lowndes|Marie Belloc]] and [[Marie L. Shedlock]], appeared in two volumes as early as 1895, before the nine volumes of Edmond de Goncourt's edition had yet been completed.{{sfn|Lyons|2012}}  This was followed by [[Julius West]]'s ''The Journal of the Goncourts'' in 1908, and by Lewis Galantière's ''The Goncourt Journals 1851-1870'' in 1937.{{sfn|Anonymous|n.d.}}  In 1962 [[Oxford University Press]] published Robert Baldick's much-praised ''Pages from the Goncourt Journal'', reprinted in 1984 by [[Penguin Books]] and in 2006 by [[New York Review Books]].{{sfn|Baldick|1984|p=[iv]}}{{sfn|Kirsch|2006}}  George J.

'''Graphotype''' was a process of autographic [[engraving]] by which [[typography|typographic]] printing blocks were produced.

==Process==
A block of [[chalk]] or some similar material is reduced to a level surface. On this surface, a design is drawn with a [[glutin]]ous [[ink]], the ink being sufficiently fluid to penetrate some little distance into the porous chalk. The ink having become dry, gentle friction is applied to the surface of the block so as gradually to rub away those parts of the chalk which are not indurated by the glutinous ink. The lines of the drawing being thus left in [[relief]], a perfect model of the required printing block is obtained and this model is next hardened by immersion in a bath containing a [[solution]] of an [[alkaline silicate]]. After this, the block is dried and reproduced by the [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]] or the [[electrotype]] process.{{sfnp|''EB''|1880}}

This method of [[typography|typographic]] engraving was brought to a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American [[wood carving|wood engraver]], Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. 2309.&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in his process is to reduce [[French chalk]] or [[talc]] to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and siftings. After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an [[inch]] in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick [[zinc]] plate, the necessary pressure being obtained by means of an [[hydraulic press]], the [[platen]] of which is faced with a polished [[steel]] plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of [[glue]] colored by [[lamp black]] or some other [[pigment]]. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine [[sable]] brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of [[silk velvet]] or a [[fitch brush]] may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary [[playing card]] is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of [[sodium silicate]] may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.{{sfnp|''EB''|1880}}

'''''Hara-Kiri''''' was a monthly French [[satire|satirical]] magazine, first published in 1960, the precursor to ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. It was created by [[Georges Bernier]], [[François Cavanna|Cavanna]] and [[Fred Aristidès]]. A weekly counterpart, '''''Hara-Kiri Hebdo''''', was first published in 1969.

Contributors included [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Jean-Marc Reiser|Reiser]], [[Roland Topor]], [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], [[Georges Wolinski|Wolinski]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gébé|fr}}, [[Cabu]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Delfeil de Ton|fr}}, [[Jean-Claude Fournier|Fournier]], [[Jean-Pierre Bouyxou]] and [[Willem (cartoonist)|Willem]]. In 1966 it published ''[[The Adventures of Jodelle|Les Aventures de Jodelle]]'', drawn by [[Guy Peellaert]] 

Hara-Kiri editions, subtitled "''Journal bête et méchant''" ("Stupid and nasty newspaper"), were constantly aiming at established powers, be they political parties or institutions like the Church or the State. In 1961 and 1966 the monthly magazine was temporarily banned by the French government.

==''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' becomes ''Charlie Hebdo''==
In November 1970, following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] at his home in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], the weekly ''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' bore the headline ''« Bal tragique à Colombey : 1 mort »'' (Eng: "Tragic ball in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises|Colombey]]: 1 death").

By way of contradistinction, the choice of the title refers to the far greater loss of life the same month: a [[Club Cinq-Sept fire|fire at a discothèque]] in which 146 people died.  The government felt this editorial choice was an offence of [[lèse-majesté]] against the deceased President and its then minister of the interior [[Raymond Marcellin]] ordered an immediate and permanent ban on publicity and on sale to minors.

''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was started immediately afterwards. Charlie in the title refers to General de Gaulle (said [[Georges Wolinski]]); but it was also the name of another magazine from Éditions du Square ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', named after the character [[Charlie Brown]] from [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.

  | language = Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Grimm]] made an attempt to establish her as a [[Germanic paganism|Germanic goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;"Grimm made the attempt to establish her as a benevolent goddess of German antiquity," noted Edgar A. List, "Is Frau Holda the Virgin Mary?" ''The German Quarterly'' '''29'''.2 (March 1956, pp. 80-84) p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
From [[German language|German]] ''huld'' ("gracious, friendly, sympathetic, grateful"), [[Middle High German language|Middle High German]] ''hulde'', [[Old High German language|Old High German]] ''huldī'' ("friendliness"). Cognate with [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''huld'' ("fair, kindly, gracious"), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''hollur'' ("faithful, dedicated, loyal"), [[Middle English language|Middle English]] ''hold'', ''holde'', [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hold'' ("gracious, friendly, kind, favorable, true, faithful, loyal, devout, acceptable, pleasant"), from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''hulþaz'' ("favourable, gracious, loyal"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*kel-'' ("to tend, incline, bend, tip").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hold|title=Huld Etymology|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''[[Hludana]]'' is found in five Latin inscriptions: three from the [[lower Rhine]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' XIII 8611, 8723, 8661), one from Münstereifel ({{CIL|13|7944}}) and one from Beetgum, Frisia ({{CIL|13|8830}}) all dating from 197 AD-235 AD. Many attempts have been made to interpret this name.&lt;ref&gt;An early interpretation, with quoted inscriptions, is U. Ph. Boissevain, "De inscriptione Romana apud Frisios reperta", ''Mnemosyne'', New Series, '''16''' (1888:439-447) p. 440f. Boissevain noted the Celtic form ''Hluðena'' and located inscriptions among the Frisian [[Ingaevones]] of Tacitus' ''De Germania''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attestations==
Frau Holda's festival is in the middle of winter, the time when humans retreat indoors from the cold. It may be of significance that the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] were originally the ''Zwölften'' ("the Twelve"), which like the same period in the [[Celt]]ic calendar were an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary period]] during which the dead were thought to roam abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |year=1990 |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' sabbath |publisher=Hutchinson Radius |location=London |isbn=0-09-174024-X |pages=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holda's connection to the spirit world through the magic of spinning and weaving has associated her with [[witchcraft]] in [[Catholic]] [[German folklore]]. She was considered to ride with witches on [[distaff]]s, which closely resemble the brooms that witches are thought to ride. Likewise, Holda was often identified with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in old church documents. As early as the beginning of the eleventh century she appears to have been known as the leader of women and female nocturnal spirits, which "in common parlance are called Hulden from Holda". These women would leave their houses in spirit, going "out through closed doors in the silence of the night, leaving their sleeping husbands behind". They would travel vast distances through the sky, to great feasts, or to battles amongst the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;From the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'', quoted in {{cite book |last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |year=1990 |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' sabbath |publisher=Hutchinson Radius |location=London |isbn=0-09-174024-X |pages=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ninth century [[Canon Episcopi]] censures women who claim to have ridden with a "crowd of demons."  Burchard's later recension of the same text expands on this in a section titled De arte magica:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have you believed there is some female, whom the stupid vulgar call Holda [or, in some manuscripts, strigam Holdam, the witch Holda], who is able to do a certain thing, such that those deceived by the devil affirm themselves by necessity and by command to be required to do, that is, with a crowd of demons transformed into the likeness of women, on fixed nights to be required to ride upon certain beasts, and to themselves be numbered in their company? If you have performed participation in this unbelief, you are required to do penance for one year on designated fast-days.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later canonical and church documents make her synonymous with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Berchta|Bertha]], [[Richella]] and [[Abundia]]. Historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] has identified similar beliefs existing throughout Europe for over a thousand years, whereby men and women were thought to leave their bodies in spirit and follow a goddess variously called Holda, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Signora Oriente]], [[Richella]], Arada and [[Perchta]]. He also identifies strong morphological similarities with the earlier goddesses [[Hecate]]/[[Artemis]], [[Artio]], the Matres of [[Engyon]], the [[Matronae]] and [[Epona]], as well as figures from fairy-tales, such as [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |year=1990 |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' sabbath |publisher=Hutchinson Radius |location=London |isbn=0-09-174024-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 16th-century fable recorded by [[Erasmus Alberus]] speaks of "an army of women" with sickles in hand sent by Frau Hulda. Thomas Reinesius in the 17th century speaks of Werra of the Voigtland and her "crowd of maenads."

Holda figures in some [[pre-Christian Alpine traditions]] that have survived to modern times. During the Christmas period in the alpine regions of Germany, Austria and northern Switzerland, wild masked processions are still held in a number of towns, impersonating Holda, Perchta or related beings, and the [[wild hunt]].&lt;ref name="MotzWinter"&gt;[[Lotte Motz|Motz, Lotte]] (1984). "The Winter Goddess: [[Percht]], Holda and Related Figures" in ''Folklore'' 95 (ii).&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivid visual descriptions of her may allude to a popular costumed portrayal, perhaps as part of a seasonal festival or holiday drama. In 1522, in ''The Exposition of the Epistles at Basel'', [[Martin Luther]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here cometh up Dame Hulde with the snout, to wit, nature, and goeth about to gainstay her God and give him the lie, hangeth her old ragfair about her, the straw-harness; then falls to work and scrapes it featly on her fiddle.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grimm based his theory of Holda on what he took to be the earliest references to her: an eleventh-century interpolation to the ''[[Canon Episcopi]]'' by [[Burchard of Worms]], and pre-Christian Roman inscriptions to ''Hludana'' that he tentatively linked to the same divinity. There were early challenges to connecting this figure with a pagan goddess,&lt;ref&gt;The early challenges were summarized by Wolfgang Golther, ''Handbuch der Deutschen mythologie'' (Leipzig) 1895:489-500.&lt;/ref&gt; since her earliest definite appearance links her with the [[Virgin Mary]], commonly called "Queen of Heaven":  an early-13th-century text listing superstitions states that "In the night of [[Christmas|Christ's Nativity]] they set the table for the Queen of Heaven, whom the people call Frau Holda, that she might help them".&lt;ref&gt;''"In nocte nativitatis Christi ponunt regina celi quam dominam Holdam vulgus appelat, ut eas ipsa adiuvet."'', quoted List 1956:81. This text, an ''Aberglaubenverzeichnis'' (a common late-medieval and early modern genre), was compiled in the years 1236-50 by Rudolph, a Cistercian monk.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lotte Motz]]&lt;ref name="MotzWinter"/&gt; and Carlo Ginzburg both conclude that she is pre-Christian in origin, based on comparison with other remarkably similar figures and ritual observances spread throughout Europe.

A pagan Holda received wide distribution in catalogs of superstitions and in sermons during the fifteenth century, and in the sixteenth, [[Martin Luther]] employed the image to personify the shortcomings of hostile Reason in theological contexts.&lt;ref&gt;List 1956:83; List, "Frau Holda as the personification of Reason," ''[[Philological Quarterly]]'' '''32''' 1953:446-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous account of Holda was collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], the [[fairy tale]] "[[Mother Hulda]]" ({{lang-de|Frau Holle|link=no}}).

[[File:Jeanette Stjernstrom.jpg|thumb|'''Jeanette Stjernström'''&lt;br&gt; by [[Maria Röhl]].]]
'''Johanna "Jeanette" Charlotta Granberg''' (19 October 1825 – 2 April 1857), also known by her married name ''Stjernström'' and by the [[pseudonym]] of ''Georges Malméen'', was a Swedish writer, a [[playwright]], a [[feminist]] and a [[translator]], who wrote plays for mainly the theatre [[Mindre teatern]] in Stockholm in the mid-19th century. She was praised as a great dramatic by her contemporaries.

==Biography==
Jeanette was born child of the writer and actor Per Adolf Granberg and was from 1849 and forwards active as a translator and a writer of plays for the theatre. She debuted with the play ''Filantropen'' in 1847 and several of her plays were performed in the 1850-51 season.

Among her more known plays were ''Läsarepresten'', a play in four acts, ''Fyra dagar af konung Gustaf III:s lefnad'', a historical play in four acts, and ''Tidningsskrifvaren'', a play in five acts, all of which were performed in the Royal Dramatic Theatre in [[Stockholm]].  She did not only write alone, but also together with her sister, [[Louise Granberg]]. Both siblings used male pseudonyms, Jeanette wrote under the name ''Georges Malméen''. She made great successes with her plays in 1855 and 1857. In ''Läsareprästen''(The vicar), she criticized religious fanaticism in her story about a priest who takes power in a community before the monarch and the people drive him out and reform the society, and in ''Hos oss eller en motbild till Onkel Toms stuga'' (At our place or a likeness to Uncle Tom's cabin), she treats the subject of poverty and charity. She was well known to be the author of her plays, but her name was not usually on the posting for the play, as this was considered to be unsuitable for her gender.

She married the actor [[Edvard Stjernström]], founder of the [[Swedish Theatre (Stockholm)]], in 1854, and died three years after.  After her death, her husband married her sister; Louise Granberg, the sister of Jeanette, continued as a playwright and eventually became director of the Swedish Theatre. Jeanette Granberg was considered a great dramatic talent and expected to become one of the greatest within her profession, and her death before the age of 32 was seen as a great loss for her profession.

[[Image:Lanzon.JPG|thumb|150px|A replica of the Lanzón in Peru's [[Museum of the Nation]]]]

'''The Lanzón''' is the colloquial name for the most important statue of the central deity of the ancient [[Chavín culture]] of the central highlands of [[Peru]]. The Chavín religion was the first major religious and cultural movement in the [[Andes]] mountains, flourishing between 900 and 200 BCE. The Lanzón takes its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for "lance," an allusion to the shape of the sculpture.

The Lanzón is housed in the central cruciform chamber of a labyrinthine series of underground passages in the Old Temple of the ceremonial and religious center of [[Chavín de Huantar]]. Devotees would be led into the maze of pitch-black tunnels, eventually coming face to face with the sculpture's snarling mouth and upturned eyes. The worshipers' disorientation, in addition to the hallucinogenic effects of the [[San Pedro cactus]] they were given before entering, only heightened the visual and psychological impact of the sculpture.

The central image of the Lanzon functions as [[axis mundi]], or pivot linking the heavens, earth and underworld.  Position within the building also suggests centrality of image.

'''License-free software''' is [[computer software]] that is not explicitly in the [[public domain]], but the software owner has not made explicit the terms of the [[software license|license]] which makes the software fully [[copyright]] protected according to the [[Berne convention]].

== Examples ==

Examples of license-free software formerly included programs written by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]], such as [[qmail]], [[djbdns]], [[daemontools]], and [[ucspi-tcp]]. Bernstein held the copyright and distributed these works without license until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040622043020/http://qmail.org/not-open-source.html "qmail is not open source"] - an article published by Russell Nelson, OSI board member in 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From December 28, 2007 onwards, he started placing his software in the [[public domain]] with an explicit [[waiver]] statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html
 |title=Frequently asked questions from distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |year=2007
 |url=http://cr.yp.to/qmail/dist.html
 |title=Information for distributors
 |accessdate=2008-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, small [[Scripting language|script]]s are frequently released without specifying a license.  For example, the website Userscripts.org hosts more than 52,000 [[Greasemonkey]] user scripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |title=Scripts &amp;mdash; Userscripts.org 
 |accessdate=2010-06-29 
 |deadurl=yes 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506055146/http://userscripts.org/scripts 
 |archivedate=May 6, 2014 
}} &lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which have no specified license.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Similarly, github reported in 2015 that 85% of the projects it hosts are unlicensed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source/ the-github-kids-still-dont-care-about-open-source] on techrepublic.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights for users ==

On his [http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html Software users' rights] web page, Bernstein explains his belief that under the terms of copyright law itself software users are always allowed to modify software for their own personal use, regardless of [[Software license agreement|license agreements]].  He says '"If you think you need a license from the copyright holder, you've been bamboozled by Microsoft. As long as you're not distributing the software, you have nothing to worry about."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html|title=Software user's rights |work=yp.to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also says that software users are allowed to back up, to compile, and to run the software that they possess.

He further says that ''"since it's not [[copyright infringement]] for you to apply a [[patch (computing)|patch]], it's also not copyright infringement for someone to give you a patch,"'' noting the case of ''[[Galoob v. Nintendo]]'' as precedent.  Thus modified versions of license-free software can legally be distributed in [[source code]] form in whatever way that the original can, by distributing a [[patch (computing)|patch]] alongside it.

== Reception and discussion ==

Advocates of license-free software, such as Bernstein, argue that [[software license]]s are harmful because they restrict the freedom to use software, and copyright law provides enough freedom without the need for licenses. Though having some restrictions, these licenses allow certain actions that are disallowed by copyright laws in some jurisdictions. If a license tries to restrict an action allowed by a copyright system, by Bernstein's argument those restrictions can be ignored. In fact, Bernstein's "non-license" of verbatim retransmission of source code is very similar in nature.

Similar positions on licenses are voiced by [[Free culture movement|Free culture]] activist [[Nina Paley]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ninapaley.com/2010/11/06/driving-without-a-license/ Driving Without a License?] on ninapaley.com ''"I can’t work up enthusiasm for any license today."'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[Luis Villa]] argued similarly negative about the license usage of "open source", when the small number projects licensed on [[GitHub]] were noticed, identifying a "[[Post Open Source]] movement against the (license) [[permission culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://lu.is/blog/2013/01/27/taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/ taking-post-open-source-seriously-as-a-statement-about-copyright-law/] on lu.is (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18747">This is a list of '''scholarly publishing "[[sting operation]]s"''' such as the [[Sokal affair]]. These are nonsense papers that were accepted by an [[academic journal]] or [[academic conference]]; the list does not include cases of [[scientific misconduct]]. The intent of such publications is typically to expose shortcomings in a journal's [[Academic peer review|peer review]] process or to criticize the standards of [[Predatory open access publishing|pay-to-publish]] journals.

==Mathematics==
* In 2012, the [[open-access journal]] ''Advances in Pure Mathematics'' accepted a nonsense paper produced by the computer program Mathgen. Although the paper was accepted, the "author" declined to pay the journal's $500 publishing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eldredge|first1=Nate|title=Mathgen paper accepted!|url=http://thatsmathematics.com/blog/archives/102|website=That's Mathematics!|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
* A paper randomly generated by the [[SCIgen]] program was accepted without peer-review for presentation at the 2005 [[World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]] (WMSCI). The conference announced the prank of having accepted the article as not [[peer review]]ed, despite none of the three assigned peer-reviewers having submitted an opinion about its fidelity, veracity, or accuracy to its subject. The three [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate students who wrote the hoax article said they were unaware of the [[Sokal Affair]] until after submitting their article. Subsequently, numerous other papers generated by SCIgen have been published in scientific journals or accepted for presentation at scientific conferences.
* In December 2013, a [[Pune]]-based software professional submitted a bogus paper titled "use of cloud-computing and social media to determine box office performance", which was accepted by the [[Bhubaneswar]]-based Research Forum for their ICRIEST-AICEEMCS International Conference. The paper's introductory section itself cautioned that it contained some "gibberish" that was auto-generated by software. One section of the paper also includes 19 lines about the 1970s Bollywood film ''[[Sholay]]'', and 19 lines from ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'', a 1992 Hollywood film. The incident highlighted a practice where "poor quality papers are accepted from students who are then asked to pay a few thousand rupees to participate in the conferences". After that the management of the event retracted the paper and apologized publicly. The Secretary in an interview described the acceptance as a human error of the coordinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140103/jsp/frontpage/story_17747127.jsp|title=Throw in F-word and become paper tiger|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 an Australian computer scientist Dr Peter Vamplew submitted a paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT) after being angered that the journal would not take his email off its mailing list. The article, titled "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list|Get me off your fucking mailing list]]", consisted of the phrase "Get me off your fucking mailing list" being repeated for the entirety of the article body. The journal requested the researcher to "add some more recent references and do a bit of reformatting" saying that the article's "suitability for the journal was excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2014-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
* Christoph Bartneck, an [[Associate Professor]] in [[Information Technology]] at New Zealand's [[University of Canterbury]], was invited to submit a paper to the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics organised by [[ConferenceSeries]]. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, he used [[iOS]]'s auto-complete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence,&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to [[Siri]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]).&lt;ref name="HIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=iOS Just Got A Paper On Nuclear Physics Accepted At A Scientific Conference|first=Christoph|last=Bartneck|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] Human Interface Technology (HIT) Lab, New Zealand|url=http://www.bartneck.de/2016/10/20/ios-just-got-a-paper-on-nuclear-physics-accepted-at-a-scientific-conference/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: "The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids"&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and the 516-word abstract contained the words "good" and "great" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online).&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; The incident was compared to an earlier case where Peter Vamplew, from [[Federation University Australia|Federation University]] in Victoria, had a manuscript containing only the phrase "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list]]" accepted by the [[International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology]].&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nonsense paper written by iOS autocomplete accepted for conference|first=Elle|last=Hunt|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/22/nonsense-paper-written-by-ios-autocomplete-accepted-for-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConferenceSeries is associated with the [[OMICS Publishing Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus British Company "Accredits" OMICS Conferences|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|authorlink=Jeffrey Beall|url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003123/https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[open access journals]] widely regarded as [[predatory open access publishing|predatory]], and has been accused of moving into "predatory meetings".&lt;ref name="Beall"&gt;{{cite web|title=OMICS Goes from "Predatory Publishing" to "Predatory Meetings" |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Beall |first2=Richard |last2=Levine |authorlink1=Jeffrey Beall |authorlink2=Richard Levine |url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2016 |publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042104/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartneck said he was "reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science," given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;

==Chemistry==
* "[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]": In 2013 [[John Bohannon]] wrote in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' about a "[[sting operation]]" he conducted in which he submitted "a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable", to 304 open-access publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannon|first=John|title=Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|journal=Science|date=4 October 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725|bibcode=2013Sci...342...60B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Mike|title=Anti-tutorial: how to design and execute a really bad study|url=http://svpow.com/2013/10/07/anti-tutorial-how-to-design-and-execute-a-really-bad-study/|work=Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week|accessdate=14 October 2013|author2=Matt Wedell|author3=Darren Naish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=The big picture about peer-review|url=http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2013/10/10/the-big-picture-about-peer-review/|work=Scholarly Communications @ Duke|publisher=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
* John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979|title=Integrative medicine and the point of credulity|date=8 December 2010|publisher=The BMJ|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
* In 2007 [[Tomasz Witkowski]] published a fake article in the psychology journal ''[[Charaktery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|title=Psychological Sokal's Style Hoax|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practices|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|last2=Zatonski|first2=Maciej|title=Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy|date=2015|publisher=BrownWalker Press|isbn=1-62734-528-0|pages=259–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|title=Sokal Re-created|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/142-swift-december-21-2007.html#i3|publisher=JREF|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other science bloggers covered the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grivan|first1=Ray|title=Polish Sokal-style hoax|url=http://poorpothecary.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-style-hoax.html|website=Poor Pothecary|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wanderer in the country of blindfolded|title=Polish 'Sokal hoax'|url=http://countryofblindfolded.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-hoax.html|website=Random journeys through Science|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary and cultural studies==
* The [[Sokal affair]]: [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]], wrote a paper titled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice [[academic peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|accessdate=3 April 2007|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=28 November 1994|work=[[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)|publisher=[[Duke University]] Press|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Mystery science theater|author1=Bruce Robbins|author2=Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]''|date=5 June 1996|accessdate= 2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Michel Maffesoli#Sociétés hoax|Sociétés hoax]]: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the "[[Autolib']]", a small rentable car in [[Paris]], to [[Michel Maffesoli]]'s ''Sociétés'' journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly "reviewed" by two people, before being accepted and published in ''Sociétés'' without any substantial editing.
* In May 2017, [[Peter Boghossian]] and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the [[open access journal]] ''Cogent Social Sciences'' which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a "driver behind much of climate change" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=Jamie|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|date=|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct|url=http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/conceptual-penis/23311886.2017.1330439.pdf|journal=Open Access Journal|volume=|page=6|pages=|via=Skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Peter|last2=Lindsay|first2=James|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct: a Sokal-style hoax on gender studies|url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/|website=Skeptic|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of ''Salon'', for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination "to accept papers regardless of quality." He also noted that none of the editorial board members of ''Cogent Social Sciences'' have expertise in gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/05/22/why-the-conceptual-penis-hoax-was-a-bust-it-only-reveals-the-lack-of-skepticism-among-skeptics/ |title=Why the “Conceptual Penis” hoax was a bust: It only reveals the lack of skepticism among skep... |last=Torres |first=Phil |date=2017-05-22 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James E. McWilliams]] criticized the authors' motives, writing that "Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate—thriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation—this scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://psmag.com/education/the-hoax-that-backfired-how-an-attempt-to-discredit-gender-studies-will-only-strengthen-it |title=The Hoax That Backfired: How an Attempt to Discredit Gender Studies Will Only Strengthen It |last=McWilliams |first=James |date=2017-05-31 |work=Pacific Standard |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [["Grievance Studies" affair]] (also referred to as the ""Sokal Squared" Scandal (or Hoax)" by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and [[Peter Boghossian]] wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called “grievance studies" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the [[feminist geography]] journal ''[[Gender, Place and Culture]]'' was criticized on social media, and then on ''[[Campus Reform]]'', which led a ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial writer to investigate and report on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Hoaxers Slip Breastaurants and Dog-Park Sex Into Journals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the ''Wall Street Journal'' story broke, referred to dog parks as "petri dishes for canine [[rape culture]]". The report also described a paper published in ''[[Affilia]]'' which contained a reworded excerpt from ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-news-comes-to-academia-1538520950|title=Fake news comes to academia|author=Jillian Kay Melchior|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2018-10-02|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
* Dr. [[Maarten Boudry]], a [[Philosophy|philosopher]], in 2012 persuaded two [[theology]] conferences to accept abstracts composed of meaningless [[word salad]] as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2012/09/28/philosopher-pulls-a-sokal-on-theology-conferences/|title=Philosopher Pulls a Sokal on Theology Conferences|author=Ed Brayton|work=Dispatches from the Culture Wars|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html|title=Atheist philosopher pulls Sokal-style hoax on theology conference|work=New Humanist Blog|publisher=Rationalist Association|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928014134/http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html#|archive-date=2012-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of stage mothers'''.  In the entertainment industry, a [[stage mother]] is the term for the mother of a child performer.  Often the stage mother is the manager of the child's career and oversees their auditions, costuming and preparation for performances and negotiates financial remuneration on the child's behalf.

There is sometimes a negative connotation for the term, sometimes implying a mother who exerts unreasonable demands for the child's treatment, or puts undue pressure on the child, or who may take advantage of the child's income or notoriety for her own selfish purposes.

'''Maria Arena Bell''' (born March 10, 1963) is an American novelist, television and freelance writer. She is the former [[head writer]] and [[executive producer]] of the [[CBS Daytime]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]].''

==Personal life==
Bell is married to Bill Bell Jr., the eldest son of ''Y&amp;R'' creators [[William J. Bell]] and [[Lee Phillip Bell]]. They have two children.

==Career==
Bell began her writing career for ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' in 1988 under writer [[William J. Bell]].  There, she helped create the character [[Sally Spectra]] who was loosely based on her step-father who worked in the Los Angeles garment industry.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Bell later developed primetime shows for [[NBC]] and CBS.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Bell returned to ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' in November 2007 and was named head writer in March 2008, and co-executive producer in September 2009.  She was then elevated to Executive Producer of the series in December 2010.

==''The Young and the Restless''==
===Departure===
On July 25, 2012, a source reported to ''[[Daytime Confidential]]'' that Bell's co-head [[Scott Hamner]] decided to quit ''Y&amp;R'', and this was later confirmed by ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' saying that he would take a leave of absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EXCLUSIVE! Y&amp;R Scribe Stepping Down |url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/exclusive-yr-scribe-stepping-down |publisher=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She [Maria Arena Bell] really didn't want me to leave, so I agreed to take a few months off," Hamner said. After the news broke, rumors began to circulate that [[Jill Farren Phelps]] was close to being named ''Y&amp;R'''s new executive producer.

Two days later, [[Sony Pictures Television]] reported via a press release that Phelps has been named executive producer and [[Josh Griffith]], who was previously fired by Sony under Bell's tenure, as head writer.&lt;ref name="Bell Out, Phelps/Griffith In"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R Shakeup"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Huge Shakeup at Y&amp;R! |title=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |pages=4–5 |date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony thanked Bell for her work and wished her "the best of luck and continued success".&lt;ref name="Bell Out, Phelps/Griffith In"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONFIRMED: Jill Farren Phelps Named Executive Producer of The Young and the Restless; Josh Griffith in as Head Writer! |url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/07/26/confirmed-jill-farren-phelps-named-executive-producer-of-the-young-and-the-restless-josh- |publisher=Daytime Confidential |last=Giddens |first=Jamey |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729183023/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/07/26/confirmed-jill-farren-phelps-named-executive-producer-of-the-young-and-the-restless-josh- |archivedate=July 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Only hours later, Bell posted a statement on her [[Facebook]] page about being ousted, sharing that she was "mystified" over being let go by Sony.&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R Shakeup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell 'Mystified'"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bell On Exit: Why Am I Leaving? |url=http://cbs.soapsindepth.com/2012/07/bell-on-exit-why-am-i-leaving.html |publisher=Soaps in Depth |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "My ratings are strong... each week stronger than last year. The show is in a great place creatively. We are number one by the greatest margin in the show's history and have been consistently while I've been there. Under no one else's tenure as head writer exec producer have we won every demographic for so long. I am just shy of five years at the helm. It has been an amazing ride. So why am I leaving? There have been a lot of tears shed in the last few days... by me and by my loyal staff and by our iconic actors. I was not given a reason and in fact I have heard nothing from Sony or CBS. They sent me a message through my husband Bill, who had the terrible job of conveying that they'd gone around him and were letting me go," Bell wrote.&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R Shakeup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell 'Mystified'"/&gt; Her statement caused angry words from fans, saying that Bell was in denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Arena Bell Really Doesn't Have a Clue Why Sony TV Gave Her The Boot at Young and Restless |url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/07/27/maria-arena-bell-really-doesnt-have-a-clue-why-sony-tv-gave-her-the-boot-at-young-and-re |publisher=Daytime Confidential |last=Giddens |first=Jamey |date=July 27, 2012 |accessdate=July 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730070218/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/07/27/maria-arena-bell-really-doesnt-have-a-clue-why-sony-tv-gave-her-the-boot-at-young-and-re |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An official reason was not given for Bell's departure,&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R Shakeup"/&gt; though many insiders have speculated that her departure was prompted by Sony's desire to have more "creative control" over the number one daytime soap opera and the controversial pairing of [[Sharon Newman|Sharon]] and [[Victor Newman]] ([[Sharon Case]] and [[Eric Braeden]]).&lt;ref name="Y&amp;R Shakeup"/&gt; Phelps and Griffith's first official episode aired on October 12, 2012,&lt;ref name="Phelps Griffith Premiere Date"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jill-Farren-Phelps-1052399.aspx |title=Exclusive: New Boss Jill Farren Phelps Reveals What's in Store For The Young and the Restless |last=Logan |first=Michael |work=[[TV Guide]] |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=August 31, 2012 |date=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Bell was still credited onscreen as executive producer until October 22.

==Criticism==
Bell was credited, along with former co-executive producer [[Paul Rauch]], for rejuvenating ''The Young and the Restless'' after former head writer and executive producer [[Lynn Marie Latham]] was panned by critics for her detour from traditional storytelling and writing characters to suit her storylines. Bell had many successful storylines, including the return of Marge, [[Katherine Chancellor]]'s look-alike, which resulted in the reveal that Katherine Chancellor was not, in fact, [[Jill Foster Abbott]]'s mother.

Yet soon after, critics became disheartened by Bell's departure from character-driven stories in favor of plot-driven ones, like when [[Lauren Fenmore Baldwin|Lauren Baldwin]] ([[Tracey E. Bregman]]) was kidnapped out of the blue by the never before seen or mentioned [[Sarah Smythe]] (also Bregman), sister of Lauren's long time nemesis [[Sheila Carter]] ([[Kimberlin Brown]]). To make matters worse, Sarah had undergone plastic surgery so as to have the same exact face as Lauren, which was a recycled plot twist from the [[Lynn Marie Latham]] era when Sheila had undergone plastic surgery to look exactly like [[Phyllis Summers|Phyllis Newman]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]). This story along with others garnered her comparisons to the late [[James E. Reilly]] (''[[Passions]]'' creator/head writer and former head writer of ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'') who was known for writing outlandish plots. Bell was criticized for writing numerous bland murder mysteries and killing off popular, long time characters, like [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]), [[Colleen Carlton]] ([[Tammin Sursok]]) and [[Diane Jenkins]] ([[Maura West]]).

Another source of contention has been Bell's casting choices. Critics and fans were dissatisfied with the recasting of one of "Y&amp;R's" most popular characters and a daytime sex symbol [[Malcolm Winters]] (formerly played by [[Shemar Moore]]) with former ''[[Family Matters]]'' actor [[Darius McCrary]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Darius McCrary Interview- The Young and the Restless |url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/2009/the-young-and-the-restless/the-darius-mccrary-interview-the-young-and-the-restless/ |publisher=Michael Fairman On Air - On Soaps |last=Fairman |first=Michael |date=December 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Eden Riegel]]'s turn as [[Heather Stevens]] and [[Maura West]] as [[Diane Jenkins]].

==Awards==
''The Young and the Restless'' writing team won the [[WGA Award]] for Best Daytime Serial in February 2010 and again in 2013 for work airing under Bell's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Young and the Restless Wins WGA Award For Daytime Drama |url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2013/02/17/the-young-and-the-restless-wins-wga-award-for-daytime-drama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325234620/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2013/02/17/the-young-and-the-restless-wins-wga-award-for-daytime-drama |archivedate=2013-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Y&amp;R wins WGA award for Best Daytime Serial! |url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/yr-wins-wga-award-for-best-daytime-serial/2010/02/21/ |publisher=Michael Fairman On Air - On Soaps |last=Fairman |first=Michael |date=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bell, along with her writing team, won the [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Drama Series Writing Team.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{:List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{expand section|with=Main storyline(s) of seasons 1-4|date=August 2018}}

The series begins revolving around [[Piper Chapman]] ([[Taylor Schilling]]), a woman in her thirties living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a [[Prison#Security|minimum-security]] women's [[federal prison]] in [[upstate New York]]. Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years prior to the start of the series and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fiancé, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest) and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the "Federal Department of Corrections" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management &amp; Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.

The fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues, during which some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement in the riot. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically shot by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally shot by a corrupt "strike team", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken hostage of the guard. All inmates are transported to other prisons.

The consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned. Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.

Throughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination, among other issues, affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being, the correctional officers, and the prison's basic ability to fulfill its fundamental responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=cite secondary source(s) for analyses}} One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities, Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down.

[[File:Cast of Orange Is The New Black at Paley Fest.jpg|thumb|right|The series cast at The Paley Center For Media's PaleyFest 2014 event honoring the show]]

Show creator [[Jenji Kohan]] read [[Piper Kerman]]'s memoir after a friend sent it to her. She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she "screwed up" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation.&lt;ref name="Collidermay"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radish |first1=Christina |title=Creator Jenji Kohan Talks ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK, Her Research Into Prison Life, and Graphic Sex Scenes |url=http://collider.com/jenji-kohan-orange-is-the-new-black-interview/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, [[Piper Chapman]], as a "trojan horse" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Orange' Creator Jenji Kohan: 'Piper Was My Trojan Horse' |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/13/211639989/orange-creator-jenji-kohan-piper-was-my-trojan-horse |publisher=NPR |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ottawa Festivals''', a not-for-profit member-based organization, is the Festival Network Office located in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] Canada. Established in 1996, the network consists of 53 festivals in the Ottawa region.

==History==
In the summer of 1994, four new festivals evolved with the objective of showcasing different cultures, arts, and entertainment to the local community. Distinct, yet sharing a common objective, these organizations, namely, Ottawa Bluesfest, CKCU Ottawa Folk Festival, Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, and Fete Caribe, saw a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences and to lend support in each other’s development and growth.

In the fall of 1994, a meeting was called by the president of Ottawa Tourism Commission Authority (OTCA) in response to many public inquiries relating to these new festivals. The goal was to create a communication flow between the festivals and OTCA. During this meeting, there was a consensus that most of the festivals had many common interests and that there was a need to form some ongoing group that could not only coordinate tourism information, but also share ideas to improve their individual events.
After many meetings and brainstorming sessions, the Ottawa Festival Network was formed with an initial board which included prominent personalities like Mark Monahan (Ottawa Bluesfest), Michel Gauthier (Canadian Tulip Festival), Gene Swimmer (Ottawa Folk Festival) and Christine Broughton (OTCA). It was from this initial group that the network flourished and eventually, was successful in liaising with several organizations, such as, Canadian Tourism Commission, City of Ottawa, and Human Resource Development Canada, to name a few.
In April, 1996 the Ottawa Festival Network became an incorporated entity with a group of diverse not-for-profit member festivals representing different cultures, arts, and entertainment.
April 2006 brought a landmark when the Ottawa Festival Network celebrated its 10th Anniversary with the “Launch of the Festival Season”. This event brought celebrated Ottawa’s multi-million dollar festival industry and the decade-long involvement of the Ottawa Festival Network in showcasing and promoting art, culture and entertainment in Canada’s National Capital Region. This event presented the unveiling of the new official name (Ottawa Festivals d’Ottawa), the logo, the 10th anniversary brochure, and the new and revised official Web site. The launch highlighted the growth of the festival industry over the past decade and how it has contributed to the local tourism and economy.

'''Pierre Clayette''' (24 March 1930&amp;ndash;18 December 2005) was a French painter, [[Etching|etcher]] and [[Lithography|lithographer]], illustrator and [[Scenography|scenographer]]. Active for five decades, much of his work was architectural in style.

==Biography==
[[File:Théâtre Rive Gauche, Rue de la Gaîté, Paris 14.jpg|thumb|right|Façade of the [[Théâtre Rive Gauche]] in Paris decorated by Clayette in 1994]]
Born in Paris in 1930, after high school Clayette attended the [[Académie Julian]] where he studied under [[Jules Cavaillès]]. On leaving the Académie he was recruited by [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]] to work in his studio. Clayette's first known professional work was in the mid 1950s. From 1960 he explored a different artistic theme each year, exhibiting virtually continuously each year successively until the early 1990s at the [[Galerie Charpentier]], the Galerie Roger Dulac, the Galerie Emmanuel David and the Galerie Proscenium. At the same time, he collaborated with the magazine ''[[Planète (magazine)|Planète]]'' as a draftsman, and illustrated the covers or the text of books including the works of Shakespeare (including the series [[New Penguin Shakespeare]]), Goethe, Rimbaud, Kafka, etc.  In the early 1960s dramatist [[Jean Anouilh]] introduced Clayette to the stage actor and director [[Jean Le Poulain]] as "A painter of the waking dream".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Le Poulain, Pierre Clayette, Paris, ''Phantasmes'', Graphedis Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Les/&gt;

For ''[[Planète (magazine)|Planète]]'' he illustrated the poems of [[Victor Hugo]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://greguti.free.fr/litt/gutierez-planete.PDF  Gégory Gutierez, 'The speech of the fantastic realism: the magazine "Planère" ' , University of Sorbonne - Paris IV, UFR of French language, university year 1997-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; he also illustrated the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in the Fantasy Realism style.  However, like many artists who at one point in their career were associated with the movement such as [[Pierre-Yves Trémois]], Clayette's pictorial production did not stop at the themes of Fantasy Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Claude Guilbert, Fantastic Realism - Forty European Painters of the Imaginary , Opta Publishing, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the unusual is a constant of his work, it draws its references in many artistic currents including Romanticism, Baroque, Symbolism, etc.&lt;ref name=Les/&gt;

Clayette died in [[Colombes]] in France in 2005 aged 75.

==Works== 
===Scenography (Sets and Costumes)===
By his own admission,&lt;ref&gt;"The Avant-scène Theater", No. 523, August 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Clayette was interested in [[scenography]] and theater design before even considering painting.  The influence of [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]] is evident in an artist who was one of the last representatives of the period between the 1920s and the late 1970s during which theater and opera directors often appeal to leading artists in the world of painting.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institut de France", No. 62, Fall 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, Clayette is part of a lineage that included, among others, [[André Derain]], [[Balthus]], [[Christian Berard]], [[George Wakhevich]], Cassandre and [[Andre Masson]].  Clayette entered the world of scenography in 1955 for a ballet by [[Daniel Wayenberg]] with [[Pierre Lacotte]] who entrusted him with his first set of sets. Clayette became famous among the great names of lyric and dramatic scenes, such as [[Maurice Béjart]], Pierre Lacotte, [[Gabriel Dussurget]], [[Maurice Escande]] and [[Jean Le Poulain]], maintaining a long involvement with the latter until Poulain's death in 1988.  Clayette's talent as a stage designer gave him the opportunity to express himself on the most prestigious stages, such as the [[Comédie-Française]], the [[Palais Garnier]] and the International Festival of Lyric Art in [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref name=Les&gt;[https://www.lesatamanes.com/artistes/clayette-pierre Pierre Clayette - Brief biography on 'Les Atamanes']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Ratoncito Pérez''' or '''Ratón Pérez''' (literally translated into English as ''Perez mouse'' or ''Perez the Mouse'') is a figure popular in [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] and [[Hispanic culture|Hispanic American cultures]], similar to the [[tooth fairy]], originating in [[Madrid]] in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez".

Similarly in the [[Philippines]], some Christian ethnic groups have the same allusion of a rat when they lose the teeth. However, unlike in the hispanic countries, the rat is not named.

The ''Ratoncito Pérez'' has been used in by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela, stars in the 2006 [[Argentina|Argentine]] movie [[El Ratón Pérez]], and appeared in the tale of [[the Vain Little Mouse]].

[[Image:Ratoncito placa.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative plaque in Madrid, placed outside the warehouse where Ratoncito Pérez was said to have lived.]]

A mouse named ''Ratón Pérez'' or "ratonpérez" or "ratompérez" first appeared in "Cuentos, oraciones, adivinanzas y refranes populares" (1877), by Fernán Caballero, the pen name of Cecilia Böhl de Faber y Larrea, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/153695.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in "La hormiguita" as her gentle and timid husband, as well as the husband of "La Ratita Presumida" (The Vain Little Mouse). This character would later inspire [[Luis Coloma]], who would make him part of the Spanish traditional folklore by turning him into a sort of Tooth Fairy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/raton/protagonistas01.htm |title=CVC. Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011|quote=He wrote works that were very well received by his readers: Pequeñeces, Boy, Jeromín... and children's stories, like Pelusa and Ratón Pérez, which were dedicated to his friends and pupils. Luis Coloma appears to be the first author to write a story featuring our famous mouse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Coloma was contracted to write a story for [[Alfonso XIII]], who had just lost his tooth at the age of 8.&lt;ref name=fotomadrid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotomadrid.com/ver/647 |title=Casa del Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011}}&lt;!-- Probably not a reliable source. Remove when we have a better one. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Coloma's story follows ''Ratoncito Pérez'' who lived with his family in a box of cookies in Madrid, but frequently ran away from home through the pipes of the city, and into the bedrooms of children who had lost their teeth. The story details how Ratoncito Pérez cunningly misleads any cats in the vicinity who may be lurking, and includes his interaction with King Buby ([[Maria Christina of Austria|Queen Maria Christina]]'s nickname for Alfonso XIII).

The city council of Madrid paid tribute to Ratoncito Pérez with a commemorative plaque outside the warehouse where the mouse was said to have lived. The plaque reads: "Here lived, in a box of cookies, Ratoncito Pérez, according to the story that the father Coloma wrote for the young King Alfonso XIII." Ratoncito Pérez thus became the first fictional character honored with a plaque by the Madrid City Council. Coloma's original manuscript, with his signature and a dedication to King Alfonso XIII, is now located in the vault of the Royal Palace Library.&lt;ref name=cvc03&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/raton/protagonistas03.htm |title=CVC. Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011|quote=The manuscript of Father Coloma, with his signature and a dedication to King Alfonso XIII, is bound in green leather with a gold brooch and gilt edges. It remains in the vault of the Royal Palace Library.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[File:Raton Perez (Cuento) pg 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of the original ''Ratón Pérez'' by Luis Coloma, illustrated by [[Mariano Pedrero]]]]

Coloma's original story has been retold and adapted in various formats since it was published in the early 1900s. One such retelling was by [[Lady Moreton]] entitled "[[Perez the Mouse]]", which she published in 1915 and attributed to Coloma.&lt;ref name=cvc03 /&gt;

In 2006, the story was filmed under the title ''[[The Hairy Tooth Fairy|El Ratón Pérez]]'' (or ''Perez, the mouse of your dreams''), directed by [[Juan Pablo Buscarini]].&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0458076/ |title=El Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ratoncito Pérez'' has been used in Colgate marketing in Venezuela,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |title=Producto.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the character appeared earlier in the tale of the Vain Little Mouse.

Other adaptations include ''[[El ratoncito Pérez]]'' by [[Olga Lecaye]] (1999), ''[[La mágica historia del Ratoncito Pérez]]'' by [[Fidel del Castillo]] (1996), ''[[¡S.O.S., salvad al ratoncito Pérez!]]'' by [[Eduardo Galán]] (1995), and ''[[Ratoncito Pérez, en Vuelo de Cometas]]'' by [[Vicenta Fernández Martín]] (1999).&lt;ref name=cvc03 /&gt;

Raton Perez makes an appearance in [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s film ''[[Rise of the Guardians]]'', when one of the Tooth Fairy's mini fairies finds him at works and tackles him before the Tooth Fairy stops the fight

Handy Manny episode "Julieta's Tooth" makes mention of "Mr. Perez" among other nicknames for the "tooth Mouse" to take her tooth after Manny retrieves it from the sink trap.

'''Samuel Gilburne''' (fl. 1605, d. after 1623) was an [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[actor]] who is listed as one of the "Principall Actors" in the prefatory material of the [[First Folio]] of William Shakespeare's plays. Gilburne is named as a former apprentice to [[Augustine Phillips]], another member of Shakespeare's company, in Phillips' will dated 4 May 1605, in which Gilburne is bequeathed 40 shillings, Phillips's "mouse-colored" velvet hose, his black taffeta suit and white taffeta doublet, his purple cloak, his sword and dagger, and his bass [[viol]]. A copy of the First Folio held at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] has a signature thought to be Gilburne's.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">A '''script coordinator''' is a role in the production of a [[film]] or [[television program|television series]]. The script coordinator is responsible for producing each [[draft document|draft]] of the [[screenplay|script]] and annotating it for ease of use for the production team.

On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and [[Film_production#Production|production]] departments. The writers deliver the first [[draft document|draft]] of a [[screenplay|script]] to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the [[screenplay|script]] for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-script-coordinator-do.htm wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script coordinator must check the [[draft document|draft]] for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the [[draft document|draft]]. Once a [[screenplay|script]] has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the [[screenplay|script]]. The process of how widely each [[draft document|draft]] is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. &lt;ref&gt;[http://aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com/2012/07/5-questions-with-writers-assistant-and.html aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the [[screenplay|script]] and again check the [[screenplay|script]] for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a [[Bible (writing)|show bible]] that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. 

A script coordinator is a distinct role from [[script supervisor]]. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the [[screenplay|script]] for editing purposes rather than [[pre-production]] coordination of the [[screenplay|script]] to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time [[screenwriter]] is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

'''''The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories''''' is a collection of seven illustrated stories by children's author [[Dr. Seuss]] published by [[Random House]] on September 27, 2011. Though they were originally published in magazines in the early 1950s, they had never been published in book form and are quite rare, described by the publisher as "the literary equivalent of buried treasure".&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{citation |title=The Bippolo Seed and Other Stories |publisher=[[Random House]] |url = http://www.randomhouse.com/book/43160/the-bippolo-seed-and-other-lost-stories-by-dr-seuss |accessdate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories were discovered by Charles D. Cohen, a Massachusetts dentist and a Seuss scholar and biographer, who also contributed an introduction to the collection.

==Plots==
The seven stories included in the book are as follows:&lt;ref name="RH"/&gt;
*"The Bippolo Seed" (60th-anniversary edition): a duck finds a rare seed that can grant wishes, but a cat tells him to wish for more than he needs, to get money; they end up losing the seed.
*"The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga": a rabbit escapes being eaten by convincing the bear that he has a rare but serious disorder.
*"Gustav, the Goldfish": a boy overfeeds a goldfish, causing it to grow until it fills a cellar. It was later adapted by [[Helen Palmer Geisel|Helen Palmer]] as "[[A Fish out of Water (book)|A Fish out of Water]]."
*"Tadd and Todd": two identical twins don't like being the same, so they try to be different by enhancing their looks but fail.
*"Steak for Supper": a boy brags about his steak dinner, causing strange beasts to follow him home, but it turns out to be stew.
*"The Strange Shirt Spot": a boy gets dirt on himself, to his mother's dismay, so he tries to get it off but fails. 
*"The Great Henry McBride": a boy dreams of having five jobs, all at once.

== Analysis ==
Some elements of the stories in this collection appeared in later books. The story "Gustav the Goldfish" was the basis for the [[Beginner Books|Beginner Book]] ''[[A Fish out of Water (book)|A Fish out of Water]]''. The book was written by Seuss's first wife [[Helen Palmer Geisel]], illustrated by [[P. D. Eastman]], and published in 1961.&lt;ref name=nel&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; "Gustav the Goldfish" rhymes, unlike ''A Fish out of Water''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Seuss later reused the basic plot of "The Strange Shirt Spot" for 1958's ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]''.&lt;ref name=nel/&gt; In both stories, a character tries to remove a spot from various household items but only manages to transfer the spot to one object after another.&lt;ref&gt;Nel 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;116&lt;/ref&gt;

The story "The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga" was recorded by [[Marvin Miller]] and released on the 1965 album ''Dr. Seuss presents..."Fox in Socks" and "Green Eggs &amp; Ham"'' on RCA Records.

'''''The Crowded Day''''' is a 1954 [[UK|British]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[John Guillermin]] and starring [[John Gregson]], [[Joan Rice]], [[Cyril Raymond]] and [[Josephine Griffin]]. The film follows a group of [[saleswoman|shopgirls]] working in Bunting and Hobbs, a [[London]] [[department store]], during the Christmas shopping season.&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1408156/index.html |title=Crowded Day, The (1954) |last=Pratt |first=Vic |author-link=Vic Pratt |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=2014 |website=Screenonline.org.uk |access-date=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=Dilys|date=1954-11-14 |title=The Hard Way |url= |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |page=11 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released in the U.S. under the title '''''Shop Spoiled'''''.

==Plot==
The Christmas holidays are approaching, and a group of shopgirls head to their jobs at Bunting and Hobbs, a busy London department store. Peggy French ([[Joan Rice]]) is upset at her shopman fiance, Leslie Randall ([[John Gregson]]), because he refuses to sell his vintage car, "Bessie", that takes up all of his time and money. Peggy notes that he went to a car club meeting the previous night instead of taking her on a date, that he spends on the car instead of saving so they can get married, and that he has not even bought her an [[engagement ring]]. As they head into their respective jobs in the furnishings and estates departments, they quarrel and Peggy breaks off their engagement. She also refuses to let Leslie take her to the staff Christmas party that night, and leads him to believe that she has been dating the kind but very proper personnel manager, Philip Stanton ([[Cyril Raymond]]). In reality, although Mr Stanton is charmed by Peggy, he is not interested in fraternizing with any of the shopgirls as that is improper for a manager and could cost him his job. 

Leslie attempts to win Peggy back, but his efforts get him reported by Peggy's supervisor Mr Preedy, who has been making romantic overtures to Peggy despite being a married man, and sees Leslie as unwelcome competition for her affections. Leslie also gets reported by his own supervisor after Leslie botches his assignment of showing a house to friends of the store owner, Mr Bunting, because he is distracted by trying to make up with Peggy. Mr Stanton, looking through Leslie's personnel file, sees a report he wrote about promotions and thinks he might transfer Leslie to a higher-paying position in the publicity department. Mr Stanton also gives Leslie's report to Mr Bunting, saying it contains new and useful ideas. Leslie later informs Mr Stanton that he took the ideas for the report out of a book written by Mr Bunting, causing Mr Stanton to worry that he himself will now be sacked for repeating Mr Bunting's own ideas back to him. 

Another shopgirl, Yvonne Pascoe ([[Josephine Griffin]]), is worried and ill at work. She tells Peggy that she urgently needs to get in touch with her fiance, Michael Blayburn, who left his mother's home two months ago to look for a job so that he could marry Yvonne. Yvonne has not heard from Michael since he left, and when she tries to telephone his wealthy mother to find out his whereabouts, she is rebuffed. Peggy suggests Yvonne go visit Mrs Blayburn at her home during Yvonne's noontime break from the cosmetics counter. Yvonne does this, but Mrs Blayburn is cold to her and tells her Michael is tired of her and doesn't want to see her or hear from her. When Yvonne confesses she is pregnant with Michael's baby, Mrs Blayburn becomes angry, calls her a "slut" and orders her out of the house. Yvonne is late getting back to work and is reported by Moira, who is annoyed at having to work all alone at the busy cosmetics counter. Mr Stanton meets with Yvonne, learns she is pregnant, and tells her she will have to stop working, although she can have her job back after the baby is born and put up for adoption. He suggests Yvonne visit the welfare office in the meantime, since she has no other family to turn to.  Yvonne returns to the cosmetics counter, where she pockets a prescription intended for a customer that contains [[strychnine]] and leaves the store. In her hurry to leave, she fails to take an urgent note that a young man left for her at the counter; the note falls on the floor and is trampled by shoppers.

At the staff Christmas party that night, Peggy tries to attach herself to Mr Stanton, interrupting his efforts to socialize with Mr Bunting's homely daughter. Leslie then appears and Mr Bunting calls him over and praises him on his fine report, putting Leslie on track for the well-paying publicity department job. Leslie pays Peggy back for her deception by telling Mr Bunting that he heard Peggy and Mr Stanton were engaged, causing Mr Bunting's daughter to burst into tears. After the party, Peggy learns that Leslie has sold his old car, thus proving that he cares more about her than the car. She happily reunites with him, only to find he has bought an even older car. 

Meanwhile, shopgirl Suzy ([[Vera Day]]), who dreams of being a film actress, is seduced after the party by her date, a chauffeur who has pretended to be a director and promised her a screen test. Alice, another shopgirl who could not get a date for the party, hires a paid male escort, only to have him tell her at the end of the evening he enjoyed going out with her and the date is free of charge. Eve Carter, a beautiful but mysterious model at the store, is shown to be secretly happily married to (and, it is implied, financially supporting) a wheelchair-bound man. She hides her marriage by taking off her wedding ring at work so she will not lose her job. 

Yvonne does not attend the party, but wanders the dark streets of London contemplating suicide. At one point she orders tea from a stall and starts to take the strychnine pills, but is interrupted by the menacing sexual advances of a male customer at the stall. He chases her through the streets until she finally escapes into a church, where she collapses in tears, but decides not to kill herself. As she walks home past Bunting and Hobbs, she throws the pills into a waste bin. The next morning, the watchman ([[Sid James]]) finds the note that Yvonne never received, crumpled on the floor. It is from Michael, telling Yvonne that he has got a job, asking her to marry him and saying he will call her the next day.

==Production==
In the mid-1950s, [[Adelphi Films]] productions were usually considered [[B movie|'B' pictures]] that were booked by theatres only as support for main features, or at selected provincial locations. Founder Arthur Dent planned ''The Crowded Day'' as a high-quality big-budget feature in hopes of convincing theatres, particularly the [[Odeon Cinemas]] and [[ABC Cinemas]], to book the film nationwide throughout the UK as a main feature ('A' picture). To that end, Adelphi subcontracted the popular stars John Gregson and Joan Rice from the [[Rank Organisation]] at significant expense, and invested in other aspects of the film.&lt;ref name=bfi /&gt;

The film was shot at [[Walton Studios|Nettlefold Studios]] and on location in London.&lt;ref name=bfi /&gt; The [[Oxford Street]] department store [[Bourne &amp; Hollingsworth]] (renamed "Bunton and Hobbs" for the film) was the setting for the exterior store shots,&lt;ref name=reelstreets1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films/?task=view&amp;id=2295&amp;film_ref=crowded_day,_the&amp;limitstart=0 |title=Film: Crowded Day, The |last1=Tunstill |first1=John &amp; Brian |last2=James |first2=Simon |last3=Wilkinson |first3=Phil |last4=Lovejoy |first4=Simon |date=2015 |website=ReelStreets.com |publisher=Reel Streets – Worldwide Film Locations| page=1 |access-date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also some interior shots as producer David Dent arranged one day's shooting at the store for free.&lt;ref name=bfi /&gt; [[The Tower House]] was used for exterior shots of Mrs Blayburn's mansion. The exterior and interior church scenes were filmed at [[St Stephen's Church, Westbourne Park]].&lt;ref name=reelstreets2&gt;Tunstill, et al., at p. [http://www.reelstreets.com/index.php/component/films/?task=view&amp;id=2295&amp;film_ref=crowded_day,_the&amp;start=10  2].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's target audience was women. The storyline involving Yvonne, the unmarried, pregnant shopgirl who contemplates suicide, was considered risque for its time, causing the film to be advertised as "not suitable for children".&lt;ref name=bfi /&gt;

''The Crowded Day'' marked the first production in which Sid James and Vera Day both appeared. The two would appear together in many more film and television productions over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Robert |date=2012-05-01 |title=Smasher! The Life of Sid James |url= |publisher=JR Books Ltd. |location=[[London]] |page=23 |isbn=978-1907532160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to [[British Film Institute|British Film Institute (BFI)]] fiction film curator [[Vic Pratt]], critics were generally "impressed" with the film, especially with Guillermin's direction, although some "smirked" at the film's handling of the unwed pregnancy and suicide storyline. However, both Odeon and ABC refused to book it as a first feature due to conflicts with Arthur Dent. In November 1954 it was partially released at a small number of Odeons, but lacking a full circuit release, was unable to recoup its costs.&lt;ref name=bfi /&gt;

In February 2011, BFI Video released ''The Crowded Day'' on DVD and Blu-ray, along with the Guillermin-directed film ''[[Song of Paris]]'', as "Adelphi Collection Vol. 3".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004CZ6I6Y/ |title=The Crowded Day/ Song of Paris (DVD + Blu-ray) |date=2011-02-14 |website=Amazon.co.uk |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |access-date=2015-12-12 |ASIN=B004CZ6I6Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference''''' is a 1975 book by the philosopher [[Ian Hacking]].

==Reception==
Hacking's work has been described as ground-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac05|Macintosh 2005]]. p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] argued that Hacking's contention that there was no concept of uncertain evidence before about 1650 is incorrect, as it neglects the extensive Latin [[scholasticism|scholastic]] literature on legal [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[aleatory contracts]] and on [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;[[#Fra01|Franklin 2001]]. p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See [[Mythical theology]] for the theological concept.''
'''''Theologia mythologica''''' is a 1532 book by [[Georg Pictorius]]. It was one of the first treatises of [[Classical mythology]] in the [[German Renaissance]]. Pictorius interprets the Greek pantheon as [[allegory]], e.g. [[Cybele]] as the [[Earth]], her chariot wheels as symbolizing the rotation of the Earth.

The '''Venetian Theatre''' is a movie theater, performing arts venue, and restaurant in downtown [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], [[United States]]. Formerly the '''Town Theater''', the building re-opened in 2008 after more than a decade of inactivity and revitalization plans. Built in 1888 as a bank, later mayor [[Orange Phelps]] converted the property into a theater in 1911 and in 1925 converted it into a two-story [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] building with a larger auditorium. Prior to renovation the theater was owned by the city of Hillsboro who purchased it from [[Act III Theatres]]. The theatre has been temporarily closed since mid-April 2017 in connection with a planned change of ownership. However, that sale fell through, and the theater and restaurant remain closed in August 2017. In late August, its owner told the ''[[Hillsboro Tribune]]'' that he had found a new buyer, but it is not known when the Venetian might reopen.

==History==
