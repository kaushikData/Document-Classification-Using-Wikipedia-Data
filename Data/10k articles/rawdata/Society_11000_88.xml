The '''2004 Ukrainian child pornography raids''' occurred in July 2004, when police in [[Ukraine]] raided a softcore [[child pornography]] ring operating in the cities of [[Kiev]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Simferopol]].&lt;ref name="reuters crackdown"&gt;{{Cite news

Erotic materials produced by the agency were distributed over the Internet to various countries.

The agency, [[LS Studio|Ukrainian Angels Studio]], streamed on the web was called LS (Lolita Studio) Models and had a number of different domains such as LS Island, LS Magazine, Lolitas on Holiday, LS Dreams, and a series of sites under the LS Land moniker.

The Crime Investigation Department of the Ministry for the Interior conducted the raids. The deputy head of the department, Vitaly Yarema, said that the bank accounts of the agency, containing hundreds of thousands of dollars, had been frozen.&lt;ref name="reuters crackdown" /&gt;
Ukrainian Angels Studios actually began work much earlier, around 1999 or 2000. It split in 2001 into two separate outlets, LS and BD. BD had its own series of photos and videos which lasted until 2004. Many of the models went to other studios, none lasting more than a year. The last known groups were Karina World and Pink-Teens. Both closed in 2007. They featured former LS Models, now of legal age (over 18).

The raids were conducted after a joint investigation between Ukrainian police and Interpol. In 2005 the [[United States Department of State]] announced that there was further cooperation between Ukrainian police and other law enforcement agencies internationally.&lt;ref name="state Ukraine report"&gt;{{

On July 26, 2017, Jeff Payne, a detective for the [[Salt Lake City Police Department]] (SLCPD), arrested nurse [[Alex Wubbels]] at the [[University of Utah Hospital]] after she refused to [[venipuncture|draw blood]] from an unconscious patient. Footage of the incident released on August 31, 2017 went viral online. The SLCPD announced policy changes which would affect how police should handle situations involving drawing blood, and the hospital announced it would also change its police protocol to avoid repeating the incident. Utah lawmakers made a bill to amend the blood draw policy of Utah law enforcement, which Utah Governor [[Gary Herbert]] signed on March 15, 2018.

==History==
===Incident===
On July 26, 2017, Marcos Torres, a pickup truck driver fleeing from [[Utah Highway Patrol]] troopers in [[Cache County, Utah]], crashed head-on into a semi-truck. Torres was killed.  William Gray, the semi-truck driver and part-time police officer, was severely burned.&lt;ref name="SL-Trib-video"/&gt; Gray was taken into the University of Utah Hospital in a sedated and comatose state.&lt;ref name="DesNews-stop"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reavy |first=Pat |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865687903/Stop-I7ve-done-nothing-wrong-Nurse-shares-police-video-of-crazy-arrest-by-SL-officer.html |title='Stop! I've done nothing wrong': Nurse shares police video of 'crazy' arrest by S.L. officer |date=August 31, 2017 |work=[[Deseret News]] |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage of the arrest incident show a dispute between police detective Jeff Payne and the nurse Alex Wubbels over obtaining a blood sample from Gray. Wubbels argued that this situation would not meet the legal requirements allowing her to take a blood sample from an unconscious patient because he was not under arrest, there was no warrant, and the patient could not consent.&lt;ref name="SL-Trib-video"&gt;{{cite news |last=Manson |first=Pamela |url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/08/31/utah-nurse-arrested-after-complying-with-hospital-policy-that-bars-taking-blood-from-unconscious-victim/ |title=Video shows Utah nurse screaming, being handcuffed after refusing to take blood from unconscious victim |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=August 31, 2017 |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wang |first1=Amy |last2=Hawkins |first2=Derek |date=September 3, 2017 |title=A Utah nurse’s violent arrest puts patient-consent law — and police conduct — in the spotlight |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/09/03/a-utah-nurses-violent-arrest-puts-patient-consent-law-and-police-conduct-in-the-spotlight/ |work=[[Washington Post]] |location=|access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Forliti |first=Amy |date=September 2, 2017 |title=Utah nurse's arrest raises questions on limits of evidence collection |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-nurse-arrested-20170902-story.html |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further cited a hospital policy, that was agreed upon by the police department, that would not permit her to provide the blood sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reavy |first=Pat |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689609/Union-says-city-made-pariahs-of-officers-in-U-nurse-arrest.html |title=Union says city 'made pariahs' of officers in U. nurse arrest |date=September 25, 2017 |work=[[Deseret News]] |access-date=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Payne put the nurse on the phone with his watch commander, Lt. James Tracy, who reportedly told her she could be arrested if she refused to provide the sample. Wubbels continued to refuse, and Payne arrested her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitehurst |first=Lindsay |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/police-officer-arrested-utah-nurse-fired-medic-job-49638686 |title=Police officer who arrested Utah nurse fired from medic job |date=September 5, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wubbels was later released and no charges were brought against her.&lt;ref name="DesNews-stop"/&gt; Gray died on September 25, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Brittany |url=http://www.good4utah.com/news/top-stories/patient-at-the-center-of-controversial-nurse-arrest-dies/818734807 |title=Patient at the center of controversial nurse arrest dies |date=September 26, 2017 |publisher=[[KTVX]] |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray dies"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/patient-center-utah-nurse-s-high-profile-arrest-over-blood-n805051 |title=Patient at center of Utah nurse's high-profile arrest dies |publisher=NBC News |agency=Associated Press |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Soon after the incident, the SLCPD started a 35-day internal investigation into the arrest. A state audit of this investigation found that the police department had followed policies for this investigation, though it suggested the SLCPD should work faster to publicize information that is in public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wieber |first=Aubrey |url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/04/17/audit-suggests-salt-lake-city-police-review-internal-investigation-policies-to-get-information-out-to-the-public-quicker/ |title=Audit suggests Salt Lake City police review internal investigation policies to get information out to the public quicker |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |date=April 17, 2018 |accessdate=May 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the [[Salt Lake County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Sim Gill]] announced that his office was investigating the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Jeremy |url=http://kutv.com/news/local/da-asks-for-criminal-investigation-into-arrest-of-u-of-u-nurse |title=D.A. asks for criminal investigation into arrest of U of U nurse |date=September 2, 2017 |publisher=KUTV |accessdate=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gill requested investigative assistance from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Green |first=Mark |url=http://fox13now.com/2017/09/07/salt-lake-county-da-requests-fbi-assistance-in-nurse-alex-wubbels-investigation/ |title=Salt Lake County DA requests FBI assistance in Nurse Alex Wubbels investigation |date=September 7, 2017 |work=Fox 13 |publisher=[[KSTU]] |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FBI spokeswoman Sandra Yi Barker said the agency opened a civil rights review after the video went public, agreed to help the county investigate the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitehurst |first=Lindsay |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/utah-asks-fbi-to-investigate-police-in-nurses-rough-arrest/2017/09/07/34ecc4aa-940b-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html |title=Utah asks FBI to investigate police in nurse's rough arrest |work=The Washington Post |agency=The Associated Press |date=September 7, 2017 |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also opened a probe into the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Szekely |first=Peter |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utah-nurse/fbi-probing-utah-cop-who-arrested-nurse-for-refusing-to-draw-blood-idUSKCN1BJ2D0 |title=FBI probing Utah cop who arrested nurse for refusing to draw blood |date=September 8, 2017 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake]] also investigated the arrest.&lt;ref name=KUER/&gt;

On September 13, 2017, [[Jackie Biskupski]], the mayor of Salt Lake City, said that an internal investigation revealed Payne and Tracy violated six staff policies during the incident, including policies regarding arrests and standards of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klopfenstein |first=Jacob |url=https://www.ksl.com/index.php?sid=45790552&amp;nid=148 |title=Biskupski: Officers violated 6 policies in Alex Wubbels' arrest |publisher=[[KSL.com]] |date=September 13, 2017 |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report from Salt Lake City's Police Civilian Review Board also alleged that Payne and Tracy violated police policies. It stated that Payne became upset and frustrated during the incident, eventually "[losing] control of his emotions." Payne's lawyer said this report was based on speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reavy |first=Pat |url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865688714/Investigators-Officers-involved-in-U-nurse-arrest-violated-department-policies.html |title=Officer who arrested nurse 'clearly lost control' of emotions, report concludes |date=September 13, 2017 |work=Deseret News |accessdate=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-utah-nurse-arrest-20170914-story.html |title=Utah police officer lost control when he arrested nurse, review board finds |date=September 14, 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 15, 2017 |agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 25, the Salt Lake Police Association, a police union in Utah, criticized the city for its treatment of the police officers involved in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-union-blasts-handling-utah-nurse-arrest-probe-50089189 |title=Police union blasts handling of Utah nurse arrest probe |date=September 25, 2017 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=October 1, 2017 |agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLCPD fired Payne and demoted Tracy two ranks to the rank of Officer on October 10, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cummings |first=William |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/10/utah-cop-fired-after-arresting-nurse/752541001/ |title=Utah cop fired after arresting nurse who wouldn't draw blood |work=USA Today |date=October 10, 2017 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abc7chicago.com/utah-police-officer-who-handcuffed-dragged-nurse-in-video-fired/2517160/ |title=Utah police officer who handcuffed, dragged nurse in video fired |last= |first= |date=October 10, 2017 |work=ABC7 Chicago |access-date=October 11, 2017 |agency=Associated Press |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011013108/http://abc7chicago.com/utah-police-officer-who-handcuffed-dragged-nurse-in-video-fired/2517160/ |archive-date=October 11, 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
According to a statement posted by Salt Lake City mayor [[Jackie Biskupski]], the SLCPD launched an internal affairs investigation within 24 hours of the July 26 incident, meeting with the hospital's CEO and nursing management team.&lt;ref name=KUER&gt;{{cite news |url=http://kuer.org/post/facing-deluge-calls-mayors-office-releases-faq-nurse-video#stream/0 |title=Facing Deluge Of Calls, Mayor's Office Releases FAQ On Nurse Video |publisher=KUER |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, the SLCPD changed its policies on drawing blood.

The '''Afghan Red Crescent Society''', or '''(ARCS)''', ([[Pashto]]: ''د افغاني سرې میاشتې ټولنې'') is the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] affiliate of the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]. The Society has existed for over 70 years although with limited structure due to the prevailing conditions which have affected the country at large for over 20 years.

== History ==

The ARCS was founded in April 1934.  It traces its origins to the Naderia Orphanage, with the purpose of helping orphans and those in need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redcrescent.af/history?lang=en A Brief History of the Afghan Red Crescent Society]. Afghan Red Crescent Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1951, the society adopted its constitution, which articulated democratic provisions for membership, elections at central, provincial and local branches, and managing board.
In 1964 ARCS took over Marastoon (مرستون)  or Afghan Welfare organizations.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;[http://www.ifrc.org/cgi/pdf_profile.pl?afprofile.pdf Organizational Overview - ARCS (PDF)] (PDF). [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] is one of the two main partners of the ARCS, establishing its delegation in [[Afghanistan]] in 1991, with only temporary evacuations during the most recent conflict.&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; Although limited in terms of organizational capacity in recent years, the organization and activities of the ARCS covers territory throughout the country, with active branches in 31 of 32 provinces.

== Organization and activities ==

The ARCS receives a significant portion of its support from the National Societies of several developed nations, including those from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[Japan]], with support channeled through the International Federation. The ARCS also maintains bilateral relations with the National Societies of [[Iran]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref name=overview /&gt; The ARCS has been led by Ms. [[Fatima Gailani]] since 2004.

Based on its wide-ranging humanitarian work throughout Afghanistan, the ARCS claims the ability to work with all ethnic groups through its services. The primary activities of the organization have been focused primarily on disaster response, health care, and youth. Ms. Fatima Gailani claimed, in a 2007 interview with the International Review of the Red Cross, that the ARCS has nearly 37,000 volunteers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 2013, the society employed 1,717 staff members and retained 23,440 volunteers. In that same year, the society assisted more than 700,000 Afghanis through disaster preparedness programs, more than 430,000 through long-term development programs and more than 30,000 in acute disaster response activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/data-explorer/|title=IFRC Data Explorer|last=|first=|date=2013|website=IFRC|publisher=|access-date=1 Jul 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afro-Portuguese''', '''African-Portuguese''' or '''Black Portuguese''', are [[Portugal|Portuguese]] citizens or residents of Portugal with total or partial ancestry from any of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] ethnic groups of [[Africa]]. Most of those perceived as Afro-Portuguese trace their ancestry to former [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese overseas colonies in Africa]]. 

Alternatively, Afro-Portuguese may also refer to various populations of Portuguese descent, to various degrees, living throughout Africa, often speaking [[African Portuguese|Portuguese]] or [[Portuguese creole]], the [[Luso-Africans]] or [[Portuguese Africans]], often also adopting Portuguese cultural norms, from which the Black Portuguese population in Portugal often derive.

== History ==

Black Portuguese citizens are descendants or migrants issuing from the former [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese African colonies]], ([[Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Cape Verde]] and [[Mozambique]]), even if residual numbers originate in other [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries. The colonies were abolished in 1951, transformed into overseas provinces by the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime and became integral parts of Portugal.

These communities arrived in Portugal after the independence of the African overseas provinces, in 1974–75, mainly after the Portuguese economic growth of the second half of the 1980s. They should not be confused with the population, overwhelmingly [[White people|white]] [[Europe]]ans born in Portugal, that "returned" from the same colonies immediately after their independence, the so-called [[History of Portugal (1974-1986)#The retornados|''retornados'']] — Portuguese settlers and descendants of Portuguese settlers born in former African colonies who relocated to Portugal after independence and in second half of the 1980s.

According to the Portuguese Foreigners and Borders Services, in 2006, this is the breakdown of Africans legally in Portugal:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sef.pt/portal/v10/PT/aspx/estatisticas/index.aspx?id_linha=4224&amp;menu_position=4142#0 Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras, ''Estatísticas 2006''.]&lt;/ref&gt; (see table)

The [[Portuguese nationality law]] privileges ''[[Jus sanguinis]]'' and a sizable number of Black-Africans in Portugal maintained their respective nationality of origin. Even if the nationality law of 1959 was based on the principle of ''[[Jus soli]]'', the changes made in 1975 and 1981 changed it to a ''Jus sanguinis'' law after the independence of the African provinces, which denied [[naturalization]] not only to first generation migrants, but also to their children and grandchildren. Still this legislation had special clauses: Portuguese nationality was granted to citizens proceeding from Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and East Timor, as well as those born under Portuguese administration in [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Macau]] if legally living in Portugal for six years. All other migrants need to live in the country for a period of ten years.

A new 2006 law granted Portuguese nationality to the second generation, if living in Portugal for at least five years. It also removed differences between countries of origin, giving the influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe, most notably Ukrainians. The law was announced in 2005 by Prime minister [[José Sócrates]] and granted Portuguese nationality to children born in Portugal of foreign parents, as he stated:"those children did not spoke another language other than Portuguese and only studied in Portuguese schools, but had nationality denied."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnoticias.net/portuguese/2006/02/mundo/populacao-portugal-lei-amplia-nacionalizacao-de-imigrantes/ População-Portugal: Lei amplia nacionalização de imigrantes]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Francisca Van Dunem]] became the first black Portuguese becoming minister in the Portuguese government.

The arrival of these black Africans in Portugal, coupled with their difficulty in accessing full [[citizenship]], enhanced, from the 1970s onwards, the processes of [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] [[Racism|discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Vala et al. (2002), ''Cultural Differences and hetero-ethnicization in Portugal: the perceptions of black and white people'', Portuguese Journal of Social Sciences, 1(2), pp. 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Vala et al. (1999), ''Expressões dos racismos em Portugal: Perspectivas psicossociológicas'', Lisboa, Instituto de Ciências Sociais.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Vala et al. (1999), ''A construção social da diferença: Racialização e etnicização de minorias'' e ''Racismo subtil e racismo flagrante em Portugal'', in Novos dos racismos: Perspectivas comparativas, Oeiras, Celta.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the result of multiple factors, from institutional and juridical, to socio-cultural (the construction of [[Stereotype|stereotypical ethno-racial differences]]), residential (with the concentration of black migrants in degraded [[ghetto]]s in Lisbon area, although this does not occur elsewhere in the country) and economical (the poorly qualified professional and educational profile of the migrants).&lt;ref&gt;R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">'''Al-Hadi Izz ad-Din''' (1441 - April 18, 1495) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]], who held the [[imamate]] in 1474-1495 in rivalry with other claimants.

Izz ad-Din bin al-Hasan bin Ali was a grandson of the counter-imam [[al-Hadi Ali]] (d. 1432) and a seventh-generation descendant of imam [[al-Hadi Yahya]] (d. 1239).&lt;ref&gt;The filiation was: al-Hadi Yahya - Ali - Muhammad - Jibril - al-Mu'ayyad - al-Hadi Ali - al-Hasan - al-Hadi Izz ad-Din.&lt;/ref&gt; He proclaimed his [[da'wa]] (call for the imamate) in 1474, after the death of the former imam [[al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar]]. He was considered a forceful leader who revived some of the power of the [[Zaydiyyah]] imamate. He was also a man of learning.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VII, Leiden 1993, p. 996.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works were a text about how to prepare for [[afterlife]], and a treatise on [[manumission]] of [[slaves]] as compensation for received injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Brockelmann, ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', Vol. I. Leiden 1943, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he had to contend with a number of other rivals for the title: [[an-Nasir Muhammad bin Yusuf|an-Nasir Muhammad]] (d. 1488), [[Al-Mansur Muhammad, Imam of Yemen|al-Mansur Muhammad]] (d. 1505) and [[al-Mu’ayyad Muhammad]] (d. 1503). At his death, he was buried in Rughafa. He sired eight sons, called [[an-Nasir al-Hasan]], al-Husayn, Ahmad, al-Mahdi, Abdallah, Salah, Abdallah Junior, and Salah Junior.&lt;ref&gt;Imam Zaid bin Ali Cultural Foundation, http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=52 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726201140/http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&amp;page_num=52 |date=2011-07-26 }} (in Arabic).&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, an-Nasir al-Hasan then claimed the imamate.

'''Alice Salomon''' (19 April 1872, [[Berlin]] – 30 August 1948, [[New York City|New York]]) was a German social reformer and pioneer of [[social work]] as an academic discipline.  Her role was so important to German social work that a postage stamp (pictured) was issued 1989 by [[Deutsche Bundespost]] in her memory.  A university, a park and a square in Berlin are all named after her.

==Life and career==
Alice Salomon was the third of eight children, and the second daughter, of Albert and Anna Salomon.  Like many girls from affluent families in this period, she was denied further education, despite her ambition to become a teacher.  This ended in 1893 when she was 21, and she recorded in her autobiography that this was "when her life began".

In 1900 she joined the ''Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine'' ("Federation of German Women's Associations" - BDF hereinafter).  In due course she was elected deputy chairperson, and kept this role until 1920.  (The Chairperson was [[Gertrud Bäumer]]).  The organisation supported destitute, abandoned, or single mothers and aimed to prevent their children being neglected.

From 1902 to 1906 she studied economics at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Berlin, though she had no relevant qualification.  Her publications were sufficient for university entrance.  She earned her doctorate in 1908 with a dissertation entitled ''Die Ursachen der ungleichen Entlohnung von Männer- und Frauenarbeit'' (loosely, "Causes of Pay Inequality Between Men and Women").  Also in this year she founded a ''Soziale Frauenschule'' ("Social Women's School") in Berlin, which was renamed "Alice Salomon School" in 1932 and is now called ''Alice-Salomon-Fachhochschule für Sozialarbeit und Sozialpädagogik Berlin'' ("Alice Salomon College of Further Education for Social Work and Social Sciences of Berlin").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadtteilzeitung-schoeneberg.de/2008/oktober/1htm 100 Jahrfeier]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 she became secretary of the ''Internationalen Frauenbund'' (International Council of Women).  She converted from [[Judaism]] to the [[Lutheran Church]] in 1914.  In 1917 she was made chairperson of the ''Konferenz sozialer Frauenschulen Deutschlands'' ("Conference of German Women's Social Schools") that she herself had founded; by 1919 sixteen schools belonged to it.

In 1920 she resigned from the BDF from fear of [[History of the Jews in Germany#Freedom and repression (1815–1930s)|antisemitic]] propaganda.  Five years later, she founded the ''Deutsche Akademie für soziale und pädagogische Frauenarbeit'' ("German Academy for Women's Social and Educational Work") which was directed by [[Hilde Lion]].  Speakers at this institution included [[Albert Einstein]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[Helene Weber]] and others of similar eminence.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, this organisation published thirteen monographs on the social and economic conditions faced by the poor in Germany.  For Alice Salomon's 60th birthday, she received an honorary doctorate from Berlin University and the Silver State Medal from the Prussian State Ministry.

===Treatment by the Nazis===
[[File:Alice Salomon, deprivation of german citizenship.jpg|thumb|Document of her deprivation of german citizenship from 25 january 1939]]

In 1933 when they acceded to power, the [[Nazi]] party [[Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany|stripped her of all her offices]] and six years later, when she was 65, she faced interrogation by the [[Gestapo]].  The Nazis objected to Salomon's Jewish origins, her Christian humanist ideas, her pacifism and international reputation.  She was expelled from Germany, where she had been running a relief committee for Jewish emigrants.

She went to New York, her German citizenship and her two doctorates having been taken from her.  In 1944 she became an American citizen.  A year later, she was honorary President of the International Women's Federation and the International Association of Schools of Social Work.

She died in New York.

The '''Chaoui people''' or '''''Shawia''''' ({{lang-arq|شاويه}}, {{lang-shy|Išawiyen}}) are a [[Berbers|Berber]] population inhabiting the [[Aurès]], [[Batna Province|Batna]] and [[Khenchla]] [[Oum bwaghi]] [[Biskra]] regions located in and surrounded by the [[Aurès Mountains]]. They also live in the [[Tébessa]] area and other parts of eastern [[Algeria]] coextensive with ancient [[Numidia]], as well as a few adjacent towns in [[Tunisia]]. They call themselves ''Išawiyen''/''Icawiyen'' (pronounced {{IPA-tam|iʃawijən|}}) and speak the [[Shawiya language]].

== History ==
Historically, the [[Aurès Mountains]] served as a refuge for [[Berber people]]s, forming a base of resistance against the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Vandals]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Arabs]]. Aurès was also a district of Algeria that existed during and after the [[Algerian War]] from 1954 to 1962. It was in this region that Berber independence fighters started the war.

[[File:Medghasen.jpg|left | upleft | thumb | [[Madghacen]], the burial of [[Numidia]]s kings]]

The patriarch of Berbers is believed to be ''Madghacen'', common ancestor of the [[Zenata]] and of the Botri as well. [[Ibn Khaldun]] identified the Zenata as Berbers. Modern historians rank this Berber region within the group of [[Numidians]] and [[Gaetuli]] or the much more ancient such as [[Meshwesh]], [[Maesulians]] and Mazaxes, from whom formed the Zenata, the main inhabitants of the Aurès in the [[Middle Ages]]. Chaoui clans known by Ibn Khaldoun were the Ifren, Maghrawa, Djerawa, Abdalwadides, Howara and Awarba.

According to [[William McGuckin de Slane|de Slane]], translator of the books of Ibn Khaldun, the term Chaoui/Shawi means "[[shepherd]]" and designates the [[Zenata|Zenata Berbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANcOAAAAQAAJ|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale|last=Khaldûn|first=ʻAbd al-Raḥman b Muḥammad Ibn|date=|publisher=|year=1856|isbn=|location=|pages=495|language=fr|translator-last=de Slane|translator-first=William McGuckin|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the independence of Algeria, the Chaouis remained localized mainly in the Auresian region. They are the second Berber-speaking group in terms of number of speakers, the first being the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]].

== Language ==
{{main|Shawiya language}}
The Chaoui traditionally speak the [[Shawiya language]] (''Berber:'' Tachawit). It belongs to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family, and is a variety of the [[Zenati languages]].

Shawiya is a closely related cluster of dialects spoken in the Aurès region (''Berber:'' Awras) of eastern Algeria and surrounding areas including [[Batna Province|Batna]], [[Khenchela]], south [[Sétif]], [[Oum El Bouaghi]], [[Souk Ahras]], [[Tébessa]], and the north part of [[Biskra]].

Recently the Shawiya language, together with the [[Kabyle language]], has begun to achieve some cultural prominence due to the Berber cultural and political movements in [[Algeria]].

Chaoui music is a specific style of [[Berber music]]. The Shawia dance is called Rahaba;  men and women dancing at weddings. There are many 20th century singers, such as [[Aïssa Djermouni]], [[Ali Khencheli]], Massinissa, Ishem Boumaraf, Djamel Sabri, Houria Aïchi, etc.

Chaoui painters and sculptors (of whom there are many) include [[Cherif Merzouki]], [[Abdelkhader Houamel]], [[Hassane Amraoui]], [[Adel Abdessemed]], and [[Mohamed Demagh]].

The [[Fantasia (culture)|fantasia]] is a traditional exhibition of horsemanship in the [[Aurès]] performed during cultural festivals.

The Chaoui were featured in Amor Hakkar's 2008 film ''[[La Maison jaune]]''.

'''Cheonmin''', or "vulgar commoners," were the lowest caste of commoners in dynastical Korea. They abounded during the [[Goryeo]] (918–1392) and [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] (1392–1897) periods of Korea's agrarian bureaucracy.

==Social class system==
Like the [[caste system in India]], this social class was largely hereditary and based on certain professions considered "unclean" by the upper classes. This list of unclean professions included butchers, [[Shamanism#Korea|shamans]], shoemakers, metalworkers, prostitutes, magicians, sorcerers, jail-keepers, and performers (like the ''kisaeng'').  [[Nobi]] (slaves), were servants taken from the cheonmin class to serve [[yangban]] (aristocracy) and royalty, but like slaves, they were considered the property of their owners and could be given away to other high-ranking people.

[[Kisaeng]], female entertainers for yangban, were in this class, educated but not respected by others in society. The hereditary nature of the caste system bred institutionalized discrimination and prejudice early on in Korea's history, as the cheonmin were barred from most forms of social advancement, including entry into government service or taking the [[gwageo]] civil service examinations.

The cheonmin, although a step above the traditional caste of untouchables or outcasts called the [[Baekjeong]], lived segregated lives, like the baekjeong, isolated from the rest of society and shunted away in ghettoes far away from the rest of society.  While the cheonmin performed tasks that other Koreans considered unclean or undignified, they still had an essential function and role within dynastical Korean society.  Their work as butchers, shoemakers, low-class entertainers, performing unclean jobs, provided services to the other classes that were unavailable from anyone else.

==Legacy==
While the class and caste system of dynastical Korea no longer exists and has largely disappeared in the modern era, remnants of such social discrimination based solely on one's occupation or a forebearer's previous line of work continue to shape traditional Korean thinking and values today.

==Exception==
In all the history of the Joseon Dynasty there are only a few extraordinary examples of a cheonmin who overcame their class status.

'''Choi Suk Bin''' gained the highest rank, just under the Queen, and became a Royal [[concubine]]. Choi Suk Bin, mother of [[King Yeongjo]], who originally entered the Palace as a ''musori'' or slave-girl.  Due to his mother's low origins, Yeongjo suffered multiple attempts to his life when he was named Crown prince over his half brother. Although he was adopted by [[Queen Inwon]] and under her protection, many nobles were against a low-born son ruling the country as king.

'''[[Jang Geum]]''' (fl. early 16th century; [[Korean name#Family names|family name]] Seo), originally an [[Uinyeo]] of the cheonmin class, became the first female Royal Physician in [[Korean history]]. 
According to the ''[[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]]'' [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] recognized Jang Geum's medical knowledge and entrusted her the royal care of all royal family members. [[King Jungjung]] therefore, promoted Jang Geum to become the third highest-ranking officer in the Court, and was granted the use of ''Dae ''({{Ko-hhrm|대|大|Dae|Tae}}) (which means "great" in Korean) before her first name.

'''Chinese Nicaraguan''' ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 尼加拉瓜华人 [[Pinyin]]: ''níjiālāguā huá rén'' Spanish: '''{{lang-es|sino-nicaragüenses}}''') are [[Nicaraguans]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[ancestry]] who immigrated to or born in [[Nicaragua]]. They are part of the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese diaspora]].

Chinese people first arrived in Nicaragua's Caribbean coast in the latter part of the 19th century, and most of them settled in cities such as [[Bluefields]], [[El Bluff]], [[Laguna de Perlas]], and [[Puerto Cabezas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Orient |last=Bolívar Juárez |title=Bluefields, rostro de Nicaragua frente al Caribe |date= |publisher= |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/octubre/25/literaria/ensayos/ |work=La Prensa |pages= |accessdate=2007-03-26 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206101445/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/octubre/25/literaria/ensayos/ |archivedate=2007-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese immigrants dominated the commerce of the main coastal towns on the Caribbean coast prior to 1879.

==History==
The [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] were thought to have arrived in [[Nicaragua]] in the late 19th century, the majority of which came from China's [[Guangdong|Guǎngdōng]] (广东) province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvsde.org.ni/web_textos/BVSDE/INIFOM/CD02/Caracterizaciones/Raas/LaCruzdeRioGrande.htmL www.bvsde.org.ni] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526045930/http://www.bvsde.org.ni/web_textos/BVSDE/INIFOM/CD02/Caracterizaciones/Raas/LaCruzdeRioGrande.htmL |date=May 26, 2007 }} Los Chinos, ¶-2&lt;/ref&gt; This supposition remained unsubstantiated until the second [[census]] (in 1920) revealed that 400 citizens of Chinese [[nationality]] lived in Nicaragua. According to documents, the population of [[Puerto Cabezas]] in the [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte|R.A.A.N.]] [[Departments of Nicaragua|department]] was formed not only by the [[Miskito people|Miskito]]s, but by communities of [[Jamaica]]ns, [[Germans]] and also Chinese in 1925.&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; Also, the community of Chinese immigrants in [[Bluefields]] was thought to be the largest in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leonardi| first = Richard | authorlink = | title = Nicaragua Handbook: The Travel Guide| publisher = Footprint Travel Guides| year = 2001| pages = 248| doi = | isbn = 1-903471-14-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Chinese consul came to Nicaragua in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerardo |last=Vargas |title=La Asociación China Nicaragüense celebra Año del Cerdo de Fuego |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2007/feb/20/china.htm |work=Bolsa de Noicias |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-17 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006112618/http://www.grupoese.com.ni/2007/feb/20/china.htm |archivedate=2007-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Chinese in Nicaragua committed themselves to the [[commerce]] industry and opened [[business]]es.&lt;ref name="PC"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mayra | last=Pardillo Gómez | title=Los primeros chinos en Nicaragua | date=2005-04-10 | publisher= | url =http://www.argenpress.info/notaold.asp?num=024528 | work =ARGENPRESS | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = Spanish }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also dedicated themselves to the [[candy]], [[soap]], and [[clothing]] [[industries]]. They dominated the commerce of the main coastal towns on the Caribbean coast prior to 1979.

==Immigration==
[[File:California Gold Rush handbill.jpg|thumb|left|A California Gold Rush handbill listing Nicaragua as a shortcut]]
Although information about when the Chinese first arrived in Nicaragua is scarce, Fernando Centeno Chiong, a Nicaraguan historian, journalist and university professor of Chinese descent, published an article in [[La Prensa (Managua)|La Prensa]] about the presence of the Chinese. Chiong wrote that there are some references that exist stating that the Chinese first arrived in Nicaragua in the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;{{cite news|first=Fernando |last=Centeno Chiong |title=Sobre la presencia de los chinos en Nicaragua |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/cgi-bin/print.pl?id=opinion-20041010-05 |work=La Prensa |pages= |accessdate=2007-06-25 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927023205/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/cgi-bin/print.pl?id=opinion-20041010-05 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably during the [[California Gold Rush]], in which people from all over the world traveled to [[California]] to [[Mining|mine]] for [[gold]], tens of thousands of whom travelled by [[steamboat]]s operated by the [[Accessory Transit Company]], whose director was  Commodore [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenberg, Amy S. |title=Manifest manhood and the Antebellum American empire |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-521-84096-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steamboats' course went up the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]], a site that had been proposed for the [[Nicaragua Canal]], Chiong wrote:

{{Quotation|''"...It is possible that between the thousands of passengers who made that passage there were Chinese citizens who remained in Nicaragua, attracted by the natural beauty and the hospitality of a country that continues maintaining those same characteristics to the immigrants of different nationalities that have already made Nicaragua their second mother country."''|Fernando Centeno Chiong&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;}}

During that time, there were restrictions that prohibited the entrance of Asian citizens in the country,&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; in spite of which, many of them defied the prohibition and settled in what is thought to have been the first Chinese presence in the [[Americas]], perhaps before the arrival of these citizens to [[Peru]] or [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;

Shortly after [[World War II]], which began in 1939 and ended in 1945, large quantities of Chinese began arriving in Nicaragua, but during the 1979 [[Sandinista]] [[revolution]], many fled to nearby [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Nicaragua: International Religious Freedom Report; Section I.

===Migration to the Pacific Coast===

The Chinese had begun heading to the Pacific side of [[Nicaragua]] and therefore started to settle in the cities of [[Managua]], [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], [[Leon, Nicaragua|Leon]], and [[Masaya]] at the end of the 19th century. The majority of them were men, many of whom converted to [[Christianity]], and married Nicaraguan women,&lt;ref name="PC"/&gt; introducing the country to last names such as: Lau, Sujo, Chang, Cheng, Siu, Law, Quant, Chow, Chiong, Kuan, Wong, Samqui, Saint and Loyman, all of which represent the [[Kinship|descendants]] of the first immigrants.&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt; It is approximated that the [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] are descendants of 15 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Embajada de la República de China (Taiwán) en Nicaragua|date=|publisher=|url=http://www.roc-taiwan.org.ni/about.htm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-03-26|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319201730/http://www.roc-taiwan.org.ni/about.htm|archivedate=2007-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there are an estimated 7,000 people who speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Languages of Nicaragua | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=NI | work =Ethnologue | pages = | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clubs and associations==

===Chinese Club and the Chinese Nicaraguan Association===
The first club founded for Chinese Nicaraguans, ''Club Chino'' (Chinese Club), was conformed in the [[Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur|South Atlantic region]] on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. It wasn't until the 1940s that the club expanded into the capital city of [[Managua]], after which the ''Asociación China Nicaragüense'' ([[Chinese Nicaraguan Association]]) was founded and became one of the most active and important associations of Nicaragua, due to the great [[economic]] power that the Chinese represented in the nation.&lt;ref name="LPC"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michell |last=Wong Valle |title=Comunidad China celebra día nacional |date= |publisher= |url=http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/octubre/10/revista/revista-20031010-02.html |work=La Prensa |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-17 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823050458/http://www-ni.laprensa.com.ni/archivo/2003/octubre/10/revista/revista-20031010-02.html |archivedate=2007-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Nicaraguan Association after the Sandinista revolution===
During the [[FSLN|Sandinista revolution]], many Chinese Nicaraguans [[emigrate]]d to neighboring countries and the United States, causing the association to be inactive for approximately 10 years. That changed, however, in 1992, after some members approached the Chinese ambassador and expressed to him the importance to celebrate the [[Republic of China]]'s [[National Day of the Republic of China|Double Tenth Day]] (双十节).&lt;ref name="LPC"/&gt;

Other active clubs/associations include the Club de Jóvenes Chinos de Nicaragua (Club of Chinese Teens of Nicaragua).

'''The Cooperative Correspondence Club (CCC)''' was a group of approximately twenty-four women, living all over the United Kingdom, who wrote to each other in the form of a private [[correspondence magazine]] from 1936 to 1990. 

== Origin ==
The CCC began in 1935 after one woman, writing under the pen name [[Ubiquitous|Ubique]], wrote the following cry for help into the motherhood magazine the ''[[Nursery World]]''.   “Can any mother help me? I live a very lonely life as I have no near neighbours.   I cannot afford to buy a wireless . . . I get so down and depressed after the children are in bed and I am alone in the house . . . Can any reader suggest an occupation that will intrigue me and exclude "thinking" and cost nothing!   A hard problem I admit."  

Mothers from all over the country replied to Ubique’s letter, expressing that they too were struggling with similar feelings of boredom and loneliness.  The women suggested that, as a way to combat this, they write to one another. So many women replied that they decided to write in the form of a correspondence magazine so that everyone could be included.

== Background ==
At the time that the women of the CCC came together, [[marriage bars]] were in place which meant that women in public service jobs were no longer legally allowed to work once they were married.  Alongside this was enormous societal pressure for women to be in the home and to spend their time working hard to be “ideal” housewives and mothers. &lt;ref&gt; Beddoe, Deidre. Back to Home and Duty: Women Between the Wars 1918-1939. (London: Pandora, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Strict housekeeping and childrearing regimes were the norm.  &lt;ref&gt; Lewis, Jane. Women in England 1879-1950: Sexual Divisions and Social Change. (Brighton: Wheatsheaf Book Ltd, 1984) &lt;/ref&gt;  Typical days were filled by maintaining the household and religiously following the rules outlined by the childrearing expert of the time, [[Truby King]], &lt;ref&gt; Dally, Ann.  Inventing Motherhood: The Consequences of an Ideal. (London: The Hutchinson Publishing Group, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; whose practices are seen as quite severe in modern times. 

This was also a difficult time for middle class women in the UK because they were the first generation who chose to move away from their family homes to start their married life. &lt;ref&gt; White, Cynthia. Women’s Magazines 1693-1968. (London: Michael Joseph Ltd., 1970.) &lt;/ref&gt; Although this was their preference, it meant that the women did not have their mothers or grandmothers near them (as previous generations had) so they had limited support with raising their families.  All of these circumstances resulted in many well educated, bright women, like those in the CCC, who were relegated to the home feeling generally dissatisfied and lacking intellectual stimulation and adult companionship.

== CCC Magazine ==
=== Distribution and Circulation ===
When they got together in 1935, every member of the CCC agreed to write an article, fortnightly, using a nom de plume, and mail it to the editor, who would compile all of the contributions and hand-stitch them together in a decorative linen cover.   There was only one copy of each edition of the magazine.  The editor would mail the completed magazine to the first woman on a pre-arranged list, who had a set amount of time to read it and to respond to the articles by commenting directly on the pages.  That member would forward it on to the next woman, and so on, until every person had received the magazine.  

The same group of women did this twice a month for 54 years until only seven of the women were still writing.  Throughout this entire time, the women fiercely upheld the rule that the magazine would be written exclusively for, and read exclusively by, the members of the club.

=== Membership ===
The one commonality amongst the women in the CCC was that they were all mothers. Other than that, they were a diverse group of women.  In fact, diversity was a requirement for new members to the club because the magazine was intended to be a place to discuss and debate, and the women wanted members who would be able to challenge one another and teach each other about different lifestyles and ideas.  The club therefore consisted of soldiers’ wives and [[conscientious objector|conscientious objectors’]] wives, liberals, conservatives and communists, women of different faiths, communities, and educational backgrounds.  

The women also ranged across the middle class, with some of the women coming from working-class families and at least one member whose family considered themselves a part of the aristocracy.  As a further example of how keen they were to bring in different types of women, in 1938, after some women in the group made [[anti-Semitic]] remarks, they specifically recruited a [[Jewish]] woman to join the club.

=== Pseudonyms === 
Every woman in the CCC chose a pen name when they joined the group.  These names did not hide the women’s identities because they all had to know each other’s real names in order to send the magazine along in the post.  However, it was a way for the women to represent themselves in the magazine.  Elektra ([[Rose Hacker]]), for example, chose her pen name because she “was madly in love with her father.”  Cotton Goods chose her pseudonym because she was from Lancashire and all of her family was in the cotton industry.  The CCC also included the writer [[Elaine Morgan (writer)]].

&lt;!--This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Cameroon]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.--&gt;

The '''demographic profile of Cameroon''' is complex for a country of its population.  [[Cameroon]] comprises an estimated 250 distinct [[ethnic groups]], which may be formed into five large regional-cultural divisions:
* '''western highlanders''' ('''[[Semi-Bantu]]''' or '''grassfielders'''), including the [[Bamileke]], [[Bamum people|Bamum]] (or ''Bamoun''), and many smaller [[Tikar]] groups in the [[Northwest Province, Cameroon|Northwest]] (est. 38% of total population);
* '''coastal tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Bassa people (Cameroon)|Bassa]], [[Duala people|Duala]] (or ''Douala''), and many smaller groups in the [[Southwest Province, Cameroon|Southwest]] (12%);
* '''southern tropical forest peoples''', including the [[Beti-Pahuin]], Bulu (a subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), Fang (subgroup of Beti-Pahuin), [[Maka people|Maka]], [[Njem]], and [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] [[pygmy|pygmies]] (18%);
* '''predominantly [[Islam]]ic peoples''' of the northern semi-arid regions (the [[Sahel]]) and central highlands, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] ({{lang-fr|Peul}} or ''Peuhl''; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) (14%); ''and''
* '''the "[[Kirdi]]"''', non-Islamic or recently Islamic peoples of the northern desert and central highlands (18%).

The Cameroon government held two national censuses during the country's first 44 years as an independent country, in 1976 and again in 1987.  Results from the second head count were never published.  A third census, expected to take years to produce results, began on November 11, 2005, with a three-week interviewing phase.  It is one of a series of projects and reforms required by the [[International Monetary Fund]] as prerequisites for foreign [[debt relief]]. The first results were published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slmp-550-104.slc.westdc.net/~stat54/nada/index.php/catalog/58 Cameroon - Third General Census of Population and Housing 2005 - IPUMS Subset] ([http://slmp-550-104.slc.westdc.net/~stat54/nada/index.php/catalog/58/download/571 download first findings "Rapport de presentation des résultats définitifs" - pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
According to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Cameroon}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 4 466 000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 40.6%, 55.9% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.5% was 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Languages of Cameroon}}

There are 24 major African language groups in Cameroon; additionally, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are official languages. [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] is also widely spoken.

Peoples concentrated in the Southwest and Northwest Provinces—around [[Buea]] and [[Bamenda]]—use standard [[English language|English]] and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]], as well as their local languages. In the three northern provinces—[[Adamawa Province|Adamawa]], [[North Province, Cameroon|North]], and [[Far North Province|Far North]]—either [[French language|French]] or [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] (the language of the [[Fula people|Fulani]]) is widely spoken. Elsewhere, French is the principal second language, although pidgin and some local languages such as [[Ewondo language|Ewondo]], the dialect of a Beti clan from the [[Yaoundé]] area, have a wide currency.

Indigenous languages of Cameroon include:
*[[Basaa language|Basaa]]
*[[Bikya language|Bikya]]
*[[Bung language|Bung]]
*[[Kanuri language|Kanuri]]
*[[Ngumba language|Ngumba]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2784">The '''Dictionary Society of North America''' ('''DSNA''') was founded in 1975 to encourage scholarly and professional activities that have to do with [[dictionaries]] and [[lexicography]].&lt;ref&gt;R. R. K. Hartmann and Gregory James, ''Dictionary of Lexicography'' (London: Routledge, 2002), 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, DSNA has been a member of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]].

The society, one of the largest professional associations for dictionary-makers,&lt;ref&gt;Erin McKean, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/magazine/lexicographer.html "On Language"], ''[[The New York Times]],'' November 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; has more than 400 members and sponsors a biennial conference for the presentation of scholarly papers on aspects of lexicographical history, theory and practice. It also publishes an annual journal of dictionary scholarship, ''Dictionaries'' (founded in 1979; accessible online through [[Project Muse]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionaries'' succeeded ''Papers of the Dictionary Society of North America'', which appeared in 1979, 1981 and 1983. Occasional publications of the society include ''Papers on Lexicography in Honor of Warren N. Cordell'' (1979) and J. E. and Elizabeth C. Congleton, ''Johnson's Dictionary: Bibliographical Survey, 1746–1984'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; and a semiannual newsletter. Copies of the newsletter and tables of contents of the journal are archived at the society's web page (see link below), which also provides news about dictionaries and membership and conference information.

Distinguished former members of the society include [[Frederic G. Cassidy]] (1907–2000), editor of the ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'', [[Allen Walker Read]] (1906–2002), [[Clarence L. Barnhart]] (1900-1993),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/25/arts/an-ear-for-the-english-of-the-english.html "An Ear for the English of the English"], ''The New York Times'', May 25, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Urdang]] (1927–2008), [[Ladislav Zgusta]] (1924–2004) and [[Richard W. Bailey]] (1939–2011).

From 1995 until 2008, the society made an annual award underwritten by [[Laurence Urdang]], to support promising lexicographical research projects. Two awards for 2009 were conferred in his memory.

Michael Adams has prepared a history of the early years of the society; the first of two installments appeared in volume 35 of ''Dictionaries'' (2014), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–35: "The Dictionary Society of North America: A History of the Early Years (Part I)".

'''Filipinos in Ireland''' consist largely of [[migrant worker]]s in the [[health care]] sector, though others work in [[tourism in Ireland|tourism]] and [[information technology]]. From just 500 individuals in 1999, they had grown to a population of 11,500 by 2007, a 2200% expansion in just eight years.&lt;ref name="Embassy"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.philembassy-uk.org/default.asp?iId=KHEHL |title=Profile of the Filipino community in Ireland |publisher=Philippine Embassy |publication-place=London |accessdate=2008-10-12 |date=2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113204420/http://www.philembassy-uk.org/default.asp?iId=KHEHL |archivedate=2009-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These nurses form the largest category of non-[[European Union]] workers in the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="IT"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2002/0415/1017357765593.html |title=Filipino workers here seek visa reform |periodical=The Irish Times |date=15 April 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Census 2011, there are 12,791 people of Filipino origin living in the state.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CD707&amp;PLanguage=0|title=Filipino population usually resident in the state |publisher=CSO |accessdate=2013-05-18 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
Ireland began targeting the Philippines for recruitment of nurses in the late 1990s. From 2000 onwards, the Philippines was targeted as a major reservoir of nursing labour, and Ireland quickly became a major destination for Filipino nurses. By 2002 Ireland was the third largest importer of Filipino nurses, after Saudi Arabia and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Yeates |first=Nicola |title=Changing Places: Ireland in the International Division of Reproductive Labour |url=http://www.dcu.ie/imrstr/firstissue/yeats.shtml |journal=Translocations: The Irish Migration, Race and Social Transformation Review |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=Autumn 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, 3,831 Filipinos worked as nurses in Ireland, making them the largest group of foreign nurses, roughly one-fifth larger than [[India]]ns, the next largest group. Because of the high cost of obtaining a [[work permit]], Filipino nurses earned a net of 30% less than market-rate wages (after paying for the permit) during their first year on the job.&lt;ref name="Yeates"&gt;{{citation|last=Yeates|first=Nicola|chapter=Here to Stay? Migrant Health Care Workers in Ireland|pages=66–73|title=The International Migration of Health Care Workers|editor-last=O'Connell|editor-first=John|publisher=Routledge|date=2008|isbn=978-0-415-95623-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though workers from non-[[European Union]] countries could bring their spouses with them into Ireland, the spouses were barred from taking up employment. Filipinos, in conjunction with a variety of NGOs, began efforts to have this policy changed as early as 2002. The government altered the policy in February 2004&amp;mdash;largely with the intent of retaining Filipino nurses, whom it was feared would otherwise migrate to other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or [[Australia]], which allowed spouses to work.&lt;ref name="IT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeates"/&gt; However, that same year, an amendment to  [[Constitution of Ireland|the constitution]] limited the scope of ''[[jus soli]]'', thus excluding the children of migrant workers from automatic citizenship; the League of Filipino Nurses took its first public political position in response to the amendment, calling it "discriminatory and racist" in an 8 June 2004 statement.&lt;ref name="Yeates"/&gt;

In addition to nurses, roughly 2,000 Filipinos worked as [[caregiver]]s in [[elderly care]] homes as of 2006; the Irish government offers training programmes enabling them to become nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland pushes new policies to benefit Filipino caregivers |periodical=Philippine Headline News |url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/hl/hl104096.htm |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines opened an embassy in [[Dublin]] in July 2009, but closed it three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.philembassydublin.ie/Presentation_of_Credentials.htm |title=First Philippine resident ambassador to Ireland presents credentials to President Mary McAleese |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-05-14 |publisher=Embassy of the Philippines |publication-place=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130617074151/http://philembassydublin.ie/ Notice re Embassy closure beginning 16 July 2012] (archived from [http://www.philembassydublin.ie/ the original] on 2013-06-17).&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines is now represented in Ireland solely by an honorary consul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippineconsulate.ie/index.php/appointment-of-mark-christopher-congdon-as-honorary-consul-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-for-ireland/|title=Appointment of Mark Christopher Congdon, As Honorary Consul Of the Republic of the Philippines for Ireland.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forum for Stable Currencies''' is a [[Advocacy#Advocacy groups|political advocacy group]] in the [[United Kingdom]] seeking [[economic democracy]] through freedom from [[national debt]]. Founded in 1998, the group is a [[non-governmental organization]] without governmental funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = HC Paper 355 House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts: Reaching an International Agreement on Climate Change | publisher = The Stationery Office | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-215-52156-0 | page = 129 | quote = As a non-funded NGO, the Forum for Stable Currencies....}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' reported that the forum was "attracting leading figures from the world of small business and across the political spectrum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  The strange rebirth of a forgotten idea | last = Boyle | first = David | date = 2003-03-04 | work = New Statesman | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200304070021 | accessdate = 2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006's ''Market, Schmarket: Building the Post-capitalist Economy'' refers to the efforts of the Forum to "democratize the process of money creation" as "sterling work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cato | first = Molly Scott | title = Market, Schmarket: Building the Post-capitalist Economy | publisher = New Clarion Press | year = 2006 | page = 195 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=11qTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Forum+for+Stable+Currencies%22&amp;dq=%22Forum+for+Stable+Currencies%22&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1998, [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley]], motivated by his opposition to [[usury]], and Sabine K McNeill, a [[mathematician]] and [[system analyst]], created the Forum for Stable Currencies at the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=McFall&gt;{{cite book |author=House of Commons Treasury Committee |title=Climate Change and the Stern Review: The Implications for Treasury Policy, Fourth Report of Session 2007-08, Report, Together with Formal Minutes, Oral and Written Evidence |publisher=The Stationery Office |year=2008 |isbn=0-215-51341-X |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the outcome of contacts with the Christian Council for Monetary Justice and organising the Campaign for Interest-Free Money through weekly meetings at the Global Internet Cafe near [[Piccadilly, London]]. McNeill had started the first [[Local Exchange Trading System]] in London in 1989 and organised Forum meetings mainly at the House of Lords, but also at the House of Commons under the auspices of [[Austin Mitchell]] MP. There, on behalf of the Forum, Austin Mitchell MP tabled [[Early Day Motions]] relating to [[public credit]]. The first submission to the Treasury Select Committee was entitled "''Green Credit for Green Purposes''".&lt;ref name=McFall/&gt;

The Forum has hosted notable speakers, including [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]] who on June, 2001 delivered a speech before the Forum at the House of Lords detailing the advantages of economic reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Legum | first = Margaret | title = It Doesn't Have to be Like this: Global Economics : a New Way Forward | edition = revised | publisher = Wild Goose Publications | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-901557-76-6 | page = 107 | quote = The advantages of such reform were given in a paper by Joseph Huber to the Forum for Stable Currencies at the House of Lords in London in June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] who in February 2008 spoke at St. James's Church, London Piccadilly. Other speakers have included [[James Gibb Stuart]], [[Bernard Lietaer]], [[Margrit Kennedy]], [[Michael Rowbotham]], and [[Stephen Zarlenga]].

Among issues of concern to the Forum is the "skimming", or overcharging of fees, by banks, which ''[[Corporate Watch]]'' cites the Forum as estimating to be the cause of 50% of bankruptcies in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=2872 | work = Originally published in Newsletter 33 | title = Ten years, ten corporations: the corporate crime awards | accessdate = 2009-02-26 | publisher = Corporate Watch }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent political initiative of the Forum are two on-line petitions targeted at the Treasury Select Committee titled ''Stop the Cash Crumble to Equalize the Credit Crunch'' and ''Financial Fairness for Voters and Taxpayers, please!'' The corresponding article ''Public Cash for the Real Economy, The ultimate request, by on-line petition'' was published by the Journal ''Accountancy Business and the Public Interest''.&lt;ref name="visar"&gt;[http://visar.csustan.edu/aaba/McNeill2009.pdf Accountancy Business and the Public Interest, Vol. 8, No.1. 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}}

In 2009, the Forum's [[Early Day Motion]] addressed the ''Enforcement of the [[Bank of England Act 1694]]'' which was written with the intention not to oppress Their Majesties' subjects.

==History==
In 1912 the French colonial authorities in Morocco introduced the French language to the country, making it the language of government administration, educational instruction, and the media; therefore [[Classical Arabic]] was only used for traditional activities and religious services. The French government had intended for the French culture and the French language to be viewed as "civilization and advancement".&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt; In 1956 Morocco declared independence, and in the government declared Classical Arabic as the official language. In the early 1960s the Moroccan government began the [[Arabization]] process.&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt; After independence, to facilitate economic growth and to increase its ties to Europe, the Moroccan government decided to strengthen its ties with France, resulting in the promotion of French. By 2005 Morocco engaged in economic liberalisation and privatization; Ennaji said that these activities, in many sectors, reinforced the usage of French.&lt;ref name=Ennaji163/&gt;

As of 2014 75% of [[Facebook]] users in Morocco post in French.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.arabsocialmediareport.com/UserManagement/PDF/ASMR6_En_Final.pdf Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616050604/http://www.arabsocialmediareport.com/UserManagement/PDF/ASMR6_En_Final.pdf |date=2015-06-16 }}" (6th Edition). [[Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government]]. June 2014. p. 31 Retrieved on June 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and purpose==
French is mainly used in administration, banking, commerce, education, and industry. Rouchdy said that within Morocco, French "is the vehicle of science, technology, and modern culture."&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt; Rouchdy further explained that the language had been "maintained for instrumental purposes and for building contacts with the West in general."&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt; The French language became entrenched in various aspects of Moroccan society, including education, government, the media, and the private sector due to the French colonial authority enacting a policy to spread the French language throughout Morocco during the colonial era.&lt;ref name=Rouchdy73/&gt; As of 2005, trade with [[France]] makes up over 75% of Morocco's international trade. Moha Ennaji, author of ''Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco'', said "[i]n this context, one can understand the important status of French, whose colonial connotations have been erased or at least drastically reduced by independence."&lt;ref name=Ennaji163&gt;{{cite book|author=Moha Ennaji|title=Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6sBlam4eJcC&amp;pg=PA163|date=5 December 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-23980-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moroccans learn the French language at school. Secondary school graduates tend to achieve French fluency, and many Moroccans become fluent in French in addition to [[Moroccan Arabic]] and use French as their second language. Most Moroccans who are bilingual in French and Arabic live in urban areas where they have strong contact with the French language and where there are high literacy rates. Many Moroccans learn French to conduct business with French tourists; gain access to information, science, and technology; and to attend French-speaking educational facilities. Ennaji said that Moroccans learn French for educational, pragmatic, and sociocultural reasons.&lt;ref name=Ennaji127&gt;{{cite book|author=Moha Ennaji|title=Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXsF7fT318QC&amp;pg=PA127|date=20 January 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-23979-8|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ennaji said "The degree of mastery of French depends on the bilingual's level of education and socio-economic background, for the higher the level of education and the wealthier the family background, the bigger the frequency of speaking French and the more frequent the alternative use of French and Moroccan Arabic by a bilingual. These factors determine the bilingual's ability to choose one or the other language in a particular speech situation."&lt;ref name=Ennaji127/&gt;

Abdelâli Bentahila, the author of the 1983 book ''[[Language Attitudes among Arabic–French Bilinguals in Morocco]]'', said that Moroccans who were bilingual in both French and Arabic commonly spoke French when discussing matters related to reading, while at a pharmacy, while discussing matters with a doctor or employer, and while discussing scientific and technical topics.&lt;ref name=Stevens73&gt;Stevens, Paul B. "[http://jls.sagepub.com/content/4/1/73.citation Language Attitudes among Arabic-French Bilinguals in Morocco]." (book review) ''[[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]]''. 1985 4:73. p.&amp;nbsp;73-76. DOI: 10.1177/0261927X8500400107. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, French has connotations of formality; Ennaji said that Moroccans tended to use French while discussing matters at work or at school,&lt;ref name=Ennaji127/&gt; and therefore French is commonly spoken in offices and schools.&lt;ref name=Ennaji162163&gt;{{cite book|author=Moha Ennaji|title=Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6sBlam4eJcC&amp;pg=PA162|date=5 December 2005|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-23980-4|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the other party in a conversation is French educated, Moroccans often speak in French or a mixture of Moroccan Arabic and French.&lt;ref name=Ennaji127/&gt; French has a prestigious status in Moroccan society, so many bilingual Moroccans mix French and Moroccan Arabic in conversation or use French words in informal Moroccan Arabic conversations.&lt;ref name=Ennaji127/&gt; According to Ennaji, in writing bilingual Moroccans only use French, and bilingual Moroccans tend to discuss scientific and technical topics only in French.&lt;ref name=Ennaji127/&gt;

Rouchdy said "The predominance of French implies that the chances of strengthening the place of Classical Arabic are reduced."&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt;

==Attitudes toward French==
Despite the legacy of colonialism, according to Rouchdy, "French is still widely appreciated by both the ruling elite and the general public."&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt; Ennaji said "most Moroccans know that Standard Arabic does not meet all their societal needs and that a [[European language]] is necessary for the transfer of ideas and technology, and for communication with the world at large, even if this European language is none but the ex-coloniser's language."&lt;ref name=Ennaji163/&gt; Rouchdy added that Classical/Modern Arabic and French are constantly in conflict with one another, but that most Moroccans believe that the bilingualism of Classical Arabic and French is the most optimal choice to allow for Morocco's development.&lt;ref name=Rouchdy71/&gt;

==French in art==
Within academic arts, French is the main language used. Academic art discourse had been conducted in French within a five decade period until 2010. Reviews of artwork and art journal articles mostly were published in French, while some newspaper coverage of gallery exhibits was in Arabic. French is the main language of art museums in Morocco. The [[Oudaya Museum]], the national art museum, has object histories only in French, while many object labels are in Arabic and French. Moroccans imagined the audiences of museums and artwork as mostly Francophone. 
Katarzyna Pieprzak, author of ''Imagined Museums: Art and Modernity in Postcolonial Morocco'', said that the "modernist or academic visual art is a language that was learned in art schools in Europe."&lt;ref name=Pieprzakxxvii&gt;Pieprzak, Katarzyna. ''Imagined Museums: Art and Modernity in Postcolonial Morocco''. [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2010. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oUXx3Iz_v3QC&amp;pg=PR28&amp;lpg=PR28&amp;dq=%22French%22+%22a+Lingua+Franca%22+Morocco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3_blK-_tYD&amp;sig=8cjRIy5w1dwBEybw-1SP2kxXVSk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t4J8UOKCNJG08ATu4ICIBg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22French%22%20%22a%20Lingua%20Franca%22%20Morocco&amp;f=false xxvii] (Introduction). Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on October 15, 2012. {{ISBN|0816665184}}, 9780816665181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieprzak concluded that "the use of French reflects a desire to be heard and to participate in a Western-controlled international art sphere and market" and that "French continues to serve as a lingua franca that unites Moroccan artists not only to Europe but also to Francophone Africa."&lt;ref name=Pieprzakxxvii/&gt;

'''Health care in Australia''' is delivered as a mixed system: universal health care (public) and private providers (insurance).  The majority of Australia's health care is provided publicly (hospitals and primary health care eg General Practitioners) with the remaining provided by the private sector (private hospitals, allied health care such as physiotherapy and dental).

[[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] is [[Australia]]'s [[universal health care|universal health insurance scheme]], which is the primary health scheme that subsidises most medical costs in Australia for all Australian citizens and permanent residents. A number of other schemes cover the medical costs in specific circumstances, such as for veterans or indigenous Australians, motor vehicle insurance, and workers' compensation  schemes, besides others. The current Medicare levy, paid by Australians who earn over a certain income is 2%.  Those that earn more are expected to pay an additional surcharge if they do not have private health insurance (Medicare Levy Surcharge).

Medical costs of visitors to Australia may be covered by travel insurance or under a reciprocal health agreement. In addition, people who are not covered by the Medicare scheme or wish to be covered for out-of-pocket medical or hospital costs can take out voluntary private health insurance, which is also subsidised by the federal government. In addition to Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] funded by the federal government which considerably subsidises a range of prescription medications.

Medicare is financed by a [[Medicare levy]], which is compulsory and administered through the tax system. The federal [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]], currently [[Greg Hunt]], administers national health policy, and [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments administer elements of health care within their jurisdictions, such as the operation of hospitals. The funding model for health care in Australia has seen [[Polarization (politics)|political polarisation]], with governments being crucial in shaping national health care policy.&lt;ref name="shcp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Solving the Health Care Problem: How Other Nations Have Succeeded and Why The United States Has Not |last=Behan |first=Pamela |year=2007 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0791468380 |page=53 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AlYrSPKHCwC |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
[[File:Australia Healthcare Cost Comparison.PNG|thumb|right|Healthcare cost comparison between Australia and other developed nations]]
In 2005/2006 Australia had (on average) 1 doctor per 322 people and 1 hospital bed per 244 people.&lt;ref name=Britannica2009&gt;{{cite book|title=2009 Book of the Year|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc|year=2009|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|chapter=Britannica World Data, Australia|pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the 2011 Australian Census 70,200 medical practitioners (including doctors and specialist medical practitioners) and 257,200 nurses were recorded as currently working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features20April+2013#p2 |title=Doctors and Nurses |date=24 July 2013 |work=4102.0 – Australian Social Trends, April 2013 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=4 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recorded data showing a rate of 374 medical practitioners per 100,000 population. The same study reported a rate of 1,124 nurses and midwives per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960840881|title=Comparative health systems : a global perspective|others=Johnson, James A., 1954-, Stoskopf, Carleen H.

Along with many countries around the world, there is a shortage of health professionals in Australia despite growth in the health workforce in previous years. From the years 2006-2011 the health workforce employment rate increased by 22.1%, which is reflected in the increase from 956,150 to 1,167,633.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a sample of 13 developed countries, Australia was eighth in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in 2009 and also in 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross-border comparison of medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of health Economics|title=International Comparison of Medicines Usage: Quantitative Analysis|url=http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/library/industry/Documents/meds_usage.pdf|publisher=Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's health-expenditure–to–GDP ratio (~9.5%) in 2011–12 was slightly above average compared with other [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129547594|title=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's [[universal health care]] system is primarily funded by [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], a financing system which funds a large part of the cost of health services, including those in public hospitals. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% [[Medicare levy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629085049/http://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/ |archivedate=29 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (with exceptions for low-income earners), with any shortfall being met by the government from general revenue.

The amount paid by Medicare includes:

# patients may be entitled to other concessions or benefits&lt;ref name=thres&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/services/msn/thresholds.jsp Thresholds and Concession Calculated Amounts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529075247/http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/services/msn/thresholds.jsp |date=29 May 2008 }}. Medicare Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;
# patients may be entitled to further benefits once they have crossed a so-called safety net threshold, based on total health expenditure for the year.&lt;ref name=thres /&gt;

Government expenditure on health care is about 67% of the total, below the OECD average of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Britnell|first1=Mark|title=In Search of the Perfect Health System|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49661-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of health costs (called [[out-of-pocket cost]]s or the [[copayment]]) are paid by the patient, unless the provider of the service chooses to use [[bulk billing]], charging only the scheduled fee, leaving the patient with no out of pocket costs. Where a particular service is not covered, such as [[dentistry]], [[optometry]], and [[ambulance]] transport,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/claims/what-cover.jsp#N1006D Examples of Services Not Covered by Medicare]. Medicare Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; patients must pay the full amount, unless they hold a Health Care card, which may entitle them to subsidised access. Services not covered by Medicare may be covered, in whole or in part, by health insurance.

==Health insurance==
An additional levy of up to 1.5% is imposed on high-income earners without [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]]. Individuals can take out health insurance to cover out-of-pocket costs, with either a plan that covers just selected services, to a full coverage plan. In practice, a person with health insurance may still be left with out-of-pocket payments, as services in private hospitals often cost more than the insurance payment.

The government encourages individuals with income above a set level to privately insure. This is done by charging these (higher income) individuals a [[Medicare Levy Surcharge|surcharge]] of 1% to 1.5% of income if they do not take out [[Health insurance#Australia|health insurance]], and a means-tested rebate. This is to encourage individuals who are perceived as able to afford private insurance not to resort to the public health system,&lt;ref name="mls"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm |title=Medicare Levy Surcharge |publisher=Private Health Insurance Ombudsman |accessdate=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though people with valid private health insurance may still elect to use the public system if they wish.

Funding of the health system in Australia is a combination of government funding and private health insurance. Government funding is through the [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] scheme, which subsidizes out-of-hospital medical treatment and funds free [[universal access]] to hospital treatment. Medicare is funded by a 2% tax [[Medicare levy|levy]] on taxpayers with incomes above a threshold amount, with an extra 1% levy on high-income earners without private health insurance, and the balance being provided by the government from general revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/healthsystem-overview-3-funding#medicarelevy | title = The Australian Health Care System: The national health care funding system | accessdate = 20 January 2011 | date = 4 February 2005 | work = The Medicare Levy | publisher = Australian Department of Health and Aging}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare is only 9% of Australia's GDP.

Health insurance funds private health and is provided by a number of health insurance organizations, called health funds. The largest health fund with a 30% market share is [[Medibank]]. Medibank was set up to provide competition to private "for-profit" health funds. Although government-owned, the fund has operated as a [[government business enterprise]] since 2009, operating as a fully commercialized business paying tax and dividends under the same regulatory regime as do all other registered private health funds. Highly regulated regarding the premiums it can set, the fund was designed to put pressure on other health funds to keep premiums at a reasonable level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition plans to sell Medibank Private|url=http://www.abc.net.au/insidebusiness/content/2010/s2825785.htm|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hazard&gt;{{cite news|last=Reece|first=Nicholas|title=Hanging on to Medibank is a national health hazard|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/hanging-on-to-medibank-is-a-national-health-hazard-20130215-2eim2.html|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] [[Howard Government]] had announced that Medibank would be sold in a [[public float]] if it won the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]],&lt;ref name="efo"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/election-fight-over-2b-medibank-plan/story-e6frf7l6-1111112202312 |title=Election fight over $2b Medibank plan |author=Ben Packham |accessdate=29 June 2013 |date=13 September 2006 |newspaper=The Herald Sun |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; however they were defeated by the [[Australian Labor Party]] under [[Kevin Rudd]] which had already pledged that it would remain in [[Public ownership|government ownership]]. The Coalition under [[Tony Abbott]] made the same pledge to privatize Medibank if it won the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]] but was again defeated by Labor. Privatisation was again a Coalition policy for the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]], which the Coalition won. However, the public perception that privatization would lead to reduced services and increased costs makes privatizing Medibank a "political hard sell."&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt;

Australian health funds can be either 'for profit' including [[Bupa]] and [[nib Health Funds|nib]]; [[mutual insurance|'mutual']] including [[Australian Unity]]; or [[non-profit organization|'non-profit']] including [[GMHBA Limited|GMHBA]], [[HCF Health Insurance]] and [[CBHS Health Fund]]. Some have membership restricted to particular groups, some focus on specific regions – like HBF which centres on [[Western Australia]], but the majority have open membership as set out in the PHIAC annual report.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|title=Private Health Insurance Administration Council, Annual Report 2009-10|publisher=Private Health Insurance Administration Council|accessdate=18 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321173818/http://phiac.gov.au/resources/file/PHIAC%20Annual%20Report%202009-10%20WEB.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership to most of these funds is also accessible using a comparison websites or the decision assistance sites. These sites operate on a commission-basis agreement with their participating health funds and allow consumers to compare policies before joining online.

Most aspects of health insurance in Australia are regulated by the ''Private Health Insurance Act 2007''. Complaints and reporting of the health industry is carried out by an independent government agency, the [[Private Health Insurance Ombudsman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phio.org.au Private Health Insurance Ombudsman (PHIO)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ombudsman publishes an annual report that outlines the number and nature of complaints per health fund compared to their market share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phio.org.au/publications/publications/annual-reports.aspx PHIO's Annual Reports]&lt;/ref&gt;

The private health system in Australia operates on a "community rating" basis, whereby premiums do not vary solely because of a person's previous [[medical history]], current state of health, or (generally speaking) their age (but see Lifetime Health Cover below).&lt;ref name="health.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/health-privatehealth-consumers-glossary.htm Private Health Insurance in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;  Balancing this are waiting periods, in particular for pre-existing conditions (usually referred to within the industry as PEA, which stands for "pre-existing ailment").  Funds are entitled to impose a waiting period of up to 12 months on benefits for any medical condition the signs and symptoms of which existed during the six months ending on the day the person first took out insurance.  They are also entitled to impose a 12-month waiting period for benefits for treatment relating to an obstetric condition, and a 2-month waiting period for all other benefits when a person first takes out private insurance.&lt;ref name="health.gov.au"/&gt;

Funds have the discretion to reduce or remove such waiting periods in individual cases.  They are also free not to impose them, to begin with, but this would place such a fund at risk of "[[adverse selection]]", attracting a disproportionate number of members from other funds, or from the pool of intending members who might otherwise have joined other funds.  It would also attract people with existing [[medical conditions]], who might not otherwise have taken out insurance at all because of the denial of benefits for 12 months due to the PEA Rule.  The benefits paid out for these conditions would create pressure on premiums for all the fund's members, causing some to drop their membership, which would lead to further rises, and a vicious cycle would ensue.

There are a number of other matters about which funds are not permitted to discriminate between members in terms of premiums, benefits or membership – these include racial origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, nature of employment, and leisure activities. Premiums for a fund's product that is sold in more than one state can vary from state to state, but not within the same state.

The Australian government has introduced a number of incentives to encourage adults to take out [[private hospital]] insurance.  These include:

* Lifetime Health Cover: If a person has not taken out private hospital cover by 1 July after their 31st birthday, then when (and if) they do so after this time, their premiums must include a loading of 2% per annum. Thus, a person taking out private cover for the first time at age 40 will pay a 20% loading. The loading continues for 10 years. The loading applies only to premiums for hospital cover, not to ancillary (extras) cover.
* Medicare Levy Surcharge: People whose [[taxable income]] is greater than a specified amount (in the 2011/12 financial year $80,000 for singles and $168,000 for couples&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm Medicare Levy Surcharge]. Private Health Insurance Ombudsmen. Retrieved on 10 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) and who do not have an adequate level of private hospital cover must pay a 1% surcharge on top of the standard 1.5% Medicare Levy.  The rationale is that if the people in this income group are forced to pay more money one way or another, most would choose to purchase hospital insurance with it, with the possibility of a benefit in the event that they need private hospital treatment – rather than pay it in the form of extra tax as well as having to meet their own private hospital costs.
** The Australian government announced in May 2008 that it proposes to increase the thresholds to $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for families.  These changes require legislative approval. A bill to change the law was introduced but was not passed by the Senate. A changed version was passed on 16 October 2008. There have been criticisms that the changes will cause many people to drop their private health insurance, causing a further burden on the public hospital system, and a rise in premiums for those who stay with the private system. Other commentators believe the effect will be minimal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/12/2332647.htm Medicare levy surcharge effect 'trivial': inquiry] ABC News. 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Private Health Insurance Rebate:  The government subsidizes the premiums for all health insurance cover, including hospital and ancillary (extras), by 10%, 20% or 30%. In May 2009, The Rudd Labor government announced that as of June 2010, the rebate would become means-tested and offered on a sliding scale.

==Programs and bodies==

===Federal initiatives===
[[File:StateLibQld 2 161967 Young girl being vaccinated at Brisbane, 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Diphtheria]] immunization in Brisbane, 1940]]
[[Medicare Australia]] is responsible for administering Medicare, which provides subsidies for health services. It is primarily concerned with the payment of doctors and nursing staff, and the financing of state-run hospitals.

The [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] provides subsidized medications to patients. The level of subsidy depends on the above-noted tests. Low-income earners may receive a card that entitles the holder to cheaper medicines under the PBS. A [[National Immunisation Program Schedule]] that provides many immunizations free of charge by the federal government, the [[Australian Organ Donor Register]], a national register which registers those who elect to be organ donors. Registration is voluntary in Australia and is commonly recorded on a [[driver's license]] or [[proof of age]] card are also managed by the federal government.

The [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] is the regulatory body for medicines and [[medical device]]s in Australia. At the borders, the [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] is responsible for maintaining a favorable health status by minimising risk from goods and people entering the country.

The [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] (AIHW) is Australia's national agency for health and welfare statistics and information. Its biennial publication ''Australia's Health'' is a key national information resource in the area of health care. The Institute publishes over 140 reports each year on various aspects of Australia's health and welfare.  The [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] and [[Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency]] also play a role in protecting and improving the health of Australians.&lt;ref name="iph"/&gt;

===State programmes===

'''Public Hospitals'''
Each state is responsible for the operation of public hospitals.

'''Healthcare Initiatives'''
State based projects are regularly set up to target specific problems such as [[breast cancer]] screening programs, indigenous youth health programs or school [[Dental public health|dental health]].

===Non-government organisations===
The [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] collects [[blood donation]]s and provides them to Australian Healthcare Providers. Other health services such as [[medical imaging]] ([[MRI]] and so on) are often provided by private corporations, but patients can still claim from the government if they are covered by the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) funds competitive health and medical research, and develops statements on policy issues.&lt;ref name="iph"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Public Health |last=Louise Fleming |first=Mary |author2=Elizabeth Anne Parker |year=2011 |publisher=Elsevier Australia |isbn=072954091X |pages=16–17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fm7jyLh0yzUC |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workforce===
In a report published by HealthWorkforce Australia in March 2012, a shortage of nearly 3,000 doctors, over 100,000 nurses and more than 80,000 registered nurses was predicted in the year 2025. In the conclusion of the report, the HWA explains: "For nurses, given the size of the projected workforce shortages presented in this report, HWA will conduct an economic analysis to quantify the cost to allow an assessment of the relative affordability of the modelled scenarios to close the projected gap." Governments, Higher Education and Training, Professions and Employers are also identified as key players in the process of addressing future challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Workforce 2025 Doctors, Nurses and Midwives – Volume 1|url=http://www.hwa.gov.au/sites/uploads/health-workforce-2025-volume-1.pdf|work=HealthWorkforce Australia|publisher=Health Workforce 2025 – Doctors, Nurses and Midwives|accessdate=15 April 2014|date=March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521003131/http://www.hwa.gov.au/sites/uploads/health-workforce-2025-volume-1.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of care===
In an international comparative study of the health care systems in six countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United
States), found that "Australia ranks highest on healthy lives, scoring first or second on all of the indicators", although its overall ranking in the study was below the UK and Germany systems, tied  with New Zealand's and above those of Canada and far above the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/1027_Davis_mirror_mirror_inte\ rnational_update_final.pdf Figure 2.

A global study of end of life care, conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, part of the group which publishes ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, published the compared end of life care, gave the highest ratings to Australia and the UK out of the 40 countries studied, the two country's systems receiving a rating of 7.9 out of 10 in an analysis of access to services, quality of care and public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-10634371 UK comes top on end of life care – report]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aging Population ===
Australia's life expectancy is approximately 83 years, however 10 of these years are expected to include an increase in disability from a chronic disease. The increase in chronic diseases are a contributor of higher healthcare costs overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Bruce K.|date=5 November 2007|title=Challenges in health and health care for Australia|url=https://www.mja.com.au/system/files/issues/187_09_051107/arm11047_fm.pdf|journal=Medical Journal of Australia|volume=187|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the older generation shows an increased need for health services, and utilizes services frequently. From the years 1973 to 2013 the total number of people 65 or older tripled, increasing from 1.1 million to 3.3. As for the population of 85 and older there was an increase from 73,100 to 439,600. In order for the Australian health care system to handle the gradual population aging, government and administration must develop new policies and programs to accommodate the needs of changing demographics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Rural and remote health care===
{{Further|Rural health care in Australia}}

Health care services, their availability and the health outcomes of those who live in rural and remote parts of Australia can differ greatly from metropolitan areas. In recent reports, the [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] noted that "compared with those in Major Cities, people in regional and remote areas were less likely to report very good or excellent health", with life expectancy decreasing with increasing remoteness: "[c]ompared with Major Cities, the life expectancy in regional areas is 1–2 years lower and in remote areas is up to 7 years lower." It was also noted that [[Aboriginal Australian]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples experienced worse health than non-Indigenous Australians.

===Electronic health records===
The [[Australian Government]] has a policy to development a lifetime electronic health record for all its citizens. PCEHR—the [[Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record]]—is the major national EHR initiative in Australia, being delivered through territory, state, and federal governments. This electronic health record was initially deployed in July 2012, and is under active development and extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = My Health Record | url = http://www.ehealth.gov.au | work = Australian Digital Health Agency | date = 2018-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now called "My Health Record".

MediConnect is an earlier program that provides an electronic medication record to keep track of patient prescriptions and provide stakeholders with drug alerts to avoid errors in prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Mason | first = Moya K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=What Can We Learn from the Rest of the World? A Look at International Electronic Health Record Best Practices|year=2005|url=http://www.moyak.com/papers/best-practices-ehr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Australia, there is a not-for-profit organisation called [[Standards Australia]], which has created an electronic health website relating to information not only about Australia and what is currently going on about EHRs but also globally.  There is a large number of key stakeholders that contribute to the process of integrating EHRs within Australia, they range from each States Departments of Health to Universities around Australia and [http://www.nehta.gov.au/ National E-Health Transition Authority] to name a few.The name of PCEHR has changed to My Health Record since 2015 with opt-out model. Australian government budgeted around $485million for this system which potentially could save nearly 5,000 lives per year when functional state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (AMSANT) | date = 2016 | title = My Health Record launched | url = http://www.amsant.org.au/my-health-record-launched/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-health.standards.org.au/ABOUTIT014/Stakeholders.aspx |title=Stakeholders |publisher=E-health.standards.org.au |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standards.org.au/OurOrganisation/AboutUs/Pages/default.aspx |title=About Us |publisher=Standards.org.au |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-health.standards.org.au/Home.aspx |title=Home |publisher=E-health.standards.org.au |date=2013-08-30 |access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security and privacy concerns have been raised. Originally, participation of the system was to opt-in by each person giving consent, however due to low participation rates, participation without consent become the default option and each person must opt-out to be excluded from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=My Health Record opt-out debate is getting silly but government is at fault |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-health-record-opt-out-debate-is-getting-silly-but-government-is-at-fault/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each person has three months, or until October 2018 to opt-out. There are 13,000 health providers involved from specialists and general practice doctors to pharmacies.  Incidents of [[Internet fraud|scamming]], [[phishing]] and [[Cyber Crime|website security breach]] have occurred. As of July 2018 the My Health Records development budget is estimated to be AU$2 billion.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The '''International Naturist Federation''' ('''INF''') or '''Fédération naturiste internationale''' ('''FNI''') or '''Internationalen Naturisten Föderation''' ('''INF''') is the global umbrella organisation representing official national [[naturist]] societies.

==Membership==
The INF is made up of representatives of national [[naturism|naturist]] organisations. The rules of the federation limit membership to one national society. To by-pass this rule, the French and English-speaking Canadian societies formed a partnership for the purpose of participating in the INF.

Some federations have independent [[youth organisation]]s which are currently not affiliated to the INF directly. On European level, youth representatives (European Naturist Youth – ENY) have elected a Youth committee to speak towards the INF and the European Naturist Assembly (EuNat). Its task is to coordinate events and promote communication and exchange between young naturists.

The rules of INF provide for direct [[wiktionary:Membership|membership]] in the INF if there is no affiliated national naturist organisation in the country of residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inf-fni.org/userfiles/files/Statutes%20E.pdf Statutes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704002107/http://www.inf-fni.org/userfiles/files/Statutes%20E.pdf |date=4 July 2009 }}, article 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katoch''' is a [[Rajput clan]]  of the [[Chandravanshi]] lineage. Their traditional area of residence was in the [[Trigarta Kingdom]], based at [[Jalandhar]]&lt;ref name="Brentnall"&gt;{{citation |last=Brentnall |first=Mark |title=The Princely and Noble Families of the Former Indian Empire: Himachal Pradesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayYbAvECXQwC |year=2005 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-163-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Kangra Fort]].

== Etymology ==
There are two possible origins for the word ''Katoch''. Members of the clan say it comes from the words ''Kat'' (army) and ''uch'' (upper class)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Singh|editor-first=Kumar Suresh |editor-link=Kumar Suresh Singh |author=Anthropological Survey of India |authorlink=Anthropological Survey of India |title=India's Communities |volume=5 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19563-354-2 |page=1613 |year=1998 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=g9MVAQAAMAAJ |quote=KATOCH They derive their nomenclature from the word Kat (army) and uch (upper class)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other sources say that it comes from ''kot'' (fort). The [[Kangra fort]] was known as Nagarkot or Kot Kangra, and since the administrators/rulers resided within that particular ''kot'' they were vernacularly called "Kot'ch" or कोटच, which means ''those within the fort''.&lt;ref name="Kot'ch"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeratha|first1=Aśoka|title=Forts and Palaces of the Western Himalaya|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173871047|page=20|edition=2000|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l2oZiyOqReoC|quote=The Kangra fort is situated at a peculiar strategical situation overlooking deep furrows leading to wide spanned stream. The fort, now in ruins, once commanded respect among the hill chieftains... It was popularly known as Nagarkot or Kot Kangra. Kot denotes a fort and Nagar denotes a town, so collectively it meant the fort of the town. The clan who ruled Kot Kangra was named Katoch after Kot. In fact, this fort was so peculiar in its situation and formidable features that it became a unique structure among the prevailing forts. So the clan ruling this fort was known as Katoch.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This over time became Katoch.

== History ==
[[File:View from top of Kangra Fort overlooking river.jpg|thumb|right|The strategic [[Kangra fort]] commanded the respect of the region.&lt;ref name="Kot'ch"/&gt;]]
The main branch of the Katoch clan were the rulers of the [[Kangra State]], which was, by some accounts, the most prominent kingdom between the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and [[Sutlej River|Sutlej]] in the pre-modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Prasad |first=Shankar |title=The Gallant Dogras: An Illustrated History of the Dogra Regiment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wxsgt6_0TYC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2005 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-81-7062-268-0 |pages=16,&amp;nbsp;21,&amp;nbsp;34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;{{citation |last=Parry |first=Jonathan P. |title=Caste and Kinship in Kangra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MabdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-54585-6|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kangra State was also known as ''Trigadh'', a name derived from the ancient [[Trigarta Kingdom]] mentioned in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Chakrabarti |first1=Dilip K. |last2=Hasan |first2=S. Jamal |title=The antiquities of Kangra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsC1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |year=1984 |publisher=Munshiran Manoharlal |p=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition holds that the Katoch were the rulers of Kangra from the times of ''Mahabharata'' till the pre-independence era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeratha|first1=Aśoka|title=Forts and Palaces of the Western Himalaya|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173871047|page=Preface|edition=2000|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l2oZiyOqReoC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They defeated the army of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] which was not able to fight in the hills. Nearly all his 10,000 soldiers perished in 1333 AD and he was forced to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Chandra, Satish (1997). Medieval India: From Sultanate to the Mughals. New Delhi, India: Har-Anand Publications. pp. 101–102. {{ISBN|978-8124105221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-modern period, the hill states of the modern Himachal Pradesh are said to have constantly warred with each other, despite relations of kinship and intermarriage. Then they were brought under the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] suzerainty by the emperor [[Akbar]]. The Mughal control was limited, however. The rulers of the states retained a fair degree of independence. Emperor [[Jahangir]] captured the Kangra fort in 1610, annexing the surrounding area and reducing the Katoch rajas to the status of vassals.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;

After the decline of the Mughal power, Raja Ghamand Chand (r.&amp;nbsp;1751–1823) recovered most of the territory earlier ceded to the Mughals. Raja Sansar Chand (r.&amp;nbsp;1775–1823) established the supremacy of Kangra over all the surrounding hill states. During his reign, Kangra became a major centre for the arts and several palaces were built.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;

In the year 1805, the neighbouring hill states rebelled, with the aid of the [[Gurkha]] army. Raja Sansar Chand was forced to seek the help of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] of Lahore. The Gurkha army was expelled but Ranjit Singh also annexed the most fertile party of the Kangra valley, reducing the Katochs of Kangra as well as the neighbouring rajas to the status of vassals. After the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1846, the whole area was ceded to the British [[East India Company]], eventually integrated into the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]]. The Katochs and the surrounding hill rajas were assigned small ''jagirs'' over which they had the rights of revenue and magisterial authority.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;

== Clans and surnames ==
The Katoch clan one of the 14 ruling clans of the eastern-Punjab region in the medieval times. The other major clans are Jaswal, [[Guleria]], Sibaia and Dadwal and Pathania. &lt;ref name="charak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Charak|first1=Sukh Dev Singh|title=History and culture of Himalayan states Himachal Pradesh Volume I|publisher=Light &amp; Life Publishers |page=17|year=1978|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3btDw4S2FmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dadwal stems from Dada, a place in Siba. Sibaia also stems from Siba. [[Guleria]] stems from Guler region. The four branches came into existence after the 11th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeratha|first1=Ashok|title=Dogra Legends of Art &amp; Culture|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173870828|page=22|edition=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katochs suffixed 'Chandra' to their names until the rise of the Sikh dynasty in Punjab, after which some clan members started suffixing 'Singh' also. However, most clan members today, including in the sub-clans, suffix Chand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeratha|first1=Ashok|title=Dogra Legends of Art &amp; Culture|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173870828|page=22|quote=These rajput clans suffixed their family names after their proper names for instance Katoch rajas suffixed Chandra. Chambials suffixed Varman, Suketias suffixed Sen while as Jaswal and Sibials suffixed Chand.|edition=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the reforms of 1930s, the Katoch women were only married westward, generally to the Pathania and Jamwal/Jamuwal men. The higher the sub-clan rated its own status, the farther away towards the west they tended to marry. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parry |first1=Jonathan P. |title=Caste and Kinship in Kangra |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781-1-3654-585-6|page=220 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MabdAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regions ruled by the clan ==

In past centuries, the clan and its branches ruled several [[princely state]]s in the region of Trigarta. Trigarta refers to the land between three rivers, namely, Beas, Sutlej, and Ravi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeratha|first1=Asoka|title=Forts and Palaces of the Western Himalaya|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173871047|page=21|edition=2000|quote=Trigarta, meaning land of three rivers. The three rivers referred are the Ravi, the Beas, and the Sutlej|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l2oZiyOqReoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the clan lost lands and by the 17th century had been reduced to a small hill state. The originator of the clan was [[Rajanaka Bhumi Chand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Charak|first1=Sukh Dev Singh|title=History and Culture of Himalayan States, Vol. 1|pages=134-136|edition=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rulers include [[Sansar Chand]] II and [[Rajanaka Bhumi Chand]], the latter being the founder of the [[Jwalamukhi temple]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]].

There are significant [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese Maronite Christian]] communities that reside in Belgium, many of whom are descendants of traders who settled during the 19th century. The majority of them live in major cities, such as [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]]. Many them are involved in the trade of [[diamonds]] in the [[Antwerp diamond district|diamond district]] of Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/23/diamond-gems-trade-antwerp-belgium Recession takes the sparkle out of Antwerp's diamond quarter | World news].

      <comment>I removed the reference that discussed endogamous relationships among the Lemba to directly state in the bullet that this is not unique to Judaism. I added a citation for the claim that the Lemba originated in Yemen. I added a section on the South African Lemba. I also added another reference to the Lemba being represented in media.</comment>

The '''Lemba''', '''wa-Remba''', or '''''Mwenye'''''&lt;ref name=Parfitt2002&gt;Parfitt, Tudor. (2002), "The Lemba: An African Judaising Tribe", in ''Judaising Movements: Studies in the Margins of Judaism'', edited by Parfitt, Tudor and Trevisan-Semi, E., London: Routledge Curzon, p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; are a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] [[ethnic group]] native to [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]], with smaller, little-known branches in [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]]. According to [[Tudor Parfitt]], Professor of Oriental and African Studies at the [[University of London]], in 2002 they numbered an estimated 50,000.&lt;ref name=Parfitt2002/&gt; They speak the [[Bantu languages]] spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], which they say were transmitted by oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Magdel"&gt;{{Cite book|author= le Roux, Magdel|title=The Lemba – A Lost Tribe of Israel in Southern Africa?|pages=209–224, 24, 37|publisher=University of South Africa|location=Pretoria|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Lemba" may originate in ''chilemba'', a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for turbans worn by some Bantu peoples, or ''lembi,'' a Bantu word meaning "non-African" or "respected foreigner".&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRkpQAmnL8oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;dq=lemba+halakhic#v=onepage&amp;q=lemba%20halakhic&amp;f=false|title=Community and Conscience: the Jews in Apartheid South Africa|last=Shimoni|first=Gideon|publisher=[[Brandeis University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=1-58465-329-9|location=United States of America|page=178|accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magdel le Roux says that the name ''VaRemba'' may be translated as "the people who refuse" – probably in the context of "not eating with others" (according to one of her interviewees).&lt;ref name="Magdel"/&gt; In Zimbabwe and South Africa, the people prefer the name ''Mwenye.''&lt;ref name=Parfitt2002/&gt;

Since the late twentieth century, there has been increased media and scholarly attention to the Lemba's claim of [[African Jews|common descent]] to the [[Jew|Jewish people]].&lt;ref name="Parfitt, Tudor 2000"&gt;Parfitt, Tudor (1993/2000)'' Journey to the Vanished City: the Search for a Lost Tribe of Israel,'' New York: Random House (2nd edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt(2002), "The Lemba", p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wuriga"&gt;[http://www.kulanu.org/newsletters/1999-summer.pdf Wuriga, Rabson (1999) "The Story of a Lemba Philosopher and His People"], ''Kulanu'' 6(2): pp.1,11–12]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516182541/http://www.kulanu.org/newsletters/1999-summer.pdf |date=16 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic [[Y-DNA]] analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population.&lt;ref name="SpurdleJenkins"&gt;{{Citation | title = The origins of the Lemba "Black Jews" of southern Africa: evidence from p12F2 and other Y-chromosome markers. | pmid = 8900243 | pmc=1914832 | volume=59 | date=November 1996 | journal=Am.

== Religion ==
Most Lemba are members of Christian churches, with some Muslims in Zimbabwe. [[Edith Bruder]] wrote that "from a theological point of view, the Lemba’s customs and rituals reveal religious pluralism and interdependence of these various practices" and see membership of these religions "in cultural rather than religious terms. These apparently religious identities do not prevent them from declaring themselves Jews through religious practice and ethnic identification."&lt;ref name="Bruder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruder|first1=Edith|title=The Black Jews of Africa: History, Religion, Identity|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195333565|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHBjAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=lemba+Christianity+Islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eHNw9MO5u5&amp;sig=szFHpwCKKdl2EzngWmYqB8w3mHY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo-8qB7qHSAhXoJcAKHdB4BB4Q6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=lemba%20Christianity%20Islam&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parfitt wrote that “Those Lemba, who perceive themselves as ethnically Jewish, find no contradiction in regularly attending a Christian Church. By and large the Lemba who are most stridently ‘Jewish' are often those with the closest Christian attachments."&lt;ref name=Parfitt2002/&gt;

==Jewish or Arab links==
In the period in which [[Yemenite Jews|Jews were settled in southern Arabia]], they were proselytising, and they attracted converts from around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=Parfitt2002/&gt; Many pre-modern Lemba beliefs and practices can be linked to Judaism, and some are also common to Islam. [[Ebrahim Moosa]] wrote that "Historians of religion have found among the Lemba certain religious and cultural practices which unmistakably resemble Islamic rituals, and there are reflections of Arabic in their language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ebrahim Moosa|editor1-last=Prozesky|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=De Gruchy|editor2-first=John W.|editor1-link=John W. De Gruchy|title=Living Faiths in South Africa|date=1995|publisher=David Philip|isbn=978-0864862532|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8-glmO65Y0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=lemba+Christianity+Islam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w5ovstkwEM&amp;sig=xDXwXwj3fok0-MfmDYaZikHKN9o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO1d2d7qHSAhVnCsAKHdF7CJ04FBDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lemba%20Christianity%20Islam&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rudo Mathivha, a Lemba of South Africa,&lt;ref name="Wuriga"/&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2013}} practices and beliefs related to Judaism include the following:
* They observe [[Shabbat]].
* They praise Nwali (a deity) for looking after the Lemba, and they identify themselves as part of the [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen people]].
* They teach their children to honour their mothers and fathers. (This is common to many ethnicities and religions.)
* They refrain from eating pig and other beasts forbidden by the [[Torah]], and forbid certain combinations of permitted foods.
* They practice ritual animal slaughter and ritual preparation of meat for consumption, a Middle Eastern practice rather than one which is common to African ethnicities.&lt;ref name="parfitt"/&gt;
* They practice male [[circumcision]]; according to Junod's work in 1927,&lt;ref name="Junod"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Junod, H.A.|title=The Life of a South African Tribe, vol. '''I:''' Social Life|pages=72–73, 94|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding tribes regarded the Lemba as the masters and originators of that art.
* Since the late 20th century and due to increased attention to their possible Jewish ancestry, they have placed a [[Star of David]] on their tombstones.
* Lemba are discouraged from marrying non-Lemba, just as Jews and other cultures are discouraged from marrying non-members of their direct community.

According to Magdel le Roux, the Lemba have a rite of sacrifice called the "Pesah", which seems similar to the Jewish ''Pesach'' or [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author= le Roux, Magdel|title=The Lemba – A Lost Tribe of Israel in Southern Africa?|pages=174, 293|publisher=University of South Africa|location=Pretoria|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of these practices and traditions are not exclusively Jewish; they are common to Muslims in the Middle East and Africa, as well as being common to other African tribes and other non-African peoples. In the late 1930s, W. D. Hammond-Tooke wrote a book identifying Lemba practices that are similar to those of Muslims: for instance, their [[Endogamy|endogamous]] marriage practices are also common to Muslims (and many other cultures and ethnic groups), as are certain dietary restrictions. Together with the similarities between many Lemba clan-names and known [[Arabic]] and [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words; e.g., ''Sadiki, Hasane, Hamisi, Haji, Bakeri, Sharifo'' and ''Saidi,'' Hammond-Tooke concluded that the Lemba were descended, at least in part, from Muslim [[Arabs]].&lt;ref name="Tooke"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hammond Tooke, W.D.|title=The Bantu-speaking Peoples of Southern Africa|pages=81–84, 115–116|publisher= Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century the British scholar [[Tudor Parfitt]], an expert on marginal Jewish groups, became involved in researching the Lemba's claims. He helped trace ancestors to Senna, what they believe is an ancestral city located on the [[Arabian peninsula]], in present-day [[Yemen]]. In an interview featured on ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' in 2000, Parfitt said he was struck by the Lemba's maintenance of rituals that seemed Jewish and/or Semitic:
{{quote|The other thing was the extraordinary importance they placed upon ritual slaughter of animals, which is not an African thing at all. Of course, it's Islamic as well as Judaic, but it's certainly from the Middle East, it's not African. And the fact that every lad was given a knife with which he did his ritual throughout his life and took to his grave. That seemed to me to be remarkably, tangibly Semitic Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="parfitt"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/tudor-parfitts-remarkable-quest.html ''Tudor Parfitt' Remarkable Quest''], NOVA, PBS, 22 February 2000, accessed 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lemba traditions and culture==
Their myths of origin generally tell of migrating from the North (which is common to many African ethnicities.)&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt (2002), "The Lemba", pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lemba tradition, their male ancestors were [[Jews]] who left [[Judea]] about 2500 years ago and settled in a place called ''[[Sena, Yemen|Senna]]'' which was located on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (present-day Yemen). Much later, according to Rudo Mathivha, their oral history relates that they migrated into [[Northeast Africa]].&lt;ref name = The_Story_of_the_Lemba_People&gt;[http://www.haruth.com/JewishLemba.html The Story of the Lemba People], Haruth&lt;/ref&gt; After ancestors intermarried with local women and became established in Africa, at some point, the tribe split into two groups, one staying in [[Ethiopia]] and the other travelling farther south, along the east coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Heer-Boswijk|first=A.H.|last2=Schaafsma|first2=H.|date=1970-01-01|title=Book Reviews : Hans Ulrich Bchn, Die Presse in Westafrika, Hamburger Beitrage zur Afrika-Kunde, Band 8.

According to Parfitt, who published a book in 1993 on his findings, Senna was most likely located in [[Yemen]], specifically, in the village of ''[[Sena, Yemen|Sanāw]]'' within the easternmost portion of the [[Hadhramaut]].&lt;ref name="Parfitt, Tudor 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2706israel.html ''Lost Tribes of Israel''], ''NOVA'' Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), 22 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The city has had a Jewish population since ancient times. Since 1948 and the founding of the [[State of Israel]], as well as later wars, the Jews have dwindled to a few hundred. In Lemba tradition, Sena has the semi-mythical status of a sacred city of origin, and is the object of hopes for eventual return.&lt;ref name="PBS1"/&gt;

According to the Lemba oral tradition, their male ancestors migrated to [[Southeast Africa]] in order to obtain gold.&lt;ref name="Tooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanWarmelo"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=van Warmelo, N.J.|title=Zur Sprache und Herkunft der Lemba|journal=Hamburger Beiträge zur Afrika-Kunde|volume=5|year=1966|pages=273, 281–282|publisher=Deutsches Institut für Afrika-Forschung}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ancestors intermarried with local women and became established in Africa, at some point, the tribe split into two groups, one staying in [[Ethiopia]] and the other travelling farther south, along the east coast.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The Lemba claim that this second group settled in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], building what was referred to as another Sena, or "Sena II". Others supposedly settled in [[Malawi]], where their descendants reside today. Some settled in [[Mozambique]], eventually migrating to [[Zimbabwe]] and South Africa. They claim to have constructed [[Great Zimbabwe]], now preserved as a monument. Ken Mufuka, a Zimbabwean archaeologist, thinks that the Lemba may have contributed to this but would not have been solely responsible. Tudor Parfitt and Magdel le Roux think that they at least helped construct the massive city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfitt|first=Tudor|authorlink=Tudor Parfitt|title=Journey to the Vanished City|publisher=Vintage (Random House)|year=2000|location=New York|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=le Roux, Magdel|title=The Lemba – A Lost Tribe of Israel in Southern Africa?|pages=25, 169|publisher=University of South Africa
|location=Pretoria|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(see below). But, most academics of this field agree that the construction of the enclosure at Great Zimbabwe is largely attributable to the ancestors of the [[Shona people|Shona]], who were first to displace the indigenous [[San people]] from the region.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt; Such works were typical of their ancestral civilisations.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zimb/hd_zimb.htm|title=Great Zimbabwe (Eleventh–Fifteenth Centuries) - Essay - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|first=Author: Department of Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the|last=Americas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lemba have [[endogamous]] marriage patterns, discouraging marriage to non-Lemba. Endogamy is common to many groups. [[Norm (sociology)|Normative]] [[Orthodox Judaism]] today recognises only [[matrilineal]] descent as determining Judaism from birth. Patrilineal descent was once the norm among the [[Israelites]], with people being identified as descendants of one of the twelve sons of Israel.

The restrictions on [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] with non-Lemba make it nearly impossible for a male non-Lemba to become a member. Lemba men who marry non-Lemba women are expelled from the community unless the females agree to live according to Lemba traditions. A woman who marries a Lemba man must learn and practice the Lemba religion, dietary rules, and other customs. The woman may not bring any cooking equipment from her previous home. Initially, the woman may have to shave her head. Their children must be brought up as Lemba.&lt;ref name="Wuriga"/&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2013}} If the Lemba had Jewish ancestors, the requirement to shave the head may date to rituals associated with converting the first Lemba women to Judaism, which would have been the way Jewish males acquired women for making families. The genetic MtDNA data of the Lemba (see below) has shown no descent from female Jewish ancestors.

According to Tooke, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Lemba were highly esteemed by surrounding tribes in the Zoutpansberg region of South Africa for their mining and metalwork skills. He wrote in his 1937 book that the other tribes regarded the Lemba as outsiders.&lt;ref name="Tooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VanWarmelo"/&gt; According to articles written during the early 1930s, in the 1920s the Lembas' medical knowledge earned them respect among tribes in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Some Observations on the Relics of Pre-European Culture in Rhodesia and South Africa|author=Trevor, Tudor G.|journal= J.

By contrast, the lead anthropologist in Zimbabwe firmly places them among African peoples, ignoring the DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt (2002), "The Lemba", pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred ngoma===
[[File:Royal Museum for Central Africa Small Drum From Congo.jpg|thumb|Small drum from Congo in the [[Royal Museum for Central Africa]], [[Tervuren]], [[Belgium]]]]

Lemba tradition tells of a sacred object, the ''[[ngoma lungundu]]'' or "drum that thunders", which they brought from the place called Sena. Their oral history claims that the ''ngoma'' was the Biblical [[Ark of the Covenant]] made by [[Moses]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Parfitt, a professor at [[SOAS, University of London]], wrote a book in 2008, ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' about the rediscovery of this object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2008|isbn=978-0007262670|author=Tudor Parfitt|authorlink=Tudor Parfitt|title=The Lost Ark of the Covenant|publisher=Harper Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book was adapted as a television documentary that aired on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], tracing the Lemba's claim that the ''ngoma lungunda'' was the legendary Ark of the Covenant. Following the lead of eighth-century accounts of the Ark in Arabia, Parfitt found a ghost town named [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in the [[Hadhramaut Governorate|Hadhramaut]], an area inhabited by people who are genetically linked to the Lemba.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Time,'' "A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant," Biema, David Van, 02/21/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Parfitt has theorized that the ''ngoma'' was related to the Ark of the Covenant, lost from [[Jerusalem]] after the city's destruction by the [[Babylonia]]n king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 587 BC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He says that the ''ngoma'' is a descendant of the Biblical Ark, theorizing that the Ark was repaired by adding more material to it as the artifact began to wear out or that it was destroyed. He says that the ark/ngoma was carried to Africa by its priestly guardians. Lemba oral history claimed that the Ark exploded 700 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;''ReporterNews,'' "Professor says he found Ark of the Covenant," Hamm, Britinni, 03/13/2008&lt;/ref&gt; and that they rebuilt the Ark on its remains.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Lemba tribe in southern Africa has Jewish roots, genetic tests reveal, 03, 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=World Jewish Congress |url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9096/lemba_tribe_in_southern_africa_has_jewish_roots_genetic_tests_reveal |title=Lemba tribe in southern Africa has Jewish roots, genetic tests reveal |publisher=World Jewish Congress |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parfitt discovered the ''ngoma'' in a [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]] museum in 2007. It had last been exhibited in 1949 by colonial officials in Bulawayo. They took it to Harare for protection during the [[Rhodesian Bush War|struggle for independence]], and it was later misplaced inside the museum.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"Zimbabwe displays 'Ark of Covenant replica'", BBC News, 18 February 2010 accessed 7 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating of a portion of the artifact showed it to be 700 years old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vickers |first=Steve |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8550614.stm |title=Lost Jewish tribe 'found in Zimbabwe' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parfitt said he believed that the ngoma was the oldest wooden artifact in Zimbabwe. In February 2010, the 'Lemba ngoma lungundu' was put on display in the museum, along with a celebration of both its history and the history of the Lemba.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Parfitt says that the ngoma/ark was carried into battles. If it broke apart, it would be rebuilt. The ngoma, he says, was possibly built from the remains of the original Ark. "So it's the closest descendant of the Ark that we know of," Parfitt says. "Many people say that the story is far-fetched, but the oral traditions of the Lemba have been backed up by science", he said.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The ngoma was on display in the Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences, but in 2008  it disappeared, and is widely believed to have been stolen by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe for his personal collection. The story of Parfitt and the ngoma was updated in 2014 in the ZDF documentary "Tudor Parfitt and the Lost Tribe of Israel" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zdf-enterprises.de/en/catalogue/international/zdfefactual/history-biographies/secrets-of-the-bible|title=ZDFE.factual - ZDF Enterprises|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lemba considered the ''ngoma'' as intensely sacred and too holy to be touched. It was carried by poles inserted into rings attached to each side of the ''ngoma''. The only members of the tribe permitted to approach it were the hereditary priesthood who guarded it. Others feared that if they were to touch it, they would be "struck down by the fire of God" which would erupt from the object. The Lemba continue to regard the ngoma as the sacred Ark.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor, ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant,'' Harper Collins Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

==DNA testing==
Early genetic testing supported some Lemba oral traditions related to origin of male ancestors in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt, Tudor and Egorova, Y. (2005) ''Genetics, Mass Media, and Identity: A Case Study of the Genetic Research on the Lemba and Bene Israel'', London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Y-DNA]] genetic study in 1996 of 49 Lemba males suggested that more than 50% of the Lemba Y-chromosomes are West Asian in origin, and shared by both Arabs and Jews.&lt;ref name="SpurdleJenkins"/&gt;

To define the people's origin more specifically, Parfitt and others developed a larger study to compare additional Lemba subjects (for whom clans were recorded) with males from South Arabia and Africa, as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews.&lt;ref name="Parfitt 2002 pp. 47-48"&gt;Parfitt (2002), "The Lemba", pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; They found significant similarities between the markers of the Lemba and men of the [[Ḥaḍramawt]] in Yemen. They also learned that the population in Yemen was relatively recent, so would not have shared common ancestors with those of the Lemba.&lt;ref name="Parfitt 2002 pp. 47-48"/&gt;

A subsequent study in 2000 found that a substantial number of Lemba men carry a particular haplotype of the [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] known as the [[Y-chromosomal Aaron|Cohen modal haplotype]] (CMH), as well as a haplogroup of Y-DNA [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]] found among some Jews, but also in other populations across the Middle East and Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Y Chromosomes Traveling South: The Cohen Modal Haplotype and the Origins of the Lemba — the "Black Jews of Southern Africa"| pmid = 10677325 | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | issue = 2 | volume = 66 | pages = 674–86 | date = 1 February 2000 | doi=10.1086/302749 | pmc=1288118 | last1 = Thomas | first1 = MG | last2 = Parfitt | first2 = T | last3 = Weiss | first3 = DA | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/oct/28/the-genetics-of-jewish-ancestry/ Schindler, Sol.

Among Jews the CMH marker is most prevalent among [[Kohen|Kohanim]], or hereditary priests. As recounted in Lemba oral tradition, the ancestor of the Buba clan "had a leadership role in bringing the Lemba out of Israel" and eventually into Southern Africa.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/israel/familylemba.html "The Lemba, The Black Jews of Southern Africa"], ''NOVA,'' Public Broadcasting System (PBS), November 2000, accessed 26 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic study found that 50% of the males in the Buba clan had the Cohen marker, a proportion higher than found in the general Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Parfitt (2002), "The Lemba", p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; 
More recently, Mendez et al. (2011) observed that a moderately high frequency of the studied Lemba samples carried Y-DNA [[Haplogroup T (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup T]], which is also considered to be of [[Near East]]ern origin. The Lemba T carriers belonged exclusively to T1b, which is rare and was not sampled in indigenous Jews of the [[Near East]] or North Africa. T1b has been observed at low frequencies in [[Ashkenazi Jews]] as well as in a few [[Levant]]ine populations.&lt;ref name = "Mendez2011"&gt;F.L. Mendez ''et al.'', "[http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3378/027.083.0103 Increased Resolution of Y Chromosome Haplogroup T Defines Relationships among Populations of the Near East, Europe, and Africa"], ''BioOne'' Human Biology 83(1):39–53, (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2013 in the ''South African Medical Journal'' studied Y-chromosomes variations in two groups of Lemba, one South African and the other Zimbabwean (the Remba). It concluded, "While it was not possible to trace unequivocally the origins of the non-African Y chromosomes in the Lemba and Remba, this study does not support the earlier claims of their Jewish genetic heritage." The researcher suggested "a stronger link with Middle Eastern populations, probably the result of trade activity in the Indian Ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soodyal|first=H|title=Lemba origins revisited: Tracing the ancestry of Y chromosomes in South African and Zimbabwean Lemba|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2013|volume=103|issue=12|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/samj/article/view/98362|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 article analysing earlier research attempting to trace Jewish ancestry (not just of the Lemba) states: 

{{quote|In conclusion, while the observed distribution of sub-clades of haplotypes at mitochondrial and Y chromosome non-recombinant genomes might be compatible with founder events in recent times at the origin of Jewish groups as Cohenite, Levite, Ashkenazite, the overall substantial polyphyletism as well as their systematic occurrence in non-Jewish groups highlights the lack of support for using them either as markers of Jewish ancestry or Biblical tales.&lt;ref&gt;Tofanelli Sergio, Taglioli Luca, Bertoncini Stefania, Francalacci Paolo, Klyosov Anatole, Pagani Luca, "Mitochondrial and Y chromosome haplotype motifs as diagnostic markers of Jewish ancestry: a reconsideration", ''Frontiers in Genetics '' Volume 5, 2014, [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fgene.2014.00384] DOI=10.3389/fgene.2014.00384&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 2016 publication, [[Himla Soodyall]] and Jennifer G. R Kromberg state that:

{{quote| When blood groups and scrum protein markers were used, the Lemba were indistinguishable from the neighbors among whom they lived; the same was true for mitochondrial DNA which represented the input of females in their gene pool. However, the Y chromosomes, which represented their history through male contributions, showed the link to non-African ancestors. When trying to elucidate the most likely geographic region of origin of the non-African Y chromosomes in the Lemba, the best that could be done was to narrow it to the Middle Eastern region. While no evidence of the extended CMH 11 was found in the higher resolution study, CMH however, was present at a rate of 8.8% being one mutational step away from the extended form.&lt;ref name="Soodyall"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Himla Soodyall|author2=Jennifer G.

==Halakhic status as Jews==
[[Halakha|Halakhic]] [[Who is a Jew?|Jewish status]] in [[Orthodox Judaism]] is determined by documenting an unbroken matrilineal line of descent or by [[conversion to Judaism]]. Jews who adhere to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rabbinism believe that "Jewish status by birth" is passed only by a Jewish female to her children (if she herself is a Jew by birth or by conversion to Judaism) regardless of the Jewish status of the father. Because of the absence of matrilineal Jewish descent for the Lemba, Orthodox or Conservative Judaism would not recognise them as 'Halakhically Jewish.' Lemba would have to complete a formal conversion process to be accepted as Jews.&lt;ref name="virtual"/&gt;

The [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] denominations, &lt;ref name="virtual"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html "Patrilineal descent"], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]], and [[Haymanot|Haymanot Jews]] on the other hand, all recognise patrilineage. As more is learned of widespread people's histories, the Reform branch has acknowledged unusual descent outside the European and indigenous Middle Eastern spheres. Especially since publication of the genetic results of the Lemba, American Jewish communities have reached out to the people, offering assistance, sending books on Judaism and related and study materials, and initiating ties to teach the Lemba about Rabbinic Judaism. So far few Lemba have converted to Rabbinic Judaism.

[[History of the Jews in South Africa|South African Jews]] of European descent have long been aware of the Lemba, but have never accepted them as Jews or thought of them as more than an "intriguing curiosity."&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"/&gt; Generally the Lemba have not been accepted as Jews because of their lack of matrilineal descent. Several [[rabbi]]s and Jewish associations support their recognition as part of the "[[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes of Israel]]".&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"/&gt; In the 2000s, the Lemba Cultural Association approached the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, asking for the Lemba to be recognised as Jews by the Jewish community. The Lemba Association complained that "we like many non-European Jews are simply the victims of racism at the hands of the European Jewish establishment worldwide". They threatened to start a campaign to "protest and ultimately destroy 'Jewish [[apartheid]]'".&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"/&gt;

The Lemba people are known as being from the"lost tribe of Israel" which further separated them during apartheid South Africa due to the religious difference of Judaism not being the "right kind" of difference to establish themselves as a distinct ethnic group requiring separate development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TAMARKIN|first=NOAH|date=2011|title=Religion as Race, Recognition as Democracy: Lemba "Black Jews" in South Africa|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41328571|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=637|pages=148–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lemba Cultural Association face misconceptions about their goals such as the idea that the Lemba identify more with European Judaism, only aim to affiliate with the European Jewry and not other black Jews, and are distanced from South African politics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, while the Lemba do identify with their religious Judaism, many practice Christianity as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Gideon Shimoni in his book, ''Community and Conscience: The Jews in Apartheid South Africa'' (2003): "In terms of ''halakha'' the Lemba are not at all comparable with the [[Falasha]] [of Ethiopia]. As a group they have no conceivable status in Judaism."&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"/&gt;

Rabbi Bernhard of South Africa has stated that the only way for a member of the Lemba tribe to be recognised as a Jew is to undergo the formal Halakhic conversion process. After that, the person "would be welcomed with open arms."&lt;ref name="Shimona2003"/&gt;

==Synagogue==
As of 2015 the Lemba were building their first [[synagogue]] in Mapakomhere, in [[Masvingo District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cengel |first=Katya |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/24/zimbabwes-lemba-build-their-first-synagogue.html |title=Zimbabwe's Lemba Build Their First Synagogue &amp;#124; Al Jazeera America |publisher=America.aljazeera.com |date=2015-05-24 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10572">'''Marriage loans''' ({{lang-de|Ehestandsdarlehen}}, {{IPA-de|ˈeːəʃtantsˌdaʁleːən}}) were part of the promotion of the family in [[Nazi Germany]]. Instituted in 1933, they were offered to newlywed couples in the form of vouchers for household goods, initially on condition that the woman stopped working. Unless the husband's earnings were very low, interest rates on the loans continued to be lower if only he worked; and one quarter of the principal was forgiven for each child.

Marriage loans were created by the "Law for the Reduction of Unemployment" of June 1, 1933.&lt;ref name=Alltag63&gt;Klaus-Jörg Ruhl, ''Brauner Alltag: 1933&amp;ndash;1939 in Deutschland'', Fotografierte Zeitgeschichte, Düsseldorf: Droste, 1981, {{ISBN|978-3-7700-0585-7}}, p. 63 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vokabular161&gt;Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, ''Vokabular des Nationalsozialismus'', Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-11-013379-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jmWOMks6bkC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehestandsdarlehen&amp;f=false p. 161] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nordic race|Aryan]] newylyweds were eligible to receive an interest-free loan of 1,000 [[Reichsmark]]s,&lt;ref name=Alltag63/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grunberger235&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''A Social History of the Third Reich'', London: Weidenfeld, 1971, {{ISBN|9780297002949}}, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of vouchers in the husband's name that could be redeemed for household goods such as furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Stibbe, ''Women in the Third Reich'', London: Arnold / New York: Oxford University, {{ISBN|978-0-340-76105-2}}, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount was approximately one fifth of average annual take-home pay;&lt;ref name=Stibbe40&gt;Stibbe, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; industrial workers earned 140 RM a month.&lt;ref name=Alltag64&gt;Ruhl, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the loans required that the bride stop work immediately&lt;ref name=Alltag63/&gt; and not take another position during the life of the loan unless the husband was earning less than 125&amp;nbsp;RM per month.&lt;ref name=Vokabular161/&gt; Planners hoped that the loan programme would cause 800,000 women to leave the workforce over the first four years, and there was an associated programme of subsidies for household goods manufacture intended to provide jobs for another 200,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Schoenbaum]], ''Hitler's Social Revolution: Class and Status in Nazi Germany 1933&amp;ndash;1939'', 1966, repr. New York/London: Norton, 1980, {{OCLC|173223624}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1933, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' featured as a "shining" example the mass wedding and subsequent resignations of 122 female employees of the [[Reemtsma]] cigarette factory in Berlin, who thereby freed jobs for unemployed men.&lt;ref name=Stibbe41&gt;Stibbe, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, full employment had been achieved and women workers were needed, so the requirement was removed and the loan made available to all young people of documented Aryan ancestry and genetic fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhl, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused an increase in applications: by 1936 approximately one third of couples were receiving them; by 1939 this had risen to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1938, a special marriage loan programme for agricultural workers was added as part of the Decree on the Welfare of the Rural Population: couples were eligible if one partner had worked in agriculture or forestry for five years before they married, and the loan would be excused after a further ten years of such work. There was also a renewable 400&amp;nbsp;RM subsidy to farm workers for setting up a household.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying for the loans required demonstrating ancestral and medical "fitness," which could be onerous.&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a law of August 31, 1939 suspended the documentary requirements in anticipation of the effects of the war.&lt;ref name=Vokabular161/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stibbe, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Couples who were both employed had to pay back the loan at the rate of 3% per month; if only the husband was employed, the repayment rate was 1% a month.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt; In accordance with the Nazi policy of reversing the decline in the birth rate among Germans, one quarter of the loan was forgiven for each child, so that with the fourth child, no more was owed.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stibbe41/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhl, pp. 62&amp;ndash;64.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave rise to the colloquialism ''abkindern'' (from ''ab'', off, and ''Kind'', child) for discharging the loan by producing offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Zentner and Friedemann Bedürftig, tr. Amy Hackett, ''The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', New York: Macmillan, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-02-897500-9}}; repr. New York: Da Capo, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-306-80793-0}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4KIdT6WLMsfniAKNiq3ZCA&amp;id=yIsnAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Third+Reich+Abkindern&amp;q=ab+kind#search_anchor 1], [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4KIdT6WLMsfniAKNiq3ZCA&amp;id=yIsnAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Third+Reich+Abkindern&amp;q=Abkindern#search_anchor 718].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1938, 1,121,000 marriage loans had been extended, 800,000 under the original conditions of requiring the bride to stop work, and a "baby boom" had resulted in the forgiveness of 980,000.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger, pp. 235, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; The loan was then halved, to 500 RM.&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt;  The 250 RM for each child remained a powerful incentive; other financial assistance, called ''Kindergeld'', was also available to encourage families to have children.&lt;ref name=Alltag64/&gt; The loans were a particularly strong incentive to marry after extramarital pregnancy had occurred.&lt;ref name=Grunberger235/&gt;

The loans were partially paid for by a tax on unmarried people called ''Ehestandshilfe'' (marriage assistance, fund for the aid of marriage).&lt;ref&gt;Zentner and Bedürftig, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=16IdT8arC6jSiALVmay-CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;id=crRZAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Third+Reich&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe#search_anchor p. 574].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard Bancroft Clough, Thomas Moodie and Carol Moodie, eds., ''Economic History of Europe: Twentieth Century'', Documentary history of Western civilization, New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1968, {{OCLC|463948695}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x7YrAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg p. 254].&lt;/ref&gt; This was levied at a rate of 2&amp;ndash;5% of gross annual income on those under 55 who were liable for income tax; under a law of October 16, 1934, it was incorporated into the income tax beginning in January 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz-Berning, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jmWOMks6bkC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSQeT8uIJoz9iQKLh_3RCw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehestandshilfe&amp;f=false p. 122].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hartmannsgruber, ''Die Regierung Hitler'' volume 3 ''1936'', Munich: Oldenbourg, 2002, {{ISBN|978-3-7646-1839-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=4y4eT4utCJLMiQKh0PX9Cw&amp;id=7OJVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Ehestandshilfe&amp;q=Die+Mittel+dazu+werden+aus+der+Ehestandshilfe+der+Ledigen9+aufgebracht%2C+die+durch+das+Einkommensteuergesetz+vom+Oktober+1934+in+die+Einkommensteuer+eingebaut+worden+ist+und+demgem%C3%A4%C3%9F+seit+1.+Januar+1935+als+erh%C3%B6hte+Einkommensteuer+der#search_anchor p. 17] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the marriage loan programme, furniture and home furnishings were amongst the few retail trade sectors to show expansion under the Third Reich; and this did not apply to department stores, which were specifically excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, pp. 134, 143 and note 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[East Germany|East German]] government forgave all outstanding marriage loans in 1950, and in 1972 instituted its own loan programme, the ''Ehekredit'' (marriage credit), which was strongly reminiscent of the Nazi marriage loan: newlyweds under 26 received an interest-free loan of 5,000 [[East German mark]]s, which was progressively forgiven as they had children (in this case 3), again referred to as ''abkindern''.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Trappe, ''Emanzipation oder Zwang?: Frauen in der DDR zwischen Beruf, Familie und Sozialpolitik'', Berlin: Akademie, 1995, {{ISBN|978-3-05-002808-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OcgQyOOtA7AC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Ehekredit+DDR&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hb0dT_TRI8mniAKqvKXNCw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ehekredit%20DDR&amp;f=false p. 70] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schwartz, "Emanzipation zur sozialen Nützlichkeit: Bedingungen und Grenzen von Frauenpolitik in der DDR" in ''Sozialstaatlichkeit in der DDR: Sozialpolitische Entwicklungen im Spannungsfeld von Diktatur und Gesellschaft 1945/49&amp;ndash;1989'', ed.

Many expatriates run [[spaza shop]]s, or [[barber|barber shop]]s; and the [[Johannesburg]]'s [[Fordsburg, Gauteng|Fordsburg]] is said to be among the best places to find Pakistani food. The influx of people arriving from Pakistan has increased significantly in the last 10 years. Most of them are in grocery, electronics and cell phone businesses. They are also running successful business of imported cars from Japan in Durban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.southafrica.net/Cultures/sw-KE/trade.southafrica.net/MoreAboutSA/WhatToDo/Restaurants/Indian_Pakistani.htm Indian/Pakistani - SouthAfrica.net]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to business, many Pakistanis are working in the field of medicine throughout the country.

In February 2010, a crowd of angry rioters protesting unemployment issues burnt tyres and barricaded roads in a northern township in Johannesburg; local media reported that Pakistani shopkeepers were among those whose premises were looted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1635">The '''Palóc''' are a subgroup of [[Hungarians]] in [[Northern Hungary]] and southern [[Slovakia]]. While the Palóc have retained distinctive traditions, including a very apparent dialect of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the Palóc are also [[Magyars|ethnic Hungarians]] by general consensus. Although their origins are unclear, the Palóc seem to be the descendants of the [[Khazar]], [[Kabar]], [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cuman]] tribes. The writings of [[Kálmán Mikszáth]] gave new prominence to the people in 1882 with his work ''The Good People of Palóc''. The Palóc village of [[Hollókő]] was proclaimed a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1987.

==Etymology==

The Cumans were called ''Polovtsy'' in Slav sources. The ''Palóc'' word originates from the [[Slavic languages|Slav]] ''Polovets''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TYGiyYO9JioC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=The+Role+of+Migration+in+the+History+of+the+Eurasian+Steppe:+Sedentary+Civilization+vs.+'Barbarian'+and+Nomad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L--wUPDuFa364QStvYHAAQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA The Role of Migration in the History of the Eurasian Steppe: Sedentary Civilization vs. 'Barbarian' and Nomad], Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Although similar to the Hungarians in origins and culture, they were considered distinct groups by the [[Turkic people|Turks]]. The first written record of the word "palóc" as the name of a people appears in the [[Mezőkövesd]] register in 1784.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17528">{{Politics}}

The combination of '''politics and technology''' covers concepts, mechanisms, personalities, efforts, and [[social movement]]s including but not necessarily limited to the [[Internet]] and other [[Information technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs).

A growing body of scholarship has begun to explore how Internet technologies are influencing [[political communication]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participation]], especially in terms of what is known as the [[public sphere]].

One of the most influential and transformational information and communication technologies is the [[mobile phone]] or [[smartphone]], which can include: talk, text messaging, [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web|Web]] access, [[electronic mail]], [[faxing]], pictures, video, and a wide variety of [[Mobile app|apps]]. Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]]. Increased availability of this [[technology]] and subsequent access to the public sphere has enhanced the ability of individuals and groups to bring attention to and organize around specialized issues.&lt;ref&gt;Creeber, Glen. Digital Cultures: [understanding New Media]. Maidenhead: Open Univ., 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[social media]] has emerged to become one of the main areas of influence for [[politics]], where millions of users are able to learn about politicians' policies and statements, interact with political leaders, organize, and voice their own opinions on political matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politics and the Twitter revolution : how tweets influence the relationship between political leaders and the public|last2=Bichard|first2=Shannon|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739165010|location=Lanham, MD|page=1|pages=|last1=Parmelee|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The digital public sphere ==
The idea of the [[public sphere]] has generally come to be understood as the open social spaces and [[public space]]s in which private citizens interact and share information and ideas relevant to the society. These can include, for example, town halls, public squares, markets, coffee shops, or what ancient Greeks called [[agora]]s. Many scholars have argued that these spaces are vitally important for creating and maintaining an active and informed public in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24669015|title=Free spaces : the sources of democratic change in America|last=Evans|first=Sara M.|last2=Boyte|first2=Harry C.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=|year=|isbn=978-0226222578|edition= 2nd|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=24669015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jürgen Habermas]]' book  ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere|The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere – An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society]]'', he defines the public sphere as "a realm of social life in which public opinion can be formed."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18327374|title=The structural transformation of the public sphere : an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society|last=Jürgen|first=Habermas|publisher=|year=1962|isbn=978-0262081801|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18327374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the public sphere should be open to all citizens, and free from influence from governments or private businesses. Habermas goes on to argue that:&lt;blockquote href="Digital rights"&gt;"A portion of the public sphere is constituted in every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public. They are then acting neither as business or professional people conducting their private affairs, nor as legal consociates subject to the legal regulations of a state bureaucracy and obligated to obedience. Citizens act as a public when they deal with matters of general interest without being subject to coercion; thus with the guarantee that they may assemble and unite freely, and express and publicize their opinions freely."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Howard Rheingold]] argues that, "There is an intimate connection between informal conversations, the kind that take place in communities... and the ability of large social groups to govern themselves without monarchs or dictators.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44162557|title=The virtual community : homesteading on the electronic frontier|last=Howard.|first=Rheingold,|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262681216|edition= Rev. |location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=44162557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rheingold and others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlgren|first=Peter|date=2006|title=The Internet, Public Spheres, and Political Communication: Dispersion and Deliberation|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=147–162|doi=10.1080/10584600590933160}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also gone on to argue that virtual spaces created through the [[Internet]] and related [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] have led to the emergence of a new type of digital public sphere.

Just as the public sphere is a combination of "every conversation in which private persons come together to form a public"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the digital public sphere also comprises all forms of [[new media]], such as [[chat room]]s, website comment sections, and [[social media]], in which private citizens engage in discourse as a public. Virtual spaces may overlap or interact with offline spaces as well, forming what has been called "hybrid networks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Merlyna|date=2015|title=A CyberUrban Space Odyssey: The Spatiality of Contemporary Social Movements|url=https://www.academia.edu/16240525|journal=New Geographies|language=en|volume=7|pages=117–123|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars argue that social media affords increasing opportunities for political discourse and mobilization within the digital public sphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loader|first=Brian D.|last2=Mercea|first2=Dan|date=2011|title=Networking Democracy?

=== Criticisms ===

==== Social exclusion ====
The traditional, offline public sphere has been criticized for not being as inclusive in practice as it is in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23650367|title=Habermas and the public sphere|last=|first=|publisher=MIT Press|others=|year=1992|isbn=978-0262031837|editor-last=Calhoun|editor-first=Craig J.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=|oclc=23650367}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Feminist scholars like [[Nancy Fraser]] have argued that the public sphere has historically not been as open or accessible to [[Social exclusion|disadvantaged or marginalized groups]] in a society, such as women or people of color; therefore, such groups are forced to form their own separate public spheres, which she refers to as a [[Counterpublic|counter-public]] or ''subaltern counter public''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Nancy|date=1990|title=Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy|jstor=466240|journal=Social Text|issue=25/26|pages=56–80|doi=10.2307/466240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars contend that online spaces are more open and thus may help to increase inclusive political participation from marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|last2=Dryzek|first2=John S.|date=2002|title=Digital Democracy: Authentic or Virtual?|jstor=26162195|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Anonymity|anonymous]] online spaces should allow all individuals to speak with an equal voice to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deseriis|first=M.|date=2013|title=Is Anonymous a New Form of Luddism?: A Comparative Analysis of Industrial Machine Breaking, Computer Hacking, and Related Rhetorical Strategies|journal=Radical History Review|language=en|volume=2013|issue=117|pages=33–48|doi=10.1215/01636545-2210437|issn=0163-6545}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other have pointed out that many contemporary online spaces are not anonymous, such as [[Facebook]]. Avatars and social media profiles often portray an individual's offline identity, which can lead to practices of online discrimination and exclusion which mirror offline inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/214085023|title=Digitizing race : visual cultures of the Internet|last=Lisa|first=Nakamura|date=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=9780816653775|location=Minneapolis|pages=|oclc=214085023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more and more historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups are also using Internet technology to carve out new online spaces for their own "networked counterpublics" such as through the use of [[hashtag]]s like #Ferguson and [[Black Lives Matter|#BlackLivesMatter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2015|title=Hijacking #myNYPD: Social Media Dissent and Networked Counterpublics|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=65|issue=6|pages=932–952|doi=10.1111/jcom.12185|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Sarah J.|last2=Foucault Welles|first2=Brooke|date=2016|title=#Ferguson is everywhere: initiators in emerging counterpublic networks|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=397–418|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2015.1106571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The digital divide ====
Another factor which affects access to the digital public sphere is the [[digital divide]], which refers to how people from [[Least Developed Countries|less developed countries]] tend to have less access to [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]] compared to those from more [[Developed country|developed countries]]. For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate. In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, the number of Internet users in developing nations has risen by 9%, according to the [[Pew Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/|title=Smartphone Ownership and Internet Usage Continues to Climb in Emerging Economies|date=2016-02-22|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has shown, though, that even within more developed countries like the United States, the digital divide continues to persist between upper and lower socioeconomic classes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/broadband-adoption-rates-and-gaps-in-u-s-metropolitan-areas/|title=Broadband adoption rates and gaps in U.S. metropolitan areas|last=Tomer|first=Adie|date=2015|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-07-01|last2=Kane|first2=Jospeh|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between different education levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/05/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/|title=11% of Americans don’t use the internet. Who are they?|date=2018-03-05|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, scholars like [[Mark Warschauer]] argue that it is not just access to technology that matters, but the knowledge of how to put that technology to use in meaningful ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50028800|title=Technology and social inclusion : rethinking the digital divide|last=Mark.|first=Warschauer,|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262232241|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=50028800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26622">'''Prostitution in Denmark''' was partly decriminalized in 1999, based partly on the premise that it was easier to police a legal trade than an illegal one.

== History ==

=== Early period ===
Prostitution ("professional [[fornication]]") was regulated in Denmark during the nineteenth century, with police playing an active part, particularly after 1864, and even forcing women to register at [[brothels]]. Technically prostitution was illegal, so regulation was carried out discreetly by order of [[King Frederick VI]] (1808-1839), Danish law prescribed jail for men and whipping for women caught in fornication. Nineteenth-century policies to prostitution were driven by the idea that it was a primary source for [[sexually transmitted diseases]], with women being subject to increasingly regular examinations. As in other countries women could be forcefully hospitalized after registration was introduced in 1815. During the century rules and practice were progressively tightened. These policies became the target of women's groups and religious groups forcing some relaxation in 1885. Brothels were eventually banned in 1901 and in 1906 forceful examination was abandoned.&lt;ref name=petersen/&gt;

=== Modern era ===
Decriminalization occurred in 1999.&lt;ref name=petersen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/police-forced-prostitutes-brothels|title=Police forced prostitutes into brothels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the government announced a campaign to combat prostitution and racketeers involved in organizing the trade and [[human trafficking]], following a commissioned police report entitled ''Strategi for en styrket politimæssig indsats mod prostitutionens bagmænd''. Justice Minister [[Lene Espersen]] (DFK) announced an intensified police effort against traffickers while promising a more sympathetic approach to victims and witnesses, with new police reforms effective 1 January 2007. This would replace an earlier strategy due to expire at the end of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/nyt-og-presse/pressemeddelelser/2006/styrket-indsats-mod-prostitutionens-bagm%C3%A6nd|title=Styrket indsats mod prostitutionens bagmænd - Justitsministeriet|website=www.justitsministeriet.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Justice Minister [[Morten Bødskov]] announced further measures and introduced a bill, arising from the 2012 report of the Criminal law Council, extending provisions against exploitation from brothels to escort services and street prostitution, increasing penalties and giving police more powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/ministeren/ministerens-indl%C3%A6g/2013/regeringen-styrker-indsatsen-mod-prostitutionens-bagm%C3%A6nd|title=Regeringen styrker indsatsen mod prostitutionens bagmænd - Justitsministeriet|website=www.justitsministeriet.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Review 2012 ===
In 2009, the Ministry of Justice ordered the Criminal Code Council (''Straffelovrådet'') to undertake a comprehensive review of Chapter 24, and they delivered their report in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jm.schultzboghandel.dk/publikationer/publikationsdetaljer.aspx?PId=af97a338-6fd4-4042-92fb-b120a3d459f2|title=Justitsministeriet - Publikationer|website=jm.schultzboghandel.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the terms of reference, they were asked specifically to comment on whether the buying of sex should be banned. Amongst their recommendations were;
* To introduce a new comprehensive provision for the involvement of a person under 18 years in prostitution
* Eliminating special provisions for the participation of 18- to 20-year-olds in prostitution
* That prostitution business in other forms than keeping a brothel be covered by including the provision of escort services
* To decriminalize the involvement of third parties in prostitution, where the agent does not operate by exploiting the prostitution of others
* The removal of the Penal Code provisions involving the request or invitation to fornication that arouses public indignation
* To eliminate the possibility that a person is prevented from entering a particular restaurant for the sole reason that he or she works as a prostitute

In addition, the Council proposed adjusting the maximum penalties for the participation of a child under 18, for payment or promise of payment, having sexual relations with a client, or for being a spectator to a show with pornographic performances involving a child under 18, in order to meet the demands of the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse of children. They also proposed adjusting the maximum penalties for aiding the prostitution of others.

With regards to a ban on buying sex, the Council concluded that such a ban would only be justified as a moral rejection of the purchase of sex. With the knowledge on prostitution in Denmark and the information on the experience of the ban on buying sex in other countries, the Council's opinion was that a ban on buying sex will not have a significant positive impact in any other respects than the punishing those who purchase sex. On the contrary, a ban on buying sex could have negative consequences for a number of prostitutes in terms of worsening economic conditions and in the form of increased stigma.

On receiving their report, the [[Justice Minister of Denmark|Minister of Justice]] (''Justitsministeren'') [[Morten Bødskov]] made these remarks: "The government has also decided to follow the Criminal Code Council recommendation not to impose a ban on buying sex (''købesex''). The Criminal Council study shows that a ban on buying sex is not likely to lead to a decrease in prostitution or the exploitation of prostitutes, but rather is likely to have negative consequences for the prostitutes." (21 November 2012).&lt;ref name=justits1112/&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Regeringen har desuden besluttet af følge Straffelovrådets anbefaling om ikke at indføre et forbud mod købesex. Straffelovrådets undersøgelse viser, at et forbud mod købesex ikke kan forventes at føre til at fald i prostitutionen eller i udnyttelsen af prostituerede, men tværtimod må forventes at have negative konsekvenser for de prostituerede."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The [[US State Department]] said that a 2008 report from the National Board of Social Services states that police estimate the number of persons involved in prostitution is approximately 5,500.&lt;ref name=statedep09&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136028.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights 2009: Denmark |publisher=US State Department |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional center for prostitution in [[Copenhagen]] is the district behind the [[Copenhagen Central Station|Copenhagen Central Rail Station]] (mainly [[Istedgade]], [[Halmtorvet]] and [[Skelbækgade]]). At the commencement of 2009, the number of street-based sex workers and sex-oriented businesses in the area was declining, but there appeared to be a growth in numbers by the middle of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/46350-warnings-of-discount-prostitution-trend.html Warnings of discount prostitution trend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120152808/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/46350-warnings-of-discount-prostitution-trend.html |date=20 January 2011 }}. Copenhagen Post Wednesday, 22 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the people entering the industry originated from Eastern Europe and Africa.

Like many other European cities, many sex workers now use internet-based advertisements for [[incall]] and [[outcall]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreou|first1=Aggelos|title=Selling sex in Aarhus|url=http://www.jutlandstation.dk/selling-sex-in-aarhus/|website=Jutland Station|accessdate=14 April 2018|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study by [[TAMPEP]] estimated that migrant workers make up 65% of all prostitutes in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/29340 Romanian sex workers most prevalent in EU]. EU Observer 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the most recent report from the [[Servicestyrelsen]] agency states that about half of the sex workers in Denmark are migrants. The largest group, about 900, come from [[Thailand]] and, typically, these workers hold a [[Permanent residency|residence permit]] or Danish citizenship. The migrant workers are entitled to a wide range of social and health benefits, but are not always aware that such services exist for them. The next largest group, totaling about 1,000, are from [[European Union]] (EU) countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but tend to commute between Denmark and their homeland; such individuals are therefore not entitled to receive assistance from Danish [[Social work|social services]]. The third largest sex worker migrant group, from Africa (especially [[Nigeria]]), numbers around 300 and a number of the African migrants commute between other [[Schengen Area]] countries and Denmark. (A similar situation exists in [[Norway]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicestyrelsen.dk/udgivelser/udsatte/prostitution/migrantprostitution-i-danmark-notat|title=Servicestrelsen: Migrantprostitution i Danmark 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women from all three migrant groups may be victims of [[human trafficking]], the actual proportion is unknown, with no reliable figures detailing the number of trafficked persons currently available for analysis. In 2008 the police met with 431 women suspected of association with trafficking and 72 were confirmed to be victims. According to Copenhagen police, women are recruited in their native countries, transported to Denmark, and then forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name=statedep09/&gt;

==Clients==
A 2005 study of male clientele by Claus Lautrups found that 14% of Danish men have paid for sex at least once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladene.dk/index.php?mod=news&amp;area=1&amp;id=168 Jeg ligger i kø på motorvejen!] Dagbladenes Bureau 26 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redenkoebenhavn.dk/data/archive/Link/detskalikkebarevaereenkropmodkropoplevelse.pdf "Det skal ikke bare være en krop mod krop-oplevelse...": en sociologisk undersøgelse om prostitutionskunder. Af Claus Lautrup. VFC Socialt Udsatte, 2005. Undersøgelsesrapport.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130745/http://www.redenkoebenhavn.dk/data/archive/Link/detskalikkebarevaereenkropmodkropoplevelse.pdf |date=19 July 2011 }}''"Af de 6.350 mænd, som deltager i spørgeskemaundersøgelsen, svarer 14 procent, at de har købt sex"''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political debates ==
The then-[[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrat]] (S) government of [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] reformed the penal code on 17 March 1999, coming into force on 1 July 1999 to decriminalize prostitution. The Social Democrats lost power in 2001.

As elsewhere in [[Scandinavia]], there has been a continuing debate about the status of prostitution laws. The then-opposition [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and feminist groups favoured outlawing the buying of sexual acts in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/46107-new-government-could-ban-buying-sex.html New government could ban buying sex]. Copenhagen Post 29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
This would have put Denmark in line with [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Iceland]], Norway having adopted such legislation in 2009. This position was supported by a number of opposition parties, including the [[Enhedslisten|Red-Green Alliance]] (''Enhedslisten'', EL) and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] (SF), but not the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Social Liberals]] (R). This position had little popular support, only about 26% supporting the measure. (see '''[[#Public opinion|Public opinion]]'''). At that time, Denmark was governed by a [[centre-right]] [[minority government]] consisting of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] (''Venstre'', V) and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] (''Det Konservative Folkeparti'', DKF).

In June 2011, responding to both an opinion poll and recent [[#Research|research]] (which see) the opposition [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (S), supported by the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] (SF), were in favour of the [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish model]] of banning the sale of sex, and did not consider the issue of rights identified in the 2011 poll. This put them at odds with the minority governing parties, the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals (Venstre)]] (V), although the position of the junior governing party, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservatives]]'s (K), position was less clear. On the other hand, the opposition [[Danish People's Party|People's Party]] (DF) was more supportive of rights, looking to [[Prostitution in New Zealand|New Zealand]]. In Denmark's complex political mosaic, the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Radicals (Social Liberals)]] (R), who were divided on the issue, were in a position of holding the balance of power on the issue. It was anticipated that if the Social Democrats were returned to power, they would follow Sweden's example.&lt;ref name=altinget611/&gt;

In the September 2011 elections, the centre-right coalition lost power to a [[centre-left]] coalition led by the Social Democrats, together with the Social Liberals and the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]] (''Socialistisk Folkeparti'', SF), and were in a position to change the laws. However, the Socialist People's Party withdrew from the coalition on 30 January 2014, [[Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt II|leaving the Social Democrats heavily dependent]] on the support of the opposition Venstre, and consequently having to modify their election promises, although the Socialist People's party continue to support the government.

== Public opinion ==
A public opinion poll in 2011 showed that 61% of Danes think Danish sex workers should have more rights, and their profession recognized. Support was found by the majority of voters for all parties, but most noticeably for the relatively small [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] (LA). The question was: ''"In Denmark, prostitution is legal, and prostitutes are in principle taxable. Prostitution is not recognized as a profession, and the prostitutes are not able to join a union, receive benefits, or be eligible for employment insurance. Are you in favour or opposed to prostitutes being allowed to join a union in order to receive benefits and employment insurance?"''&lt;ref name=altinget611&gt;[http://www.altinget.dk/artikel/danskerne-vil-give-prostituerede-flere-rettigheder Danskerne vil give prostituerede flere rettigheder]. Altinget.dk 10 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
In 2010, the Danish government, responding to criticisms that the debate on prostitution was largely based on myths and stereotypes, allocated DKK 4 million for a national survey by ''Det Nationale Forskningscenter for Velfærd'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfi.dk|title=SFI- Det Nationale Forskningcenter for Velfærd|website=www.sfi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published in 2011 as ''Prostitution i Danmark''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altinget.dk/misc/prostitution.pdf Prostitution i Danmark']&lt;/ref&gt; The report stressed that prostitution cannot be treated as a monolithic or homogeneous entity, in particular drawing a distinction between outdoor (street) and indoor work. It suggested a more targeted approach, pointing out that most sex workers had chosen their profession, rather than being coerced.&lt;ref name=altinget611/&gt;

==Autonomous constituent countries==

===Faroe Islands===
Under [[Courts of Denmark|Danish Jurisdiction]], the legal status of prostitution remains lawful. However, there is no evidence of organised prostitution within the self-governing territory.&lt;ref name="H&amp;S" /&gt;

===Greenland===
Prostitution in [[Greenland]] is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Small-Town Greenland Prepares for Influx of Foreign Workers|url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/small-town-greenland-prepares-for-influx-of-foreign-workers_1480624.html|author=Susanne Willgren|newspaper=The Epoch Times|date=31 October 2012|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the country is subject to the [[law of Denmark]] in most areas of legislation, Denmark's decriminalization of prostitution in 1999 has not been applied in Greenland.&lt;ref name=H&amp;S&gt;{{cite report|title=Prostitution in the Nordic Countries|url=http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:701621/FULLTEXT01.pdf|location=Stockholm|date=16–17 October 2008|first1=Charlotta|last1=Holmström|first2=May-Len|last2=Skilbrei|publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers|isbn=978-92-893-1930-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Greenland is exempt from the obligations of the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|Palermo Protocol on human trafficking]] to which Denmark is a signatory,&lt;ref name=H&amp;S/&gt; but there is little evidence of human trafficking in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Human Trafficking as a Human Rights Issue And Policy Responses of Arctic Nations|url=https://www.rha.is/static/files/NRF/OpenAssemblies/Anchorage2008/a/5th_nrf_anc_2008_footen_bromfield_human_trafficking.pdf|first=Nicole Footen|last=Bromfield|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|page=10|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report published in 2008 indicated that Greenland had no signs of visible or organised prostitution, no services directed specifically at prostitutes and no instances of prostitution-related court cases. It did, however, refer to claims that [[transactional sex]] had sometimes been used, for example, in return for temporary housing.&lt;ref name=H&amp;S/&gt; In a tradition associated with Greenland's [[Inuit]] people, hosts have been reported to have offered their wives to guests in a form of "hospitable prostitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S3g29DlTxNsC|first1=Cesare|last1=Lombroso|first2=Guglielmo|last2=Ferrero|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780822332466|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists who founded the country's capital [[Nuuk]] in 1728 included prostitutes among their number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wurm|first1=Stephen A.|last2=Mühlhäusler|first2=Peter |last3=Tyron|first3=Darrell T.|title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas, International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glU0vte5gSkC|series=Volume 2, Part 1 Volume 13 of Trends in Linguistics|year=1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-013417-9|page=1051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R. v. Beattie''''' was a [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case in which the defendant, John Beattie, was accused of [[child pornography]] possession after police entered his home and "seized a three-ring binder containing thirty-three stories describing, in graphic language, sexual activities between adults and children under the age of fourteen."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2005/april/C41354.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Danay noted that [[John I.

The '''real estate sector in Kenya''' has seen a boom that began somewhere in the mid to late 2000s because the property market is responding to [[Economy of Kenya|increased demand]].

In [[Nairobi]], the capital and largest city of [[Kenya]], there is one of the largest expatriate communities in the continent due to the significant number of multinationals who have chosen Nairobi as either their African hub or East and Central African hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Opinion-and-Analysis/Why-Kenyan-real-estate-sector-is-robust-/-/539548/1909974/-/vf6wfz/-/index.html|title=Why Kenya’s real estate sector is robust|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebirth of property development in Nairobi has attracted global attention. In its 2012 Wealth Report, real estate management company, Knight Frank, ranked Nairobi as the fastest-growing real estate market in the world, outpacing cities like Miami and Monaco.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nairobi’s Changing Skyline: Commercial Real Estate On The Rise|url=http://abacus.co.ke/nairobis-changing-skyline-commercial-real-estate-on-the-rise/|website=http://abacus.co.ke/|publisher=Abacus|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate prices in Nairobi rose 25 percent between January and December 2011. Nairobi was also voted as one of the top 10 cities to watch by global real estate firm, Jones Lang LaSalle, out of 150 cities globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hayerone.com/real-estate-boom-in-kenya-2018/|title=Real Estate Market Boom In Kenya 2018|publisher=hayerone|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Nairobi]] and [[Mombasa]] were the only cities in the "southern hemisphere" to have reported double digit property price increases, out of 71 cities surveyed  in the Prime International Residential Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Nairobi-tops-global-cities-in-property-prices-rally/-/539552/1376198/-/ixqtsbz/-/index.html|title=Nairobi tops global cities in property prices rally|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table shows property price growth in the top cities in the survey.

The report noted that inflows from Kenyans in the diaspora are particularly significant in driving the prices and that the cost per square metre of land in [[Nairobi]] and [[Mombasa]] is still lower than other cities such as [[Monaco]].

==Markets==

===Office===
The office market in Kenya has moved from a position of oversupply and the market is finally stabilising, as Nairobi reinforces its position as the regional commercial hub of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?versionid=1668&amp;type=1# |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708145848/http://resources.knightfrank.com/GetResearchResource.ashx?versionid=1668&amp;type=1# |archive-date=8 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail===
Kenya continues to experience some of the most decentralised growth of the retail market as marketers move outside Nairobi and go to other urban centres in Kenya such as Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Nakuru.

===Industrial===
Most industrial companies in Kenya tend to avoid renting or leasing space. However, over the recent years there has been significant development especially along Mombasa Rd. Rent and take up is low so the sector might need a couple more years to mature.

===Residential===
The residential market has actually been one of the key drivers of the property market. There has been a significant number of development projects coming up both within the Greater Nairobi Area and other urban areas such as Mombasa, Naivasha and Kisumu.

====Upper Hill====
[[Upper Hill, Nairobi|Upper Hill]] has become an alternative for major companies seeking land cheaper than that which is in the Central Business District of Nairobi. It is one of the two main bases multinational firms consider when setting up in Kenya or Africa. Some of the firms include but are not limited to: [[Cisco Systems]], [[Citibank]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Huawei]] and [[IMF]].

====Westlands====
[[Westlands]] along with Upper Hill has become one of the two main bases for multinational firms that want to set up in Kenya or Africa. Some of the firms include but are not limited to: [[General Electric]], [[Google]] Africa headquarters, [[Intel Corporation]], [[LG]] and [[Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Plc]].
{{wide image|Woodvale Grove, Westlands, Nairobi.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Woodvale Grove, [[Westlands]]}}

====Gigiri====
Gigiri is home to Kenya's large [[expatriate]] community. It is one of the largest expat communities in Africa. It houses the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]]. [[Nairobi]] is the only African city to host a major UN body. It also has [[the Village Market]], which targets the expat community in Nairobi and hosts the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] Base for Eastern and Southern Africa. Gigiri is considered one of Kenya's most posh suburbs along with [[Runda]] and [[Muthaiga]] which are really close to the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hassconsult.co.ke/index.php/area-profile/area-profile/110-gigiri|title=HassConsult Real Estate|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is comparable to the mostly-expat-inhabited neighbourhood of [[Itaewon]] in [[South Korea]]. However, it is much smaller.

====Runda, Muthaiga, Lavington, Karen====
These areas are Kenya's most expensive neighbourhoods; however, it is very likely that the neighbourhoods like Runda will lose its tag due to the recent demolitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000084594&amp;story_title=Kenya-anxiety-as-houses-in-runda-face-demolition|title=Anxiety as houses in Runda face demolition|first=Jeckonia|last=Otieno|work=Standard Digital News|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are seeing more and more townhouses rather than mansions and villas.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/201111250015.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machakos (East Metro)===
[[File:Nairobi Metro location map.png|thumb|Nairobi Metro Map&lt;br&gt;[[Nairobi County]] (red)&lt;br&gt;[[Kajiado County]] (green) &lt;br&gt;[[Machakos County]] (yellow) &lt;br&gt;[[Kiambu County]] (purple)]]
Towns in Machakos County on the outskirts of Nairobi from the 2000s been inhabited by people who work in Nairobi. [[Athi River]] is one town that has seen people move there. This shows that people have started to prefer living outside the core of the city. Under the Nairobi 2030 Masterplan, Machakos County is to become a dormitory town for Core Nairobi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nairobimetro.go.ke/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=25&amp;Itemid=57{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/konza-silicon-savanna/26033/|title=Kenya kickstarts multi-billion-dollar Konza Tech City|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Konza Techno City====
[[Konza Technology City]] dubbed "Africa’s Silicon Valley" will be the single largest property development ever done in Kenya. It is going to host the technology city as part of many programmes that aim to steer Kenya into middle income status. It will cost a whooping US$14.5 billion after commencing in January 2013 and is to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;http://techloy.com/2013/01/24/kenyas-president-launches-15-billion-konza-silicon-city-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kiambu (North Metro)===
With the recent completion of the expansion of a road connecting Core Nairobi to Kiambu County, there has been a lot of property development happening with the most significant being:

====Tatu City====
Tatu City is a property development by [[Moscow]]-based Renaissance Partners. The development will cost US$2.5 billion; groundbreaking commenced in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/62952|title=A Wave of 'New Cities' Are Poised to Transform Africa - For the Worse?|work=Planetizen:  The Urban Planning, Design, and Development Network|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kajiado (South Metro)===
[[Kajiado County]] is currently home to Kenya's richest people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Kajiado-richest-county-Turkana-poorest-/-/1064/1930892/-/ain94qz/-/index.html|title=Kajiado richest county, Turkana poorest|date=29 July 2013|work=Daily Nation|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many residential neighbourhoods that host people who work in Nairobi examples are [[Ngong, Kenya|Ngong]], [[Kitengela]], [[Kiserian]] and [[Ongata Rongai]]. [[Kitengela]] is close to [[Athi River]] which has also started rising as a popular residential area.

==Mombasa==
Mombasa is the second-largest city in [[Kenya]]. Prime land in Mombasa is up for grabs as a property boom like the one witnessed in the 1970s continues to push up home prices in the coastal town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Investors-cash-in-on-Mombasa-land-rush-as-property-prices-soar/-/539546/1225096/-/bdka4yz/-/index.html|title=Investors cash in on Mombasa land rush as property prices soar|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nyali===
[[Nyali]] houses some of the most expensive homes in Kenya.

===Shanzu===
Shanzu is also another affluent neighbourhood right past Whitesands beach hotel at Bamburi beach. The area houses high-profile housing developments.

===English Point Marina===
English Point Marina will be East and Central Africa's first floating pontoon marina. It will offer apartment living in the comfort, luxury and security of a hotel and will be managed by Pinewood Village Beach Resort.
Units sold cost between KES. 36 and 150 million (US$410,000 – US$1.8 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denisonyachtsales.com/2011/06/kenyas-first-marina-hopes-to-attract-boats-yachts/|title=Kenya's First Marina Hopes to Attract Boats &amp; Yachts|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high prices, the units are almost sold out.{{When|date=February 2014}}

The total cost of the project is about KES. 4.8 billion (US$60 million).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.megaprojects.co.ke/projects/20/details/#.UgDtcWQY1jA&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |March 2013}} the project was 30% complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEdbA-IezY|title=English Point Marina 30% complete|date=17 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete virtual tour of the property has been created to give online users a feel of what to expect from the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.360tours.co.ke/tours/final/epm_tour|title=Marina EnglishPoint - 360 tours|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rugby Boys''' are a collective term for [[Street gang|gangs]] of street children found in the [[Philippines]]. They are one of the most well-known [[poverty]]-afflicted people found in the slums of the Philippines. They are known for using and being addicted to a [[Adhesive#Contact adhesives|contact cement]] known as "Rugby" brand manufactured by [[Bostik]] and other aromatic solvents to alleviate their [[hunger]], and resulting in crime to fund their addiction.&lt;ref name="torre"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/cebu-news/2009/05/18/468466/rugby-cheap-high-citys-street-kids-last-two-parts|title='Rugby': cheap high for city's street kids  (Last of two parts)|author=AJ de la Torre, Niña G. Sumacot-Abenoja, Wenna Berondo|date=18 May 2009|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the Philippine [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]] show that the number of street children increased by 6,365 yearly, and half of the country’s street children, from 8 to 20 years old, have at one time sniffed Rugby and other inhalants. The relative ease of procuring these substances due to their low cost contributes to widespread abuse. There is no comprehensive epidemiologic data on the magnitude on inhalant abuse among children and adolescents in the Philippines. &lt;ref name="wellsphere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellsphere.com/men-s-health-article/quot-rugby-boys-quot/508771 |title= "Rugby boys" |publisher=Wellsphere.com |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=2012-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311062623/http://www.wellsphere.com/men-s-health-article/quot-rugby-boys-quot/508771 |archivedate=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to widespread abuse of toluene-based substances, stricter rules have been imposed on the manufacture and sale of Rugby and similar glues by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, such as the mandatory addition of [[mustard oil]] as a [[Bitterant|sniffing deterrent]]. In addition, purchasers will now be required to present valid identification for them to have access to contact cement that doesn't contain any bitterants or other such deterrents.&lt;ref name="bitterant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/metro-manila/07/08/09/pdea-rugby-now-dangerous-drug|title=PDEA: Rugby now a 'prohibited drug'|work=[[ABS-CBNnews.com]]|publisher=[[ABS-CBN]]|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wealthy [[adolescents]] were the first to use [[inhalants]] and become addicted to them, often using them to alleviate depression. In terms of [[Drug addiction|addiction]], inhalants are ordinary household products such as cleaners, cooking sprays, fabric protectors, paint thinner and adhesives and solvents. Because of the low cost of Rugby and other inhalants, poor people (especially inexperienced and destitute youths) use them to relieve hunger pangs and common poverty health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='RUGBY BOY' JUMPS TO HIS DEATH FROM SCHOOLBUILDING|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1218827041.html|publisher=[[The Manila Times]] {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}|accessdate=4 August 2018|date=1 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Rugby Boys” (also called “Solvent Boys”) and even girls do the sniffing in the streets. The chemical is placed in a plastic bag, and inhaled from the bag to achieve euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/rugby-boys-inhalant-abuse-philippines-94899.html?cat=62 |title= Yahoo Voices Rugby boys|publisher=Yahoo voice.com |date=October 26, 2006 |accessdate=2012-04-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140311075253/http://voices.yahoo.com/rugby-boys-inhalant-abuse-philippines-94899.html?cat=62 |archivedate = March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impoverished population is the most common victim of addiction to dangerous and illegal substances. Once they are "high" they forget their hunger. Others become addicted because of family problems, poor self-esteem and [[peer pressure]]. Solvents, particularly Rugby, is the inhalant of choice in the Philippines for most teenagers since it is easily obtained. Less scrupulous store owners sell the adhesive in small portions to children and teenagers.

==Health problems==
Inhalants cause nausea, blurred vision, memory lapse and loss of motor coordination. These effects may be a minor discomfort to the user after inhalation, but permanent damage from inhalants is irreversible. Damage to organs such as the [[liver]], [[kidneys]], [[brain]] and [[heart]] could be fatal.&lt;ref name="torre"/&gt;

A [[documentary]] by [[Karen Davila]] showed the effects of inhalant abuse on a person's body. One male teenager who served as the subject of the documentary has been addicted to Rugby for five years. He started sniffing Rugby due to [[Peer pressure|peer influence]]. His parents knew about his addiction, but as his mother explained, they were unable to dissuade him from inhaling the toxic substance. His father resorted to [[Corporal punishment in the home|beatings]] to teach him a lesson, to no avail. All his friends are addicts and the money they earn is saved to buy Rugby. The boy even turned his addiction into business, buying a bottle of Rugby then selling it in small portions to friends, and the profit enabled him to buy more Rugby.&lt;ref name="wellsphere"/&gt;

In the months they have observed this boy, they captured him at his lowest point. With the years of abuse that his body suffered, he could not stand or walk properly, and his body was scrawny. When he was taken for a medical exam, doctors found that he had [[tuberculosis]] and that his liver and kidneys were not functioning well. Through [[CT Scan]], it was found that his brain was smaller than average for his age bracket. Doctors said that if he continues his habit, he would either fall into a [[vegetative state]], in a [[coma]], or die.&lt;ref name="torre"/&gt;

The chemical [[toluene]] provides the aromatic smell of contact cement and other glue and is the culprit behind the addiction. Toluene abusers are exposed to levels above 1000 ppm (parts per million). Levels of exposure greater than 600 ppm cause confusion and delirium. Inhalant abuse causes permanent damage to the brain and may result in “sudden sniffing death”. It can also cause loss of memory, confusion or disorientation, distorted perception of time and distance, hallucinations, [[nausea]] and [[emesis]]. Inhalant abuse leads to muscle cramps and weakness, numbness of limbs, abdominal pains, damage to the central nervous system, kidneys and liver. It also produces psychological dependence. Once the habit is formed, the dose must be increased gradually to produce the same effect.&lt;ref name="torre"/&gt;

==Crimes attributed==
Many Rugby boys have resorted to crime to fund their addiction. These crimes include [[robbery]], aggressive threats and hold-ups, [[drug trafficking]], and racketeering and small [[organized crimes]].  In a recent television documentary by Karen Davila, a Filipino broadcaster, a boy they ordered to buy Rugby from a store easily purchased a bottle of Rugby, and was told by the store owner that the Rugby should be wrapped in paper to conceal it. This is because there is a law prohibiting the selling of solvents to minors without parental consent. Many [[crime syndicates]] and common businessmen recruit and teach children how to get away with buying it.

Many of their crimes occur at crowded public places, when the police are distracted.

'''Réunionnais of Indian origin''' are people of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] origin in [[Réunion]]. They form two ethnic groups on the island, [[Malbars]] and [[Zarabes]].

==Origins==
Originally brought in as indentured laborers as in [[Mauritius]], they were mostly from [[South Indian]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s.&lt;ref name="indiandiaspora.nic.in"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821114441/http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter6.pdf |archive-date=2010-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next largest group was from [[North Indian]] [[Hindus]], speaking [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Bhojpuri]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. The smallest group were Muslims (from [[North India|North]], [[South India|South]] and [[West India]]). There were also latter emigrants, mostly [[Hindu]], traders and businessmen. In Réunion, Indians from South India, often Hindu, are known as Malbars and Muslim Indians from North India are known as Zarabes.

==Today==
Indo-Réunionnais people have affected the culture of [[Réunion]], bringing Indian foods as well as plants and animals to the island. The Hindus here have mixed with the other races.

==Malbars==
{{main|Malbars}}
Originally brought in as indentured laborers as in [[Mauritius]], they were mostly from [[South Indian]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s and [[Telugu people|Telugu]]s.&lt;ref name="indiandiaspora.nic.in"/&gt;
Tamils in Reunion are gradual awakening and desire to their ancestors' culture, and started studying their language and religions especially from [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref name="indiandiaspora.nic.in"/&gt;
They also now wanted to translate their newly acquired civic and political rights into a gradual and increasing participation in local and other elections.
*Mr [[Jean-Paul Virapoullé]] is an example of Tamil Participation in the island's civic and political life. He is currently Mayor of Saint Andre and First Vice President of the General Council of Reunion. There are other examples of this kind, such as those Mr Saminadin Axel Kichenin.
*Mrs Nadia Ramassam who are respectively Second and Third Vice Presidents of the same General Council.
*Mrs Denise Nilameyom is Deputy Mayor of Tampon.

==Zarabes==
{{main|Zarabes}}
[[Zarabes]] is the name given to the [[Muslim]] community of [[Réunion]]. The Muslims migrated to Réunion in mid-nineteenth century. Zarabes are mostly [[South Asia]]n and specifically from the modern state [[Gujarat]] in [[India]].{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Demographic factors==
Many are [[Christian]]s and [[Hindu]]s, including some who are nominally Christian but include Hindu practises.&lt;ref name="ghasarian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghasarian |first1=Christian |year=1997 |title=We Have the Best Gods!

Others are [[Sikh]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]] or [[non-religious]]. [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] is also practised in [[Réunion]]. They speak [[Réunion Creole]] and French. There are a handful of schools where Indian languages such as [[Tamil language|Tamil]] may be studied as a third or fourth language.

== Phonology ==
The Sa'ban language has several sounds that are rare among the world's languages. These include voiceless nasal and liquid consonants&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and a distinction between long and short vowels as well as long and short consonants. Some examples of words with voiceless nasals and liquids are given in the table below. They have a stative reading in contrast to long consonants:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Most victims find themselves in coercive or abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous. Locations where this practice occurs span the globe and reflect an intricate web between nations, making it very difficult to construct viable solutions to this human rights problem.

Article 5 of the Palermo Protocol then requires the member states to criminalize trafficking based on the definition outlined in Article 3; however, many member states' domestic laws reflect a narrower definition than Article 3.&lt;ref name=Villanova /&gt; Although these nations claim to be obliging Article 5, the narrow laws lead to a smaller portion of people being persecuted for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=Villanova /&gt;

The UN established various anti-trafficking tools, including a Global Report on Trafficking in Persons and an Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons. The Global Report on Trafficking in Person provides new information based on data gathered from 155 countries. It offers first global assessment of the scope of [[human trafficking]] and what is being done to fight it. The UN General Assembly passed several resolutions on measuring to eliminate human trafficking. In 2010 the UN Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons was adopted. Various other organizations have engaged in global efforts against sex trafficking. "The UN Protocol's is the bedrock of the international initiatives against human sex trafficking" . The protocol includes several elements the first being: Action which includes recruitment,and transportation. The next element becomes a Means which includes coercion, fraud, or abuse of power towards others. The purpose element is the most concerning which can also be exploitation. This includes exploiting the prostitution, forced labor, slavery, and the removal of organs. The UN requires states and countries to establish the trafficking of humans as a criminal offense.

===United States===
After members of Prostitutes Anonymous who were survivors of modern domestic sex trafficking spent 13 years doing TV, radio, public appearances, news interviews, etc. and calling out that this country needed to "'do something' about it"{{snd}} an internationally recognized definition for sex trafficking was finally established with the Trafficking Act of 2000.  It was during the same year the Palermo Protocol was enacted, the United States passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) to clarify the previous confusion and discrepancies in regards to the criminalizing guidelines of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=Arizona&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lew|first1=Candace|title=Sex Trafficking of Domestic Minors in Phoenix, Arizona: A Research Project|date=July 2012|url=http://dianeandbrucehallefoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/sex-trafficking-domestic-minors.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this act, sex trafficking crimes were defined as a situation where in which a "commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age."&lt;ref name="TVPA Doc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=United States Government|title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the victim is a child under the age of 18 no force, fraud, or coercion needs to be proven based on this legislation.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; Susan Tiefenbrun, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law who has written extensively on human trafficking, conducted research on the victims addressed in this act and discovered that each year more than two million women throughout the world are bought and sold for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=Tiefenbrun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tiefenbrun|first1=Susan|title=The Saga of Susannah A U.S. Remedy for Sex Trafficking in Women: The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|journal=Utah Law Review|date=2002|volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clarify previous legal inconsistencies in regards to youth and trafficking, the United States took legal measures to define more varieties of exploitive situations in relation to children.&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; The two terms they defined and focused on were "commercial sexual exploitation of children" and "domestic minor sex trafficking."  Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is defined as "encompassing several forms of exploitation, including pornography, prostitution, child sex tourism, and child marriage."&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt; Domestic minor sex trafficking (DMST) is a term that represents a subset of CSEC situations that have "the exchange of sex with a child under the age of 18, who is a United States (US) citizen or permanent resident, for a gain of cash, goods, or anything of value."&lt;ref name=Arizona /&gt;

According to ECPAT USA, the average age of entry into street prostitution is between 12 and 14 years old. In today’s culture, pimps and prostitutes are being glamorized in the media (Frundt). This is extremely dangerous as it constructs a falsified reality of what the sex trafficking industry is really like. In the United States, sex traffickers and pimps often find their victims in malls. Sometimes vulnerable looking girls will be abducted while walking to their cars if they look distracted and are alone, and other times the pimps will go up to a victim and convince them to leave with them, often offering a job of some kind and money. Emotional and physical coercion is used in order for the victim to trust the pimp and build a relationship. A lot of times, the victims are tricked into thinking they will have freedom in the work they are promised along with a large sum of money. However, what ends up happening is they become a sex slave. After the victim has agreed to the pimp’s offer, they are forced into not leaving by forcing addictive drugs, with-holding money and physical/sexual abuse. It is very common in the United States for pimps to own a business or store, especially nail salons and massage parlors. It is also very common for sex slavery businesses to be conducted near U.S. military bases, because of the business soldiers bring.

==Causes==
There is not one simple factor that perpetuates sex trafficking, rather a complex, interconnected web of political, socioeconomic, governmental, and societal factors.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Commonwealth Secretariat|title=Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth: Some critical issues for action in the decade 2005-2015|date=2004|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|accessdate=17 March 2015|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gQCsswEACAAJ|isbn=9781848598553}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siddharth Kara]] argues that [[globalization]] and the spread of Western Capitalism drive inequality and rural poverty, which are the material causes for sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="Inside the Business of Modern Slavery" /&gt; Kara also emphasizes that there are factors on both the supply and demand sides of sex trafficking, which contribute to its continued practice. Natural disasters, sex and gender discrimination, personal problems which increase vulnerability, and cultural norms which discriminate certain populations serve as factors which support the supply side of sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="Inside the Business of Modern Slavery" /&gt; In regards to the demand for sex trafficking, Kara believes that the demand for inexpensive labor, strict immigration laws and policies, and the involvement of corrupt government officials in trafficking rings act as promoting factors of the industry.&lt;ref name="Inside the Business of Modern Slavery" /&gt; Strict immigration laws are also cited by Susan Tiefenbrun as a key factor in individuals entering this industry because "poor women seeking to better their economic situations by emigration, resort to the financial assistance of unscrupulous loan sharks and traffickers."&lt;ref name="Tiefenbrun" /&gt;


In Susan Tiefenbrun's work on sex trafficking, she cites high poverty rates, a societal norm for minimal respect for women, a lack of public awareness on this issue, limited educational and economic opportunities for women, and poor laws to prosecute exploiters and traffickers, as the major factors present in the "source countries" of sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="Tiefenbrun" /&gt; However, the destination countries to which sex workers are sent tend to be much wealthier compared to the source countries.&lt;ref name="Tiefenbrun" /&gt;

As shown in this research and many other papers, sex trafficking is more the result of a combination of various factors than the simple desire of individuals wanting to reap the profits from exploiting others, through based on the demand for inexpensive sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Inside the Business of Modern Slavery" /&gt;

==Prevention==
Anyone is permitted to contact The National Human Trafficking Resource Center at 1(888)-373-7888. The hotline is beneficial since providers are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist victims and provide information for those who are at risk. There are a variety of ways in order to help prevent trafficking. One must be aware of the indicators to identify victims: abnormal behavior, poor physical health, lack of control, and work and living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recognize the Recognize|url=http://polarisproject.org/human-trafficking/recognize-signs|website=Polaris|accessdate=24 April 2018|date=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these signs may only be shown through a number of people - there may be more severe, serious indicators of sex trafficking. If you are a huge supporter in anti-trafficking, you can host events in the community to raise awareness of how people are targeted and who. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Ways You Can Help Fight Human Trafficking|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/id/help/|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main causes of sex trafficking is the lack of knowledge, especially in young girls. It is extremely important to educate the youth in possible prevention methods. As social media can be a large form of “recruiting” victims, it can also be a useful tool in preventing sex trafficking (Kempadoo). Since teenagers are constantly going through Twitter and Instagram, posting possible prevention methods and information on the topic is a great way to inform your peers. It is also a fast way of posting potential dangerous/suspicious areas to avoid. One of the most common forms of abduction/coercion are in parking lots, especially if it’s dark outside and not many people around. It is important to always be looking at your surroundings if you are in this position. One of the most common ways that young girls get abducted if they are walking to their car while they are looking at their phone, looking for their keys, or just distracted by something. A common tactic of the attacker will follow a girl to her car and waits to see if she doesn’t leave right away. If she is on her phone it is an easy way to get in the passenger seat and often times the victim will be held at gunpoint until they drive to the demanded location. Small but crucial  safety tips like these should be taught in school and at home in order for children to be more cautious and aware of their surroundings when they could be in danger. For women who started as either strippers or escorts, it is extremely important to be informed of the serious danger of getting into sex-trafficking. It starts off as voluntary, but once the pimps have a relationship and they like the victim trusts them, that is when it goes downhill. Once the pimps know the girl trusts them, is when all emotions are turned off and starts treating them as slaves. Again, informing the masses is key to preventing sex-trafficking.

==Profile and modus operandi of traffickers==

===Pimp-controlled trafficking===
In pimp-controlled trafficking, the victim is controlled by a single trafficker, sometimes called a [[pimp]].  The victim can be controlled by the trafficker physically, psychologically, and/or emotionally.  In order to obtain control over their victims, traffickers will use force, drugs, emotional tactics as well as financial means. In certain circumstances, they will even resort to various forms of violence, such as gang rape and mental and physical abuse.  Traffickers sometimes use offers of marriage, threats, intimidation, brainwashing and kidnapping as means of obtaining victims.

A common process is for the trafficker to first gain the trust of the victim, called the grooming stage.  They seek to make the victim dependent on them.&lt;ref name="rapidassessment" /&gt;  The trafficker may express love and admiration, make lofty promises such as making the victim a star, offer them a job or an education or buy them a ticket to a new location.&lt;ref name="trafficking_and_internet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/judges_journal/2013/winter/human_trafficking_and_internet_and_other_technologies_too.html|title=Human Trafficking and the Internet*  (*and Other Technologies, too) - Judicial Division|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main types of work offered are in the catering and hotel industry, in bars and clubs, modeling contracts, or [[au pair]] work. Once the victim is comfortable, the pimp moves to the seasoning stage, where they will ask the victim to perform sexual acts for the pimp, which the victim may do because they believe it is the only way to keep the trafficker's affection.  The requests progress from there and it can be difficult for the victim to escape.&lt;ref name="rapidassessment" /&gt;

Another tactic is for traffickers to kidnap their victims, and then drug them or secure them so they cannot escape.&lt;ref name="truckers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/13/484801054/truckers-take-the-wheel-in-effort-to-halt-sex-trafficking|title=Truckers Take The Wheel In Effort To Halt Sex Trafficking|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traffickers may seek out potential victims who are traveling alone, are separated from their group, or seem like they have low self-esteem.  They may go to places likes malls where they are more likely to find girls without parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a21.org/content/top-five-hot-spots-for-human-trafficking/gjdplg?permcode=gjdplg|title=TOP FIVE: Hot Spots for Human Trafficking - The A21 Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffickers are using social media at an increasing rate to find victims, research potential victims, control their victims and advertise their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollingout.com/criminal-behavior/fbi-speaks-internet-social-media-impact-sex-trafficking-pt-3/#_|title=How the internet and social media impact sex trafficking|date=7 April 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/humantrafficking_online_the_role_of_social_networking_sites_and_online_classifieds_1.pdf Human Trafficking Online: The Role of Social Networking Sites and Online Classifieds]&lt;/ref&gt;  Traffickers often target people who post things that indicate that they are depressed, have low self-esteem or are angry with their parents.&lt;ref name="technology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologyandtrafficking.usc.edu/primary-research-diffusion-of-technology-facilitated-human-trafficking|title=Primary Research: Diffusion of Technology-Facilitated Human Trafficking · Technology &amp; Human Trafficking|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traffickers also use social media posts to establish patterns and track the locations of potential victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicholsonstudentmedia.com/news/careless-use-of-social-media-increases-human-trafficking-rate-in/article_7f87d66c-e110-11e5-b7b0-0755ef73bb8d.html|title=Careless use of social media increases human trafficking rate in Florida|first=Eric|last=Scott|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the victim has joined the offender, various techniques are used to restrict the victim's access to communication with home, such as imposing physical punishment unless the victim complies with the trafficker's demands and making threats of harm and even death to the victim and their family.&lt;ref name="trafficking_and_internet" /&gt; Sometimes, the victims will succumb to the [[Stockholm Syndrome]] because their captors will pretend to "love" and "need" them, even going so far as promise marriage and future stability. This is particularly effective with younger victims, because they are more inexperienced and therefore easily manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Walker-Rodriguez |first1=Amanda |first2= Rodney |last2=Hill |url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/law-enforcement-bulletin/march_2011/human_sex_trafficking |title=Human Sex Trafficking |work=FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin |date=March 2011 |accessdate= 7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, those who traffic young girls into prostitution are often women who have been trafficked themselves. As adults they use personal relationships and trust in their villages of origin to recruit additional girls.&lt;ref name="Maplecroft811"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafficking A global phenomenon with an exploration of India through maps|url=http://www.maplecroft.com|publisher=Maplecroft|accessdate=December 25, 2012|author=Alyson Warhurst|author2=Cressie Strachan |author3=Zahed Yousuf |author4=Siobhan Tuohy-Smith |page=51|format=PDF|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some (migrating) prostitutes (See: [[migrant sex work]]) can become victims of human trafficking because the women know they will be working as prostitutes; however, they are given an inaccurate description by their "boss" of the circumstances. Therefore, they consequently get exploited due to their misconception of what conditions to expect of their sex work in the new destination country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Gang-controlled trafficking===

Gang-controlled sex trafficking and Pimp-controlled sex trafficking run their operations in very similar ways. The largest difference between the two is that gang-controlled trafficking is run by a large group of people whereas pimp-controlled trafficking is run by only one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Rapid Assessment on Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking|url=http://sharedhope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MS-Rapid-Assessment-22715.pdf|journal=Shared Hope|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, gang members are expected or forced to participate in tasks that involve illegal and violent activity. Some of these criminal behaviors may include: distributing drugs, robbery, trafficking drugs, extortion, and murder.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-national-gang-report-2015.pdf/view|title=National Gang Report 2015|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One money making source that many people do not necessarily associate with gangs is human sex trafficking. Gangs are now turning to sex trafficking as it is seen as safer and more lucrative than drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Rapid Assessment on Domestic Sex Trafficking|url=http://sharedhope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MS-Rapid-Assessment-22715.pdf|journal=Shared Hope|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gangs can make larger amounts of money quicker by selling other people’s bodies, and are less likely to get caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nsvrc.org/news/news-field/15778|title=Innocence Lost: Gangs and Sex Trafficking {{!}} National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC)|website=www.nsvrc.org|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421113113/http://www.nsvrc.org/news/news-field/15778|archive-date=2017-04-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain circumstances, gangs may team up with other gangs in the area, and work together as a sex ring. There are a number of different reasons that gangs make this decision. One reason is that it enables them to increase profits by trading different girls, women, boys or men. This gives their client, also known as a john, a greater variety of options to choose from. Clients are often willing to pay a larger price for a sexual experience with someone new. Another reason that gangs will share females is because this makes it more difficult for law enforcement to keep track of the victims, ultimately preventing them from making a positive identification.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

When people think or talk about sex trafficking a very common question people will ask is, “where do they find people to traffic?”. In many cases, gang members will scope girls out at malls, skip parties, online and through social media. In addition, they often will seek out female runaways from their neighborhood. Many of the girls they look for have been physically or sexually abused, have low self-esteem, struggle with drug and alcohol dependency, or are seeking a home/family environment.&lt;ref name="Gang - Involved Sex Trafficking"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humantraffickinghotline.org/resources/gang-involved-sex-trafficking|title=Gang - Involved Sex Trafficking|date=2014-09-28|work=National Human Trafficking Hotline|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the gang to sex traffic an individual, the first thing they need to do is gain that person's trust. They shower the victim with praise and attention, making her feel important and desired. This is referred to as the Romeo Method. It consists of different manipulation techniques. A member will take her to a fancy restaurant, flounder her with lavish gifts, and take her to parties where they are provided with endless supplies of drugs and alcohol. They also learn their weaknesses at the same time, find his or her vulnerabilities and once they find that soft spot they can use it against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lederer|first=Laura|date=|title=Sold for Sex: The Link between Street Gangs and Trafficking in Persons|url=http://www.globalcenturion.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Sold-for-Sex-The-Link-between-Street-Gangs-and-Trafficking-in-Persons-1.pdf|journal=The Protection Project Journal of Human Rights and Civil Society|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gang members often wear certain types of clothing or colors to prove their commitment or loyalty to the gang. It is also very common to represent your gang by branding your body with tattoos.&lt;ref name="Gang - Involved Sex Trafficking" /&gt; Unfortunately, many victims of sex trafficking are being branded as well. By forcing a tattoo onto their victims they are essentially marking their territory and officially displaying ownership of that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Jan|date=2014|title=Into Hell: Gang-Prostitution of Minors|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1383&amp;context=crsj|journal=Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice|volume=20|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the short film, Unbranded: Sex Trafficking Tattoo Removal, Vice Media dives deep into the recovery stages of a young girl who was trafficked for three years.

===Familial trafficking===
In familial trafficking, the victim is controlled by family members who allow them to be sexually exploited in exchange for something of value, such as drugs or money.  For example, a mother may allow a boyfriend to abuse a child in exchange for housing.  Usually, it begins with one family member and spreads from there.  Familial trafficking may be difficult to detect because these children often have a larger degree of freedom and may still attend school and after-school functions.  These children may not understand that they are being trafficked or may not have a way out. Familial trafficking is considered by some to be the most prevalent form of human sex trafficking within the United States. &lt;ref name="rapidassessment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharedhope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MS-Rapid-Assessment-22715.pdf|title=Shared Hope International: Rapid Assessment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of trafficking is also extremely common outside of the United States. Many families from impoverished areas (India, Thailand, Philippines, etc.) find themselves in situations where debt or tradition calls for the selling of a loved one, most commonly female. In Thailand there is a tradition known as ''bhun kun,''which establishes the youngest daughter as financially responsible for her parents as they grow old. Author Kara Siddharth interviewed a Thai victim who stated that, though she hated the men she was with, “she was proud to fulfill her duty to her parents in the form of tiny payments that the brothel owner sent to her father after her trafficking debts were repaid”. This is just one of the many countries whose lower class turn to this form of income. Many children are sold to repay debts, or merely to put food on the table for their family for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Trafficking: An Overview|last=Kara|first=Siddharth|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780231139618|location=New York|pages=1-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brock, J.

===Forced marriage===
{{Main article|Forced marriage}}

A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml|title=BBC - Ethics - Forced Marriages: Introduction|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Servile marriage'' is defined as a marriage involving a person being sold, transferred or inherited into that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/21-40/rip32.html|title=Forced and servile marriage in the context of human trafficking|work=aic.gov.au|date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ECPAT]], "Child trafficking for forced marriage is simply another manifestation of trafficking and is not restricted to particular nationalities or countries".&lt;ref name="ecpat.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecpat.org.uk/sites/default/files/forced_marriage_ecpat_uk_wise.pdf |title=Child Trafficking for Forced Marriage |accessdate=2014-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718000206/http://www.ecpat.org.uk/sites/default/files/forced_marriage_ecpat_uk_wise.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A forced marriage qualifies as a form of human trafficking in certain situations. If a woman is sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct with her new husband, then her experience is that of ''sex trafficking''. If the bride is treated as a domestic servant by her new husband and/or his family, then  this is a form of ''labor trafficking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://give.theahafoundation.org/blog-0/bid/149715/Forced-Marriage-and-the-Many-Faces-of-Human-Trafficking|title=Forced Marriage and the Many Faces of Human Trafficking|work=theahafoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Forced Marriage: 
Approximately 140 million girls who are under the age of 18, which is about 39,00 a day, are forced into early marriages. Forced marriage, which is identified by the United Nations as “contemporary form of slavery,” occurs without full consent of the man or women and is associated with threats by family members or the bride/groom. Forced Marriage occurs not only in foreign countries but as well in the U.S.A. The service providers in the United States cannot successfully respond to the forced marriage cases because they lack clarity and a true definition of what a forced marriage is.

===Survival sex===
In survival sex, the victim is not necessarily controlled by another person but feels they have to perform sexual acts in order to obtain basic commodities to survive. In addition to money, persons engaging in survival sex may trade sexual favors for food, shelter, or drugs &lt;ref name="rapidassessment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=National Network for Youth |date=6 March 2008 |title=Consequences of Youth Homelessness |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.nn4youth.org/wp-content/uploads/IssueBrief_Youth_Homelessness.pdf |access-date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most reported cases are the youth that perform sexual acts for shelter or a place to sleep. Within the youth experiences of survival sex, 8.1% of females, males, and transgender are victims. Those who perform the trafficking include immediate family, boyfriends, employers, and strangers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Relationship between Sex Trafficking and Survival Sex|url=https://humantraffickinghotline.org/sites/default/files/Homelessness%2C%20Survival%20Sex%2C%20and%20Human%20Trafficking%20-%20Covenant%20House%20NY.pdf|website=Covenant House|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are at a higher risk of survival sex include runaways, homeless, foster kids, and orphans. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Human Trafficking?|url=https://www.hercampus.com/school/vcu/what-you-need-know-about-human-trafficking-1|website=What you need to know about human trafficking|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profile of victims==
There is no single profile for victims of human trafficking. Most are women, though it is not uncommon for males to be trafficked as well. Victims are captured then exploited all around the world, representing a diverse range of ages and backgrounds, including ethnic and socioeconomic. However, there is a set group of traits associated with a higher risk of becoming trafficked for sexual exploitation. Persons at risk include homeless and runaway youth, foreign nationals (especially those of lower socioeconomic status), and those who have experienced physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, violent trauma, neglect, poor academic success, and inadequate social skills.&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Victims|url=http://www.traffickingresourcecenter.org/what-human-trafficking/human-trafficking/victims|website=www.traffickingresourcecenter.org|publisher=National Human Trafficking Resource Center|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a study of a group of female sex workers in Canada found that 64 percent of the women had been in the child welfare system as children (this includes foster and group homes).&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare" /&gt; This research conducted by Kendra Nixon illustrates how children in or leaving foster care are at a higher risk of becoming a sex worker.&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare" /&gt; 

In the United States, research has illustrated how these qualities hold true for victims, even though none can be labeled as a direct cause.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; For example, more than 50 percent of domestic minor sex trafficking victims have a history of homelessness.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Familial disruptions such as divorce or the death of a parent place minors at a higher risk of entering the industry, but home life in general influences children's risk. In a study of trafficked youth in Arizona, 20 to 40 percent of female victims identified with experiencing abuse of some form (sexual or physical) at home before entering into the industry as a sex slave.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; For the males interviewed, a smaller proportion, 0 to 30 percent, reported former abuse in the home.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt;

Children are at risk because of their vulnerable characteristics; naïve outlook, size, and tendency to be easily intimidated".&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=Gretchen|last2=McGlone|first2=Mandy|title=Entry, Progression, Exit, and Service Provision for Survivors of Sex Trafficking: Implications for Effective Interventions|journal=Global Social Welfare|date=March 22, 2014|volume=1|issue=4|pages=157–168|doi=10.1007/s40609-014-0010-0}}, citing {{Cite journal|title=Human trafficking is more than sex trafficking and prostitution: implications for social work|author=Maria Beatriz Alvarez, Edward J.

Children do not need to be forced into sexual exploitation according to the Victims Protection Law to be considered victims of Sex Trafficking. Under this act a child is defined as anyone under the age of 18, however the exploitation of children under the age of 14 carries a harsher punishment, though this is rarely enforced. The Bureau of Justice Statistics states that 100,000 children who fall under the age of 18 are trafficked daily in the United States, and only 150 child trafficking cases have been brought to court. Many children who are trafficked are also at higher risk of turning to prostitution, a crime that many of them face criminal charges for, even under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mehlman-Orozco|first=Kimberly|date=2015|title=Safe Harbor Policies for Juvenile Victims of Sex Trafficking: A Myopic View of Improvements in Practice|url=|journal=Open Access Journal|volume=3|pages=52-62|via=Cogitatio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main motive of a woman (in some cases, an underage girl) to accept an offer from a trafficker is better financial opportunities for herself or her family. A study on the origin countries of trafficking confirms that most trafficking victims are not the poorest in their countries of origin, and sex trafficking victims are likely to be women from countries with some freedom to travel alone and some economic freedom.&lt;ref name="rao"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rao | first1 = Smriti | last2 = Presenti'' | first2 = Christina | year = 2012 | title = Understanding Human Trafficking Origin: A Cross-Country Empirical Analysis | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 231–263 [233–234] | doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.680978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous fake businesses that sound realistic that convince people to apply for the job. Some places have a reputation for holding an illegal business in order to attract their victims. Not only do fake businesses attract victims but those who are in relationships are even in danger. Men will find vulnerable women and start dating them. As the relationship progresses, the boyfriend will tell his girlfriend that no one else would basically love her like he did and soon convince her that she needs to go to place to place to get trafficked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Consequences to victims==
Sex trafficked people face similar health consequences to women exploited for labor purposes, people who have experienced domestic violence, and migrant women.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Cathy|title=The health risks and consequences of trafficking in women and adolescents: Findings from a European study|journal=London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the sex workers contract sexual transmitted infections (STIs).&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; In a study conducted by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, "only one of 23 trafficked women interviewed felt well-informed about sexually transmitted infections or HIV before leaving home."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman" /&gt;  Without knowledge about this aspect of their health, trafficked women may not take the necessary preventative steps and contract these infections and have poor health seeking behavior in the future.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman" /&gt; The mental health implications range from depression to anxiety to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) due to the abuse and violence victims face from their pimps or "Johns".&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; With such a mindset many individuals develop alcohol or drug addictions and abusive habits.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt; Also, traffickers commonly coerce or force their sex workers to use alcohol or drugs when they are in childhood or adolescence.&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare" /&gt;  Many victims use these substances as a coping mechanism or escape which further promotes the rate of addiction in this population.&lt;ref name="Global Social Welfare" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study conducted by J. Potterat ''et al.'', it was determined that the average lifespan for women engaged in prostitution in Colorado Springs was 34 years.&lt;ref name="Arizona" /&gt;

==Around the world==

===Africa===
Sex trafficking of women and children is the second most common type of trafficking for export in Africa.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; In Ghana, "connection men" or traffickers are witnessed regularly at border crossings and transport individuals via fake visas. Women are most commonly trafficked to Belgium, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, the Netherlands, Nigeria, and the United States.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States are also common destination countries for trafficked Nigerian women.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; In Uganda, the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], traffics individuals to Sudan to sell them as sex slaves.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; The Nigerian syndicates dominate sex trades in multiple territories. The syndicates recruit women from South Africa and send them to Europe and Asia, where they are forced into prostitution, drug smuggling, or domestic violence. Law enforcement reported that sex traffickers force drug use to persuade these unwilling women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258860.htm|title=South Africa|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
The key hubs for both source transportation and destination of the sub-region of Asia include India, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; India is a major hub for trafficked Bangladeshi and Nepali women.&lt;ref name="Gender and Human Rights in the Commonwealth" /&gt; In India itself, there are an estimated 3 million sex workers and 40% of those sex workers are trafficked children, mostly girls from ethnic minorities and lower castes.

=== Iran ===
Iran is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Iranian girls between the ages of 13 and 17 are targeted by traffickers for sale abroad; younger girls may be forced into domestic service until their traffickers consider them old enough to be subjected to child sex trafficking. An increase in the transport of girls from and through Iran en route to other Gulf States for sexual exploitation has been reported from 2009-2015; during the reporting period, Iranian trafficking networks subjected Iranian girls to sex trafficking in brothels in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Organized criminal groups kidnap or purchase and force Iranian and immigrant children to work as beggars and street vendors in cities, including Tehran. These children, who may be as young as 3, are coerced through physical and sexual abuse and drug addiction; reportedly many are purchased for as little as $150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258786.htm|title=Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of girls from Iran are brought to Pakistan to be sold as sex slaves every day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Iran.htm|title=Human Trafficking &amp; Modern-day Slavery - Iran|website=gvnet.com|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these women have already been raped within the first 24 hours of their departure.&lt;ref name="Uncensored"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/reporters-uncensored/irans-dark-secret-child-p_b_262222.html|title=Iran's Dark Secret: Child Prostitution and Sex Slaves|last=Uncensored|first=Reporters|date=2009-09-19|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said in the Tehran newspapers that senior figures from the government have been involved in buying, selling, and abusing young women and children. Runaway girls in Iran are sought out for by the traffickers because it is incredibly easy to put them in the sex trafficking market since they have no home.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; There are about 84,000 women and girls in prostitution in Tehran. Most of them are on the streets, while others are in the 250 brothels.&lt;ref name="Uncensored" /&gt;

=== Israel ===
The trafficking of women into prostitution in Israel began in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Combating Trafficking for Prostitution in Israel |url=http://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/Trafficking/HumanTrafficking/Sexualexploitation/Pages/struggleprostitutiontraffickingisrael.aspx |website=Office of the National Anti-Trafficking Coordinator |accessdate=31 May 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimate of three thousand women were being trafficked in the 1990s and early 2000s. Many of the women came from “post-Soviet states particularly Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and many more.” The women ended up in brothels where they worked seven days a week and served up to 30 clients a day. The traffickers used physical violence and threats to dissuade the women from leaving, they also confined women behind locked doors and barred windows. Throughout the 1990s the Israeli authorities failed to view sex trafficking as a problem, they simply viewed it as prostitution. They failed to interfere with brothel operations. If a case was filed the trafficker would have had a plea bargain with light punishment. The women who were being trafficked on the other hand were classified as illegal alien or criminals since they entered Israel illegally, so authorities concentrated on catching the women rather than the traffickers. Usually the victims of trafficking are vulnerable because they live in poverty, or they are not educated. Trafficking affects the mental health of the victim as well as physical health. Israel has become a country of destination for women who had been trafficked from surrounding countries.

Israel was ranked Tier 1 in the 2016 U.S. State Department Trafficking in Persons Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258789.htm|title=Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tier 1 is the highest ranking given to a government that has acknowledged human trafficking and has made efforts to solve the problem. Israel has tried to improve and protect the victims affected by sex trafficking. Israel has been providing victims of human sex trafficking with shelter and protection against the sex traffickers. These have been some of many steps taken to lower the number of women who have been affected by the traffickers. Although many say that the shelters that they provide are not sufficient for the victims, it has been seen that the number of  women affected has declined since 2006. The anti-trafficking law of 2006 describes penalties of up to 16 years of imprisonment for trafficking an adult, 20 years for trafficking a child, 16 years for slavery and up to seven years for forced labor.

==Public health response==
=== Healthcare interventions ===
There are many [[public health]] initiatives that are being implemented to identify victims of sex trafficking. There are few professionals that are likely to encounter victims of sex trafficking, but healthcare providers are a unique group because they are more likely to come into contact with individuals that are still in captivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Educating Healthcare Professionals on Human Trafficking | date=2014-12-30 | work=Pediatric Emergency Care |language=en|pmc = 4392380}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The National Human Trafficking Resource Center provides guidelines to aid healthcare providers in identifying victims of sex trafficking. They provide general guidelines to indicate human trafficking (i.e. inconsistent/scripted history, unwillingness to answer questions about illness or injury, etc.), but also includes indicators to hone in on sex trafficking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humantraffickinghotline.org/resources/what-look-healthcare-setting|title=What to look for in a healthcare setting|date=2016|work=National Human Trafficking Hotline|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, this network has created a framework for sex trafficking protocols in healthcare settings once a victim is suspected or identified. The goal of the protocol is to provide those interacting with the patient step-by-step instructions on how to proceed once a potential trafficking victim has been identified&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://humantraffickinghotline.org/resources/framework-human-trafficking-protocol-healthcare-settings|title=Framework for a Human Trafficking Protocol in Healthcare settings|date=2016|work=National Human Trafficking Hotline|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, an initiative known as the HEAL Trafficking and Hope for Justice Protocol Toolkit is being made accessible to healthcare providers&lt;ref&gt;	{{Cite news|url=https://healtrafficking.org/2017/06/new-heal-trafficking-and-hope-for-justices-protocol-toolkit-for-developing-a-response-to-victims-of-human-trafficking-in-health-care-settings/|title=HEAL Trafficking|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The goal of the toolkit is to provide a uniform medical response to trafficking. The toolkit combines known policies and procedures with tenets of trauma informed care. The toolkit is intended for the use of different healthcare providers such as community health workers, social workers, mental health counselors, nurses, and many others.
A second initiative was taken on by the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. They have started to implement new fields of data collection through [[International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD) in order to better identify and categorize cases of sex trafficking. The new fields are ICD-10-CM codes. These are further categorized into T codes and Z codes.  The T codes are further subcategorized into specific diagnoses that are used to indicate suspected and confirmed cases of trafficking. In addition, Z codes are also further categorized, but will be used for examination or observation of trafficking victims for other reasons&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/otip/news/icd-10|title=CDC Adds New Human Trafficking Data Collection Fields for Healthcare Providers|date=2016-06-14|work=National Human Trafficking Hotline|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Approximately 87.8% of trafficking victims have come in contact with a healthcare professional either during of after their time of exploitation and labor. On February 26, 2018, the [https://www.acf.hhs.gov/otip/about/what-is-human-trafficking Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP)] under the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/767/actions SOAR to Health and Wellness Act of 2018].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/767/actions|title=SOAR to Health and Wellness Act|date=2017-01-31|work= Energy and Commerce Committee|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}
&lt;/ref&gt; SOAR which is an acronym which stands for Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond is a training program which aims to properly equip professionals with the necessary resources and methods to identify victims of human trafficking. The training aids to help others recognize key indicators and characteristics of human trafficking as well as aid in key communication techniques that are effective for everyone involved. Response tactics can be key to identifying victims without causing harm and putting them in increased danger. The trainings also provide key communities with the support and resources they may need to bring attention to a crime which may be heavily impacting that area.  The training can either be taken online or in person and can be personalized based the role of the professional. SOAR is available to anyone who who may be interested in learning how to identify victims or situations of human trafficking in a healthcare setting. The training can either be taken online or in person and can be personalized based the role of the professional. SOAR is available to anyone who who may be interested in learning how to identify victims or situations of human trafficking in a healthcare setting. Trainings are available for social workers, medical and public health professionals, and even educators.

Physicians against the trafficking of humans ([https://www.doc-path.org/path PATH]) is a program of the [https://www.amwa-doc.org American Medical Women's Association (AMWA)] that was started in 2014 with efforts to encourage medical professionals including physicians, residents, and medical students to become more aware of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.amwa-doc.org/our-work/initiatives/human-trafficking/|title=Physicians Against Trafficking of Humans|date=2018|work= AWMA|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The initiative was initially brought into discussion by Dr. Gayatri Devi in 2012 who was the president of AMWA at the time. She identified human sex trafficking as a key issue to be addressed. This discussion then progressed into forming a Human Trafficking Committee to handle the issue. PATH has since been creating content for hospitals and other medical facilities to use in order to educate professionals and students on the identification and advocacy for human trafficking. PATH has also been featured in many media outlets such as [https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/09/dc-conference-to-focus-on-teaching-providers-how-to-spot-trafficking-025769 Politico] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrxhptvEOTs TEDx].

There are three main tactics social workers use to aid in the recovery of sex trafficking survivors: ecological, strengths-based, and victim-centered&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busch-Armendariz|first=Noël|last2=Nsonwu|first2=Maura Busch|last3=Heffron|first3=Laurie Cook|date=January 2014|title=A kaleidoscope: The role of the social work practitioner and the strength of social work theories and practice in meeting the complex needs of people trafficked and the professionals that work with them|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0020872813505630|journal=International Social Work|language=en|volume=57|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1177/0020872813505630|issn=0020-8728}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Using the ecological approach, the social worker evaluates their client's current environment and goals for reintegration into the community. By examining how justice systems, legal, and medical services impact their client, they can help them look into areas of future employment, gaining legal status, and reuniting with family. The strengths-based approach aims to create a bond of trust between the social worker and their client to build confidence as well as autonomy and leadership skills. Lastly, when using the victim-centered approach, social workers develop services and plans for the future specifically catered to their client’s individual needs. These services are developed through a survivor’s lens, which allows social workers to easily meet the needs of their clients. All three methods have proven to be effective in the recovery of sex trafficking survivors&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

===Control tactics to facilitate intervention===
There are many control tactics used by sex traffickers in order to control their victims such as: threats, physical and sexual assault, confiscating legitimate travel and immigration documents, and verbalizing threats against the victims family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Sex Trafficking Into the United States: A Literature Review | date=2006 | work=Criminal Justice Review |language=en| doi=10.1177/0734016806290136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The University of Minnesota Duluth published the power and control wheel to help target domestic abuse intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theduluthmodel.org/what-is-the-duluth-model/|title=What is the Duluth Model?|date=2017|work=Domestic Abuse Intervention Program|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The wheel identifies eight different mechanisms of power and control used on victims including: intimidation, emotional abuse, isolation, denying, blaming, and minimizing, sexual abuse, physical abuse, using privilege, economic abuse, as well as coercion and threats. The wheel was developed to be used in counseling and education groups for victims of sex trafficking. The wheel breaks down the tactics used against victims so the cycle of violence may become visible and stopped. [[File:Power and control wheel.jpg|thumb| Abbreviated version of the Power and Control Wheel]]
A second mechanism used to understand control is the BITE Model created by [[Steven Hassan]]. The BITE Model describes four categories of coercion used on sex trafficking victims: behavior control, information control, thought control, and emotional control&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://old.freedomofmind.com/Services/HumanTraffickingBITE.php|title=Steven Hassan's Human Trafficking BITE Model|date=2014|work=Freedom of Mind Resource Center|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He describes that it is essential to understand the loss of identity victims experience in order to help them get out or recover from sex trafficking.

==Anti-sex trafficking efforts==

===History of international legislation===

International pressure to address trafficking in women and children became a growing part of the social [[Reform movement]] in the United States and Europe during the late nineteenth century. International legislation against the trafficking of women and children began with the conclusion of an international convention in 1901, and the [[International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic]] in 1904. (The latter was revised in 1910.) The first formal international research into the issue was funded by American philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller]], through the American Bureau of Social Hygiene. The [[League of Nations]], formed in 1919, took over as the international coordinator of legislation intended to end the trafficking of women and children. An international Conference on White Slave Traffic was held in 1921, attended by the 34 countries that ratified the 1901 and 1904 conventions.&lt;ref name="Berkovitch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitzka|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another convention against trafficking was ratified by League members in 1922, and like the 1904 international convention, this one required ratifying countries to submit annual reports on their progress in tackling the problem. Compliance with this requirement was not complete, although it gradually improved: in 1924, approximately 34 percent of the member countries submitted reports as required: this rose to 46 percent in 1929, 52 percent in 1933, and 61 percent in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkovitch|first=Nitzka|title=From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women's Rights and International Organizations|year=1999|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801860287|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[1921 International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]] was sponsored by the League of Nations. In 1923, a committee from the bureau was tasked with investigating trafficking in 28 countries, interviewing approximately 5,000 informants and analyzing information over two years before issuing its final report. This was the first formal report on trafficking in women and children to be issued by an official body.&lt;ref name="Berkovitch" /&gt;

Efforts to combat sex trafficking are often linked to efforts against prostitution; however, this is often problematic in regards to legal recourse of sex trafficking victims. While prostitutes are nominally working by choice, sex trafficking victims do so under duress. Recognizing this, many states have passed legislation that allows sex trafficking victims amnesty under prostitution laws, however many fail to do so due to legal illiteracy and institutional prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnard|first=Alyssa M.|date=2014-01-01|title="THE SECOND CHANCE THEY DESERVE": VACATING CONVICTIONS OF SEX TRAFFICKING VICTIMS|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=114|issue=6|pages=1463–1501|jstor=23932264}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, sex trafficking victims often risk legal persecution when alerting authorities to their situation.

[[Jane Addams]] was one of the most notable reformers during the Progressive Era and refined the still early concepts of white slavery and sex work in her book "A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil”. She, among others, fought to classify all people coerced into prostitution as victims of sexual slavery, and believed that all sex work was sexual exploitation of women by more powerful men. Addams also believed that abolishing white slavery would bring more women into the suffrage movement. Alex Smolak, a physician, has studied many of the health risks faced by women in white slavery during the Progressive era. She says in her article titled “White Slavery, Whorehouse Riots, Venereal Disease, and Saving Women..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 3703872 | pmid=23805804 | doi=10.1080/19371918.2011.592083 | volume=28 | issue=5 | title=White slavery, whorehouse riots, venereal disease, and saving women: historical context of prostitution interventions and harm reduction in New York City during the Progressive Era | journal=Soc Work Public Health | pages=496–508 | last1 = Smolak | first1 = A| year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that “The Progressive Era was a time when society was rapidly changing, with influences stemming from urbanization, industrialization, commercialization, immigration, and civilizing morality, all interacting with one another to fuel both prostitution and the anti-prostitution movement.” Along with “The U.S. White Slave act of 1910”, the “International Agreement for the Suppression of the White Slave Trade” was ratified by 13 nations, including the United States in 1904. Throughout the next 45 years the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children was adopted by the League of Nations and the term white slavery was replaced by trafficking, the word used commonly today.[[File:60000girls.png|thumb|170px|Wanted 60,000 girls to take the place of 60,000 white slaves who will die this year]]
The first formal international research into the scope of the problem was funded by American philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller]], through the American Bureau of Social Hygiene.

===United Nations===
{{Main article|United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking}}

The first international protocol dealing with sex slavery was the 1949 UN [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of Prostitution of Others]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polis.osce.org/library/f/3655/2833/UN-USA-RPT-3655-EN-Text%20of%20the%20Convention.pdf |title=Convention For The Suppression Of The Traffic In Persons And Of The Exploitation Of The Prostitution Of Others |accessdate=2015-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054644/http://polis.osce.org/library/f/3655/2833/UN-USA-RPT-3655-EN-Text%20of%20the%20Convention.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This convention followed the abolitionist idea of sex trafficking as incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person. Serving as a model for future legislation, the 1949 UN Convention was not ratified by every country, but came into force in 1951.  These early efforts led to the 2000 Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, mentioned [[Human trafficking#Overview and differentiation|above]]. These instruments contain the elements of the current international law on trafficking in humans.

In 2011, the United Nations reported that girl victims made up two-thirds of all trafficked children.  Girls constituted 15 to 20 percent of the total number of all detected victims, whereas boys comprised about 10 percent. The UN report was based on official data supplied by 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNODC|title=Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2012|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/Trafficking_in_Persons_2012_web.pdf|publisher=United Nations publication, Sales No. E.13.IV.1|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a resolution to create the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons was adopted by the United Nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/news/uswirestory.asp?ID=15114|title=Feminist Wire Daily Newsbriefs: U.S. and Global News Coverage|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first World Day against Trafficking in Persons took place July 30, 2014, and the day is now observed every July 30.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;

Current international treaties include the [[Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages]], entered into force in 1964.

===In the United States===

[[File:Stopping Sex Trafficking in the United States (10445204615).jpg|thumb|Louise Slaughter testifies at a Ways &amp; Means Human Resources Subcommittee hearing on October 23, 2013. Louise testified in strong support of a bill she has co-sponsored with Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-MN) that address the high rate of children in foster care being recruited into sex trafficking within the United States. (10445204615)|left]]
In 1910, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Mann Act|White Slave Traffic Act of 1910]] (better known as the Mann Act), which made it a [[felony]] to transport women across state borders for the purpose of "prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose". Its primary stated intent was to address prostitution, immorality, and human trafficking particularly where it was trafficking for the purposes of prostitution, but the ambiguity of "immorality" effectively criminalized [[interracial marriage]] and banned single women from crossing state borders for morally wrong acts. In 1914, of the women arrested for crossing state borders under this act, 70 percent were charged with voluntary prostitution. Once the idea of a sex slave shifted from a white woman to an enslaved woman from countries in poverty, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country in order to address this issue. (The government had other unrelated motives for the new immigration policies.) Several acts such as the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and [[Immigration Act of 1924]] reduced the number of emigrants from Europe and Asia from entering the United States. Following the increased restrictions of the 1920s (which were significantly relaxed by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] and [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]]), human trafficking was not considered a major issue until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="candidate"&gt;Candidate, Jo Doezema Ph.D. "Loose women or lost women?

The Commercial Sex Act&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1591&lt;/ref&gt; makes it illegal to recruit, entice, obtain, provide, move or harbor a person or to benefit from such activities knowing that the person will be caused to engage in commercial sex acts where the person is under 18 or where force, fraud or coercion exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop Sex Trafficking.|url=https://awasartn.org/HUMAN_TRAFFICKING.html|accessdate=2010-03-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427175810/https://awasartn.org/HUMAN_TRAFFICKING.html|archivedate=2011-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Victims Of Trafficking And Violence Protection Act of 2000.| url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[George W. Bush]] Administration, fighting sex slavery worldwide and domestically became a priority with an average of $100 million spent per year, which substantially outnumbers the amount spent by other countries. Before President Bush took office, Congress passed the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] (TVPA). The TVPA strengthened services to victims of violence, law enforcement's ability to reduce violence against women and children, and education against human trafficking. Also specified in the TVPA was a mandate to collect funds for the treatment of sex trafficking victims that provided them with shelter, food, education, and financial grants. Internationally, the TVPA set standards that governments of other countries must follow in order to receive aid from the U.S. to fight human trafficking. Once [[George W. Bush]] took office in 2001, restricting sex trafficking became one of his primary humanitarian efforts. The Attorney General under President Bush, [[John Ashcroft]], strongly enforced the TVPA.  The Act was subsequently renewed in 2004, 2006, and 2008. It established two stipulations an applicant has to meet in order to receive the benefits of a [[T visa|T-Visa]]. First, a trafficked victim must prove/admit to being trafficked and second must submit to prosecution of his or her trafficker.  In 2011, Congress failed to re-authorize the Act.  The State Department publishes an annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which examines the progress that the U.S. and other countries have made in destroying human trafficking businesses, arresting the kingpins, and rescuing the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Soderlund, Gretchen.

===Council of Europe===
Complementary protection is ensured through the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] (signed in [[Lanzarote]], 25 October 2007). The Convention entered into force on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=201&amp;CM=1&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 44 states, with another 3 states having signed but not yet ratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201/signatures|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the Convention is to provide the framework for an independent and effective monitoring system that holds the member states accountable for addressing human trafficking and providing protecting to victims.&lt;ref name="CoE Convention"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Council of Europe|title=Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings|date=2005|publisher=Council of Europe|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/Source/PDF_Conv_197_Trafficking_Erev.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To monitor the implementation of this act, the Council of Europe established the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA).&lt;ref name="Council of Europe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Council of Europe|title=About GRETA|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/Docs/Monitoring/GRETA_en.asp#TopOfPage|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention address the structure and purpose of GRETA and holds the group accountable to publish reports evaluating the measures taken by the states who have signed the Convention.&lt;ref name="Council of Europe" /&gt;

===Other government actions===
Actions taken to combat human trafficking vary from government to government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cho, Seo-Young, Axel Dreher and Eric Neumayer (2011), The Spread of Anti-trafficking Policies - Evidence from a New Index, Cege Discussion Paper Series No. 119, Georg-August-University of Goettingen, Germany. |url=http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/document/download/77423e5166dffaed5d33b58c35d504b5.pdf/119_Cho.pdf | accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some government actions include:

* introducing legislation specifically aimed at criminalizing human trafficking;
* developing co-operation between law enforcement agencies and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] (NGOs) of numerous nations; and
* raising awareness of the issue.

Raising awareness can take three forms. First, governments can raise awareness among potential victims, particularly in countries where human traffickers are active. Second, they can raise awareness amongst the police, social welfare workers and immigration officers to equip them to deal appropriately with the problem. And finally, in countries where prostitution is legal or semi-legal, they can raise awareness amongst the clients of prostitution so that they can watch for signs of human trafficking victims. Methods to raise general awareness often include television programs, documentary films, internet communications, and posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Criticism===
{{Main article|human trafficking#Criticism}}

Many countries have come under criticism for inaction, or ineffective action. Criticisms include the failure of governments to properly identify and protect trafficking victims, enactment of immigration policies which potentially [[re-victimize]] trafficking victims, and insufficient action in helping prevent vulnerable populations from becoming trafficking victims.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} A particular criticism has been the reluctance of some countries to tackle trafficking for purposes other than sex.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Studies of sex work and anti-sex trafficking efforts, intended to combat sex trafficking or provide support to victims, have raised concerns over the unintended effects of certain national and international policies, law enforcement strategies, and activist efforts  on both sex-trafficked individuals and non-trafficked sex workers. For example, The United States' Tier 2 assessment of Japan on its 2004 TIP Report &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/|title=Trafficking in Persons Report|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged the Japanese government to add additional constraints to its procedures and policies for obtaining an entertainer visa, sometimes used by migrant workers seeking employment at businesses within the sex industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Illicit flirtations : labor, migration, and sex trafficking in Tokyo|last=Salazar.|first=Parreñas, Rhacel|date=2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804778169|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=763155680}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these regulations provided opportunities for some third-party facilitators of these visas to exploit migrants while also limiting migrants' ability to leave employers with poor working conditions or overly restrictive practices, such as holding their passports or limiting their ability to leave the premises of the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Illicit flirtations : labor, migration, and sex trafficking in Tokyo|last=Salazar.|first=Parreñas, Rhacel|date=2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804778169|location=Stanford, Calif.|oclc=763155680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the move for love : migrant entertainers and the U.S. military in South Korea|last=Sealing.|first=Cheng|date=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812206920|location=Philadelphia|oclc=794700706}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices of law enforcement officers in some countries have also been criticized for incentivizing non-trafficked sex workers to declare themselves to be trafficking victims and enter aid and rehabilitation programs in order to avoid prison sentences for prostitution charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dealing in desire : Asian ascendancy, Western decline, and the hidden currencies of global sex work|last=Kay|first=Hoang, Kimberly|isbn=9780520960688|location=Oakland, California|oclc=899739300|date = 2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)===
Many [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] work on the issue of sex trafficking. One major NGO is the [[International Justice Mission]] (IJM). IJM is a U.S.-based non-profit human rights organization that combats human trafficking in developing countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. IJM states that it is a "human rights agency that brings rescue to victims of slavery, sexual exploitation, and other forms of violent oppression." It is a faith-based organization since its purported goal is to "restore to victims of oppression the things that God intends for them: their lives, their liberty, their dignity, the fruits of their labor."&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]]|title="We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'…"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal= Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|page=149–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IJM receives over $900,000 from the US government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Boston.com |title=USAID Contracts with Faith Based Organizations |accessdate=March 14, 2012 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/special/faith_based/faith_based_organizations.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has two methods for rescuing victims: brothel raids in cooperation with local police, and "buy bust" operations in which undercover agencies pretend to purchase sex services from an underage girl. After the raid and rescue, the women are sent to rehabilitation programs run by NGOs (such as churches) or the government.

There are also national [[Non-governmental organizations]] working on the issue of human trafficking, including sex trafficking. In Kenya for example, [[Awareness Against Human Trafficking (HAART)]] works on ending all human trafficking in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Awareness against human trafficking HAART Kenya http://haartkenya.org&lt;/ref&gt; HAART has also participated in the UNANIMA International Stop the Demand campaign &lt;ref&gt;UNANIMA International Stop the Demand http://www.unanima-international.org/what-we-do/campaigns/stop-the-demand&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, J. Walter Thompson Amsterdam has opened a school called School for Justice. Here, survivors of sex trafficking are educated to become lawyers. The entire program is expected to take five to six years for each girl to complete. The women will graduate with law degrees, with a special focus on commercial sexual exploitation cases. JWT hopes that one day they may become prosecutors, or even judges, empowered to combat the criminals who once exploited and abused them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/jwt-is-training-former-underage-sex-workers-in-india-for-careers-in-law/|title=JWT Is Training Former Underage Sex Workers in India for Careers in Law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NGOs often have the best of intentions when combating sex-trafficking. NGOs are often funded by the West and are implemented in countries that have a very different culture. Research shows that employees of the Western NGOs are slow to adapt to the culture of the community they are providing services to. This often leads to a disconnect between the NGO and the community. Employees of NGOs hold the responsibility of relaying the narrative of sex-trafficked people. This can create a hierarchical structure that makes the voice of Western NGOs as more legitimate than the voice of the people they are serving. Thus, reinforcing the essentialized notion of third-world women as backwards and other.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamler|first=Erin Michelle|date=2013|title=Negotiating Narratives of Human Trafficking: NGOs, Communication and the Power of Culture|url=|journal=Journal of Intercultural Communication|volume=42|pages=73-90|doi=10.1080/17475759.2012.728147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan is a popular place for sex-trafficking. Japan has a long history with the trade of women for sex. For a good part of the countries history, sex work was legal in Japan. This makes it difficult for the government to decipher between legal sex work and illegal prostitution. This is where NGOs step in to assist the government. NGOs provide services in countries where the government policies are failing to combat a specific issue. However, in Japan it is difficult for NGOs focused on issues with women to receive local funding. This weak political support makes the work for NGOs in Japan much more difficult. Japan’s lack of support for women’s rights shows why the role of NGOs is so important in that country.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chie|first=Noyori-Corbett|last2=Moxley|first2=David|date=2018|title=Addressing Female Sex Trade Human Trafficking in Japan through NGO Advocacy Networks|url=|journal=International Social Work|volume=61|pages=954-967|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaigns and initiatives===
Public information campaigns are defined  “...government-directed and sponsored effort to communicate to the public or a segment of the public in order to achieve a policy result” (Majic 2017; Weiss &amp; Tschirhart 1994).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the past ten years, Spain has seen a surge of sex trafficking. In light of this crisis, social movements, organizations and government institutions have enacted policies like the Second National Plan against Sex Trafficking and Anti-Trafficking laws. Campaigns to fight against sex trafficking in Spain between 2008-2017 have been examined by researchers. Their research showed that that many campaigns focus on the narrative of the victim as vulnerable and weak, rather than focusing on the actual crime of sex trafficking and the economic system that allows it to flourish. According to the research these narratives disempower sex trafficked people through repeated language of vulnerability and innocence. The researchers explain that the lack of information provided in these campaigns hinders their success. Campaigns will throw out huge numbers of women exploited into sex work but gives no context to the system that allows sex trafficking to flourish.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saiz-Echezarreta|first=Vanessa et. al|date=2018|title=Advocacy of Trafficking Campaigns: A Controversy Story|url=|journal=Comunicar|volume=26|pages=29-38|doi=10.3916/C55-2018-03|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]] was established to combat trafficking in women on any grounds. It is an alliance of more than 100 non-governmental organizations from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaatw.org/|title=Home - The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW)|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorn (organization)|The Demi and Ashton (DNA) Foundation]] was created by celebrity [[humanitarians]] [[Demi Moore]] and [[Ashton Kutcher]] in 2009 in their efforts to fight human trafficking (specifically focusing on sex trafficking of children) in the U.S. In September 2010, the pair announced the launch of their "Real Men Don't Buy Girls" campaign to combat child sex trafficking alongside other [[Hollywood]] stars and [[technology]] companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Twitter]], and [[Facebook]]. "Real Men Don't Buy Girls" is based on the idea that high-profile men speaking out against child sex trafficking can help reduce the demand for young girls in the commercial sex trade. The popular TV channel [[MTV]] started a campaign to combat sex trafficking. The initiative called [[MTV EXIT]] (End Exploitation and Trafficking) is a multimedia initiative produced by MTV EXIT Foundation (formerly known as the MTV Europe Foundation) to raise awareness and increase prevention of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mtvexit.org/|title=Staying Alive Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalhand.org/en/browse/global_issues/20/all/organisation/38584|title=MTV EXIT Foundation (End Exploitation and Trafficking) - Corporate NGO partnerships|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another campaign is the [[A21 Campaign]], Abolishing Injustice in the 21st Century, which focuses on addressing human trafficking through a holistic approach.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.a21.org/content/our-solution/gkr9dk|title = Our Solution|date = |accessdate = April 28, 2015|website = The A21 Campgain|publisher = The A21 Campgain|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide potential victims with the education and valuable information on how to best reduce their likelihood of being trafficked through strategies that reduce their vulnerability. The organization also provides safe environments for victims and runs restoration programs in their aftercare facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, they provide legal council and representation to victims so they can prosecute their traffickers. Another key component of the campaign is to help influence legislation in order to enact more comprehensive laws that place more traffickers in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:Not For Sale girl.jpeg|left|thumb]]
The [[Not for Sale (organization)]] Campaign works in the United States, Peru, the Netherlands, Romania, Thailand, South Africa, and India to help victims of human trafficking. In 2013 alone, they provided 4,500 services to 2,062 individuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://notforsalecampaign.org/our-strategy/|title = Our Strategy|date = |accessdate = April 28, 2015|website = Not for Sale|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150428172821/http://notforsalecampaign.org/our-strategy/|archivedate = April 28, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of victims who received assistance were from the Netherlands and the number of victims served increased by 42 percent from 2012. The campaign allocates the majority of their funds to providing victims health and nutritional care and education. Not for Sale provides a safe shelter for victims and empowers them with life skills and job training.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This helps trafficked individuals re-enter into the workforce through a dignified form of work. In the organization's 2013 Annual Impact Report, it was determined that 75 percent of the victims had been sexually exploited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://notforsalecampaign.org/impact/2013-annual/|title = 2013 Annual Impact Report|date = |accessdate = April 27, 2015|website = Not for Sale|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20150428172824/http://notforsalecampaign.org/impact/2013-annual/|archivedate = April 28, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate sex trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the [[Super Bowl]]. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/30/the-superbowl-of-sex-trafficking.html|title=Michelle Goldberg, "The Super Bowl of Sex Trafficking," Newsweek, January 30, 2011.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Backpage website for the Dallas area experienced a 136 percent increase on the number of posts in the Adult section that Sunday. Typically, Sundays were known to be the day of the week with the lowest amount of posts in the Adult section. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads and found that most commonly used words suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl. Also, the self-reported ages were higher than usual which conveys that an older population of sex workers were drawn to the event, but since these are self-reported the data is not reliable. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mark"&gt;Latonero, Mark.

===='End Demand'====
End Demand refers to the strategy and efforts of different institutions that seek to end sex trafficking by eliminating and criminalizing the demand for both voluntary and involuntary commercial sex. End Demand is very popular in some countries including the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="berger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = Stephanie M | year = 2012 | title = No End In Sight: Why The "End Demand" Movement Is The Wrong Focus For Efforts To Eliminate Human Trafficking | url = | journal = Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 523–570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the End Demand strategy support initiatives such as "[[John's school]]s" that rehabilitate johns, increased arrests of johns, and public shaming (e.g. billboards and websites that publicly name johns who were caught).&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="desiree"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wortley | first1 = S. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = B. | last3 = Webster | first3 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Vice lessons: A survey of prostitution offenders enrolled in the Toronto John School Diversion Program | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Criminology | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 227–248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Monto | first1 = Martin A. | last2 = Garcia | first2 = Steve | year = 2001 | title = Recidivism Among the Customers of Female Street Prostitutes: Do Intervention Programs Help? | url = http://wcr.sonoma.edu/v3n2/monto.html | journal = Western Criminology Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911101950/http://wcr.sonoma.edu/v3n2/monto.html | archivedate = 2007-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; John's Schools were pioneered in San Francisco in 1995 and now used in many cities across the U.S. as well as other countries such as the UK and Canada. Some compare John's Schools programs to driver's safety courses, because first offenders can pay a fee to attend class(es) on the harms of prostitution, and upon completion, the charges against the john will be dropped. Another initiative that seeks to end demand is the cross-country tour "[[Ignite the Road to Justice]]," launched by the 2011 Miss Canada, [[Tara Teng]]. Teng's initiative circulates a petition to end the demand for commercial sex that drives prostitution and sex trafficking. End Demand efforts also include large-scale public awareness campaigns. Campaigns have started in Sweden, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Atlanta, Georgia. The Atlanta campaign in 2006 was titled "Dear John," and ran ads in local media reaching out to potential johns to discourage them from buying sex. Massachusetts and Rhode Island also had legislative efforts that criminalized prostitution and increased end demand efforts by targeting johns.&lt;ref name="berger" /&gt;

The Dear John campaign in Atlanta, Georgia ran from 2006-2008. It aims to end the demand for buying sex. The focus of this campaign is clearly centered around the John. The campaign mimics a “Dear John Letter” which is apparently a letter that a women sends to her partner when she is ending the relationship. A “John” refers to a man who purchases sex. In the 1990s, there was specific media attention paid to sex trafficking of women outside the United States. The feminist reaction to this at the time was a call for harsher punishments for Johns and social services for trafficked people. This was an aim to “end” the demand for prostitution. Critics of the Dear John campaign focus on the ‘male demand’ aspect of the campaign and find that this style of campaign reinforces gendered, racialized and sexualized assumptions about Johns and trafficked women. The historical discourse in the U.S. concerning Johns is racially charged. An example of this racialized nature is associated with the temptations of Thai massage parlors. Despite these objections, lawmakers have found this messaging morally compelling. The campaign was run by locals of Atlanta. Advocates for the campaign informed citizens through media that young women were the ones being arrested while the Johns were not.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

It is common for victims to have an initmate relationship with their pimp. This makes it difficult for prosecutors to charge traffickers because the victim will not testify against their pimp. Contextual analysis research has shown the essentialized nature of the campaign. The Dear John campaign posters define women in terms of there relationship to sex. They also only depict white girls in the images inferring that the only victims worth caring about are young white and innocent.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

It is interesting to note that there are no images of Johns in the campaign posters. A plausible explanation for this would be an effort by the campaign to widen the scope of the messaging and to avoid racial stereotypes. Conversly, the racial stereotypes of trafficked girls is made clear. This excludes a majority of victims who do not identify with the image that the poster conveys. Lawmakers in Atlanta were fully behind the campaign as a statement to the public that they will not tolerate the purchasing of sex. These public statements are in stark contrast to the actual amount of funding that the city gave to organizations who provide housing and services for victims. The city did no research into the effectiveness of the campaign and therefore there is no data on its actual impact on the city. It is also important to note that the campaign ads were only in English and many people are not familiar with the Dear John reference. Lawmakers believe that the campaign was effective in bringing awareness to the issue and therefore shaped public opinion and policy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Recognition of males in the global fight against trafficking ===
The lack of conversation, advocacy, legal/social support services, and academic work around the sexual exploitation of men and boys can be traced to larger social discourses surrounding male sexuality, dominance, and behavior. Media representations of masculinity and sexual dominance contribute to the idea that men cannot be victims, especially in regards to sex-related crimes. The lack of public knowledge and attention to male victimhood and vulnerability is strongly reflected in the quality of services and strength of legal frameworks available to male victims of sex trafficking .&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Jones, Samuel Vincent (2010). The Invisible Man: The Conscious Neglect of Men and Boys in the War on Human Trafficking, Utah Law Review, No 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Experts describe the "perceived agency and resilience in young males" to be a strong force in deterring male victims from seeking the support they need, and discouraging male-inclusive anti-trafficking service and support networks from forming in the first place. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Jarrett D|last2=Glotfelty|first2=Elliot|last3=Miles|first3=Glenn|title="No Other Choice": A Baseline Study on the Vulnerabilities of Males in the Sex Trade in Chiang Mai, Thailand|journal=Dignity: A Journal on Sexual Exploitation and Violence|volume=2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the spare support frameworks for male victims that do exist, the specific vulnerabilities of different populations in different areas around the world-- regarding nationality and migration status, sexual orientation, drug use, socio-economic status, health status, family structure, and more-- are often unaddressed, leaving crucial groups' needs unmet. The double stigma that surrounds male victims of sex trafficking, involving homosexuality and sex work more broadly-- makes it incredibly difficult for male victims to come forward and seek help, or even to self-organize. Some scholars report that male victims have also faced higher rates of police violence and brutality than female victims in regards to contact with law enforcement. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP) (2014). The Needs and Rights of Male Sex Workers, Briefing paper no 8, UK&lt;/ref&gt;
===Criminalizing and legalizing prostitution===

Laws regarding the purchase and sale of voluntary and involuntary sex vary greatly across the developed world. Their effects on sex trafficking are difficult to discern. Proponents of various forms of criminalization, legalization, or regulation of prostitution, may all argue their model decreases sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="lsr.nellco.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Samuel |last2=Persson |first2=Petra |title=Human Trafficking and Regulating Prostitution |url=https://lsr.nellco.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1303&amp;context=nyu_lewp |website=NELLCO |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Dutch model]] of legalization and regulation and the [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish model]] of criminalizing purchasers and pimps but not prostitutes are often discussed. The difference of these models casts the prevention of trafficking against the rights of voluntary sex workers and purchasers. It is argued that a hybrid model of licensing sex workers and criminalizing the purchase of unlicensed sex would reduce trafficking without crushing civil rights.&lt;ref name="lsr.nellco.org" /&gt;

===2017 Giving Day===
Numerous international organizations have partnered to create an anti-human trafficking Giving Day to raise awareness and funds on July, 30th 2017. This is the day designated by the United Nations as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. The Giving Day is being hosted by Charidy.com, a crowdfunding platform for non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='End Human Trafficking Giving Day|url=https://www.charidy.com/endslavery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Assembly in 2010, adopted the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, encouraging Governments around the world to undergo drastic measures in order defeat human trafficking. The goal was to put the fight against human trafficking into the United Nation's programmes to strengthen positive development and security around the world. A main section of the plan is to place a United Nations Trust Fund for the women and children who fell victim of trafficking. The Trust Fund in the plan ensures to assist and protect the victims of trafficking through grants to certified NGOs. In the future, the goal is to make the victims a priority who are come were victims and had issues with migration. It also places a focus on the aid to victims who were trafficked by their perpetrator for the goal of sexual relations, organ removal, forced begging, forced criminality, and emerging exploitative reasons.

The General Assembly in the year 2013, gathered a meeting to go over the world's plan of action. Numerous states also declared July 30 as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. The came to the conclusion that day of remembrance and awareness was crucial to remember the victims, the right's they possess and their protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/humantrafficking/|title=World Day against Trafficking in Persons, 30 July|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common Misconceptions ==
There are a number of misconceptions about sex trafficking. Sex trafficking and human trafficking are not to be confused with human smuggling. Although human trafficking for sexual or non-sexual labor may involve transporting victims across international boarders as in human smuggling, international borders do not need to be crossed for a person to be considered trafficked. Trafficking differs from smuggling in that it includes exploiting an individual after coercing or deceiving them and does not necessarily involve transporting individuals across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/|title=UNODC - Human Trafficking|last=nancy.cao|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human trafficking and sex trafficking are often used as synonyms. However, Trafficking of people to engage in non-sexual labor may be more prevalent than trafficking of people for the purpose of forcing them to perform sexual labor.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105377.htm|title=Major Forms of Trafficking in Persons|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, accurate estimates of trafficking rates are extremely difficult to obtain.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/faqs.html#What_is_the_most_commonly_identified_form_of_trafficking|title=FAQs|last=diana.teixeira|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ZHANG|first=SHELDON X.|last2=SPILLER|first2=MICHAEL W.|last3=FINCH|first3=BRIAN KARL|last4=QIN|first4=YANG|date=2014|title=Estimating Labor Trafficking among Unauthorized Migrant Workers in San Diego|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24541775|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=653|pages=65–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;Sex trafficking tends to receive more attention from aid organizations and donors due to the greater public outrage that forced sexual labor and abuse evoke compared to forced non-sexual labor and thus incidents of sex trafficking are more frequently reported.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Sex trafficking is also commonly conflated with non-coerced sex work criminalized as prostitution.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Jay|last2=Jakobsson|first2=Pye|date=2013-02-19|title=Abolitionist feminism as patriarchal control: Swedish understandings of prostitution and trafficking|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10624-013-9309-y|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=333–340|doi=10.1007/s10624-013-9309-y|issn=0304-4092}}&lt;/ref&gt; This misconception stems primarily from two sources: academic anti-prostitution scholars and prostitution abolitionist activists. A minority of [[Feminist views on prostitution|feminist scholars]] argue that all prostitution is coerced due to the prevalence of [[Compulsory heterosexuality]] and social and economic pressures stemming from [[Neoliberalism]] and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeffreys|first=Sheila|date=July 2009|title=Prostitution, trafficking and feminism: An update on the debate|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2009.07.002|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=32|issue=4|pages=316–320|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2009.07.002|issn=0277-5395}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are often at odds with the views of sex workers who work independently, or consensually with third parties such as brothels and club owners, who see the higher remuneration and flexibility of sexual labor as preferable to poorer paying and inflexible mainstream employment where they are subject to sexual harassment and assault by male employers and colleagues.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899739300|title=Dealing in desire : Asian ascendancy, Western decline, and the hidden currencies of global sex work|last=Kay,|first=Hoang, Kimberly|isbn=9780520960688|location=Oakland, California|oclc=899739300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794700706|title=On the move for love : migrant entertainers and the U.S. military in South Korea|last=Sealing.|first=Cheng,|date=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812206920|location=Philadelphia|oclc=794700706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/8TQHK3|title=A personal choice|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of activist organizations seeking to provide services to trafficking victims, lobby for anti-trafficking legislation, and generally raise awareness about sex-trafficking also advocate for the criminalization of sex work that is consensual.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The practices of some anti-sex trafficking programs and initiatives is that they provide intensives for non-trafficked sex workers to identify as victims of trafficking to gain access to resources such as shelters only if they claim to be victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Law enforcement agencies also incentivize non-trafficked sex workers to claim that they have been trafficked by threatening them with jail time if they admit they are working by choice as opposed to attending training workshops and no jail time if they claim they are trafficked.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Such policies, though beneficial to actual trafficking victims, inflate reported rates of trafficking by incentivising non-trafficked sex workers to identify report themselves as trafficking victims.

{{See also|Happiness in Judaism}}
'''''Simcha''''' ({{lang-he-n|שִׂמְחָה}} {{transl|he|''śimḥāʰ''}}; {{IPA-he|simˈχa|langpron}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈsɪmχə|langpron}}) is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word that means gladness, or joy, and is often used as a [[given name]].

==Uses==
{{Main|Happiness in Judaism}}
The concept of simcha is an important one in Jewish philosophy. A popular teaching by Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]], a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is "''Mitzvah Gedolah Le'hiyot Besimcha Tamid''," it is a great [[mitzvah]] (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Likutei Moharan|Likutei MoHaran]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jew]]s often use ''simcha'' in its capacity as a [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] noun meaning festive occasion. The term is used for any happy occasion, such as a wedding, [[Bar Mitzvah]] or engagement.

===Holidays===
The day of [[Simchat Torah]], "Rejoice in the Law", which marks the completion and beginning of the annual cycle of reading the Torah.

===Other uses===
Simcha is also the name of a [[kosher]] [[beer]] from [[Saxony]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simcha-sachsen.de Simcha - Koscheres Bier aus Sachsen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a slang term used in [[Jewish-American organized crime]] circles to refer to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/10121/edition_id/193/format/html/displaystory.html Free-wheeling U.S. spirit stoked gangsters, prof says], Jewish Bulletin of Northern California, December 4, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Simcha is also used as a given name, for men or women. In the [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish tradition, the name Simcha is most likely to be used for a boy, while in the [[Sephardic]]/[[Israelis|Israeli]] tradition it would be a girl's name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10257">'''Social translucence''' (also referred as ''social awareness'') is a term that was proposed by Thomas Erickson and [[Wendy Kellogg]] to refer to "design digital systems that support coherent behavior by making participants and their activities visible to one another".

Social translucence represents a tool for [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in socio-technical systems, which function is to
* stimulate [[online participation]]
* facilitate collaboration (via [[collaborative filtering]] but also by helping the construction of trust)
* facilitate navigation ([[social navigation]])

Social translucence is, in particular, a core element in [[online social networking]] such as [[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]], in which they intervene in the possibility for people to expose their [[online identity]], but also in the creation of awareness of other people activities, that are for instance present in the [[Activity stream|activity feed]]s that these systems make available.

Social translucence mechanisms have been made available in many [[web 2.0]] systems such as:
* [[Online communities]]
* [[Online social networking]]
* [[Wikis]] &lt;ref name="McDonald Gokhman Zachry 2012 p.

==Background==

Participation of people in online communities, in general, differ from their participatory behavior in real-world collective contexts. Humans in daily life are used to making use of "social cues" for guiding their decisions and actions e.g. if a group of people is looking for a good restaurant to have lunch, it is very likely that they will choose to enter to a local that have some customers inside instead of one that it is empty (the more crowded restaurant could reflect its popularity and in consequence, its quality of service). However, in online social environments, it is not straightforward how to access to these sources of information which are normally being logged in the systems, but this is not disclosed to the users.

There are some theories that explain how this social translucence can affect the behavior of people in real-life scenarios. The American philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]] states that humans are social creatures, in the sense that people's actions cannot be isolated from the behavior of the whole collective they are part of because every individuals' acts are influenced by larger social practices that act as a general behavior's framework.&lt;ref name="Mead1934"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind, Self, and Society: From the Standpoint of a Social Behaviorist|last=Mead|first=George. H.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1934|isbn=|location=Chicago|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his performance framework, the Canadian sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] postulates that in everyday social interactions individuals perform their actions by collecting information from others first, in order to know in advance what they may expect from them and in this way being able to plan how to behave more effectively.&lt;ref name="Goffman 1990 p. "&gt;{{cite book | last=Goffman | first=Erving | title=The presentation of self in everyday life | publisher=Penguin | location=London | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-14-013571-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

According to Erickson et al., social translucent systems should respect the principles of visibility (making significant social information available to users), awareness (bringing our social rules to guide our actions based on external social cues) and accountability (being able to identify who did what and when) in order to allow people to effectively facilitate users communication and collaboration in virtual environments.&lt;ref name="Erickson Kellogg pp. 59–83"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Erickson | first=Thomas | last2=Kellogg | first2=Wendy A. | title=Social translucence: an approach to designing systems that support social processes | journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction | publisher=Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) | volume=7 | issue=1 | date=2000-03-01 | issn=1073-0516 | doi=10.1145/344949.345004 | pages=59–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zolyomi et al. proposed the principle of identity as a fourth dimension for social translucence by arguing that the design of socio-technical systems should have a rich description of who is visible, in order to give people control over disclosure and mechanisms to advocate for their needs.&lt;ref name="Zolyomi Ross Bhattacharya Milne 2018 p. "&gt;{{cite conference | last=Zolyomi | first=Annuska | last2=Ross | first2=Anne Spencer | last3=Bhattacharya | first3=Arpita | last4=Milne | first4=Lauren | last5=Munson | first5=Sean A. | title=Values, Identity, and Social Translucence | publisher=ACM Press | publication-place=New York, New York, USA | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-4503-5620-6 | doi=10.1145/3173574.3174073 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonald et al. proposed a system architecture for structuring the development of social translucent systems, which comprises two dimensions: types of user actions in the system, and a second describing the processing and interpretation done by the system. This framework can guide designers to determine what activities are important to social translucence and need to be reflected, and how interpretive levels of those actions might provide contextual salience to the users &lt;ref name="McDonald Gokhman Zachry 2012 p. "/&gt;

==Effects==

===Benefits===

In the same way that in the real-world, providing social cues in virtual communities can help people to understand better the situations they face in these environments, to alleviate their decision-making processes by enabling their access to more informed choices, to persuade them to participate in the activities that take place there, and to structure their own schedule of individual and group activities more efficiently.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=Xianghua|last2=Erickson|first2=Thomas|last3=Kellogg|first3=Wendy A.|last4=Patterson|first4=Donald J.|title=Informing and performing: investigating how mediated sociality becomes visible|journal=Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|volume=16|issue=8|year=2011|pages=1095–1117|issn=1617-4909|doi=10.1007/s00779-011-0443-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this frame of reference, an approach called "social context displays" has been proposed for showing social information -either from real or virtual environments- in digital scenarios. It is based on the use of graphical representations to visualize the presence and activity traces of a group of people, thus providing users with a third-party view of what is happening within the community i.e. who are actively participating, who are not contributing to the group efforts, etc. This social-context-revealing approach has been studied in different scenarios (e.g. IBM video-conference software, large community displaying social activity traces in a shared space called NOMATIC*VIZ), and it has been demonstrated that its application can provide users with several benefits, like providing them with more information to make better decisions and motivating them to take an active attitude towards the management of  their self and group representations within the display through their actions in the real-life.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

The feeling of personal accountability in front of others that social translucence can report to users can be used for the design of systems for supporting behavior change (e.g. weight loss, smoking cessation), if combined with the appropriate type of feedback.&lt;ref name="Barreto Szóstek Karapanos 2013 p. "&gt;{{cite conference | last=Barreto | first=Mary | last2=Szóstek | first2=Agnieszka | last3=Karapanos | first3=Evangelos | title=An initial model for designing socially translucent systems for behavior change | publisher=ACM Press | publication-place=New York, New York, USA | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4503-2061-0 | doi=10.1145/2499149.2499162 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns===

By making the traces of activity of users publicly available for others to access it is natural that it can raise users concerns related to which are their rights over the data they generate, who are the final users that can have access to their information and how they can know and control their privacy policies.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt; There are several perspectives that try to contextualize this privacy issue. One perspective is to see privacy as a tradeoff between the degree of invasion to the personal space and the number of benefits that the user could perceive from the social system by disclosing their online activity traces.&lt;ref name="PatilLai2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Sameer|last2=Lai|first2=Jennifer|title=Who gets to know what when: configuring privacy permissions in an awareness application|year=2005|pages=101|doi=10.1145/1054972.1054987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective is examining the concession between the visibility of people within the social system and their level of privacy, which can be managed at an individual or at a group level by establishing specific permissions for allowing others to have access to their information. Other authors state that instead of enforcing users to set and control privacy settings, social systems might focus on raising their awareness about who their audiences are so they can manage their online behavior according to the reactions they expect from those different user groups.&lt;ref name="DingErickson2011"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Super Free'''|スーパーフリー|Sūpā-furī}} or its shortened form {{nihongo|'''Sūfuri'''|スーフリ}} was an inter-university rave event club, mainly comprising students of [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The leader of the club along with various students from Waseda and other universities in Tokyo was arrested and convicted for rape and, subsequently, the club was dubbed by several English media outlets as a "rape club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1165356.ece|title=Rape clubs: A stain on its elite students that Japan cannot face|first=Leo|last=Lewis|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=2003-10-03|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/02/world/main571280.shtml|title=Rape Debate In Japan|first=Lauren|last=Johnston|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=2003-09-02|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/11/02/1233322.htm|title=Elite club leader gets 14 years jail for gang rapes|publisher=[[ABC Online]]|date=2004-11-02|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/04/1057179159324.html|title=Japan searches soul after divisive rape case|first=Shane|last=Green|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=2003-07-05|accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its leader was {{nihongo|Shin'ichirō Wada|和田 真一郎|''Wada Shin'ichirō''|born July 30, 1974, in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]}}.

Super Free was established as a university social club in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040409a3.html|title=College gang-rape trio get up to 32 months|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2004-04-09|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wada was a student at Waseda University before being arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/cgi-bin/common/popupPrintArticle.pl?path=/articles/2003/07/04/1057179156476.html |title=Revealed: the workings of a uni rape club |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2003-07-05 | accessdate=2008-01-17 | location=Melbourne}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered Waseda University in 1994 and became the organizer of "Super Free" in 1995. It had 14 members as of 2003. Super Free was a highly successful inter-university rave event club, to the point that it was incorporated, having 5 branches nationwide, 30-odd employees and an office in Roppongi. According to the indictment, the club organized parties and social gatherings at a public night-club in [[Roppongi]]. The members of Super Free would scout for potential victims among the public, and befriend them offering drinks. Once their victims were intoxicated and incapable of resisting, they would lure them to an abandoned room.&lt;ref name="gang rape" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/184 |title=Gang rape spotlights dirty deeds at Waseda campus |publisher=[[Japan Today]] |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615024248/http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/184 |archivedate=2008-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wada was arrested on June 9, 2003. His circle's 13 other members were also arrested for gang rape.&lt;ref name="gang rape" /&gt; Super Free was dissolved in June 22, 2003.

Wada was indicted for three counts of rape. On November 2, 2004, the [[Tokyo District Court]] sentenced him to 14 years in prison, a comparatively heavy sentence under Japan's postwar sentencing guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20041103a2.html Gang-rape ringleader gets 14 years]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[The Japan Times]]'', November 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20041118b2.html Super Free ringleader appeals 14-year term for gang rapes] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', November 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2005, the [[Tokyo High Court]] rejected the appeal and upheld the original sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050603a5.html High court upholds 14-year sentence for gang-rape leader] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2005, the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20051103a2.html Appeal by Super Free gang rapist rejected] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', November 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After their arrest, a statute for the prosecution of gang rape was established under the [[Criminal Code of Japan]]. In January 2006, three students in [[Kyoto University]] were arrested for gang rape under this penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060127a3.html |title=Kyoto University trio held in suspected gang rapes |publisher=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2006-01-27| accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seiichi Ota]], a Japanese [[cabinet minister]], was heavily criticized after he issued a statement regarding the case, saying "At least gang rapists are still vigorous. Isn't that at least a little closer to normal?" on June 26, 2003. He later reported that his statement was taken out of context, and that he didn't have the chance to further comment on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3025240.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fury over Japan rape gaffe | date=2003-06-27 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Yasuo Fukuda]] was reported to have made highly controversial comments during an off-the-record discussion with reporters in June 2003 regarding the victims of rape by the members of Super Free, according to an article in the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun. The magazine quoted Fukuda as saying: "There are women who look like they are saying 'Do it to me'. Those who have that kind of appearance are at fault, because men are black panthers." In response, Fukuda claimed that the ''[[Shūkan Bunshun]]'' had distorted his comments, stating that he had never intended to defend rape, and told a parliamentary panel afterwards that rape was "a criminal act and an atrocious crime".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3042316.stm Japan rape victims 'asking for it']," ''BBC News'', 3 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0XPQ/is_2003_July_8/ai_104847267 Fukuda denies making remarks defending alleged gang rapists], ''Kyodo'', 8 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sydney Live Steam Locomotive Society''' was formed in 1948 and built a [[miniature railway]] along a [[drainage channel]] behind houses on Anthony Road, [[West Ryde]], [[Sydney]], Australia. The site has been transformed by the addition of fill from [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] work during widening of the [[Main Northern railway line|local railway line]] and the society has grown and now operates a miniature railway on the site with a 400m long elevated track of 2{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inch, 3{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inch and 5&amp;nbsp;inch gauge, and two 300m long ground level 5&amp;nbsp;inch railways. The society is open to the general public on the third Saturday of each month.

The Society operates miniature [[steam locomotive]]s which represent [[prototype]] engines of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and other states. One can also see a variety of other prototype [[locomotive]]s. The locomotives work hard hauling 6 car trains with up to 30 persons. A 10 lever mechanical ex New South Wales Government Railways [[ground frame]] operates elevated swing stub points and lower quadrant signals on the elevated railway and a &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbsframe.mste.co.uk/public/Sydney_SLSLS.html&lt;/ref&gt; 48 miniature (Westinghouse style) [[lever frame]] operates the ground level railway's motor points and colour light signals. Members practice their [[model engineering]] in the creation of miniature steam locomotives, truly representative of the prototype.

A history of the society was produced to celebrate the 50 years of their operation&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/363450]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club owns the second oldest miniature steam locomotive in Australia, known as The Old Girl.

The grounds are a local favourite for [[Birthday party (event)|birthday parties]] on running days.

The operation is in accordance with the Codes of Practice for Operation, Training and Standards of the Australian Association of Live Steamers (AALS). This code is available on their web site at http://www.aals.asn.au. The [[boiler]]s in the miniature locomotives are built, tested and operated in accordance with the Australian Miniature Boiler Safety Committee codes.

The closest railway station is [[West Ryde railway station|West Ryde]].

'''Talpur''' ({{lang-bal|تالپورء اۏبادگ}}) is a [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] speaking [[Baloch people|Baloch]] [[tribe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talpur.com www.talpur.com]/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Baloch race. A historical and ethnological sketch.'' M. Longworth Dames. The [[Royal Asiatic Society]], London, 1902. [https://archive.org/stream/balochracehistor00damerich/balochracehistor00damerich_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; settled in [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Balochistan]] in [[Pakistan]]. 

The Talpur Baloch soon gained power and overthrew the [[Kalhora]] after the [[Battle of Halani]].  Peace between the two warring tribes was soon established and in the year 1783, His Highness Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur as the new [[Amir]] of [[Sindh]]. This brought an end to the ferocious fighting and the defeat of the ruling [[Kalhora]] by the Talpur tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Qammaruddin Bohra, ''City of Hyderabad Sindh 712–1947'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}}

==Talpur dynasty==
The '''Talpur dynasty''' ({{lang-ur|سلسله تالپور}}) ({{lang-bal|تالپورء اۏبادگ}}) was a dynasty of the Talpur Baloch tribe that conquered and ruled [[Sindh]], and other parts of present-day [[Pakistan]], from 1783 to 1843. 

=== History ===
In the middle of the XVIII century. in the Sindehili were feudal lords of Balochi tribe of the Talpurs, who were in vassalage from the [[Kalhora dynasty|Kalhoras]]. Taking advantage of the fact that the population was extremely is outraged by the tyranny of the Nawab (ruler) Abdullah Nabi Kalhor, the leaders of the Talpurs raised in June 1779 an uprising and ousted Abdullah Nabis, seized power. Nawab fled to [[Kandahar]], hoping to find support with his suzerain [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]].

Timur Shah agreed to help him, and in 1781 Abdullah Nabi with the assistance of The [[Afghan]] troops again became the ruler of Sind. However, fermentation in the country not only did not stop but broke out with renewed vigor. Relying on the support of the disaffected nawab population, the leader of the Talpurs Fatah Ali Khan expelled Abdullah Nabi from Sind in 1783. Sent Timur Shah to the aid of the rulers of Kalhor, a detachment of Afghan troops was defeated by the Balochs in 1786 near [[Shikarpur, Sindh|Shikarpur]].

The Talpur dynasty was defeated by the British invaders in 1843 at the [[Battle of Miani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5547">[[Arasbaran]], also known as Karadagh in [[Azerbaijani language]] ('''قره‌داغ''') is a vast mountainous area in the north of [[East Azarbaijan Province]] in [[Iran]]. In this area there were several Turkic tribes, including the [[Beghdillu]], [[Chalabianlu]], [[Haji-Alilu]], [[Mohammad Khanlu]], [[Hoseynaklu]], [[Hasanbeyglu]], [[Ilyaskhanlu]], [[Tokhmaqlu]], [[Bayburdlu]], [[Qaradaghlu]], and [[Qarachorlu]]. All of these tribes are now sedentary, but characteristic aspects of their culture, developed around [[nomadic pastoralism]],&lt;ref&gt;Dyson-Hudson, Rada, and Neville Dyson-Hudson. "Nomadic Pastoralism." Annual Review of Anthropology 9 (1980): 15-61.&lt;/ref&gt; have persisted to our times.

[[File:Aqdash June 2011.jpg|thumb|190px|'''[[Agdash Abbasabad|Aqdash]]''' temporary pasturage of migrating tribes.]]
[[File:Caparli July2011.jpg|thumb|190px|'''[[Chaparli]]''' summer camp near [[Abbasabad, Khoda Afarin|Abbasabad]] still is used as summer camp by remnants of [[Mohammad Khanlu]].]]

==Land ownership==

According to A. Lampton, in the [[Karadagh Khanate]] the pasturage belonged to [[Khan (title)|Khans]], who also owned arable land in winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Ann K.S. Lambton, "Landlord and Peasant in Persia: A Study of Land Tenure and Land Revenue", republished in 1991, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the following sections a brief history of Arasbaran tribes is given according to a comprehensive article by Oberling &lt;ref&gt;Oberling, Pierre. "The Tribes of Qarāca Dāġ: A Brief History." Oriens 17 (1964): 60-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and other English language sources. More information may be found in a [[Persian language|Persian]] book by Colonel H. Baibordi.&lt;ref&gt;سرهنگ حسین بایبوردی، "تاریخ ارسباران"، ابن سینا، تهران ۱۳۴۱&lt;/ref&gt;

===History until the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906===

In the wake of [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]] a significant fraction of the inhabitants of [[Arasbaran]]lived as nomadic tribes. The major tribes included the [[Chalabianlu]], with 1500 tents and houses, [[Qarachorlu]] 2500, [[Haji-Alilu]] 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500.&lt;ref&gt;R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography Of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time [[Ahar]], with 3500 inhabitants, was the only city of Qaradağ.&lt;ref&gt;Bibliothèque orientale Elzévirienne, Volume 52; Volume 55, 1887 p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear when the remaining three tribes were  founded. It should be noted that in [[Arasbaran]] the tribe is a political entity rather than an ethnic concept, and therefore the bond between different families in the tribe is through their allegiance to a common chief.&lt;ref&gt;P. Oberling, “The Tribes of Qarāca Dāġ,” Oriens 17, 1964, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, at a critical moment of time a strong man, often from the ruling family of a tribe, may have gathered sufficient number of nomadic families and form a new tribe. There are unconfirmed evidences, based on oral traditions, that this may have been the case for [[Mohammad Khanlu]] tribe.

===The tribes major rule in the aftermath of Persian Constitutional Revolution===

===The status of tribes in the wake of White Revolution===
After [[World War II]], The central government commissioned the security of, generally unruly tribes, to tribal chiefs. This had disastrous results in [[Arasbaran]] as the chiefs apparently used their weapons "to overawe their settled neighbors and to levy illegal dues".&lt;ref&gt;Ann K.S. Lambton, "Landlord and Peasant in Persia", 1953, Oxford university press, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, villagers started migrating to [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]] well before the [[White Revolution]], which was intended to improve the living conditions of peasants.

==The cultural relics of tribes==

During the epoch of [[Rezā Shāh]] (1925–1941) there was a concerted campaign  not only to settle the pastoral nomads but also to eliminate their distinctive culture in terms of language, dress and authority structures. The nomads reverted to their former life style following the king's forced abdication. The new king, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], began persecution of nomads  after introducing his [[White Revolution]] in early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, R. (2001). You can’t go home again: pastoralism in the new millennium. London: Overseas Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the departure of the Shah and the ensuing period of uncertainty, some nomads revived remnants of their culture without attempting to return to the traditional authority structures. After the end of [[Iran–Iraq War]] in 1988, the Islamic government promoted selective aspects of nomadic life, and, accordingly, government sponsored TV series were made. Unfortunately, none of the noteworthy programs is dedicated to the Tribes of Arasbaran. The government's unexpectedly  soft approach to the [[Ashik]] music, has provided Tribes of Arasbaran to safeguard their cultural identity. This music has evolved in relation to the pastoral life of Turkic tribes&lt;ref&gt;A.O.Senarslan, Women asiqs of Azerbaijan: tradition and transformation, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and was mainly preserved in [[Arasbaran]] region during the cultural repression of [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi era]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11439">{{For|the German informal demonym|Wessi}}
'''Westie''', or ''' Westy''', is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] term used in [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]] to [[Stereotype|stereotypically]] describe residents of the [[Greater Western Sydney]], the western suburbs of [[Melbourne]] or the West [[Auckland]] city of [[Waitakere]] (New Zealand). It may also refer as a derogatory term to people who might not live in the west of a city. The alternative term "[[bogan]]" is often used instead, as it has a similar definition but does not refer to a geographical area.

==Origin and definition of the term==
The term originated, and is most often used, in relation to residents of the numerous [[Greater Western Sydney|western suburbs]] of [[Sydney]], Australia, and of [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

According to the [[Macquarie Dictionary]], the term in Australian English now refers to people from outer suburbs and a lower socio-economic background, or to the stereotypes associated with such people.&lt;ref name="mdict"&gt;"Westie", Macquarie Dictionary Online Edition 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It also states that the term has spread throughout Australia and may be used to refer to people who may not live in the western part of their city.&lt;ref name="mdict" /&gt; With reference to its use in Sydney, the Macquarie Book of Slang says the term is applied negatively to anyone that may live west of one's own suburb.&lt;ref name="bos"&gt;[http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/anonymous@FF863417644/-/p/dict/slang-w.html? "Westie"], Macquarie Book of Slang, Macquarie Library, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Westie persona==
The term "westie" is often used to associate someone or something with a stereotype. This stereotype depicts people from the outer suburbs as unintelligent, undereducated, unmotivated, unrefined, lacking in fashion sense, working-class or unemployed. Clothing such as [[flannelette]] shirts, [[Ugg boots]], leopard-print fabric, [[Adidas]] outfits with clear stripes, blue singlets are associated with the stereotype, as are the "uniform" of black T-shirt and ripped jeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Collins|editor2=Poynting|title=The Other Sydney: Communities, Identities and Inequalities in Western Sydney|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auckland, New Zealand===
{{See also|Jafa}}
In Auckland, westies are almost entirely residents of [[Waitakere City]], in particular the [[Auckland]] city-side suburbs of [[Massey, New Zealand|Massey]], [[Te Atatu]], [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]], Sunnyvale, Glen Eden, Green Bay, Titirangi, Ranui, and [[New Lynn]]. Some people from [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] are called by others and themselves ''westies'' although Avondale is actually within the territory of [[Auckland City]].

To be called a ''Westie'' in Auckland is sometimes ambiguous as it can be both a pejorative or good natured, depending on intent. Many people from Waitakere City will call themselves ''Westies'' with pride, yet not meet the stereotypical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/Mayor/pdf/westies.pdf |title=Review of Mayor Bob Harvey's book |format=PDF |publisher=Auckland Council |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112165031/http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/Mayor/pdf/westies.pdf |archivedate=January 12, 2006 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Westies are stereotypically seen as being more brash and of-the-soil than other districts of Auckland. The stereotype also incorporates black jerseys and old V8 cars.

The shift from a pejorative to a societal identifier has been abrupt and in no small part due to the 1993 single ''Westy Gals'' by Auckland singer [[Jan Hellriegel]], and local comedian [[Ewen Gilmour]]'s stand-up comedy act as Ewen "Westie" Gilmour between 1995 and 2000 in the premier television programme ''[[Pulp Comedy]]''. Both of these instances gave the term national prominence. Gilmour was "unofficially appointed cultural ambassador" for Waitakere City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewengilmour.com/biography/|title=Biography|publisher=Ewen Gilmour|year=2013|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005060530/http://www.ewengilmour.com/biography/|archivedate=2014-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as councillor for the Waitakere City Council in 2004 and joins former mayor [[Tim Shadbolt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morgan, Jared|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/3784678/Mayor-Tim-joins-Westie-walk-of-fame|title=Mayor Tim joins Westie walk of fame|work=The Southland Times|publisher=Fairfax NZ News|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as stereotypical westies who have entered local body politics. The biography of [[Bob Harvey (mayor)|Bob Harvey]] former mayor of Waitakere City was titled ''Wild Westie''. 

The successful television series ''[[Outrageous Fortune (TV series)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' is set in West Auckland with the main characters being the West family, a play on the word 'Westie'.

The persona of the standard Auckland "Westie" continues to evolve. In November 2008 [[Paula Bennett]] defeated [[Lynne Pillay]], the long-standing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] [[Waitakere (New Zealand electorate)|Member of Parliament for Waitakere]] under the banner "Proud to be a Westy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK0806/S00088.htm|title=Three great westies join Waitakere Walkway of Fame|date=10 June 2008|publisher=Waitakere City|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett is a solo mother and a former social service beneficiary who became the [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]] in the former [[New Zealand National Party|National]]-led Government. With [[Simon Bridges]] (an ex-Westie) now leader of the Opposition, National is now led by two "Westies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/101811247/west-aucklanders-divided-on-having-two-westies-lead-national |title= West Aucklanders divided on having two Westies lead National |publisher= Stuff (Fairfax) |date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It should be noted that as of the 2010 amalgamation of Auckland's council boundaries into one regional greater council, [[Waitakere City]] no longer exists as a distinct entity. Yet, those living within the former boundaries remain claiming themselves as ''Westies' essentially within the former boundaries.

===Sydney, Australia===
In Sydney, westies have taken their name from Sydney's western suburbs, a region of suburbs in which the cost of living is less than Sydney's affluent Easterly, North shore, Sutherland Shire and other coastal suburbs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The west also has lower levels of professional employment. As a result, the term "Westie" was used in a derogatory sense to suggest that someone was uncouth or unsophisticated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Macquarie Book of Slang reports that the area which Westies inhabit does not have clear boundaries even though Western Sydney is generally regarded as being the metropolitan area west of [[Strathfield, New South Wales|Strathfield]]. While some in the [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|eastern suburbs]] might consider residents of [[Epping, New South Wales|Epping]] as Westies, others may restrict the term to areas such as [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]], Granville and Berala. Westies were also a common sight in the 1980s in the south-western suburbs such as [[Minto, New South Wales|Minto]] and [[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Campbelltown]].&lt;ref name="bos" /&gt;

In Sydney it is claimed that the term originated within the surfing community in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Board riders or surfers who lived in the beachside suburbs, closer to the beach and waves, would often refer to what they saw as "part time" weekend surfers, who travelled to the beach from the western suburbs as "Westies". In this regard they were seen as "blow ins" who crowded the beach and waves each weekend.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

However, it is argued that the term "Westie" was a creation of the 1960s and 1970s as young, working families were encouraged westward into the newly built, rather austere public and private housing subdivisions on Sydney's urban fringe. It was a term of division and derision, and became shorthand for a population considered lowbrow, coarse and lacking education and cultural refinement.&lt;ref name=Gwyther&gt;{{cite paper|first=Gabrielle|last=Gwyther|title=Once were Westies|work=Griffith REVIEW|edition=20: Cities on the Edge|publisher=[[Griffith University]]|year=2008|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immortalised in the 1977 social realist film, ''[[The FJ Holden]]'', by [[Michael Thornhill]], the classic Westie was a male of Anglo-Celtic origin who lived in the vast, homogenous flatlands west of the [[Sydney central business district|Sydney CBD]]. The checked [[Flannel|flannelette shirt]] symbolised his attire and vandalism, cheap drink and hotted-up cars his behaviour.&lt;ref name=Gwyther/&gt; Westie became a rhetorical device to designate the other Sydney: spatially, culturally and economically different from the more prosperous and privileged Sydneysiders of the North, East and South&lt;ref name=Gwyther/&gt;

The term may also be used to describe someone who acts or uses the same mannerisms as a person from the western suburbs but lives somewhere else.

====Coastal suburbs====
It could be noted in this context that in Sydney, the western suburbs often have no (or less prominent) coastal access. This is often reflected in house prices and suburb 'status'.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}  The typical commute of a resident living in the western suburbs of these cities also involves driving towards the sun each way, possibly explaining the cultural similarities across multiple cities.  The commuters are commonly known as squinters due to the fact that they must squint while driving because of the rising and setting sun.

===Ballarat, Australia===
The term Westie is often used to describe a person living in the western portions of [[Wendouree]], a suburb in the north-west of [[Ballarat]] also known for its lower socio-economic status.

A '''white noise machine''' is a device that produces a sound with a random character, which sounds like a rushing waterfall or wind blowing through trees. Often such devices do not produce actual [[white noise]], which has a harsh sound, but [[pink noise]], whose power rolls off at higher frequencies, or other [[colors of noise]].

==Use==
White noise devices are available from numerous manufacturers in many forms, for a variety of different uses, including audio testing, sound masking, [[sleep]]-aid, and [[power-nap|power-napping]]. Sleep-aid and nap machine products may also produce other soothing sounds, such as music, rain, wind, highway traffic and ocean waves mixed with—or modulated by—white noise. White noise generators are often used by people with [[tinnitus]] to mask their [[Tinnitus#Signs and symptoms|symptoms]].  The sounds generated by digital machines are not always truly random. Rather, they are short prerecorded audio-tracks which continuously repeat at the end of the track.

Manufacturers of [[Sound masking|sound-masking]] devices recommend that the volume of white noise machines be initially set at a comfortable level, even if it does not provide the desired level of privacy. As the ear becomes accustomed to the new sound and learns to tune it out, the volume can be gradually increased to increase privacy.  Manufacturers of [[Sleeping aid|sleeping aids]] and [[Power napping|power-napping]] devices recommend that the volume level be set slightly louder than ''normal music listening level'', but always in a comfortable listening range.

Sound and noise have their own measurement and color coding techniques, which allows specialized users to identify noise and sound according to their respective needs and utilization. These specialized needs are dependent on certain professions and needs, e.g. a [[psychiatrist]] who needs certain sounds for therapies and treatments on a mental level, and patients who have conditions such as insomnia, anxiety, and, tinnitus (these conditions are managed with special devices which are designed to create certain sounds that treat such conditions at a mental level). A white noise machine has “white” as the color code given to that noise having a particular [[frequency spectrum]].

==Design==
Most modern white noise generators are electronic, usually generating the sound in real-time with audio test equipment, or via electronic playback of a digital audio recording.  Simple mechanical machines consist of a very basic setup, involving an enclosed fan and, optionally, a speed switch. This fan drives air through small slots in the machine's casing, producing the desired sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">The '''Wola''' people are an indigenous group of the [[Southern Highlands Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. They live in five valleys northeast of [[Lake Kutubu]].&lt;ref name="landmouth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wolaland"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolaland.org/page/Wola.php|title=wolaland.org|website=www.wolaland.org|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wola are sedentary and practice [[Shifting cultivation|swidden agriculture]]. Their main staple is sweet potato; lesser staples are bananas and taro.&lt;ref name="landmouth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wolaland" /&gt;

The Wola speak a variety of [[Angal language|Mendi]].&lt;ref name="Hays"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hays |first1=Terence E. |title=Encyclopedia of world cultures |date=1991 |publisher=G.K.
