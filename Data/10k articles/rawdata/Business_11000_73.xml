'''Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957''', the full title of which is '''Convention concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour''', 1957 (No. 105), is one of the eight [[ILO fundamental conventions]] of the [[International Labour Organization]], which cancels certain forms of forced labour still allowed under the [[Forced Labour Convention]] of 1930, such as punishment for [[strike action|strikes]] and as a punishment for holding certain [[political opinion|political views]].

In order to implement the 1930 Forced Labour Convention and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, the [[Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour]] was set up.

==Ratifications==
{{wikisource|Convention concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour}}
{{As of|May 2016}}, the Convention has been ratified by 175 of the 187 [[International Labour Organization#Membership|ILO member]]s.&lt;ref name = ratifications/&gt; The 12 ILO members that have not ratified the Convention are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312250:NO |title=Members who have not ratified |work=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Brunei
*China
*Japan
*South Korea
*Laos
*Marshall Islands
*Myanmar
*Palau
*Tonga
*East Timor
*Tuvalu
*Vietnam

Two countries which had ratified the Convention—Malaysia and Singapore—have since denounced it. In addition, seven members of the United Nations are not members of the ILO and thus are not eligible to ratify the Convention unless they first join the ILO: Andorra, Bhutan, Liechtenstein, Micronesia, Monaco, Nauru, and North Korea.

{{Big Five Hawaii}}
'''Amfac, Inc.''', formerly known as '''American Factors''' and originally '''H. Hackfeld and Company''', was a [[land development]] company in Hawaii. Founded in 1849 as a retail and sugar business, it was considered one of the so-called [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]] companies in the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. At its peak it owned {{convert|60000|acre}} of land, and was a dominant sugar company in Hawaii as well the founder of one of its best known department stores, [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]]. 
It now&lt;!-- when? --&gt; owns {{convert|5000|acre}} of land in [[Kaanapali]] on the island of [[Maui]]. Since 2005 it is known as Kaanapali Land, LLC ({{OTC Pink|KANP}}).

==History==

German immigrant Heinrich Hackfeld and his brother-in-law J. C. Pflueger founded a dry goods store called H. Hackfeld and Company in 1849 in [[Honolulu]]. Hackfeld later&lt;!-- when??  --&gt; became the business agent for [[Old Sugar Mill of Koloa|Kōloa Plantation]] on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]]. [[Paul Isenberg]] (1837–1903) became a partner in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher=[[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/isenberg34bs.txt |chapter= Isenberg, Paul  |accessdate=August 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], Pioneer Mill, DCCA #207, was seized by the U.S. government [[Alien Property Custodian]]. It was later sold to a consortium of Hawaii businessmen in 1918, who changed the name to "American Factors". In 1966, the name was further shortened to "Amfac". 
Henry Alexander Walker became president in the 1930s. The family estate known as the [[H. Alexander Walker Residence]], was developed into a showcase garden.&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{cite web |title= H. Alexander Walker Residence nomination form |author=Dorothy Riconda |author2= Robert M. Fox  |work=National Register of Historic Places |date= September 18, 1972 |publisher=U.S. National Park Service |url= {{NRHP url|id=73000665}} |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 to 1972 under president Henry Alexander Walker Jr. Amfac acquired 42 different companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= July 31, 1972 |title= Corporations:Amfac's Wide Swing |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877962,00.html |work=TIME |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald L. Sloan was removed as president November 20, 1987 and replaced by Richard L. Griffith (Walker was still chairman of the board). The company announced it was selling its non-Hawaii business units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/business/amfac-is-planning-to-sell-its-non-hawaii-businesses.html |date= December 14, 1987 |title= Amfac Is Planning to Sell Its Non-Hawaii Businesses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 27, 2010 | first=Calvin | last=Sims}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amfac was bought by [[Chicago]]-based [[JMB Realty]] in 1988 for US$920&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/19/business/company-news-amfac-holders-back-bid-by-jmb.html |date= November 11, 1988 |title= Company News: Amfac Holders Back Bid by JMB |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the sugar industry in Hawaii declined after statehood, so did the fortunes of Amfac. Amfac's assets were gradually sold off or closed. Oahu Sugar in [[Waipahu]] was closed in 1994.&lt;ref name="dynasty"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Dynasty in decline: Amfac, the first Hawaii company to earn $1 billion in revenue, is a shadow of its former self| work = Honolulu Star-Bulletin| accessdate = 2018-04-22| date = 2001-09-02| url = http://archives.starbulletin.com/2001/09/02/business/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberty House went into bankruptcy in 1998 (it was later acquired by [[Federated Department Stores]] and now carries the [[Macy's]] brand name). The Pioneer Mill in [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] closed in 1999, and the [[Kekaha, Hawaii|Kekaha]] Sugar Mill and [[Lihue, Hawaii|Lihue]] Plantation closed in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Young| first = Peter T.| title = Ho‘okuleana: Pioneer Mill| work = Ho‘okuleana| accessdate = 2018-04-22| date = 2013-08-02| url = http://totakeresponsibility.blogspot.com/2013/08/pioneer-mill.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynasty"/&gt; Amfac Hawaii went into [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/02/28/news/index.html Amfac mired in debt]. ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Amfac Hotels &amp; Resorts was retained by JMB and was renamed [[Xanterra Parks and Resorts]]. Amfac Hawaii was reorganized as Kaanapali Land, LLC and the bankruptcy closed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Annual Report (form 10K) of Kaanapali Land, LLC |date= March 29, 2010 |work=US Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR |url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1230058/000089262610000036/kaa_k09.txt |accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Stihl''' (November 10, 1896 in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] &amp;ndash; January 14, 1973 in Rohrbronn, [[Baden-Württemberg]], Germany) was an [[engineer]] and important [[inventor]] in the area of [[chainsaw]]s, and the founder of Andreas [[Stihl]] AG &amp; Company.

Stihl founded a company for steam boiler prefiring systems in 1926 in the town of [[Cannstatt]], near [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. In the same year, he patented the "Cutoff Chainsaw for Electric Power." This saw weighed in at a hefty 63&amp;nbsp;kg and had a one-inch gauge chain with handles at either end. Due to its bulk, it required two people to operate. In 1929, Stihl built the world's first [[petrol]] powered chainsaw, named the 'tree-felling machine.' The company continued to grow and in 1931 it became the first European company to export chainsaws to America and Russia. Was the chief supplier of chainsaws to the Nazis and was named the official chainsaw of the Reich and Germany.  In 1954 [[Jonsereds Fabrikers AB|Jonsered]] created the prototype for the modern chainsaw. A design Stihl utilizes to this day. In 1959, the company introduced the lightweight Stihl Contra chainsaw.

The company he founded still bears his name, and is privately owned by his children. Andreas Stihl had four children with his first wife, among them [[Hans Peter Stihl]] (born 1932) and Eva Mayr-Stihl (born 1935), who succeeded her father in managing the company and remaining Vorstand till 2002.

'''Bhāju Ratna Kansakār''' ([[Devanagari]]: भाजुरत्न कंसकार) (1882 - 20 December 1956) was a Nepalese trader and philanthropist who laid the foundations of the Jyoti Group, one of the largest business and industrial houses in [[Nepal]]. He was also an important figure in the revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]] in the country when it was being suppressed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= LeVine |first1= Sarah |last2= Gellner |first2= David N.|title= Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal |url= |accessdate= |year=2005 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-674-01908-9 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jyotigroup.org.np/trading |title=Trading |publisher=Jyoti Group |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Bhaju Ratna was born in [[Kathmandu]], the third of four sons of father Kulbir Singh and mother Nanibeti Kansakar. His ancestral home was located at Kel Tol, a business and ceremonial neighborhood in central Kathmandu. Its most important landmark is the temple of Jana Baha Dyah, which is known in [[Sanskrit]] as Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred [[Avalokiteśvara]]). Bhaju Ratna never went to school, and taught himself to read and write.  

The [[Kansakar]]s were engaged in the hereditary occupation of making bronze, brass and copper household utensils. Bhaju Ratna started out as a worker at a relative's workshop in [[Darjeeling]], [[India]] in 1898. Returning to Kathmandu in 1903, Bhaju Ratna got married to Gyan Maya [[Tamrakar]]. He went back to his job in Darjeeling shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hilker |first= DS Kansakar |title= Syamukapu: The Lhasa Newars of Kalimpong and Kathmandu |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=hbgVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=syamukapu&amp;dq=syamukapu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vkfZUZCBJouIrAfr24DQDw&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate= |year=2005 |publisher= Vajra Publications |location= Kathmandu |isbn=99946-644-6-8 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Going into business==

After a few years in Darjeeling, Bhaju Ratna decided to set up a cloth shop in Kathmandu with his savings, and went to [[Mumbai]] to procure stock. Around 1905, he opened a cloth shop at Kel Tol. The business prospered, but in 1918, a massive fire destroyed the entire stock of textiles and yarn, and Bhaju Ratna was ruined. About the same time, his wife died leaving behind four children. 

Bhaju Ratna remarried and moved to [[Kalimpong]], India in 1921 to start afresh as a seller of household utensils for export to [[Tibet]]. Kalimpong was then the start of the caravan route to [[Lhasa]]. As business grew, he brought over craftsmen from Kathmandu and established his own workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hilker |first= DS Kansakar |title= Syamukapu: The Lhasa Newars of Kalimpong and Kathmandu |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=hbgVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=syamukapu&amp;dq=syamukapu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vkfZUZCBJouIrAfr24DQDw&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate= |year=2005 |publisher= Vajra Publications |location= Kathmandu |isbn=99946-644-6-8 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhaju Ratna habitually wore a white cap, and Tibetan traders would often refer to him as Syamukapu, which means "white cap" in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. It would become the name of the business house he subsequently established in Kalimpong and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Timeless trader |first= Mark |last= Turin |url= http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=12653 |newspaper=Nepali Times |date=20 October 2006 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harris |first= Tina |title= Geographical Diversions:  Tibetan Trade, Global Transactions |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=JxCotCnoGrUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=bhajuratna+kalimpong&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=En_w6ppJwB&amp;sig=_O2tFXI9PYmf5pUtVteILQch1Ek&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c5nBUZDIOIurrAeqxoDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=bhajuratna&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2013 |publisher= University of Georgia Press |location= |isbn=9780820345123 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enterprises in Tibet and India==

Bhaju Ratna diversified into forwarding Lhasa-bound cargo for [[Lhasa Newar (trans-Himalayan traders)|Lhasa Newar]] merchants based in the Tibetan capital. Later, he also procured the merchandise for them on commission basis, and dispatched them to Lhasa by mule caravan. By 1930, he had opened his own establishment in Tibet at [[Pagri|Phari]], which lies on the trade route to Lhasa. 

Since most of the merchandise shipped to Lhasa were obtained in [[Kolkata]], he set up an office there too in 1937, and sent his eldest son Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar to work there. In 1939, he set up a business house in Lhasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kansakar |first= Manikratna |editor-first=Kesar |editor-last=Lall |title= The Newar merchants in Lhasa |publisher= Ratna Pustak Bhandar| location=Kathmandu |year=2001|page=111 |chapter= Syamukapu - A recollection |isbn=99933-0-187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhaju Ratna's extensive trading enterprises grew into the Jyoti Group which was founded in the 1940s by Maniharsha Jyoti (1917-1992). It is involved in trading, manufacturing, travel, steel, pharmaceuticals and insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jyotigroup.org.np/jyoti-group |title=Jyoti Group |publisher=Jyoti Group |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Nepal's first steel factory celebrates golden jubilee |first= |last= |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/07/08/money/nepals-first-steel-factory-celebrates-golden-jubilee/250960.html |newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhaju Ratna's grandson [[Padma Jyoti]] is the chairman of the Jyoti Group.

==Religious benefactor==

Bhaju Ratna became one of the most important supporters of the movement to revive Theravada Buddhism at a time when it faced official disapproval at great personal risk. In 1926, following the [[banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal]] by the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime, he took care of them when they arrived in Kalimpong. During the second expulsion in 1944 too, he housed and fed the monks for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietrich|first=Angela|title=Buddhist Monks and Rana Rulers: A History of Persecution|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|year=1996|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001124156/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BH/bh117536.htm|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vandya |first= R.

'''Crowley Milner and Company''', generally referred to as '''Crowley's''', was a [[department store]] chain founded in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 1909. After several years of financial difficulties, the company ceased operation in 1999 and its assets were sold.

Its flagship store, corporate office and warehouse complex occupied two blocks in downtown Detroit for almost 80 years. The store was a direct competitor of [[Hudson's|the J. L. Hudson Company]] and the [[Kern's|Ernst Kern Company]] until Kern's closed in 1959. Crowley's and Hudson's were both noted for their lavish annual Christmas displays. Faced with a decline in retail traffic in downtown Detroit, Crowley's closed its downtown location in July 1977. The firm operated a store in Detroit's New Center area that remained open until the chain's demise in 1999.

On March 11, 1995, the chain acquired [[Steinbach (store)|Steinbach]] in the northeast US. When Crowley's ceased operation in 1999, several of its locations were purchased by discount chain [[Value City]]. Three in the Detroit area were rebranded ''Crowley's Value City'' and remained part of the Value City chain until it also ceased operating in 2008.

== History ==

In 1909, Joseph J. Crowley, his brothers William and Daniel, and William L. Milner joined to save the Detroit-based store of Pardridge &amp; Blackwell that was struggling financially. Joseph Crowley previously worked as a credit manager for the Detroit wholesale firm of Burnham Stoepel and had great experience reorganizing struggling ventures. He and his brothers opened the Crowley Brothers Wholesale Dry Goods Company in 1902. William Milner was a regular customer of the Crowley Brothers through his W.L. Milner Department Store of [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="funding"&gt;{{cite web| title=Crowley, Milner &amp; Company| publisher=FundingUniverse.com/Company Histories| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Crowley-Milner-amp;-Company-Company-History.html| year=1998| accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pardridge &amp; Blackwell formed in 1901&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Book of Detroiters-A Biographical Dictionary of Leading Living Men of the City of Detroit| author=Albert N Marquis, ed.| publisher=A N Marquis &amp; Co| place=Chicago| url=http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mi/county/tuscola/det/detbie-bla.htm| page= 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on the edge of insolvency due to poor management and the recession of 1907. The opportunity to assume control of the retailer came when an executive of the Central Savings Bank of Detroit, one of the store's creditors, approached Joseph Crowley. Crowley agreed on the condition that his two brothers and Milner join him and Crowley, Milner and Company was born.

Immediately after the incorporation of Crowley, Milner and Co., its owners envisioned the store as one of the highest quality retail operations in Detroit. At the turn of the twentieth century, Detroit was regarded as one of the most affluent cities in the United States, and Crowley, Milner &amp; Co. helped to uphold this image. The owners stocked the store with luxurious clothing and gifts imported from Europe and opened a full-service restaurant and grocery store. Within ten years, the Crowley, Milner &amp; Co. expanded its building and was the largest department store in Michigan.  
[[File:Partirdge &amp; Blackwell.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pardridge &amp; Blackwell Building c. 1910 from Farmer and Monroe Streets]]
The Pardridge &amp; Blackwell Building occupied the western half of the block bounded by Farmer Street, Gratiot Avenue, Library and Monroe Streets. It contained six floors with large triple windows on the second through fourth floors divided by piers faced with white glazed brick and terra cotta. The piers formed arches above the windows of the fifth floor with windows on the sixth floor spaced between the [[corbel]]s supporting the elaborate cornice above. Two large illuminated signs proclaiming ""P.&amp; B." inside a heart graced the northwest and southwest corners of the roof. Crowley, Milner expanded the building by removing the cornice to add a seventh and eighth floor and expanding east to Library Street.  In 1920, they then constructed an eleven-story "home store" on the site of the Goldberg Brothers store east of Library Street.  Initially, the {{convert|100000|sqft|abbr=on}} annex was connected to the main building by a tunnel.  In 1923, the city of Detroit granted permission to connect the two structures above ground and an elaborate five-story bridge opened in 1925.&lt;ref name="buildings"&gt;{{cite web| title=Crowley's Department Store| url=http://www.buildingsofdetroit.com/places/crowleys| publisher=Buildings of Detroit| date=| accessdate=2011-05-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430000456/http://www.buildingsofdetroit.com/places/crowleys| archivedate=2011-04-30| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrances on Farmer, Gratiot and Monroe were framed by large arches and the windows above the doors on the second floor were topped by a large [[pediment]].  One notable feature of the department store was wooden escalators which remained until the structure was demolished in 1977.

The company stumbled slightly when Milner was killed in 1923 while traveling to his store in Toledo. The company lost its president and merchandising expert and his 42 percent interest in the corporation was sold by his heirs. Without Milner, the store eventually came to be known as Crowley's, but the company retained its full name until 1999. Joseph Crowley succeeded his friend and partner as president, but the loss of full control by the tight-knit group affected the company for many years.

Like many retailers, the [[Great Depression]] impacted Crowley's deeply.  Sales plummeted from $39 million in 1928 to only $10 million in 1929.  Joseph Crowley died in 1937 and his widow repurchased the shares of the company sold by William Milner's heirs to give the Crowleys majority ownership in the corporation.  Daniel J. Crowley, Joseph's son, became president and helped the company chart a course to recovery.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

===Expansion===

The company began its transformation from a single store to a chain in 1959 when Crowley's expanded to the Detroit suburbs by opening its first store in the Westborn Shopping Center in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]].  This was followed by a store in the Grand River/Greenfield shopping area in northwest Detroit in 1960 and identical stores in the [[Livonia Marketplace|Livonia]] and [[Macomb Mall|Macomb]] Malls in 1964.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web| date=May 21, 2010| url=  http://departmentstoremuseum.blogspot.com/2010/05/crowley-milner-co-detroit-michigan.html| publisher=Department Store Museum.com| accessdate=2011-01-28| title=Crowley, Milner &amp; Co., Detroit, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this expansion was at the expense of the downtown store.  By 1960, the store consolidated enough to allow the Veteran's Administration to lease the lower six-floors of the annex building for $147,000 per year.&lt;ref name="buildings"/&gt;

In 1972, the firm purchased the Demery's chain which consisted of a store at Woodward and Milwaukee in the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] neighborhood, and in the suburbs of [[Birmingham, Michigan|Birmingham]] and [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills]].  The New Center store later moved into the New Center One Building.

The [[Lakeside Mall]] store in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan|Sterling Heights]] opened in 1975 followed in 1980 by stores at [[Universal Mall]] in Warren and [[Arborland Center]] in Ann Arbor.  The [[Tel-Twelve Mall]] unit opened in 1985.  In 1986, stores opened in [[Westland, Michigan|Westland]] and at [[Courtland Center]] in [[Burton, Michigan|Burton]], the latter approximately one hour north of Detroit.

The downtown store closed in 1977 due to declining sales.  This was followed by closure of the office and warehouse building in 1978 and the Ann Arbor store in 1983 when the Arborland Center was converted to a discount center.  Offices moved to a building on Lafayette Boulevard at the western edge of the downtown business district and remained there until the company's liquidation.  The Grand River-Greenfield store was only {{convert|45000|sqft|abbr=on}}, but continuously performed well in sales.  It was located in several storefronts along Grand River Avenue and in 1987 the landlord wanted to redivide the building to lure new businesses.  It offered Crowley's a portion of the renovated structure but the store declined.&lt;ref name="funding"/&gt;

In 1985, members of the Crowley family, who still owned more than 51 percent of the company stock agreed to sell the store to Oakland Holding Company.&lt;ref name="briefs"&gt;{{cite news| title=Briefs| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/14/business/briefs-052421.html?scp=40&amp;sq=crowley+milner&amp;st=nyt| date=14 July 1985| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline ===

In 1990, Crowley's opened a new prototype men's store adjacent to its Farmington store which immediately was successful.  The [[store-within-a-store]] concept focused on men's businesswear and was immediately expanded to other branches.

This was an attempt to lure customers back from newcomers to the Detroit market such as [[MainStreet]], a unit of [[Federated Department Stores]] which later became [[Kohl's]], and [[Mervyns]]. Crowley's changed its product line to feature more upmarket with lines by [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Ralph Lauren]] aimed at the [[Hudson's]] or [[Lord &amp; Taylor]] shopper. This move alienated many traditional customers as Crowley's was seen as a more mid-market store with locations in Detroit's older suburbs.

The prototype men's clothing store proved to be a successful move. Sales were strong, and the company discussed plans to introduce more similar stores in the future. This store within a store had its own entrance and focused on men's suits and accessories; similar to the [[Men's Wearhouse]]. The young men's and sportswear was in the located in the main store. Also, Crowley's instituted a "Frequent Buyer" program at all of its stores, as a method of encouraging customer loyalty. The program kept track of each customer's monthly purchase amounts, and then the stores issued gift certificates based on each person's sales figures.

Despite the initial success of the Frequent Buyers program and the new store format, annual sales dropped almost $10 million from 1991 to 1992.

In March 1991, Crowley, Milner &amp; Co. announced it was seeking a merger partner that was large enough to help the company expand.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web| title=Crowley Milner &amp; Co seeking buyer| publisher=alacrastore.com| author=Thompson Financial Mergers and Acquisitions| date=March 29, 1991| accessdate=2011-02-03|url=http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&amp;A/Crowley_Milner_Co_seeking_buyer-197735020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was management's opinion that long-term growth for the Crowley's chain would come through acquisition of some type, with the most likely scenario being an acquisition by another party.

In late 1992, the company opened a store carrying only women's clothing in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], based on the concept of its men's store in Farmington.  The store was unsuccessful and analysts were split on the reasons.  Some felt it was due to the location or layout while others cited the unfamiliarity of the Crowley's brand in the Lansing market.&lt;ref name="newswire"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Highbeam.com| title=Crowley, Milner &amp; Company Opens Concept Store, Sarah's by Crowley's| work=PR Newswire| date=November 12, 1992| accessdate=2011-02-03| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12768722.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the company obtained a revolving line of credit from [[Schottenstein Stores]], which provided Crowley, Milner &amp; Co. with the ability to resume payments to its creditors. It then implemented other changes which included a new computer software system to manage personnel, closing the Westland store and eliminating the Frequent Buyers program.

The result was that sales increased in 1994 and the company announced its first profitable quarter in almost five years. Management continued to rebuild financial stability by obtaining a new working capital loan from Congress Financial Corporation to replace the agreement with Schottenstein Stores Corp. Management also announced a two-for-one common stock split, introduced its own credit card and the new slogan "Detroit's Own Department Store".

Sales in 1995 rose to $109.9 million. On November 21 of that year, Crowley's purchased the Steinbach chain with 24 stores in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Vermont from the Schottenstein family.  The company planned to sell approximately 10 of the stores and continue operation of the others.  It ultimately retained 16 stores.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| title=Crowley, Milner To Take Over Steinbach Chain| work=New York Times-Company News| publisher=nyt.com| date=November 21, 1995| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E5DB1339F932A15752C1A963958260| accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite news| work=Crain's Detroit Business| title=Robert Carlson, former CEO of Crowley, Milner &amp; Co., dies| date=March 12, 2009| publisher=CrainsDetroit.com| url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090312/FREE/903129984/robert-carlson-former-ceo-of-crowley-milner-and-co-dies#| author=Daniel Duggan| accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Crowley's proposed a new store for [[Novi, Michigan|Novi]]'s Main Street development but this fell through by 1999, as did a 1998 takeover of local women's fashion chain Winkelman's.&lt;ref name="winkelmans"&gt;{{cite news| title=Bidding for Winkelman's: Crowley's may Face Competition at Auction| work=Crain's Detroit Business| publisher=CrainsDetroit.com| author=Matt Roush| url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/19980112/SUB/801120887| date=January 12, 1998| accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It did expand into the Winkelman's store at [[Tel-Twelve Mall]] and opened a separate Men's store in that mall.

On June 1, 1997, Crowley's opened its enlarged store in the atrium of the New Center One Building.  The expansion was {{convert| 7500|sqft|abbr=on}} in space previously occupied by Winkelman's and a bookstore which became children's and home stores separate from men's and women's clothing.  This was not their largest location, but was the most profitable store by square footage.&lt;ref name="cdb"&gt;{{cite news| author=Matt Roush| work=Crian's Detroit Business| publisher=CrainsDetroit.com| date=June 30, 1997| accessdate=2011-01-31| url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/19970630/SUB/706300862| title=A New Center of Attention: Crowley's Success Spreads Beyond GM Area}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time it hearlded the success of the New Center store, Crowley's announced a costly lesson from its purchase of Steinbach in the form of a $4 million loss during the first quarter of 1997.  This was up from $1.3 million for the first quarter of 1996.&lt;ref name="loss"&gt;{{cite news| author=Matt Roush| work=Crain's Detroit Business| publisher=CrainsDetroit.com| date=May 26, 1997|accessdate=2011-01-31| title=Crowley Posts $4M Loss in 1Q| url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/19970526/SUB/705260901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The losses proved too great and in 1997, the company began to downsize in the hope of remaining viable. Crowley's lost the lease on the Birmingham store it acquired as part of the Demrey's merger when the landlord announced it would redevelop the site into a retail-entertainment complex.[[Crowley's#cite note-rumblings-15|[15]]]

Losses which were $5.2 million for the first half of 1998 could not be offset with renovation delays in reopening its largest location, the  Macomb Mall store in time for critical back to school sales. On January 4, 1999, Shottenstein Stores and Value City took control of Crowley's in a stock swap transaction. Two weeks later, trading of the company's stock was suspended.[[Crowley's#cite note-trade-16|[16]]] On February 8, 1999, Crowley's filed for reorganization under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy laws and announced it would liquidate the remaining nine Crowley's and 16 Steinbach's stores and sell eight additional locations to Value City.[[Crowley's#cite note-carlson-9|[9]]][[Crowley's#cite note-highbeam-17|[17]]]

The Livonia Mall, Universal Mall, Macomb Mall and Westborn Mall stores were sold to discounter [[Value City]] who operated the three as [[Crowley's Value City]].[[Crowley's#cite note-crain-13|[13]]] The Westborn Mall location was resold and demolished to construct a [[Kroger]].[[Crowley's#cite note-14|[14]]] Another mall-based location at [[Lakeside Mall]] in Sterling Heights was sold to [[Target Corporation]] to create an expansion to the [[Hudson's]] store. Four Steinbach stores in New Jersey ([[Seaview Square Mall|Ocean Township]], [[Bergen Mall|Paramus]], [[Manalapan Mall|Manalapan]], [[Shore Mall|Egg Harbor Township]]) were also sold to Value City.

'''Dividing territories''' (also '''market division''') is an agreement by two companies to stay out of each other's way and reduce competition in the agreed-upon territories. The process known as geographic market allocation is one of several [[anti-competitive practices]] outlawed under [[United States antitrust law]]s. The term is generally understood to include dividing customers as well.

For example, in 1984, [[FMC Corp.]] and Asahi Chemical agreed to divide territories for the sale of [[microcrystalline cellulose]], and later FMC attempted to eliminate all vestiges of competition by inviting smaller rivals also to collude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/12/fmc.htm|title=FTC Order Settles Charges that FMC Corp. and Japan's Asahi Chemical Co. Engaged in Illegal Anticompetitive Practices - Federal Trade Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2531">'''External risks''' are generally something that is uncontrollable by the first party.

==In contract law==
In [[contract law]], are risks that are produced by a non-human source and are beyond [[human]] control. They are unexpected but happen regularly enough in a general population to be broadly predictable, and may be the subject of [[casualty insurance]].
Good examples of external risks are [[natural disasters]] such as [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanoes]].

[[Insurance]] adjusters analyze external risks on a normal basis. Measuring risks of the environment is common practice throughout [[insurance claims]]. As far as claims go, most external risks, or an "[[Act of God]]", are protected by [[property insurance]].

==In project management==
In [[project management]]; Risks that are external to the project and the project manager cannot control.
Good examples of external risks are changes in government [[legislation]], changes in [[strategy]] from senior managers, and the [[economy]].

==Common examples&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
|title=External Events
|journal=Information Security Handbook
|url=http://ishandbook.bsewall.com/risk/Assess/Risk/External_Events.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
* [[Hurricanes]]
* [[Earthquakes]]
* [[Tornadoes]]
* [[Floods]]
* Volcanic Eruptions
* [[Lightning]]
* [[Fire]]
* [[Disease]] (such as pandemics/epidemics)
* Environmental Hazards (pollution)
* Civil Disruptions (vandalism, terrorism)

==Assessing external risks==
Three separate aspects should be analyzed when determining the amount of external risk that exists.

# '''Frequency of Occurrence''' - What are the odds of an external risk occurring in your situation? Do similar risk situations happen often in your area? This assesses the probability of the external risk.
# '''Duration of the Occurrence''' - Over what time period will the external risk last? How long will the affected party be at an altered state due to this risk? This assesses the amount of time that would be lost due to the risk and its effects.
# '''Loss of Assets''' - What types of property could be damaged or destroyed from this risk? This assesses the state of property and assets after the external risk occurs.

'''Francis''' "'''Frank'''" '''C. Buckley''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CM}} (April 8, 1921 – February 1, 2016) was president and spokesperson for the [[Buckley's]] company, founded by his adoptive father [[W.K. Buckley]], in 1920. In 2005, the company was sold to [[Novartis]].

In 2003, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] for being "an inspiring example of how one can positively influence the lives of many".&lt;ref&gt;{{OCC|7174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Buckley was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1921 and adopted by William Buckley, who had founded Buckley's Company in 1920; one year prior to Francis' adoption. Buckley graduated from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in commerce and finance.  Shortly after graduating from college Buckley enlisted in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm as a carrier-based fighter pilot and served in [[World War II]] during his time with the Royal Navy Fleet. He started his career in the family business as a traveling door to door salesman for three years.

After Buckley had served his family business as a salesman, he took a position in the Management department. Frank Buckley was more interested in broadcast media, finance, and administration type of business while William was first and foremost a salesman; this dynamic element between the father-son combo proved to be an extremely and immensely effective tandem. William K. Buckley died in 1978.  Frank Buckley assumed his adoptive father's position in the family business as the president.

In the mid-1980s Buckley became the spokesman for Buckley's. He first came on the scene as the spokesman when the company implemented the satirically honest ad campaign that owned up to Buckley's "awful taste". This campaign was featured on many television and radio commercials. Because of Buckley's time and success as the company's spokesman on the many featured commercials, he became a recognizable public figure.

Since Buckley was a small boy, he always sustained an interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Buckley served as the Proprietary Association of Canada's president—which as since been changed to the Non-Prescription Drug Manufacturers Association of Canada—and remained a member until his death. Buckley was always very active throughout his life and involved with many community service organizations. He died on February 1, 2016 in Toronto at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/frank-buckley-famous-canadian-pitchman-dies-at-94/article28529498/Frank Buckley, famous Canadian pitchman, dies at 94]", ''The Globe and Mail'', 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank McBrearty Jnr''' is an Irish politician and businessman. The son of [[Frank McBrearty Snr]], McBrearty became known nationally as a result of the [[Morris Tribunal]]'s ruling that police had tried to frame him for the 1996 murder of Richie Barron. McBrearty pursued the Irish state in a long-running legal battle to restore his good name.

'''Getty Oil''' is an American oil marketing company with its origins as part of the large integrated oil company founded by [[J. Paul Getty]].

==History==
[[Image:Cheshire Getty, Cheshire CT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;In [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], a Cheshire Getty roadside gasoline station.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Starting in 1949, J. Paul Getty negotiated a series of lucrative oil leases with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. [[Gordon Getty]] and his family inherited a 40% interest in the company when J. Paul Getty died in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/01/news/companies/getty-fortune/ Where the Getty family fortune came from]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, after entering into a binding agreement to sell Getty and its 2.3-billion-barrel stockpile of proven oil reserves to [[Pennzoil]], Gordon Getty struck a dramatic deal to sell the company to [[Texaco]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitefield, Debra. [http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-19/business/fi-1170_1_gordon-getty The Deal: How Getty Ended Up With Texaco], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 19, 1986. Accessed August 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 1985, in the case of ''[[Pennzoil#Pennzoil, Co. v. Texaco, Inc.|Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil, Co.]]'', Pennzoil won a US$10.53 billion verdict against Texaco in the largest civil verdict in U.S. history as a result of the violation of the binding agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, Tamar. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/19/business/pennzoil-texaco-fight-raised-key-questions.html?pagewanted=all "Pennzoil-Texaco Fight Raised Key Questions"], ''The New York Times'', December 19, 1987. Accessed August 30, 3016.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the reserves were sold, only some of the refineries changed hands, and Getty continued to exist as a downstream entity. Getty gas stations in the Northeast were sold off as a condition of the buyout. The company became known as Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Getty Petroleum Marketing was sold to [[Lukoil]] and [[ExxonMobil|Mobil]] in certain areas and then in 2011 to Norwegian investors before filing for bankruptcy protection in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303497804579238422859563940 Getty Petroleum Creditors Sue Former Owners for $6 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian company Westerhoudt AG, run by Olaf Westerhoudt, acquired the rights to the Getty Oil name in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.

At one point, Getty Oil owned a majority stake of [[ESPN]], before it was sold to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4942">'''Hardware certification''' is the process through which computer hardware is tested to ensure it is compatible with specific software packages, and operates as intended in critical situations. With ever dropping prices of [[computer hardware|hardware]] devices, the market for networking devices and systems is undergoing a kind of change that can be loosely termed as ‘generalization’. Big established enterprises like [[Cisco]], [[Novell]], [[Sun Microsystems]] etc., no longer manufacture all the hardware required in the market, instead they ‘license’ or ‘certify’ small hardware players operating out from countries like [[Taiwan]] or [[China]].

==Certification process==

=== Vendor certification ===

To obtain certification, the hardware or software has to conform to a set of [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]] and [[quality standards]] that are put in place by the original creator of [[technology]]. Usually the certification process is done by a “Certification partner”.  Certification partners are selected by the original creators of the technology and these partners are given the authority to do the testing and certification process. After a product is found to be compatible, it is labelled as xxx certified where xxx is the name of the original creator of the technology. Vendors use a “label” on the products  to advertise the fact of compatibility with the said technology.

The process of certification ensures that the products made by different manufacturers are standardized and are [[Computer compatibility|compatible]] with each other as indicated in [[computer hardware|hardware]] or [[software]] platform.

=== Third-party certification ===

Third-party certification is undertaken by an independent body. To obtain third-party certification, the hardware or software has to confirm to a set of [[quality standards]] determined by the third-party.

==Various certifications==
* '''Cisco certification''': Cisco manufactures networking hardware devices and systems. Hardware and software companies use the certification issued by Cisco’s partners to ensure that their ware is compatible with the Cisco standards and protocols.
* '''Sun Certification''':This is for Independent Software vendors (ISV) involved in developing applications that are compatible with Java technology. Java was created by Sun Microsystems and is widely used to write enterprise and consumer application solutions.
* '''Novell Certification''': Novell began certifying partner hardware with NetWare in the 1980s.  The name of the certification is "YES Certified".   The Yes Certified program involves certification of Partner hardware with SUSE Linux Enterprise software.  Since 2005 the program has shifted from Novell NetWare to SuSE Linux and has become the SUSE YES Certified Program.  The certified Hardware is given a Yes Certification Bulletin which can be viewed online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp SUSE Yes Certification Bulletin Search Page]&lt;/ref&gt;  More information about the Yes Certification program can be found at SUSE's website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suse.com/partners/ihv/yes/ SUSE Yes Certification program website]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Microsoft's certification''' for Vista: This certification is called "WHQL" Windows Hardware Quality Labs". The dominant position of Windows in the computing world ensured that there are enormous number of applications written and hardware manufactured. This WHQL signifies that the hardware or software works with the Vista operating system. 
* '''Real Certification''': This certification is given by RealNetworks for ensuring compatibility with its media player “RealPlayer”. Mobile computing devices like cell phones and PDAs are equipped with RealPlayer to enable them to play streaming content.
* '''Linux certification''' programs: Hardware vendors use this certification for their products to ensure compatibility with [[Linux]] based systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-laptop.net/ Linux on Laptops]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''SpectraLink certification''': SpectraLink VIEW Certification Program is designed to ensure interoperability for enterprise Wi-Fi based infrastructure products that support NetLink Wireless Telephones.
* '''Altiris Developer Program Certification''': Altiris is a leading vendor of IT service-oriented management solutions.
* '''EMC Centera Proven''': This certification is a good way to demonstrate that your solution takes full advantage of EMC Centera Platform which can be crucial to sales.
* '''Skype Certification''': Skype-certified products satisfy both the Technical Requirements and the Design Guidelines of Skype.
* '''Linux-Tested Certification''': Hardware Vendors can use the Linux-Tested program from AppLabs to certify their products are compatible with the Linux OS and have been tested for complete functionality.

'''Harry Alfred Rée''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[OBE]] (15 October 1914 – 17 May 1991) was a British educationist and wartime member of the [[Special Operations Executive]].

Harry Rée was born in England, the son of Dr. Alfred Rée, a chemist who was from  a Danish Jewish family, and Lavinia Elisabeth Dimmick, the American-born great granddaughter of chemist and industrialist [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/Scandinavia/ree-index.htm "Hartvig Philip Rée og hans slægt"], Josef Fischer, Copenhagen, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flojborg.dk/slaegt/3846.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081713/http://www.flojborg.dk/slaegt/3846.htm |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Shrewsbury School]], [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and the [[Institute of Education]], [[University of London]]. In 1937 he became a language master at [[Bradford Grammar School]], and later at [[Langley Park School for Boys|Beckenham and Penge County School for Boys]]. In 1940 he married Hetty, daughter of Eardley Vine, of [[Beaconsfield]].&lt;ref&gt;"Forthcoming marriages", ''[[The Times]]'', 18 April 1940&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children, Janet, Brian and the philosopher Jonathan.

In the [[Second World War]] Rée was registered in 1940 as a [[conscientious objector]] conditional upon working in the [[National Fire Service]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperial War Museum]], Sound Archives, 10858/2&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1941 re-registered for military service and was called up into the army. He later volunteered for the [[Special Operations Executive]], receiving a captaincy in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and the codename "César". In April 1943 he was parachuted into France and joined the [[SOE F Section networks|Acrobat Network]] around [[Montbéliard]]. Later he became active in the [[SOE F Section networks|Stockbroker Network]] around [[Belfort]].

Rée spoke against [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] bombing in France, arguing that it was turning French [[public opinion]] against the Allies. He suggested that SOE agents could organise effective [[sabotage]] of factories on the ground. He organised the destruction of the [[Peugeot]] factory at [[Sochaux]] by convincing the local director, who was already resisting, to co-operate with SOE. The local director's sabotage was more efficient, and he managed to share tactical information on the Wehrmacht projects they had had to become involved in (especially the [V-1]). On 5 November 1943 Rée organised a decoy attack on compressors and transformers at Sochaux to transfer the blame. Therefore, the RAF did not bomb the factory.

The Germans tried to capture Rée, who escaped a Feldgendarmerie group after being shot four times and, according to his own account, had to swim across a river and crawl through a forest. He managed to reach [[Switzerland]] and still keep some contact with his organisation. In May 1944 he was replaced by an American officer, E.F. Floege, and returned to Britain. He starred in the film ''Now it Can be Told'' (aka ''[[School for Danger]]''), produced by the RAF Film Unit, which told the story of SOE's activities in France.

In 1951, Rée became headmaster of [[Watford Grammar School for Boys]]. He appeared occasionally on the BBC Television "Brains Trust" programme. In 1962 he became the first professor of education at the [[University of York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/40thanniversary/1960sprofile.htm The University of York – 1960s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002233108/http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/presspr/40thanniversary/1960sprofile.htm |date=2 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rée wrote a biography of the educator and inventor of [[Village College]]s, [[Henry Morris (education)|Henry Morris]] : ''Educator Extraordinary: The Life and Achievements of Henry Morris'' ([[Longman]], 1973) and produced a compilation of Morris' talks and articles, ''The Henry Morris Collection'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1984). He also wrote The Three Peaks of Yorkshire a walking guide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-morr.htm Henry Morris – infed.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1991.

==Biography==
Born in [[Zagreb]], Čermak became a small businessman in the 1980s. In the 1990s, he entered the oil business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nezavisne.com/komentari/kolumne/Cermak-ili-prica-o-hrvatskom-uspjehu-14138.html | newspaper = [[Nezavisne novine]] | author = Denis Kuljiš | language = Croatian | title = Čermak, ili priča o hrvatskom uspjehu | date = 2007-09-08 | accessdate = 2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 1991, Čermak held the position of Vice President of the Executive Board of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and also served as an advisor to the President of the Republic of Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]]. In 1991, he was appointed the Assistant Minister of Defence in the Croatian Government, a position he held until 1993. While in this position and thereafter, he held the rank of [[Colonel General]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
He was succeeded in this position by his former chauffeur, [[Vladimir Zagorec]].&lt;ref name=Lesen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.at/a/ex-general-vladimir-zagorec-vom-landvermesser-kroaten-220538|work=News Networld Internetservice GmbH

'''Jindřich Waldes''' (also Heinrich Waldes or Henry Waldes) 2 July 1876 [[Nemyšl]] – 1 July 1941 [[Havana]] was a leading industrialist, founder of the [[Waldes Koh-i-noor Company]], Czech patriot of Jewish origin and art collector.

==Life==
[[Image:WaldesKohinoor.jpg|thumb|Waldes Koh-i-noor fasteners for the German market, 1920s]]
Karel Waldes, father of Jindřich, had an inn and a small haberdashery shop in the village of Nemyšl near the town of [[Tábor]] in southern [[Bohemia]]. He wanted his son to continue his business but Jindřich found a position of a clerk at the firm of Eduard Lokesch and Son in [[Prague]]. This company made buttons and cufflinks. As Waldes had a good knowledge of languages he became Lokesch’s business agent and travelled the world on behalf of the firm.
In 1902 together with an engineer Hynek Puc (1856–1938) Waldes left Lokesch and founded his own company Waldes a spol. A year later Puc invented a special machine that inserted a small spring into concealed dress fasteners, the main product of the new firm. The new machine supplemented labour of ten skilled workers. With the increased production Puc kept inventing more machines to support the manufacture of pins, safety pins, needles and buttons. The world-renowned Waldes trademark, Miss KIN, came about in 1912 when Waldes on his ocean trip met Elizabeth Coyne&lt;ref&gt;'Koh-i-noor Girl', ''Koh-i-noor Magazin'', Volume IV, number 37, January 1933, page 3, as her signature under her photograph confirms.&lt;/ref&gt; who playfully put one fastener in her eye.  [[František Kupka]] painted her portrait in oils and [[Vojtěch Preissig]] from it designed the firm’s trademark. The other trade names used were Koh-i-noor and Otello.

Waldes Koh-i-noor headquarters were located in [[Prague]] suburbs of [[Vršovice]]. Soon the company grew to a large concern with branch factories in [[Warsaw]], [[Dresden]], [[Vienna]], [[Paris]], [[Barcelona]] and [[New York City]].

On 1 September 1939 Waldes was imprisoned by [[Gestapo]] after the [[Third Reich]] occupation of [[Czechoslovakia]] and kept in concentration camps [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald]], arriving in Dachau on September 10, 1939 and transferred to Buchenwald on September 26 of the same year. In 1941 his family, who were sent to USA by Waldes before the war (he decided to remain in Prague as a Czech patriot) paid the Nazi authorities 8 million Czech crowns (about 1 Million Reichsmarks or $250,000 US) ransom. In Buchenwald he suffered a diabetic attack, and was in the prison hospital from 11 April 1940 until his release on 2 June 1941. The Gestapo then transported Waldes by plane to Lisbon, Portugal, where he boarded a United States-bound ship. However, Waldes did not survive the journey to the USA and died under suspicious circumstances on the ship which stopped at [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] in May 1941.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He [Waldes] arrived on a Portuguese ship in Cuba. In the moment that he stepped onto solid ground, he broke down and died."&lt;ref name="Aufbau"&gt;Obituary in ''Aufbau'' Magazine, New York, July 25, 1941. Translated from the German: "Er kam mit einem portugiesischen Schiff auf Cuba an. In dem Augenblick, da er den festen Boden betrat, brach er zusammen und starb.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to witness testimony during a case in the US in the late 1950s, Waldes actually died in a hospital in Havana.&lt;ref&gt;Lauterbach, E: International Law Reports, Vol. 29, Cambridge University Press, 1966, Page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated at a memorial attended by several hundred people on 15 July 1941 at Fresh Pond, Maspeth, in New York.&lt;ref name="Aufbau"/&gt;

Waldes was also a passionate art collector of contemporary Czech art. In 1918 in [[Prague]] he founded Waldes Museum for his collection of buttons which had over 70 thousand items. The collection was transferred after the [[Second World War]] to Museum of Decorative Arts (Uměleckoprůmyslové museum) in [[Prague]]. Apart from buttons he collected works of Czech painters especially [[František Kupka]]’s paintings. They became friends in 1919 and remained so until 1938. Waldes supported Kupka throughout his career by buying his canvases. Part of Jindřich Waldes’ collection held by the [[National Gallery in Prague]] had been returned to his descendants living in the United States.

In 2007 the Prague City Court rendered the decision to return fifty percent of the Czech Koh-i-Noor holdings to the Waldes family heirs. However, in 2010 the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] in [[Brno]] reversed the decision, stating that the [[Beneš decrees]] of 1945 handed the property to the Czech state, not the Communist seizures in 1948.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fischer was born on 3 June 1947 in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]].

===Career===

Fischer worked as a business owner before entering politics.

In 2001, he was elected to the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]] for [[Electoral region of Mining and Pastoral|Mining and Pastoral]], representing [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]].&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;[[David Farrell (political scientist)|David M.

He served as the Vice President of One Nation until 2002, when he served as its Leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2002/01/17/archive/far-right-australian-leaves-politics-jewish-leaders-wary-of-her-legacy Far-right Australian Leaves Politics; Jewish Leaders Wary of Her Legacy], [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 17 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

After the resignation of [[Paddy Embry]], he and [[Frank Hough]] were the party's only MPs in Western Australia. In June 2004, he and Hough both resigned from the party to sit as [[independent (politician)|independent]]s. Fischer, unlike Embry and Hough, did not join the [[New Country Party]] and was defeated as an independent in 2005. He has subsequently contested elections affiliated with [[Graeme Campbell (politician)|Graeme Campbell]], a former [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor]] MP and founder of the [[Australia First Party]].

'''Colonel John Page''' (26 December 1628 – 23 January 1692), a merchant in [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]] on the [[Virginia Peninsula]], was a member of the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] and the Council of the [[Virginia Colony]]. A wealthy landowner, Page donated land and funds for the first brick [[Bruton Parish Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.acswebnetworks.com/1/1318/ABriefGuideToBrutonParishChurchforWebsite1.pdf "A Brief Guide to Bruton Parish Church"]&lt;/ref&gt; Col. Page was a prime force behind the small community gaining the site of the new [[College of William &amp; Mary]], founded in 1693, as well as a chief proponent of the village being designated the colony's capital in 1698.

These events resulted in the renaming of Middle Plantation as [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in 1699, perhaps most well known as the birthplace of democratic governmental principals among the patriots before and during the [[American Revolution]]. In the early 21st century, Colonel Page's tiny Middle Plantation is the modern home of the restored colonial city now known as [[Colonial Williamsburg]], one of the most popular tourism destinations in the world.

Original church built 1683 on land donated by Colonel John Page. The shaft commemorating Col. Page is at right of the church door in this photograph by [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]].]]
According to the Genealogy of the Page Family in Virginia, published in 1883, "John Page, son of Thomas Page (b. 1597), of Sudbury, County Middlesex, England, seventh son of Richard Page, second son of John Page (b. 1528), first of Henry Page (b. 1500), of Wembley, County Middlesex, England, all of the Parish of Harrow, was born at Sudbury in A.D. 1627.  He immigrated to America about 1650 at about 23 years of age, and became the progenitor of the Page-family in Virginia." &lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/master/gdc/scdser01/200401/books_on_film_project/loc06/20060630022ge.pdf '' Genealogy of the Page Family in Virginia, published in 1883'', pp14-15, ]&lt;/ref&gt;  John Page's niece Mary Whaley (daughter of his brother Matthew and wife of James Whaley of Bruton Parish, York County, Virginia) is buried in the churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Lyon G., "Grammar and Mattey Practice and Model School", ''William and Mary Quarterly'', July 1895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1887 [[Henry Burke]], the [[Somerset Herald|Somerset Herald of Arms in Ordinary]], concluded that John Page was related to the Page family of [[Harrow on the Hill]].[https://archive.org/details/genealogyofpagef00page][http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22464]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Col. John Page by Peter Lely.jpeg|thumb|right|260px|Col. John Page of Middle Plantation, Williamsburg, Virginia, by [[Peter Lely|Sir Peter Lely]]. [[College of William and Mary]]]]

John Page became a merchant, and emigrated to the [[Virginia colony]]; his sister Elizabeth (wife of [[Edward Digges]]) and brother Matthew also emigrated to Virginia. In about 1656, John Page married Alice Lukin,&lt;ref name=Channing&gt;Genealogy of the Page Family in Virginia, Richard Channing Moore Page, M.D., New York, 1893 [https://archive.org/details/genealogyofpagef00page]&lt;/ref&gt; (1625–1698) perhaps the daughter of Edward Lukin, a [[Virginia Company]] shareholder.&lt;ref&gt;Dorman, John Frederick, ''Adventurers of Purse and Person'', 4th ed., Vol. 2, pp494-495.  Dorman states: "The longstanding identification of Alice Page ... as daughter of Edward Lukin has not been confirmed."  After discussing the differences between the arms carved on the Page tomb, and the arms borne by known Lukin families, Dorman concludes: "There are other extant American gravestones engraved with arms differing from the actual arms of the individual, mistakes apparently having been made because the stone cutter referred to an armory or other collection of published arms when precise descriptions were not provided, or perhaps not even known, by the family of the deceased."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pages originally lived in the New Towne section at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].

The Pages settled in [[York County, Virginia|York County]] in 1655. In 1662, the Pages had a large brick cross-plan house built in nearby [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]]. A wealthy landowner, Page owned 330 acres (1.3&amp;nbsp;km²) in Middle Plantation, including much of what is now [[Duke of Gloucester Street]], Nicholson Street, and part of Francis Street in the restored area of [[Colonial Williamsburg]]. In 1672, Page patented 3600 acres (15&amp;nbsp;km²) in [[New Kent County, Virginia|New Kent County]] which became Mehixton Plantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Summer Hill: History of the Summer Hill Site|url=http://www.virginiadigs.net/summer_hill/history.html|author=|last=Hobbs|first=Tom|work=VirginiaDigs|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He donated land and £20 for the first brick [[Bruton Parish Church]] which was completed in 1683, and was located immediately adjacent to the site of the present larger restored structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brutonparish.org/article140827.htm A Brief History of Bruton Parish Church, brutonparish.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1683, he came into possession of a tract of land which originally belonged to his brother Matthew in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]] known as Neck of Land. It is also known that he owned property at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in New Towne section.

John Page was a member of the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] starting in 1665. He played a pivotal role in supporting the efforts of Reverend Doctor [[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]] in the founding of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in 1693, which was located at Middle Plantation. Beginning in 1677, he is believed to have been an early advocate for moving the capitol to Middle Plantation, which eventually occurred in 1699, seven years after his death. (Middle Plantation was renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in honor of [[William III of England|King William III]] shortly thereafter).

Colonel John Page and his wife Alice Lukin Page are buried at Bruton Parish Church in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Channing/&gt; Their tombstone, originally located within the church graveyard, was later moved to the church vestibule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/photos/2003/31/7136184_1044135375.jpg Photograph of the headstone of Col.

==Family==
[[File:PageArms.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|[[Coat of arms]] of Col. John Page of [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]]]]
The Page family was one of the [[First Families of Virginia]], which later included [[Mann Page|Mann Page III]], his brother U.S. Congressman and Virginia Governor [[John Page (Virginia)|John Page]], and later descendants such as U.S. Ambassador to Italy [[Thomas Nelson Page]], and [[Virginian Railway]] builder [[William Nelson Page]].

Colonel and Mrs. John Page named their eldest son Francis, and he also built a substantial brick home at Middle Plantation. (Present-day Francis Street in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] is said to be named for him). Another son, Matthew Page, was born in Virginia in 1659 and became a planter. He was one of the original board of trustees of the College of William and Mary, a member of the Governor's Council, and was active in public affairs. He died on January 9, 1703.

Their grandson, Mann Page I (1691–1730) (son of Matthew Page), also became a planter and wealthy landholder in Virginia, owning nearly 70,000 acres (280&amp;nbsp;km²) in [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]], [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]], and [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]] among other locations. In 1725, Mann Page I began the construction of [[Rosewell Plantation]], the Page mansion on the banks of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester County]]. Mann Page I's wife Judith Carter was the daughter of [[Robert Carter I]]. Mann Page I son John Page married Jane Byrd, a granddaughter of Colonel [[William Byrd I]]. One of John Page's great-grandsons was [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Richard Lucian Page]].

Mary Page, the daughter of Col. John Page, married Walter Chiles Jr., son of Col. Walter Chiles of the Virginia Governor's Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chiles-family-structures-timeline.htm A Timeline for Structures at Jamestown Relating to the Chiles Family, Historic Jamestowne, National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt; In his will of March 5, 1687, Col. John Page mentions his grandson John Chiles, as well as his "grandsonne John Tyler, sonne of my grand-daughter Elizabeth Tyler."&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/va/charlescity/bios/c4200000.txt ''Lieut. Col. Walter Chiles'', Lyon G.

[[File:Governor John Page Virginia.jpeg|thumb|left|175px|Virginia Gov. [[John Page (Virginia politician)|John Page]], great-grandson of Col. John Page]]
Because of the propensity of [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) to marry within their narrow social ranks for many generations, John Page is counted as a progenitor of many other FFV families. These include the families of Byrd, Chiles, Dilliard, Tyler, Pendleton, Burwell, Nelson, Randolph, Carter, Harrison, Waller and others.&lt;ref name=Channing/&gt;

[[Tan Sri]] [[Datuk|Dato]]' ''' Loh Boon Siew''' ({{zh|c=駱文秀|p=Luò Wénxiù}}; 1915 – 1995) also known as “Mr Honda”, was a [[Penangite]] [[tycoon]] and the first sole distributor of [[Honda]] [[motorcycle]]s in [[Malaysia]].

==Early life==
Boon Siew was born in [[Hui'an County]], [[Fujian]], [[China]]. He spent his childhood collecting pig dung (used as fuel) to make a living. Aged 12, he arrived in [[Penang]] from China with five friends, among them Loh Poh Heng and Loh Say Bee. He could speak only [[Hokkien]] and had virtually no formal education. He worked as an apprentice car mechanic upon his arrival.

==Business==
At age 18, Boon Siew purchased 11 buses using his $2,000 in savings. He reconditioned the buses and sold them for $12,000. Next, he used the money he earned to buy another 39 buses. In 1942, during World War II, his money was confiscated by the invading Japanese army.  After World War II ended in 1945 and the Japanese were defeated, he started selling bicycles, tires and [[motorcycle accessories]], and soon he expanded his business to [[used car]]s, transports and buses.

In the 1950s, Boon Siew went into property development with his friends Say Bee and Poh Heng by building residential villas in Taman Saw Kit in Penang. His work is continued by his Boon Siew Group.

Boon Siew arranged to meet with Mr. [[Soichiro Honda]], the [[Honda Super Cub]]'s creator, and quickly convinced him to set up a Honda subsidiary in Malaysia.

The first Malaysian Honda showroom was set up on Pitt Street in Penang, very near the home of Boon Siew. The Japanese Honda Motor Co Ltd soon appointed Boon Siew the sole distributor for Honda motorbikes in the country, as the first 50 units of Honda 4-stroke Cub were being imported into Malaysia.

A factory was built in Penang to assemble the Honda Cub and the Honda motorcycle assembled in Malaysia was renamed the ''Boon Siew Honda''. The Honda Cub became the best selling motorcycle in Malaysia and Boon Siew was recognised as the first person to bring the Honda Cub motorcycles into [[Southeast Asia]]. The popular Cantonese word ''[[Cub 仔]]'' (transcribed as "kapchai" in informal Malay), which means "small (Honda) Cub" and is now a generic for small [[underbone]] motorcycles in Malaysia, originates from the Honda Cub.

Boon Siew also played a role in the brief merger between [[Kwong Wah Yit Poh]] and [[The Star (Malaysia)]] in 1974, and helped with the establishment of the [[Lam Wah Ee Hospital]] and the Penang Old Folks Home.

He died at the age of 79 on 16 February 1995. To memorialize his contributions to the automotive industry, a road called ''Jalan Loh Boon Siew'' was named after him in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]].

{{Contract law}}
'''Lost volume seller''' is a [[term of art|legal term]] in the [[Contract law|law of contracts]].  Such a seller is a special case in contract law.  Ordinarily, a seller whose buyer breaches a contract and refuses to purchase the goods can recover from the breaching buyer only the difference between the contract price and the price for which the seller ultimately sells the goods to another buyer (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).

In the case of a lost volume seller, the seller goes on to sell the goods to someone else, usually for the same price.  Under the usual measure of damages, such a seller would have no damages (the contract price less the sale price to the other customer is zero) and the breaching buyer would have no liability.

The objective of the law of contracts with respect to damages is to put the aggrieved party in as good a position as the aggrieved party would have been in if the breaching party had fully performed.  The ordinary measure of damages fails to put the lost volume seller in as good a position as the lost volume seller would have been had the breaching buyer fully performed.  The lost volume seller would have had the profit from two sales if the first buyer had performed instead of the profit from only one sale as a result of the first buyer’s breach.  In such a case, certain law (including Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the United States) permits the aggrieved seller to recover the lost profit that the seller would have made had the buyer not breached (plus, under some circumstances, incidental damages).

Lost volume sellers tend to be those whose capacity to sell or to produce or acquire the subject goods is sufficiently large to meet the demands of all customers who seek to buy those goods.  The term generally arises in the context of a breach of contract action in which the selling party seeks to recover against a breaching buyer who repudiates his or her promise to buy.  For a lost volume seller, the failure to make one sale (i.e., due to the buyer's breach) reduces the seller's [[profit (economics)|profits]] by the amount of profit that would accrue from that sale.

==Example==
For example, suppose a [[T-shirt]] maker has 100 T-shirts. If a customer agrees to buy a shirt from the seller and then breaches that agreement (i.e. refuses to take delivery and pay), the seller will likely be able sell the shirt at the same price to the next customer who walks in. Such a seller has no damages by the usual measure (i.e., there is no difference between the contract price with the breaching buyer and the price paid by the buyer who subsequently bought the T-shirt).

However, if that seller has the ability to sell a shirt to any customer that walks in, then the customer who breaches the agreement to buy has prevented the seller from earning profit that the seller would have earned had the agreement been honored.  The initial buyer’s breach has caused the seller to receive the profit from only one sale (the sale to the second buyer) instead of the profit from two sales (the sale to the second buyer plus the sale for which the breaching buyer contracted).

Accordingly, the T-shirt seller can recover from the breaching buyer the profit that the seller would have made on the sale of the T-shirt for which the breaching buyer contracted.

'''Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman''' (1927 – 25 January 1992) was the founder and editor of the [[Jang Group of Newspapers]]  which currently publishes many [[Urdu]] and English newspapers in [[Pakistan]]. A self-made newspaper magnate, he ranks among the most successful newspaper entrepreneurs in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Aziz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/mkr/2009/article1.html |title=Tribute to Mir Khalil-Ur-Rahman (Special Edition 2009) |website=Jang.com.pk |date=1947-08-14 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/590711/journalist-mir-jamil-dies |title=Journalist Mir Jamil dies - Newspaper |website=Dawn.com |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mir Khalil ur Rahman was born in 1927 to a middle-class family in the town of [[Gujranwala]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], where he received his basic schooling and college education. He received his degree in Accounting from the [[University of the Punjab]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]]. During the Second World War, his parents moved to [[New Delhi]], the capital of India. It was here that he discovered his love for journalism. The world of newspapers attracted him far more than the dull books of accounting. He had a passion for reading and writing and a fondness for newspapers and magazines. He sat glued to his radio set, listening to the latest war news.&lt;ref name="Aziz"/&gt;

In 1940, when he was still a student, he started a newspaper for the [[Islam|Muslims]] during [[World War II]] in [[Delhi]]. He called it the ''Jang'', or ''War''. Some of his critics said, at that time, that he encouraged the war hysteria by selecting a name like that for his newspaper but  Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman made it clear that he was doing it for the soldiers and not to encourage the [[Second world war]].&lt;ref name=researchpedia/&gt;

==Career==
After the independence of [[Pakistan]] on 14 August 1947, Mir Khalil moved to [[Karachi]], first capital of the newly created state of Pakistan, and started publishing the [[Daily Jang]] from there which was funded by a loan of 5000 rupees from Abdul Ghani Barq of [[Ferozsons]] Publishers of Lahore. Pakistan's first Governor General and founder,  [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] was delighted by this move and offered the government's help in running it. Mir, however, declined the offer saying that the freedom of the press was his motto and goal for journalism in Pakistan. Mir also helped in the founding of the [[Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors]]. He opposed, tooth and nail, any government measures or action which curbed the freedom of the press in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=researchpedia/&gt;

The '''New Program Group''' (NPG) refers to a [[joint-venture]] [[consortium]] formed in August 1984 involving the [[Gannett Company|Gannett]], [[Hearst Television|Hearst]], [[Metromedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syndication Venture Awaits word on Sale of Metromedia |author= |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-05-20/business/8501200162_1_metromedia-tv-metromedia-producers-corp-npg|newspaper=Sun Sentinel |date=20 May 1985 |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Storer Communications|Storer]] and [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft]] television station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FRESH FARE PUTS A NEW FACE ON INDEPENDENT STATIONS |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/02/arts/fresh-fare-puts-a-new-face-on-independent-stations.html?pagewanted=2 |newspaper=New York Times |date=2 February 1986 |accessdate=4 April 2013 |first=Richard W. |last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups. The reasoning behind of the formation occurred when broadcasting companies Taft, Gannett, Hearst, and Storer, desiring to beat the rates of network production (by the early 1980s, an average network sitcom cost roughly [[United States|$]]600,000 per episode&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tv Syndicators' Brave New World |author=Gendel, Morgan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-03-04/entertainment/ca-24343_1_tv-syndication/2 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 March 1985 |accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and exercise more creative program control, joined forces with Metromedia Productions to produce and distribute new [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndicated]] TV programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10738">[[Image:OTA seal.png|thumb|right|OTA seal]]
The '''Office of Technology Assessment''' ('''OTA''') was an office of the [[United States Congress]] from 1972 to 1995. OTA's purpose was to provide Congressional members and committees with objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century, i.e. [[technology assessment]]. It was a leader in practicing and encouraging delivery of public services in innovative and inexpensive ways, including early involvement in the distribution of government documents through [[electronic publishing]]. Its model was widely copied around the world.

[[Princeton University]] hosts The OTA Legacy site, which holds "the complete collection of OTA publications along with additional materials that illuminate the history and impact of the agency". On July 23, 2008 the [[Federation of American Scientists]] launched a similar archive that includes interviews and additional documents about OTA.

==History==
Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment with the Technology Assessment Act of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg797.pdf |title=Technology Assessment Act of 1972 ~ Public Law 92-484 |date=October 13, 1972 |series=86 Stat. 797 ~ House Bill 10243 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}} ([http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/ns20/act_f.html HTML version])&lt;/ref&gt; It was governed by a twelve-member board, comprising six members of Congress from each party — half from the Senate and half from the House of Representatives.  During its twenty-four-year life it produced about 750 studies on a wide range of topics, including [[acid rain]], [[health care]], global [[climate change]], and [[polygraphs]].

===Closure===
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal |align=right|image1=OTAShirt-Front.png|image2=OTAShirt-Back.png|footer=The front and back of a tee shirt created and worn by some staff of the OTA to express their sentiments about the intent of the 104th Congress to terminate their service while simultaneously increasing the Library of Congress' budget by an amount equal to nearly twice that of OTA's. Compare to the official seal above, and note the arm of Congress strangling the symbolic U.S.A. in the satirical version.}}

Criticism of the agency was fueled by ''Fat City'', a 1980 book by [[Donald Lambro]] that was regarded favorably by the Reagan administration; it called OTA an "unnecessary agency" that duplicated government work done elsewhere.  OTA was abolished (technically "de-funded") in the "[[Contract with America]]" period of [[Newt Gingrich]]'s Republican ascendancy in Congress.

When the [[104th Congress]] withdrew funding for OTA, it had a full-time staff of 143 people and an annual budget of $21.9 million.  The Office of Technology Assessment closed on September 29, 1995. The move was criticized at the time, including by Republican representative [[Amo Houghton]], who commented at the time of OTA’s defunding that "we are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2010/06/nader-proposes-reviving-congressional-office-of-technology-assessment/ Nader proposes reviving Congressional Office of Technology Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the closure saw it as an example of politics overriding science, and a variety of scientists have called for the agency's reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/09/14/bring-back-the-ota/ |title=Bring back the OTA |accessdate=2013-03-12 |author=PZ Myers |date=September 14, 2007|publisher=[[Scienceblogs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
While the OTA was closed down, the idea of [[technology assessment]] survived, in particular in Europe. The [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network coordinates members of [[technology assessment]] units working for various European governments. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] has meanwhile established a TA unit, taking on former duties of the OTA.

While campaigning in the [[2008 US presidential election]], [[Hillary Clinton]] pledged to work to restore the OTA if elected [[United States President|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Healy |author2=Cornelia Dean |title=Clinton Says She Would Shield Science From Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/us/politics/05clinton.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page= |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=3570 |title=Scientific Integrity and Innovation: Remarks at the Carnegie Institution for Science |accessdate=2007-10-05 |date=October 4, 2007}} Text of Clinton's speech to the [[Carnegie Institution]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 29, 2009, House of Representatives member [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] of New Jersey wrote an op-ed piece articulating the argument for restoring the OTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/fromthefields-holt/ |first=Rush |last=Holt |authorlink=Rush D. Holt, Jr. |title=Lobotomy |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2009-04-29 |date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 The [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] released a report entitled "Reinventing Technology Assessment" that emphasized citizen engagement and called for performing the functions of the OTA by creating a nationwide network of non-partisan policy research organizations, universities, and science museums: the Expert &amp; Citizen Assessment of Science &amp; Technology (ECAST) network. ECAST would conduct both expert and participatory technology assessments for Congress and other clients.  The author of the report was Dr. Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute.  The report states that the drive to modernize OTA was initiated by [[Darlene Cavalier]], a popular citizen science advocate and author of the Science Cheerleader blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/ReinventingTechnologyAssessment1.pdf |title= Reinventing Technology Assessment: A 21st Century Model |accessdate=2010-05-05 | author=Richard Sclove |date=April 2010 |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalier outlined the idea of the citizen network in a guest blog post for [[Discover Magazine]]'s The Intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/29/a-little-respect-involving-citizens-in-technology-assessment/ |title=A Little Respect: Involving Citizens in Technology Assessment |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Discover}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced the concept in an article in Science Progress in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/07/harnessing-citizen-scientists/ |title=Harnessing Citizen Scientists |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=July 7, 2008|publisher=Science Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OptiY''' is a design environment providing modern optimization strategies and state of the art probabilistic algorithms for uncertainty, reliability, robustness, sensitivity analysis, data-mining and meta-modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optiy.de/Features.html ''OptiY Features'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
OptiY is an open and multidisciplinary design environment, which provides direct and generic interfaces to many CAD/CAE-systems and house-intern codes. Furthermore, a complex COM-interface and a user-node with predefined template are available so that user can self-integrate extern programs for ease of use. The insertion of any system to an arbitrary process chain is very easy using the graphical workflow editor. Collaborating different simulation model classes is possible as networks, finite-element-method, multi-body-system, material test bench etc.

===Data mining===

[[Data mining]] is the process of extracting hidden patterns from data. Data mining identifies trends within data that go beyond simple data analysis. Through the use of sophisticated algorithms, non-statistician users have the opportunity to identify key attributes of processes and target opportunities. Data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information. It is commonly used in a wide range of applications such as manufacturing, marketing, fraud detection and scientific discovery etc.

===Sensitivity analysis===

Local Sensitivity as correlation coefficients and partial derivatives can only used, if the correlation between input and output is linear. If the correlation is nonlinear, the global sensitivity analysis has to be used based on the variance-relationship between input- and output-distribution as Sobol index. With [[sensitivity analysis]], the system complexity can be reduced and the cause-and-effect chain can be explained,.&lt;ref&gt;Saltelli, A., Chan, K. and Scott, E.M.: ''Sensitivity Analysis''.  John Willey &amp; Sons Chichester, New York 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oakley J.E., O´Hagan A.: ''Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis of Computer Models: a Bayesian Approach''. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 66:751-769, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilistic simulation===

The variability, uncertainty, tolerance and error of the technical systems play an important part by the product design process. These cause by manufacturing inaccuracy, process uncertainty, environment influences, abrasion and human factors etc. They are characterized by a stochastic distribution. The deterministic simulation cannot predict the real system behaviors due to the input variability and uncertainty, because one model calculation shows only one point in the design space. [[Probabilistic design|Probabilistic simulation]] has to be performed. Thereby, the output distributions will be calculated from input distributions based on the deterministic simulation model by any simulation system. The realistic system behaviors can be derivate from these output distributions,.&lt;ref&gt;Pham T-Q, Neubert H. and Kamusella A.: ''Design for Reliability and Robustness through Probabilistic Methods in COMSOL Multiphysics with OptiY''. Proceedings of the 2nd European COMSOL Conference. 4–6 November 2008 in Hannover: [http://www.optiy.eu/download/RobustDesignComsolOptiY2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacks J., Welch W.J., Mitchell T.J., Wynn H.P.: ''Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments''. Statistical Science 4, pp. 409-435, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reliability analysis===

The variability of parameters causes often a failure of the system. Reliability analysis ([[Failure mode and effects analysis]]) investigates the boundary violation of output due to input variability. The failure mechanisms of components are known in the specification for the product development. They are identified by measurement, field data collection, material data, customer-specifications etc. In the simulation, the satisfaction of all product specifications is defined as constraints of the simulation results. The system reliability is given, if all constraints scatter insight the defined boundaries. Although a nominal parameter simulation shows that all values of the constraints are located in reliable boundaries, the system reliability however cannot be warranted due to input variability. A part of the constraints variability, which violates the defined boundaries, is called the failure probability of the solution. Reliability analysis computes the failure probability of the single components and also of the total system at a given time point.&lt;ref&gt;Au, S.K., Beck, J.L.: ''Subset Simulation and its Application to Seismic Risk Based on Dynamic Analysis''. Journal of Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 129, No. 8, August 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meta-modeling===

Meta-modeling or [[Surrogate model]] is a process to win the mathematical relationship between design parameters and product characteristics. For each point in the parameter space, there is a corresponding point of the design space. Many model calculations should be performed to show the relationship between input and output systematically (Full Factorial Design). For a high computing effort of the product model, it is practically infeasible. Adaptive response surface methodology can be used to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Pham T-Q, Kamusella A. and Neubert H.: ''Auto-Extraction of Modelica Code from Finite Element Analysis or Measurement Data''. Proceedings of the 8th International Modelica Conference. 20-22 March 2011 in Dresden: [http://www.optiy.eu/download/Pham_Modelica2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Santner, T.J., Williams, B.J., Notz, W.I.: ''The Design and Analysis of Computer Experiment''. Springer-Verlag New York 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatigue life prediction===

Predicting [[fatigue (material)]] has been one of the most important problems in design engineering for reliability and quality. They have several practical uses: rapid design optimization during development phase of a product and predicting field use limits as well as failure analysis of product returned from the field or failed in qualification test. Fatigue analysis focus on the thermal and mechanical failure mechanism. Most fatigue failure can be attributed to thermo-mechanical stresses caused by differences in the coefficient of thermal and mechanical expansion. The fatigue failures will occur when the component experiences cyclic stresses and strains that produce permanent damage. 

===Multi-objective optimization===

In development process of technical products, there are frequently design problems with many evaluation goals or criteria as low cost, high quality, low noise etc. Design parameters have to be found to minimize all criteria. In contrast to a single optimization, there is another order structure between parameter and criteria spaces at a [[Multiobjective optimization|multi-objective Optimization]]. Criteria conflict each other. Trying to minimize a criterion, other criteria may be maximized. There is not only one solution, but also a [[Pareto optimal]] solution frontier. Multi-objective optimization finds all Pareto solutions automatically with a single run. The multiple decision making support tool is also available to select one best suitable solution from them.&lt;ref&gt;Zitzler E., Thiele L.: ''Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms: A Comparative Case Study and the Strength Pareto Approach''. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computations. pp. 257-271. November 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robust design optimization===

Variability, uncertainty and tolerance have to be considered for design process of technical systems to assure the highly required quality and reliability. They are uncontrollable, unpredictable and cause the uncertainty satisfaction of the required product specifications. The design goal is assuring of the specified product functionalities in spite of unavoidable variability and uncertainty. The approach solving this problem is robust design of the product parameters in the early design process ([[Robust Parameter Design (RPD)]]). Thereby, optimal product parameters should be found. Within, the system behavior is robust and insensitive in spite of unavoidable variability. E.g. the consistent variability and uncertainty leads only to the smallest variability of the product characteristics. So, the required product specifications will be always satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Sung H. Park: ''Robust design and analysis for quality engineering''. Chapman &amp; Hall 1996. {{ISBN|0-412-55620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11906">{{Politics of France}}
In [[Politics of France|French politics]], an '''''ordonnance''''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔʁdɔnɑ̃s|lang|Fr-ordonnance.ogg}}, "order") is a [[statutory instrument]] issued by the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] in an area of law normally reserved for [[primary legislation]] enacted by the [[French Parliament]].  They function as temporary statutes pending ratification by the Parliament; failing ratification they function as mere executive regulations.

''Ordonnances'' should not be confused with ''[[décret]]s'' issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] (an [[Order in Council#France|order-in-council]]) or [[president of France|president]], or with [[ministerial order]]s (''arrêtés''); these are issued either in matters where the [[Constitution of France|Constitution]] allows primary legislation from the Council or as secondary legislation implementing a statute.
[[File:Pyramide des normes.png|thumb|[[:fr:Hiérarchie des normes en droit français|Hierarchy of French legal norms]]]]
In the [[Judiciary of France|French justice system]], the word can also refer to a summary ruling made by a single judge for simple cases.

==Current usage==
===Motivations===
Article 34 of the [[Constitution of France]] restricts certain legal matters to [[statute law|primary legislation]] to be enacted by [[Parliament of France|Parliament]]. All other areas of law fall within the domain of delegated legislation in the form of orders-in-council (OIC) issued by the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] or ministerial orders issued by individual cabinet ministers.

Orders-in-council and other [[secondary legislation|delegated legislation]] issued in areas reserved for primary legislation are illegal, unless they are specifically authorized by statute. Such orders define implementation measures and details left out by the originating statute.

For various reasons explained below, the Executive may sometimes want to pass [[primary legislation]] in a field reserved by statute. The ''ordonnances'' are the constitutional means to do so.

Delegated legislation can be repealed through litigation before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] (acting in their role of legislative review) if they violate general legal principles or constitutional rights, whereas primary legislation may be ruled unconstitutional only through judicial review before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]. Statutes are thus relatively more solid.

===Vocabulary notes===
The decisions made by the [[President of France|French President]] under art. 16 of the French Constitution, enabling him to take emergency measures in times where the existence of the Republic is at stake (a form of [[reserve powers]]) are not called ''ordonnances'', but simply ''décisions''.

The introductory sentence of an ''ordonnance'', as published in the [[Journal Officiel de la République Française]], is: "The President of the Republic [...], after hearing the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], after hearing the Council of Ministers, orders:". The word ''ordonnance'' comes from the same root as ''ordonner'' "to order".

===Procedure===
====Normal procedure====
In the [[French Fifth Republic]], most ''ordonnances'' operate pursuant to article 38 of the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]].

The Council of Ministers first introduces a bill before Parliament authorizing it to issue ''ordonnances'' to implement its program. The bill specifies a limited period of time, as well as a topic for the proposed ''ordonnances''. If the bill passes in Parliament, the French Cabinet can issue ''ordonnances'' on the given legal matter within the specified time period. The Executive must consult the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on every ''ordonnance''; the advice of the Council is compulsory but nonbinding.

An ''ordonnance'' must be signed by the French President, the Prime Minister and relevant ministers. This proved in 1986 to be a source of tension, during a period of [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] when President [[François Mitterrand]] and Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] were of opposite political opinions, and the President refused to sign ''ordonnances'' requested by the Prime Minister, forcing him to go through the normal parliamentary procedure;&lt;ref&gt;Jean V. Poulard, “The French Double Executive and the Experience of Cohabitation”, ''Political Science Quarterly'', vol. 105, no. 2 (Summer 1990): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2151025 243-267]&lt;/ref&gt; it was however controversial at the time whether he had the right to refuse to sign them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Parodilien, “[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rfsp_0035-2950_1997_num_47_3_395180 Proportionnalisation périodique, cohabitation, atomisation partisane : un triple défi pour le régime semi-présidentiel de la Cinquième République]”, ''Revue française de science politique'', vol 47, no. 3-4 (1997): 292-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Moureaud, “[http://www.repas-senat.fr/docs/2/article3.pdf Le refus de signature des ordonnances en 1986 : un enjeu structurant en période de cohabitation]”, ''Revue d'étude politique des assistants parlementaires'', no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the time period has elapsed, the Cabinet must introduce before Parliament a bill of [[ratification]] for the ''ordonnances'', otherwise these lapse at the end of the period. Until Parliament has voted the ratification bill, the ''ordonnances'', similar to executive orders, can be challenged before the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]].

If they are ratified, they become like ordinary statutes. There is, however, no obligation that they should be ratified, in which case they are mere regulations; in fact, between 1960 and 1990, out of 158 ''ordonnances'', only about 30 were ratified.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen because even though the ratification bill has been brought before Parliament, it is not necessarily scheduled for examination and vote. If Parliament votes down the ratification bill, it does not go into effect.

The Constitutional Council and the Council of State have admitted that ratification, in addition to explicit means (vote on the ratification bill, or ratification amendment added to another bill), could also be performed ''implicitly'', when Parliament refers to an ''ordonnance'' as though it were a statute.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance2.html#toc94 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section III C&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castaing"&gt;Cécile Castaing, “La ratification implicite des ordonnances de codification. Haro sur « La grande illusion »”, ''Revue française de droit constitutionnel'', no. 58 (2004/2): 275-304, [[P.U.F.]], {{ISBN|978-2-13-054645-0}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.058.0275}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implicit ratification was prohibited by [[French constitutional law of 23 July 2008|a 2008 constitutional amendment]].

It has occasionally happened that the Executive did not make use of the authorization that they had requested and obtained.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc19 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', section I A 3&lt;/ref&gt;

====Budget bills====
It is of particular importance that budget bills should be voted in a timely manner, since they authorize taxes and spending. For this reason, the Government can adopt the budget by ''ordonnances'' if Parliament has not been able to agree on it within 70 days after the proposal of the budget (Constitution, article 47). The same applies for social security budget bills, but with a 50-day period (Constitution, article 47-1).

Neither of these procedures has ever been used.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.senat.fr/ej/ej_ordonnance/ej_ordonnance0.html#toc3 Les ordonnances - bilan au 31 décembre 2007]'', introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overseas territories====
Article 74-1 of the Constitution allows the Government to extend legislation applicable to [[Metropolitan France]] to overseas territories by ''ordonnances''. These ''ordonnances'' lapse if they have not been ratified within 18 months by Parliament.

===Usage and controversy===

The use of ''ordonnances'' is not controversial when used for technical, uncontroversial texts (such as the ordinances that converted all sums in [[French Franc]]s to [[Euro]]s in the various laws in force in France).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=JUSX0000009L Law 2000-517] authorized the government to adopt ordinances to convert sums from Francs to Euros in various legislative texts.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ordonnances'' are also used to adopt and adapt [[European Directives]] into French law in order to avoid delayed adoption of a Directive, which often happens and is criticized by the [[EU Commission]] and exposes France to fines.

''Ordonnances'' are also used to codify law into codes, in order to rearrange them for the sake of clarity without substantially modifying them. Such usage has however been criticized for the legal risks that it poses if the ratification act is never voted.&lt;ref name="Castaing"/&gt;

The use of ''ordonnances'' for controversial laws is generally criticized by the opposition as anti-democratic, and demeaning to Parliament (Guillaume, 2005), in much the same way as the use of [[Article 49 of the French Constitution#Commitment of responsibility on a bill (49.3)|article 49-3]] to force a bill to be voted.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Rullier, ''Le Parlement sous la onzième législature 1997-2002'', Revue française de droit constitutionnel, n° 54 2003/2, pp. 429 - 447, {{ISBN|978-2-13-053967-4}}, {{DOI|10.3917/rfdc.054.0429}}: the former chief of staff of the Minister for relations with Parliament during the [[Lionel Jospin|Jospin]] administration criticizes the use of ''ordonnances'' and article 49-3 in 1995 by [[Alain Juppé]], particularly to force a reform of Social Security without the intervention of Parliament, resulting in [[1995 strikes in France|mass strikes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous usage==
''Ordonnances'' have been extensively used as a form of [[rule by decree]] in periods where the government operated without a working Parliament: [[Vichy France]], where the executive had dismissed Parliament and other [[democracy|democratic]] structures, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], until it could establish a legislature, and in the last days of the [[French Fourth Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19580604&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=05327&amp;pageFin= Loi n°58-520 du 3 juin 1958 relative aux pleins pouvoirs]&lt;/ref&gt; and the early days of the [[French Fifth Republic]], until the new constitution had come into force and legislative elections had been held (article 92 of the Constitution, now repealed).

Certain legal texts enacted by the King in the medieval and ''[[Ancien Régime in France|ancien régime]]'' eras were called ''ordonnances'', the best known of which today is the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]].

'''Quality infrastructure''' relates to all fields of [[metrology]], [[standardization]] and [[Test method|testing]], of [[quality management]] and [[conformity assessment]], including [[certification]] and [[accreditation]]. In the past, the abbreviation MSTQ (Metrology, Standardization, Testing and [[Quality Assurance]]) was used for this combination of single elements.

Quality infrastructure must ensure:

- elaboration and implementation of technical regulations for products and passage from compulsory standards to voluntary ones;&lt;br /&gt;
- application of good practice code regarding standardization;&lt;br /&gt;
- elimination of all measures that pose [[trade barrier]]s - not only [[customs]] taxes and quantitative restrictions, but all the measures with equivalent (protectionist) effects.

Quality infrastructure: Definition adopted in June 2017 by the DCMAS Network (BIPM, IAF, IEC, ILAC, ISO, ITC, ITU, OIML, UNECE and UNIDO) + the World Bank.

“The system comprising the organizations (public and private)together with the policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework, and practices needed to support and enhance the quality, safety and environmental soundness of goods, services and processes. 

The quality infrastructure is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition  is important to enable access to foreign  markets. It is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development, as well as environmental and social wellbeing. 

It relies on: 
• metrology
• standardization
• accreditation
• conformity assessment, and 
• market surveillance”

'''SCI-Arc''' in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], is an independent, non-profit school offering undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees in architecture. Founded in 1972, SCI-Arc was initially regarded as - both institutionally and artistically - more [[avant-garde]] than traditional architecture schools based in the United States.&lt;ref name=IconMagazine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconeye.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2762:the-new-la-school--icon-52--october-2007 |title=Justin McGuirk, "The New LA School", October 2007 |publisher=[[IconMagazine]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203091006/http://iconeye.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2762:the-new-la-school--icon-52--october-2007 |archivedate=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school consists of approximately 500 students and 80 faculty members, some of whom are practicing architects. It is based in the quarter-mile long ({{convert|0.25|mi|km|disp=out}}) former [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] in the [[Arts District, Los Angeles|Arts District]] in downtown Los Angeles, and offers a variety of community events such as outreach programs, free exhibitions, and public lectures.

== Degrees ==
SCI-Arc offers undergraduate, B.Arch, and graduate degree programs, M.Arch 1 and M.Arch 2 accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). SCI-Arc is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).

SCI-Arc EDGE, the Center for Advanced Studies in Architecture offers four postgraduate degree programs: M.S. Architectural Technologies, M.A. Fiction and Entertainment, M.S. Design of Cities, and M.S. Theory and Pedagogy.

In addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, SCI-Arc offers two summer programs: a four-week program for high school students, Design Immersion Days; and a four-week intensive, introductory program that explores design through experimental architecture, Making+Meaning.

== History ==

SCI-Arc was founded in 1972 in [[Santa Monica]] by a group of faculty and students from [[Cal Poly Pomona College of Environmental Design|Department of Architecture]] at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]], who wanted to approach the subject from a more experimental perspective than traditional schools offered.{{r|vincent20110422}} Originally called the New School, SCI-Arc was based on the concept of a "college without walls" and it remains one of the few independent architecture schools in the world. Initially, instead of academic hierarchies the School favored a horizontal relationship between professors and students, who took responsibility for their own course of study. [[Ray Kappe]], who had founded the Pomona department, became the new school's first director, served in that position until 1987, and was awarded the AIA/ACSA Topaz Medal for excellence in architecture education in 1990.&lt;ref name="25 Years of SCI-Arc 1990-1997"&gt;''Volume5''. [http://www.volume5.com/html/25_years_of_sci-arc_3.html ''25 Years of SCI-Arc 1990–1997''] 19 Sep 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kappe was succeeded as director by Michael Rotondi, one of SCI-Arc's founding students. [[Neil Denari]]  became director in 1997; [[Eric Owen Moss]]  served as director from 2002–2015;&lt;ref&gt;Barrie-Anthony, Steven.

Retrieved 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernan Diaz Alonso was appointed Director and Chief Executive Officer effective Sept 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=director&gt;{{Cite news|title = SCI-Arc's newly announced director sees growth and a global presence|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-hernan-diaz-alonso-next-director-sciarc-20140919-story.html|newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Jessica |last=Gelt|date=November 19, 2014|access-date = 2015-09-28|issn = 0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diaz Alonso has been a faculty member at SCI-Arc since 2001. He is known for championing the school's push toward a digital future and, prior to his appointment as Director, has served as the school's Graduate Programs Chair since 2010.&lt;ref name=director/&gt; Although SCI-Arc was once unaccredited and its finances unstable—Moss joked, "We used to be considered one step ahead of the [[IRS]], one step ahead of creditors"—the school is now fully accredited, and its finances improved to the point that SCI-Arc was able to pay $23.1 million to buy its campus building in 2011.&lt;ref name="vincent20110422"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/apr/22/business/la-fi-downtown-deal-20110422 | title=L.A. architecture school SCI-Arc buys its unorthodox home | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011 | accessdate=April 23, 2011 | author=Vincent, Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The main thing is to figure out a way for SCI-Arc to keep growing without losing its character and pedigree," Diaz Alonso said in an interview following his appointment as Director.&lt;ref name=director/&gt;

[[File:SciArc SantaFe.jpg|thumb|left|North End of SCI-Arc from Santa Fe Ave]]
The open nature of SCI-Arc's program is reflected in the series of industrial buildings that have housed the school, where students are encouraged to design and construct their own studio environments, and occasionally full-scale projects. The school has been based in three locations – the first (1972-1992) a small industrial building in Santa Monica and later moved into the second, a much larger (architecturally unique concrete post &amp; beam) industrial building (1992-2000) in Marina del Rey. In 2001, it moved to its current home, the 60,000-square-foot 1907 [[Santa Fe Freight Depot]] designed by [[Harrison Albright]] on the eastern edge of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. When SCI-Arc arrived, the building was a stripped-down concrete shell. Today the building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and the school has become an anchor for the city's [[Arts District]]. The school conducts design projects that engage with under-served members of the community. To these ends, SCI-Arc has been awarded a $400,000 grant by ArtPlace to develop two on-campus public performance/lecture spaces, as well as development for a third public venue in the surrounding arts district.&lt;ref name="SCI-Arc Arts District Anchor Project"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielson|first=Christopher|title=ArtPlace Announces 47 New Grants|url=http://www.artplaceamerica.org/articles/artplace-announces-47-new-grants/|work=artplaceamerica.org|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615134759/http://www.artplaceamerica.org/articles/artplace-announces-47-new-grants/|archivedate=15 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the street, "One Santa Fe," a 438-unit apartment complex designed by [[Michael Maltzan Architecture]] (MMA) opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawthorne|first1=Christopher|title=Maltzan's One Santa Fe apartment complex plays with notion of density|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-one-santa-fe-review-20141012-column.html|agency=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School culture ==
[[File:SciArc Presentations during finals.jpg|thumb|right|Normal scene during SCI-Arc's finals weeks]]

SCI-Arc attracts students from nearby and throughout the world in pursuit of the educational programs that the school offers. Most students have already completed some college level work; some already hold professional architectural degrees. SCI-Arc is serious about educating and challenging its students—but does it so in an unconventional atmosphere. It is not uncommon to see a student using his or her skateboard to get from one end of the building to the other, or to be working on a model with his or her dog napping nearby.  Students actively engage in preparing the SCI-Arc Gallery exhibitions, help fellow graduating students in setting up their models for thesis presentations, and contribute to workshops that result in projects throughout the school, such as the graduation pavilion and other unique structures.  Students have access to their SCI-Arc studio spaces 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learn About SCI-Arc and What It Takes to Get In|url = http://collegeapps.about.com/od/collegeprofiles/p/southern-california-institute-of-architecture.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic programs ==
SCI-Arc offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] (NAAB) and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] (WASC), including a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program, a 3-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 1) open to applicants who hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent in any field of study, and a 2-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 2) open to applicants with a prior undergraduate degree in architecture.

In the fall and spring terms, design studios, seminars and workshops led by SCI-Arc faculty and visiting instructors offer students a multitude of choices and perspectives. During the summer term, some courses are also open to upper-level students from other architecture programs and to the public. Summer at SCI-Arc features two intro to architecture programs open to the public: Design Immersion Days, a four-week intense design and architecture workshop for high school students, and MAKING+MEANING, a four-week foundation program in architecture that introduces the principles of architecture in a hands-on exploration of spatial experimentation, design methodologies and the creative process.

In addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs,  SCI-Arc offers four one-year postgraduate programs in fields including architectural technologies, entertainment and fiction, design of cities, and theory and pedagogy.

SCI-Arc's undergraduate and graduate programs culminate in two public events in which students present their thesis projects to renowned critics from around the world, including [[Peter Cook]], [[Greg Lynn]], and [[Pritzker Prize]] recipient [[Thom Mayne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielson|first=Christopher|title=2011 Thesis &amp; Graduation Weekend|url=http://sciarc.edu/lectures.php?id=1956|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119110123/http://www.sciarc.edu/lectures.php?id=1956|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "SCI-Arc has long been one of this country’s best experimental labs in which designers speculate about the future of the human-made environment, and its thesis projects are its calling cards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SCI-Arc Keeps Us Wondering|url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/practice/professional-development/sci-arc-keeps-us-wondering_o|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General rankings place SCI-Arc at #12 in undergraduate and #27 in graduate programs overall.

== Making + Meaning ==
[[File:StudentLife wikipedia.JPG|thumb|left|Student working on his M+M project (summer 2009)]]

Making + Meaning is a four-week summer program at the Southern California Institute of Architecture that introduces the principles of architecture in a hands-on exploration of spatial experimentation, design methodologies and the creative processes.

During this intensive program, students survey and challenge the discipline's boundaries by drawing, making and constructing. Methodologies range from material experimentation to compositional strategies; from imagination to inhabitation.

Making + Meaning students meet leading thinkers in architecture, engage in open dialogue, delve into the city of Los Angeles' wealth of experimental architecture and produce a portfolio of work crystallizing their explorations in the program.

The program derives its strength from the diverse backgrounds of its students. From those gauging their interest and curiosity in architecture, to those beginning an architectural degree, Making + Meaning is a platform for individual learning in a collective environment; an introduction to the discipline of architecture and a welcome to SCI-Arc's culture and community.

== Public programs ==
SCI-Arc's public programs invite the community into the school to foster debate and understanding of architecture's capacity to transform the world. A recent program and exhibition, "LA in Wien/Wien in LA," investigated the architecture of Los Angeles and Vienna and their respective influences on one another in over the last century. It brought together six esteemed international architects—[[Hitoshi Abe]], [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]], Eric Owen Moss, [[Thom Mayne]], [[Peter Noever]], and [[Wolf Prix]] of [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]—to share their perspectives and experiences in a discussion led by [[Anthony Vidler]]. The full scope of SCI-Arc public programs includes lectures, exhibitions, faculty talks and other opportunities for interaction between the school and the community.

== Lecture series ==
Each semester's lecture series produces an eclectic selection of speakers from multiple disciplines, including architects,  artists, film-makers, engineers, theoreticians, and performers. Speakers are selected by a forum of students, faculty, alumni, and administrators and the lectures are free and open to the public. Lectures are followed by a dinner in honor of the speaker, allowing students and faculty to interact more personally with the invited speaker. SCI-Arc lectures are broadcast for live viewing on the internet.

== SCI-Arc Robot House ==
SCI-Arc's Robot House, initiated by faculty members Peter Testa and Devyn Weiser, builds upon the school's strengths to create a next generation platform for experimentation and speculation on the future of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SCI-Arc students take 3D printing to the robots|url = http://www.gizmag.com/sci-arc-robot-house-3d-printing/29452/|website = www.gizmag.com|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated conceptually and physically between studio and shop, academy and industry, the lab focuses on multi-robot cooperation and collaboration using six state-of-the-art Staübli robotic systems. The Robot House offers a new design interface extending beyond a production facility. It creates unprecedented emulation, simulation and animation environments in which computational geometry, material agency and fabrication logistics merge. The introduction of video, vision and sensing technologies with the lab's robotic systems support feedback and exchanges between matter, data and form.

Projects explore additive free-form fabrication tied to advanced composite materials. The robots themselves, relatively small in size and dexterity, support a reconfigurable 3D workspace with a wide range of applications including on-site construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">'''The Copyright Association''' was an English organisation founded in 1872 for "authors, publishers and other persons interested in [[copyright]] property", which together with the [[Society of Authors]] lobbied Parliament on copyright issues in the decades before the [[Copyright Act 1911|1911 Copyright Act]].

In the early 1870s, English publishers were especially concerned to protect the rights of their authors in [[Canada]], since the Canadian Government was pressing for the right to reprint British works in Canada subject to an excise duty.&lt;ref name=Seville&gt;Catherine Seville, ''The internationalisation of copyright law: books, buccaneers and the black flag in the nineteenth century'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.97-102&lt;/ref&gt; The association's initial committee included both authors (including [[Robert Browning]], [[Arthur Helps]], [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], [[Charles Reade]] and [[Charles Edward Trevelyan]]) and publishers (including [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] (1808-1892), [[Longman|Thomas Longman]] (1804-1879), [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], [[George Bentley (publisher)|George Bentley]] (1818-1895) and [[George Routledge]]).&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Association, ''[[The Times]]'', 20 March 1872, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Design of Everyday Things''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref name="Durham"&gt;{{cite news

|title=Science of the appliance
|newspaper= [[Times Higher Education]] |location= London

|date=November 6, 1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt; book by cognitive scientist and usability engineer [[Donald Norman]] about how design serves as the communication between object and user, and how to optimize that conduit of communication in order to make the experience of using the object pleasurable. One of the main premises of the book is that although people are often keen to blame themselves when objects appear to malfunction, it is not the fault of the user but rather the lack of intuitive guidance that should be present in the design.

The book was published in 1988 with the title '''''The Psychology of Everyday Things'''''. Norman said his academic peers liked that title, but believed the new title better conveyed the content of the book and better attracted interested readers.&lt;ref name="Preface2002"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=978-0-465-06710-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}} It is often referred to by the initialisms '''''POET''''' and '''''DOET'''''.

Norman uses case studies to describe the psychology behind what he deems good and bad design, and proposes design principles. The book spans several disciplines including [[behavioral psychology]], [[ergonomics]], and design practice.

A major update of the book, '''''The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition''''', was published in 2013.

==Contents==

In the book, Norman introduced the term ''[[affordance]]'' as it applied to design,&lt;ref name="AboutFace3"&gt;{{cite book

Gibson]]'s concept of the same name.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt; {{anchor|doors}}Examples of affordances are flat plates on doors meant to be pushed, small finger-size push-buttons, and long and rounded bars we intuitively use as handles. As Norman used the term, the plate or button ''affords'' pushing, while the bar or handle affords pulling.&lt;ref name="AboutFace3"/&gt;{{rp|282–3}}&lt;ref name="DOET"/&gt;{{rp|9}} Norman discussed [[door handle]]s at length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10,87–92}}

He also popularized the term ''[[user-centered design]]'', which he had previously referred to in ''User Centered System Design'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis
|last=Friess
|first=Erin
|title=The User-Centered Design Process: Novice Designers' Use of Evidence in Designing from Data

|laysummary=http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/graduate/phd_rhet/previous-dissertatons/diss_abstracts/Erin%20Friess.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the term to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he deemed secondary issues like [[aesthetics]]. User-centered design involves ''simplifying the structure of tasks'', ''making things visible'', ''getting the mapping right'', ''exploiting the powers of constraint'', ''designing for error'', ''explaining affordances'' and [[seven stages of action]]. He goes to great lengths to define and explain these terms in detail, giving examples following and going against the advice given and pointing out the consequences.

Other topics of the book include:

* The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
* The Psychology of Everyday Actions
* Knowledge in the Head and in the World
* Knowing What to Do
* To Err Is Human
* [[Human-centered design]]
* The Design Challenge

After a group of industrial designers felt affronted after reading an early draft, Norman rewrote the book to make it more sympathetic to the profession.&lt;ref name="Durham"/&gt;

'''Trinity Church''' is a historic [[parish]] church in the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]] located near the intersection of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in the lower Manhattan section of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Known for both its location and endowment,&lt;ref name="NYT42413"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trinity Church Split on How to Manage $2 Billion Legacy of a Queen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/nyregion/trinity-church-in-manhattan-is-split-on-how-to-spend-its-wealth.html|accessdate=April 25, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 24, 2013|author=Otterman, Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity is a traditional [[high church]], with an active parish centered around the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] in missionary, outreach, and fellowship.

== History and architecture ==
The Trinity Church has been significant to New York City's history for over 300 years.  In 1696, [[Benjamin Fletcher|Governor Benjamin Fletcher]] approved the purchase of land in Lower Manhattan by the [[Church of England]] community for construction of a new church. The parish received its charter from [[William III of England|King William III]] on May 6, 1697. Its land grant specified an annual rent of 60 bushels of wheat.&lt;ref name="NYTHIST"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1859/11/18/78901567.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=TRINITY CHURCH PROPERTY.; Outline of the Legal History of the Trinity "Church Farm." | date=November 18, 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first rector was [[William Vesey]] (for whom nearby [[Vesey Street]] is named), a protege of [[Increase Mather]], who served for 49 years until his death in 1746.

===First Trinity Church===

The first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure with a [[gambrel roof]] and small porch, was constructed in 1698, on [[Wall Street]], facing the [[Hudson River]]. The land on which it was built was formerly a formal garden and then a burial ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ekamper.net/gr-misc.htm |title= Digital redraft of the Castello Plan of New Amsterdam in New Netherland in 1660 [Beta] |access-date= 2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://patricia.rootsweb.ancestry.com/nytristate/castello.htm |title= INDEX TO PLOTS ON THE CASTELLO PLAN MAP |website= Ancestry.com |access-date= 2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/new_york_1695.jpg |title= New York City 1695 | website= University of Texas Libraries |access-date= 2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built because in 1696, members of the [[Church of England]] (Anglicans) protested to obtain a "charter granting the church legal status" in New York City. According to historical records, [[William Kidd|Captain William Kidd]] lent the runner and tackle from his ship for hoisting the stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/about/history/ |title= Historical Timeline |website=TrinityChurch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trinity kidd blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/news/blogs/the-archivists-mailbag/question-of-the-day-trinitys-very-own-pirate | title=Question of the Day: Trinity's Very Own Pirate? | publisher=Trinity Church | work=The Archivist's Mailbag | date=November 19, 2008 | accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], increased the parish's land holdings to {{convert|215|acre|m2}} in 1705. Later, in 1709, [[William Huddleston]] founded [[Trinity School (New York)|Trinity School]] as the [[Charity School]] of the church, and classes were originally held in the steeple of the church. In 1754, King's College (now [[Columbia University]]) was chartered by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II of Great Britain]], and instruction began with eight students in a school building near the church.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]] the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America, following the departure of General [[George Washington]] and the [[Continental Army]] shortly after [[Battle of Long Island]] and subsequent local defeats.  Under British occupation clergy were required to be [[Loyalist]]s, while the parishioners included some members of the revolutionary [[New York Provincial Congress]], as well as the [[First Continental Congress|First]] and [[Second Continental Congress]]es.

The church was destroyed in the [[Great New York City Fire of 1776]], which started in the Fighting Cocks Tavern, destroying nearly 400 to 500 buildings and houses, and leaving thousands of New Yorkers homeless. Six days later, most of the city's volunteer firemen followed General Washington north.  Rev. [[Charles Inglis (bishop)|Charles Inglis]] served throughout the war and then to Nova Scotia on evacuation with the whole congregation of Trinity Church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/loyalismnewyork00flicrich#page/36/mode/1up/search/nova+scotia  Loyalism in New York during the American revolution, p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samuel Provoost|Rev. Samuel Provoost]] was appointed Rector of Trinity (1784–1800) in 1784, and the New York State Legislature ratified the charter of Trinity Church, deleting the provision that asserted its loyalty to the King of England. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whig]] patriots were appointed as vestrymen. In 1787, Provoost was consecrated as the first Bishop of the newly formed Diocese of New York. Following his 1789 inauguration at Federal Hall, George Washington attended [[Thanksgiving]] service, presided over by Bishop Provoost, at [[St. Paul's Chapel]], a chapel of the Parish of Trinity Church. He continued to attend services there until the second Trinity Church was finished in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel is currently part of the Parish of Trinity Church and is the oldest public building in continuous use in New York City.

===Second Trinity Church===
Construction on the second Trinity Church building began in 1788; it was consecrated in 1790. St. Paul's Chapel was used while the second Trinity Church was being built.

The second Trinity Church was built facing Wall Street; it was 200 feet tall, and longer and wider than its predecessor. Building a bigger church was beneficial because the population of New York City was expanding.  The church was torn down after being weakened by severe snows during the winter of 1838&amp;ndash;39.

The second Trinity Church was politically significant because President Washington and members of his government often worshiped there. Additional notable parishioners included [[John Jay]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Third Trinity Church===

The third and current Trinity Church began construction in 1839 and was finished in 1846.&lt;ref name=nycland /&gt; When the Episcopal Bishop of New York consecrated Trinity Church on [[Ascension Day]] (May 1) 1846, its soaring [[Gothic Revival]] spire, surmounted by a gilded cross, dominated the skyline of lower Manhattan. Trinity was a welcoming beacon for ships sailing into [[New York Harbor]].

In 1843, Trinity Church's expanding parish was divided due to the burgeoning cityscape and to better serve the needs of its parishioners. The newly formed parish would build [[Grace Church, New York|Grace Church]], to the north on Broadway at 10th street, while the original parish would re-build Trinity Church, the structure that stands today. Both Grace and Trinity Churches were completed and consecrated in 1846.

Trinity Church held the title of [[tallest building in the United States]] until 1869, when it was surpassed by [[St. Michael's Church, Old Town, Chicago]]. At the time of its completion, Trinity's {{convert|281|ft|m|adj=on}} spire and cross comprised the highest point in New York, until it was surpassed in 1883 by the stone tower of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and in 1890 by the [[New York World Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trinitywallstreet.org/|title=Trinity Church|website=trinitywallstreet.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876–1877 a [[reredos]] and altar were erected in memory of [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.]], to the designs of architect [[Frederick Clarke Withers]].

Architectural historians consider the third and present Trinity Church building, built in 1846 and designed by architect [[Richard Upjohn]], the first and finest example of Gothic Revival architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.trinitywallstreet.org/ |title=Trinity Church |website=Trinity Church|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the [[United States Department of the Interior]] designated Trinity Church a [[National Historic Landmark]] because of its architectural significance and its place within the history of New York City.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=76001252}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination |date=August 1976 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{cite web |url={{NHLS url|id=76001252|photos=y}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination (photos) |date=August 1976 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinity today===
On July 9, 1976, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited Trinity Church. Vestrymen presented the Queen with a symbolic "back rent" of 279 [[peppercorns]].

Since 1993, Trinity Church has hosted the graduation ceremonies of the [[High School of Economics and Finance]]. The school is located on [[Trinity Place]], a few blocks away from the church. Guided tours of the church are offered daily at 2 p.m.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====September 11, 2001====
During the [[September 11 attacks]], people took refuge inside the church from the massive debris cloud produced by the first World Trade Center tower collapse. Some of the chapel pew's paint was rubbed off from the people taking refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trinitywallstreet.org/blogs/moment/pilgrimage-ground-zero-and-beyond |title=Pilgrimage to Ground Zero, and Beyond |date=2011-09-09|work=Trinity Church |access-date=2018-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pews were later replaced, but one still exists at the back of the chapel for remembrance of the events on 9/11. Falling wreckage knocked over a giant [[sycamore]] tree that had stood for nearly a century in the churchyard of [[St. Paul's Chapel]], part of Trinity Church's parish, located several blocks north of Trinity Church. Sculptor [[Steve Tobin]] used its roots as the base for a bronze sculpture titled ''Trinity Root'', which stood in front of the church at the corner of [[Wall Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] until December 2015 when it was moved by the church to its conference center in Connecticut. The move was controversial as it damaged the sculpture, which was later repaired, and the artist has objected to its eviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/nyregion/artist-still-in-shock-after-trinity-church-uproots-and-breaks-his-9-11-work.html |title=Artist still in shock after Trinity Church uproots and breaks his 9/11 work|date=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupy Wall Street====
Trinity is located near [[Zuccotti Park]], the location of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest. It offered both moral and practical support to the demonstrators but balked when church-owned land adjoining [[Juan Pablo Duarte Square]] was demanded for an encampment. For withholding this property the church hierarchy were criticized by others within the Anglican movement, most notably Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref name="Balk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Group Faults Church, a Onetime Ally|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/nyregion/church-that-aided-wall-st-protesters-is-now-their-target.html |accessdate=December 17, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 16, 2011|author=Matt Flegenheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 2011, occupiers, accompanied by a few clergy, attempted to occupy the land (known as [[LentSpace]]), which is surrounded by a [[chain-link fence]]. After demonstrating in Duarte Park and marching on the streets surrounding the park, occupiers climbed over&lt;ref name="Yes!"&gt;{{cite news|title=Re-Occupy: A Movement Seeks a Sanctuary: On occupying Trinity Church—and the Occupy movement's relationship with established institutions |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/reoccupy-a-movement-seeks-a-sanctuary |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |newspaper=Yes!|date=December 19, 2011|author=Nathan Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the fence. Police responded by arresting about 50 demonstrators, including at least three Episcopal clergymen and a Roman Catholic nun.&lt;ref name="Duarte17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arrests as Occupy Protest Turns to Church |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-protesters-march-against-trinity-church.html |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 17, 2011 |author=Al Baker|author2=Colin Moynihan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Burial grounds ==
{{main|Trinity Church Cemetery}}
There are three [[burial grounds]] closely associated with Trinity Church:
#[[Trinity Church Cemetery|Trinity Churchyard]], at Wall Street and Broadway, is where [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], [[Angelica Schuyler Church]], [[Philip Hamilton]], [[William Bradford (1663-1752)|William Bradford]], [[Franklin Wharton]], [[Robert Fulton]], Captain [[James Lawrence]], [[William Alexander, Lord Stirling]], [[Francis Lewis]], and [[Albert Gallatin]] are buried. 
#[[Trinity Church Cemetery|Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum]] on [[Riverside Drive (New York)|Riverside Drive]] at 155th Street, formerly the location of [[John James Audubon]]'s estate, is where [[John James Audubon]], [[Alfred Tennyson Dickens]], [[John Jacob Astor]], and [[Clement Clarke Moore]] are buried. It is the only active cemetery remaining in the borough of Manhattan. 
#The [[St. Paul's Chapel|Churchyard of St. Paul's Chapel]] is where memorials to the United Irishmen Addis Emmet and Dr. William MacNeven are located.

== Bells ==
The tower of Trinity Church currently contains 23 [[Church bell|bell]]s, the heaviest of which weighs 27 U.S. [[hundredweight]] (1225&amp;nbsp;kg).

Eight of these bells were cast for the tower of the second church building and were hung for ringing in the English [[change ringing]] style. Three more bells were added later. In 1946 these bells were adapted for swing chiming and sounded by electric motors.

A project to install a new ring of 12 additional [[change ringing]] bells was initially proposed in 2001 but put on hold in the aftermath of the [[9/11]] attacks, which took place three blocks north of the church. This project came to fruition in 2006, thanks to funding from the [[Dill Faulkes|Dill Faulkes Educational Trust]]. These new bells form the first ring of 12 change-ringing bells ever installed in a church in the United States. The installation work was carried out by [[John Taylor Bellfounders|Taylors, Eayre and Smith]] of [[Loughborough]], England, in September 2006.

In late 2006, the ringing of the bells for bell practice and tuning caused much concern to local residents, some of whose windows and residences are less than 100 feet at eye level from the bell tower. The church then built a plywood deck right over the bells and placed shutters on the inside of the bell chamber's lancet windows. With the shutters and the plywood deck closed, the sound of the bells outside the tower is minimal.  The shutters, and hatches in the plywood deck, are opened for public ringing.

Public ringing takes place before and after 11:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. Sunday service and on special occasions, such as 9/11 commemorations, weddings, and ticker-tape parades. Details of the individual bells can be found at Dove's Guide for Church Bellringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cccbr.org.uk/dove/detail.php?DoveID=NEW+YORK12 |title=Dove's Guide for Church Bellringers|website=cccbr.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doors ==
Trinity Church has three sets of impressive bronze doors, donated by [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor]] in memory of his father, [[John Jacob Astor III]]. Conceived by [[Richard Morris Hunt]], they date from 1893 and were produced by [[Karl Bitter]] (east door), [[J. Massey Rhind]] (south door), and [[Charles Henry Niehaus]] (north door).  The north and east doors each consists of six panels from Church history or the Bible, and the south door depicts the history of New York in its six panels.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Wayne, Sculpture in America, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York 1968, p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
Trinity Church, as an Episcopal parish in the [[Anglican Communion]], offers a full schedule of Daily Prayer and [[Eucharist]] services throughout the week, and based on the [[Book of Common Prayer]]; it is also available for special occasions, such as weddings and baptisms. In addition to daily worship, Trinity Church provides Christian fellowship and outreach to the community.

==Music and arts==

Trinity Church has a rich music program with an annual budget of $2.5 million as of 2011.&lt;ref name=NYT42413 /&gt; ''Concerts at One'' has been providing live professional classical and contemporary music for the Wall Street community since 1969, and the church has several organized choirs, featured Sunday mornings on [[WQXR-FM|WQXR 105.9 FM]] in New York City. Trinity presents world-class music programs both in New York City and around the world via high definition video streaming.

The mainstay of Trinity's music program is The Choir of Trinity Wall Street, a professional ensemble that leads liturgical music at Trinity Church and St. Paul's Chapel, presents new-music concerts in New York City, produces recordings, and performs in international tours. The Choir is often joined by the Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Trinity's ensemble of period instrumentalists, and NOVUS NY, Trinity's contemporary music orchestra.

Trinity is also home to a Youth Chorus, Youth Orchestra, Family Choir, Downtown Voices, change bell ringers, and a wide variety of arts programming through Congregational Arts. Visiting choirs from around the world perform at Trinity weekly. The entire music program is under the leadership of [[Julian Wachner]], Director of Music and the Arts, a renowned conductor, composer, and keyboard artist.

== Property holdings ==
[[File:Closeuptrinity.jpg|thumb|Close-up of statues of Trinity Church]]
Beginning in the 1780s, the church's claim on 62 acres of Queen Anne's 1705 grant was contested in the courts by descendants of a 17th-century Dutchwoman, Anneke Jans Bogardus, who, it was claimed, held original title to that property.  The basis of the lawsuits was that only five of Bogardus' six heirs had conveyed the land to the English crown in 1671.&lt;ref name=inside /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1879/05/07/80751664.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=A Dutchwoman's Farm.; The Hon. James W. Gerard On The Anneke Jans Bogardus Claims | date=May 7, 1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous times over the course of six decades, the claimants asserted themselves in court, losing each time. The attempt was even revived in the 20th century. In 1959, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] sued over the compensation of the church's property manager, but the church prevailed in ''[[Stanton v. United States]]''.

Disclosure resulting from a lawsuit filed by a parishioner revealed total assets of about $2 billion as of 2011.&lt;ref name=NYT42413 /&gt; Although Trinity Church has sold off much of the land that was part of the royal grant from Queen Anne,&lt;ref name="inside"&gt;{{cite inside}}, pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; it is still one of the largest landowners in New York City with 14 acres of Manhattan real estate including 5.5 million square feet of commercial space in [[Hudson Square]].&lt;ref name=NYT42413 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/about/real-estate|title=Trinity Real Estate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130021304/http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/about/real-estate|archivedate=2009-11-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parish's annual revenue from its real estate holdings was $158 million in 2011 with net income of $38 million,&lt;ref name=NYT42413 /&gt; making it perhaps one of the richest individual parishes in the world.&lt;ref name=inside /&gt;

The institution also owns the [[Trinity Court Building]] property, where it formerly housed its offices and preschool. That building was demolished in 2015, and a replacement is under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newyorkyimby.com/2016/10/new-mixed-use-tower-revealed-at-74-trinity-place-financial-district.html|title=New Mixed-Use Tower Revealed at 74 Trinity Place, Financial District - New York YIMBY|date=2016-10-24|work=New York YIMBY|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.6sqft.com/construction-kicks-off-on-trinity-churchs-pelli-clarke-pelli-designed-community-center-and-office-tower/|title=Construction kicks off on Trinity Church's Pelli Clarke Pelli-designed community center and office tower {{!}} 6sqft|website=6sqft|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church was connected to the previous building by a footbridge, which was preserved during demolition, and will be connected to the new building upon its completion.

'''Ulf Gunnar Ekberg''' (born December 6, 1970), also known as '''Buddha''', is a Swedish singer-songwriter, musician, businessman and television and film producer, best known as a founding member of the pop group [[Ace of Base]], along with siblings [[Jonas Berggren]], [[Linn Berggren]] and [[Jenny Berggren]].

==Life and career==

Ace of Base released its debut album in 1992 and went on to attain major chart success throughout the 1990s.

Ekberg has [[record producer|produced]] several artists, TV productions, films and events and has sold over 40 million records world wide.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Ulf restarted Ace of Base in 2006, touring the world with them from 2007 to 2009. In 2009, he started a new music production/publishing and management company together with Jonas Berggren based in LA, London and Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

After Ekberg experienced the [[tsunami]] in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand, he founded the Surin Relief Fund to support affected children by providing facilities to educate children and care for orphaned children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surinrelieffund.com Surinrelieffund.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008205422/http://www.surinrelieffund.com/ |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Nazi activities===
In its 27 March 1993 edition, the Swedish [[newspaper]] ''[[Expressen]]'' reported that Ekberg had once been a member of a band called "Commit Suiside" [''[[sic]]''], which sang songs with explicit racist lyrics.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;http://noisey.vice.com/blog/ace-of-bases-secret-nazi-past&lt;/ref&gt; Ekberg claims that the cited lyrics were not recorded by Commit Suiside, but says he regrets this past part of his life as a big mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/24/ace-of-base-nazi-past-lyrics_n_3148797.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Ace of Base Responds To Nazi Allegations | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commit Suiside was a neo-Nazi band active in Gothenburg from 1983 to 1986, when Ulf was between the ages of 13 and 16. Other media outlets reported that Ekberg had been a neo-nazi [[skinhead]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Ace_Of_Base/2005/08/24/1186511.html Toronto Sun: Swedish stars holding Aces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonPhoenix"&gt;[http://weeklywire.com/ww/05-08-00/boston_music_4.html The Boston Phoenix: How Swede It Is]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jag är på väg ut ur mörkret|date=17 June 1998|newspaper=Aftonbladet|author=Jörgen Holmstedt|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/noje/9806/17/ulfekberg.html|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 he was a part of the leadership of the [[Sweden Democrats]] in [[Gothenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Sverigedemokraterna: den nationella rörelsen]] |last1=Larsson |first1=Stieg |authorlink1=Stieg Larsson |authorlink2=Mikael Ekman |year=2001 |publisher=[[Ordfront]] |location= |isbn=91-7324-877-0 |page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some of his old songs were released on the compilation album ''Uffe was a Nazi!''. Including songs like ''Rör inte vårt land'' (Don't touch our land), ''Vit makt, svartskalleslakt!'' (White Power, black head slaughter) and a cover of [[Skrewdriver]]'s "Smash the IRA", with the lyrics changed to refer to the [[Left Party (Sweden)|VPK]].&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt;

In the 1997 documentary ''Our Story'', Ekberg said: "I told everyone I really regret what I've done. I closed that book. I don't want to even talk about it, that time does not exist in me any more. I closed it and I threw the book away 1987. I took the experience from it, I learned from it. But that life is not me. It's somebody else."

===Personal life===
Ekberg dated the Swedish model/actress [[Emma Wiklund|Emma Sjöberg]] from 1994 to 2000. He currently lives in [[London]] with his girlfriend Johanna Aybar and their three children: Viggo, Vincent and Valentina.

'''Umberto Agnelli''' (1 November 1934 – 27 May 2004) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[industrialist]] and [[politician]]. He was the third son of [[Virginia Agnelli]] (born Donna Virginia Bourbon del Monte) and of [[Edoardo Agnelli (industrialist)|Edoardo Agnelli]], and the youngest brother of [[Gianni Agnelli]].

He served as a [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of Italian carmaker [[Fiat]] from 1970 to 1976&lt;ref name="news.independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article38565.ece|title=Umberto Agnelli|accessdate=31 December 2007|work=news.independent.co.uk|location=London|date=29 May 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219150336/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article38565.ece|archivedate=19 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the death of his brother Gianni, was briefly chairman of the FIAT Group, 2003–2004, until his own death, aged 69, the following year. He was also chairman and {{fact span|text=later honorary chairman|date=April 2017}} of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], the football team long-associated with FIAT and the [[Agnelli family]], and was for a time the president of the Italian Football Association. 
He was a [[Italian Senate|senator]] of the [[Italian Republic]], from 1976 to 1979. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Italian Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/27-10-2015/hall-of-fame-vialli-mancini-facchetti-ronaldo-herrera-agnelli-tardelli-ferlaino-130676725232.shtml|title=Hall of fame, 10 new entry: con Vialli e Mancini anche Facchetti e Ronaldo|trans-title=Hall of fame, 10 new entries: with Vialli and Mancini also Facchetti and Ronaldo|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Gianni e Umberto Agnelli, 1965 - san dl SAN IMG-00001296.jpg|thumb|Umberto Agnelli (right) with [[Gianni Agnelli]], 1965]]

Agnelli was chairman of FIAT-controlled [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus Football Club]] between 1956–61 and was honorary chairman from 1970–2004.

Agnelli was chairman of Fiat France 1965–80, chief executive officer of Fiat SpA 1970–76 and vice-president 1976–93. He was chairman of Fiat Auto 1980–90 and a member of International Advisory Board 1993–2004.

Though he was a senior executive in the family company, Fiat, he was sidelined from taking a leadership role by his brother [[Gianni Agnelli|Gianni]] until the latter's death in 2003. Only then did he take over as chairman of the whole Fiat Group, 2003–2004. The Group controlled several Italian newspapers and publishers in addition to the FIAT car-firms and Juventus.

Umberto was in the process of restoring Fiat's fortunes, following a period in which the company's balance sheet, market share and share value had all been in decline, when he suddenly died of [[lung cancer]] after barely 18 months in control. Despite this, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated he was the world's 68th richest man with an approximate net worth of [[United States dollar|US$]]5.5 billion. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the [[Bilderberg Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html|title=Former Steering Committee Members|work=bilderbergmeetings.org|publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]]|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Agnelli was born in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], the youngest of seven children. His life was beset by an unusual amount of tragedy and bereavement. His father [[Edoardo Agnelli (industrialist)|Edoardo Agnelli]] perished in an air crash when he was one year old, and his mother [[Virginia Bourbon del Monte|Virginia]] died in a car accident ten years later when he was just 11 years old.
 
In 1959 Agnelli married the heiress ''Donna'' Antonella Bechi Piaggio, from the well-known business-family of [[Piaggio]]. They had three sons but their first, twin boys, died shortly after birth. The third son, [[Giovanni Alberto Agnelli]], grew up to be the head of the maternal family-firm Piaggio, and was being groomed to succeed at Fiat, but died of cancer at the age of 33 in 1997. 

Umberto and Antonella Agnelli later divorced, and in 1974 Umberto married ''Donna'' Allegra Caracciolo di Castagneto. Allegra is the first cousin of Umberto's sister in law [[Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto]], the wife of his brother Giovanni (Gianni). The ladies come from the old [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Nobility|noble]] family that has, among other, the [[Title of nobility|titles of nobility]] of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito.

Umberto and Allegra had two children: [[Andrea Agnelli|Andrea]] (born 1975) and Anna (born 1977). Andrea later followed in his father's footsteps by becoming chairman of Juventus, in 2010.

== Entrepreneurship ==
=== Viaden Media ===

At the age of 16 Prokopenya took on the responsibility of caring for his family, when his father,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had started a business in the 1990s, died in a car accident. In the 2000s, Prokopenya focused on IT consulting and running [[Viaden Media]], the IT company that he founded. In 2006, he reoriented Viaden to develop their own IT products.&lt;ref name=lifetime.ubr /&gt;&lt;ref name=childhood /&gt;

In 2009 the company launched a mobile applications department, headed by [[Yuri Gurski]]. The company developed numerous top-rated applications including ''All-in Fitness'', which sustained top ranking positions on the [[AppStore]] Healthcare &amp; Fitness category in 40 countries for several months. Viaden achieved in excess of 200 million mobile application installations. By 2011 the company was the largest mobile phone software developer in the post-Soviet region. Prokopenya ran the company until 2011 when he sold it, for €95 million, to [[Teddy Sagi]], an Israeli entrepreneur and founder of [[Playtech]] software company. Later Viaden Media was divided into two companies: Sport.com (the largest developer of fitness applications, and owner of sites sport.com and yoga.com) and the Skywind Group (which specialises in mobile and social games).&lt;ref name=gursky.ej&gt;{{cite web

=== VP Capital ===

In 2012, Prokopenya founded his investment company, VP Capital, which has a focus on the technology sector. Later this year he started the fintech company exp(capital), which develops solutions for banks and brokers in order to construct algorithms for high frequency market making. The company is located in the [[Belarus High Technologies Park]], and was ranked the best employer of the year in 2014. The mobile applications department of exp(capital) was acquired by the British company [[IG Group|IG Holdings]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref name=exp.tut&gt;{{cite web

Prokopenya said that Belarus pays around 5% a year interest on debt obligations and that this is high for Belarus, which has debt less than 30% of its GDP. Critics argued that these calculations are inaccurate and that there is no connection between abolishing the death penalty in Belarus and reducing the country's debt burden. Some critics agreed that a moratorium on the death penalty will improve relations between Belarus and the European Union, and that this could affect the rating of the Belarusian Eurobonds and possibly rendering new debt cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Lauritz Vilhelm Pacht''' (23 November 1843, [[Copenhagen]] – 20 May 1912, [[Holte]]) was a Danish [[Genre art|genre]] painter, industrialist and philanthropist. 

==Biography==
His father was a cap maker. After his confirmation, he began to learn printing, but was later apprenticed to a marble chipper.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Vilhelm_Pacht Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; While taking classes at the [[Copenhagen Technical College]], his drawings attracted the attention of [[G.F. Hetsch]], who advised him to take up [[porcelain painting]]. After completing his courses, he was given a position at the [[Royal Porcelain Factory]], which he held from 1862 to 1867.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; 

Beginning in 1861, he also attended classes at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]; passing his final exam in 1866. He began to have showings at the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] and, in 1869, was awarded the {{ill|Neuhausenske Prize|da|De Neuhausenske Præmier}}.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; 

For several years, he worked to perfect a method to improve the reproduction of drawings by printing press. In 1872, he received a patent for his processes and set up a workshop for what he called the "Heliotype" (a process similar to [[hectography]]). Later, he also produced [[phototype]]s.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; In 1880, he joined with the photographer, {{ill|Hilmar Crone|da}}, to create "Pacht &amp; Crones Illustrationsetablissement". Crone left the company in 1885 and was replaced by the drawing teacher, {{ill|Giovannino von Huth|da}}. That same year, Pacht started the "Skandinavisk Panoptikon", a combination [[wax museum]] and [[cabinet of curiosities]].&lt;ref name="V"&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pacht Vilhelm Pacht] @ Victorian Cinema.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, he opened a factory that produced [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] ink and [[Oil paint#Paint tubes|paint tubes]]. In 1890, the company went public as an [[aktieselskab]]  called the "Danske Bogtrykkeres Farvefabrik", but he continued as General Manager.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In 1896, he presented the first moving pictures in Denmark in a wooden structure called the "Panorama" at the square in front of Copenhagen's city hall. His building and equipment were lost to a suspicious fire, but he soon re-established his shows (renamed the "Kineoptikon") at his Panoptikon.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;
 
His activities made him a wealthy man, but also ensured that his output as a painter was rather small.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=2674 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before his death in 1912, he and his second wife, Oline, created the "Vilhelm Pachts Kunstnerboligs Legat" (Artist-Dwelling Legacy), which turned his mansion, "Pachts Bo", into housing for indigent artists.

'''Yellowfin''' is an Australian-headquartered [[business intelligence]] (BI), analytics, [[dashboard]] and [[report]]ing software vendor. It develops and markets a suite of products that are used to transform, access, analyse and report on data held in common business sources including [[spreadsheets]], Web [[API]]s and [[database]]s.

== History ==

Yellowfin was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2003 by a group of business intelligence industry veterans.

The company released its first product, a [[ROLAP]] (Relational OLAP) browser-based web application for a [[Software as a service|SAAS]] software vendor in 2004. This resulted in an early specialization in providing both embedded reporting capabilities to software companies as well as support for the complexities of multi-tenancy hosted environments.

The product is based on an open server architecture and was developed in Java. The design provided the basis for subsequent releases to introduce additional levels of functionality. Amongst these were the development of an integrated [[location intelligence]] module (2009), a social media layer (2010), and a responsive [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]] platform (2012).&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/enterprise/marvels-on-your-mobile-20100322-qrb0.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Marvels on your mobile |date=March 23, 2010 |first=Lia |last=Timson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further innovations include the pioneering of Storyboard, a Collaboration module (2014), and Content Canvas for free-form visualizations (2016).

In 2017, Yellowfin launched 7.4 with its first AI/ML capabilities for Augmented Analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Augmented Analytics |url=https://www.gartner.com/webinar/3846165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using machine-assisted insights, data science integration and ETL capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Era of Analytics: Combine the best of mind and machine |url=https://www.jenunderwood.com/2018/02/12/new-era-analytics-combine-mind-and-machine/ |website=Jen Underwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, with the launch of Yellowfin 8 and the introduction of two additional products – Yellowfin Stories and Yellowfin Signals  –  the company changed its approach, releasing the platform as a suite of five packaged products. Yellowfin Signals is continuing development in the augmented analytics space, enabling a machine automated analytics product. 

Due to the early association with other software vendors, Yellowfin has continued to specialize in the embedded business intelligence market providing its solution as a [[White-label product|white label product]].  The company's primary business model is growth via channel sales through resellers, software partners as well as industry alliances such as [[Sybase]].&lt;ref name="Sybase"&gt;[http://www.sybase.com.au/detail?id=1059730 Sybase Partnership with Yellowfin], Sybase.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these partnerships Yellowfin has over 3 million end users and 27,000 clients in over 75 countries. The software is used across a broad range of industries including financial services,&lt;ref name="financial services"&gt;[http://www.istart.co.nz/index/HM20/AL210753/AR211274 iStart Paymark signs Yellowfin], Financial Services,&lt;/ref&gt; retail,&lt;ref name="retail "&gt;[http://www.techworld.com.au/article/256922/plumber_350_linux_desktops_bonanza_yellowfin_bi Techworld, Plumber's 350 Linux desktops bonanza for Yellowfin BI], Retail.&lt;/ref&gt; telecommunications, logistics,&lt;ref name="logistics "&gt;[http://www.crn.com.au/Feature/214521,logistics-swings--roundabouts.aspx CRN, Logistics is getting smarter thanks to data warehousing and business intelligence], Logistics.&lt;/ref&gt; professional services and government.
