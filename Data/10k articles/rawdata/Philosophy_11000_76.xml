'''Adrian Lewis Melott''' (born January 7, 1947) is an American physicist. He is one of the pioneers of using large-scale computing to investigate the formation of large-scale structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter.  He later turned his attention to an area he calls “astrobiophysics”, examining a variety of ways that external events in our galaxy may have influenced the course of life on Earth, including analysis of [[gamma-ray burst]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0309415 |title=Did a gamma-ray burst initiate the late Ordovician mass extinction? |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=3 |pages=55 |date=23 April 2004 |display-authors=6 |author=A.

== Life ==

Born in [[Moundsville, West Virginia]], his early scientific interest was in physical chemistry, but later changed to study physics at Bethany College in West Virginia.

He became active in the antiwar and educational movements of the 60’s, and was drawn into the Unitarian ministry. He attended [[Starr King School for the Ministry]] in Berkeley, California and was minister in Tampa, Florida for 7 years. During this time he continued his interest in physics. In 1977 he entered the physics program at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he met and quickly decided to work with noted cosmologist [[Dennis W. Sciama]]. He was among one of three groups who had initiated the numerical simulation of the formation of structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter.

He received his Ph.D. in 1981, and followed with postdoctoral work with [[Arthur M. Wolfe]] at Pittsburgh, with the group of [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]] in Moscow, and as Enrico Fermi Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago.  In 1986 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Kansas]], where he has been ever since.

In 1998-2001, he was active in the “controversy” surrounding evolution in the public school curriculum in Kansas. In 2002, he received the Joseph Burton Forum Award for his central role in organizing public support for the return of modern evolutionary biology to the Kansas public school curriculum &lt;ref&gt;url=|http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Melott&amp;first_nm=Adrian&amp;year=2002&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to Gillian, and has two sons, Christopher and Jesse.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Research ==

His work in [[dark matter]] focused on the formation of what has come to be called the “cosmic web” from [[Zeldovich]] pancakes.  In 1983, before the existence of such structure was generally accepted, he and collaborators predicted its existence in a Universe dominated by [[cold dark matter]].  Later in the 80’s, he worked with J. Richard Gott on the topology of large-scale structure, then with Sergei Shandarin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ku.edu/vita/shandarin.html |title=Sergei Shandarin, Professor |publisher=[[University of Kansas]] |accessdate=2010-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627222924/http://www.physics.ku.edu/vita/shandarin.html |archivedate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the merging of hierarchical clustering models with the Zel’dovich pancake picture as a description of large-scale structure.

Beginning in 2003, he made an abrupt transition into a new area which began by examining the effects the radiation from a [[gamma-ray burst]] would have upon the Earth, and attempting to draw a connection with past mass extinction events.  This has branched out into examination of comet impacts, solar flares, and other phenomenae.  He showed that a 63 million-year oscillation in fossil biodiversity cuts across a variety of data sets and has found clues to its cause, which, however, is still an unsolved problem.

Melott is a member of the [[Paleontological Society]]. He was elected Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/fellowships/archive-all.cfm?initial=M&amp;year=1996&amp;nom_unit=&amp;institution= |title=Fellowships : Archive (1995-present) |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; “For groundbreaking studies of the origin and evolution of cosmic structure” in 1996, and received its Joseph Burton Forum award &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Melott&amp;first_nm=Adrian&amp;year=2002 |title= Melott Forum Award citation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his educational work in 2003. In 2007, he was elected Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] “For distinguished contributions to cosmological large-scale structure, for organizing public support for teaching evolution, and for interdisciplinary research on astrophysical impacts on the biosphere.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23220">'''Androcentrism''' ([[Ancient Greek]], ἀνήρ, "man, male"&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | last3 = Stuart Jones | first3 = Henry | others = Roderick McKenzie | author-link1 = Edward Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | author-link3 = Henry Stuart Jones | title = [[A Greek–English Lexicon]] | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 499596825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a [[masculine]] point of view at the center of one's [[world view]], culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing femininity. The related adjective is ''androcentric'', while the practice of placing the [[feminine]] point of view at the center is ''[[gynocentric]]''.

== Origin of the term ==

The term ''androcentrism'' was introduced as an analytic concept by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on ''The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture'', published in 1911.&lt;ref name="CPG_1911"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins Gilman | first = Charlotte | author-link = Charlotte Perkins Gilman | title = The man-made world: or, Our androcentric culture | publisher = Charlton | location = New York | year = 1911 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3015/3015-h/3015-h.htm | oclc = 988836210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as ''[[Other (philosophy)|other]]''. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] while female patterns were considered as [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].&lt;ref name="CPG_1911" /&gt;

== Education ==
In the past boys and men were expected to have better formal education than girls and women. Girls and women were less frequently able to read and write than boys and men were; thus, written material tended to reflect the male point of view.  Well into the second half of the 20th century young men entered university far more frequently than young women.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Some universities such as the [[University of Oxford]] consciously practiced a [[numerus clausus]] and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|work=Times Higher Education|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "educated opinion" risked being androcentric.

== Literature ==

In the majority of societies today, books, magazine articles and book reviews are written predominantly by men and therefore may privilege a male viewpoint. For instance, in 2010 only 37% of the books published by [[Random House]] were written by women, and only 17% of the books reviewed by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Franklin | first = Ruth | title = A Literary Glass Ceiling? Why magazines aren't reviewing more female writers | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/82930/VIDA-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews | work = [[The New Republic]] | date = February 7, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by VIDA in 2010 found that men wrote the vast majority of articles and book reviews in leading magazines in the United States and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VIDA | title = The Count 2010 | url = http://vidaweb.org/the-count-2010 | work = VIDA: Women in Literary Arts | date = May 16, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of [[Caldecott]] award-winning books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Mykol C. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = David | last3 = Broaddus | first3 = Michelle | last4 = Young | first4 = Kate | title = Gender stereotyping and under-representation of female characters in 200 popular children’s picture books: a twenty-first century update | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 55 | issue = 11&amp;ndash;12 | pages = 757&amp;ndash;765 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | date = December 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.

== TV and film ==

The vast majority of films are written and directed by men. This may result in an androcentric bias, with most films (and film characters) being created from a male perspective. Of the top 250 grossing films in 2007, 82% had no female writers and only 6% had a female director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = The celluloid ceiling report: behind-the-scenes employment of women in the top 250 films of 2007 | url = http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/Celluloid%20Ceiling%202007%20Full%20Report.pdf | publisher = Center for the study of women in television and film, [[San Diego State University]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of all film reviews published in the USA are written by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = Thumbs down - representation of women film critics in the top 100 U.S. daily newspapers | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110312222038/http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen | archive-date = 12 March 2011 | url = http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen/ | date = 2008 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, not only do men have more influence than women over the storyline and characters of most films but also they have the most influence when it comes to publicly reviewing them. Because most film reviewers are male, androcentric films (films from a masculine viewpoint) may tend to receive more glowing reviews than female-centric films.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A 2009 study conducted by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] analyzed 122 children's films (released between 2006 and 2009) and found both a male bias 'behind the scenes' of the films as well as a male bias in the content of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Smith | first1 = Stacy | last2 = Choueiti | first2 = March | title = Gender on screen and behind the camera in family films: an executive summary | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223180123/http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | archive-date = 23 December 2010 | url = http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | publisher = [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] |date=23 December 2010 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this sample, 93% of directors, 87% of writers, and 80% of producers were male. Therefore, an androcentric (male) perspective was dominant in most of the films. The report argued that the male dominance behind most of the films was connected to a male bias (an androcentric bias) in the content of the films themselves. For instance, the majority (70.8%) of the speaking characters in these films were also male, and female characters were much more likely than male characters to be portrayed as beautiful. The report argued that "cinematic females are valued more than cinematic males for their looks, youthfulness, and sexy demeanor".

== The arts ==

In 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the [[Guerrilla Girls]], began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guerilla Girls poster 1989 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | archive-date = 25 November 2013 | url = http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | publisher = [[Guerrilla Girls]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Jerry | author-link = Jerry Saltz | title = Where are All the Women?

== Generic male language ==

In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as "Hey guys" or "Dear Sirs") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Paul | first = Jennifer | title = Feminist philosophy of language | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/#1.1 | website = plato.stanford.edu | publisher = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online) | date = 2004 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).

Many Latin-based languages in the world are also male-centric. For instance, in Spanish the word ''padres'' (plural of 'father') means 'parents', ''abuelos'' (plural of 'grandfather') means 'grandparents', and ''chicos'' means either 'boys' or 'children'. Pluralized nouns are, if describing a mixed-gender group, assigned male word-endings, pronouns, and adjectives.  This dominance of the masculine grammatical form in formation of the plural is a property also of Italian, Portuguese and French.

Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.'&lt;ref&gt;
''Studies'':

Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Mykol C. | title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Masculine bias in the attribution of personhood: people = male, male = people&lt;/nowiki&gt; | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 393&amp;ndash;402 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | date = November 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all.  In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) — females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of "any person" as generic "he," since "he" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., "he or she") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., "human").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khosroshahi | first = Fatemeh | title = Penguins don't care, but women do: A social identity analysis of a Whorfian problem | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 505&amp;ndash;525 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500013889 | date = December 1989 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500013889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Who counts as human?

Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind. According to Slocum, "All too often the word 'man' is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females."&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, Sally (2012) [1975], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kou0uQAACAAJ Woman the gatherer: male bias in anthropology]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = McGee | editor-first1 = R.

== Generic male symbols ==

The default images in Western society for 'man' and for 'human being' are usually the same. For example, the 'walking person' light (that indicates when it is safe for pedestrians to cross the road) looks the same as the symbol for 'man' on the door of a male restroom. The typical symbol for 'woman' looks quite different (with long hair and a triangle body to indicate she is wearing a dress).

On the Internet, many avatars are gender-neutral (such as an image of a smiley face). However, when an avatar is human and discernibly gendered, it usually appears to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wade | first = Lisa | title = Default avatars: a collection | url = https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/6281/5883 | work = [[University of Minnesota|The Society Pages]] &amp;#124; Sociological Images | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] | date = 4 May 2009 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Anonymously male: Social media avatar icons are implicitly male and resistant to change | journal = Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | page = 8 | publisher = [[Masaryk University]] | doi = 10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | date = 2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the image of a man (but not that of a woman) is considered to be a normative representation of humankind in general.

== Politics and the law ==

==Sports==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Sports media channels such as [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], as well as sports magazines like [[Sports Illustrated]], are assumed to appeal to a predominantly male audience. This is reflected by its advertisers who almost exclusively target men. Men are also most likely to stimulate the sporting economy whether the advertising is targeted non-gender specifically. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}''&lt;!--This statement is not supported by research and data--&gt;analysis.''

[[File:AB Portrait.jpg|thumb|Arnold Berleant]]
Arnold Berleant was born in Buffalo, New York&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo.  He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics.  His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics.  Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of ''Contemporary Aesthetics'', an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.

==Life and work==

As a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts.  These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Renee Conroy, “Berleant Review,” (Philadelphia, PA:  American Society for Aesthetics, Eastern Division, April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  His first book, ''The Aesthetic Field:  A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience'' (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated.  Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment.  The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cheng Xiangzhan, “Environmental Aesthetics and Ecological Aesthetics:  Arnold Berleant’s Impact on Ecological Aesthetics in China,” Sztuka i Filozofia-Special Issue (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In Art and Engagement'' (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film.&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Aesthetics, Summer 1991.  p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality.  Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt;
The body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience.  Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.&lt;ref&gt;M. Feder-Marcus, Choice (American Library Association,  December, 1991), p. 255)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Michael O'Brien''' [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] (9 December 1907 – 3 January 1982&lt;ref name="Zealandia"&gt;"Jesuit lecturer dies", ''Zealandia'', 17 January 1982, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a New Zealand Jesuit priest, philosopher, musician (cellist),{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|p=72}} writer and seminary professor.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand and was educated by the [[Order of St Dominic|Dominican sisters]] at St Thomas's Academy, [[Oamaru]] and at [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]]. His father was a surgeon.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=11–22}} He had a sister (who later became Sister Monica O'Brien [[Society of the Sacred Heart|RSCJ]], of Wellington) and two brothers, Arthur and Michael, who remained in Christchurch.&lt;ref name="Zealandia"/&gt;

==Training==
In January 1924, O'Brien commenced his studies as a Jesuit [[novice]] at the Loyola [[Novitiate]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] in Sydney, Australia. There and at [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview|Riverview College]] he also advanced his study of Greek.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=23–29}}  O'Brien obtained his BA at the [[National University of Ireland]] where he also studied music.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=30–38}} In 1929, O'Brien went to the Jesuit house of Philosophy at [[Pullach]], a village just outside [[Munich]] where, after learning German, and with many German, Austrian and other students from many countries, he embarked on three years of laborious philosophic studes. The Philosophy taught was fundamentally [[scholasticism|medieval scholasticism]], as modified by the sixteenth century Jesuit [[Francisco Suárez|Suárez]]. O'Brien's "best teacher" was Father [[Alois Maier]] who promoted [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. O'Brien made a special study of [[Plotinus]] in relation to the Psychology of art. [[Karl Rahner]] was two years ahead of O'Brien but among his companions were [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[:de:Josef Neuner|Joseph Neuner]] and [[Alfred Delp]]. In 1932, at the end of his Philosophy course, O'Brien received [[minor orders]] from [[Michael von Faulhaber|Cardinal Faulhaber]], Archbishop of Munich.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=39–46}} He then returned to Sydney and was given the job of coaching young novices who were beginning their university studes.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=47–52}} In 1935, O'Brien went to the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Louvain]] in Belgium to study Theology. His most important teacher there was [[Joseph Maréchal]] who combined the "best insights" of [[Thomas Aquinas]] with the transcendental speculations of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. "His teaching set flowing one of the principal streams of present-day Catholic Philosophy and Theology, a stream from which [[André Marc]] and [[Karl Rahner]], [[:de:Johannes Baptist Lotz|J.B. Lotz]], [[Emerich Coreth]] and [[Bernard Lonergan]] have all drunk". O'Brien read particularly the German theologian and mystic [[Matthias Scheeben]] and wrote a theological dissertation on [[Friedrich von Hügel]]. O'Brien was ordained a priest in 1938 at Louvain and after spending the first few years of [[World War II]] in Jesuit establishments in England and in Ireland, he returned to Sydney in 1941.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=53–69}}

==Academic career and contribution==
In Australia, O'Brien was appointed to St Patrick's College, [[Melbourne]] to teach boys in 1941. It was there that he published a book on the vocation of a Jesuit priest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13117644?q=bernard+o%27brien&amp;c=book&amp;versionId=15551065 Bernard O'Brien (1907–1982), ''The Jesuit Vocation'', Messenger Office, St. Patrick's College, Melbourne, 1944.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 he was appointed to the Jesuit scholasticate at [[Watsonia, Victoria|Watsonia]] to take care of the university studies of the Jesuit [[scholastics]] as he had before. On 2 February 1942 he was admitted to his final vows as a Jesuit. In 1943 he was appointed to [[Corpus Christi College, Melbourne|Corpus Christi College, Werribee]] (a seminary for the training of secular priests) near Melbourne to lecture in theology. He filled this position until 1949.{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=70–75}} In late 1947 temporarily and then permanently in 1950 O'Brien was appointed to [[Holy Name Seminary]] in his home town of [[Christchurch]]. At that time it was a minor seminary with generally 70–90 secondary school age boys boarding there. By 1959, however, the school aspect had been fazed out and the seminary was teaching Philosophy to men who had finished secondary school and were in training to be ordained as secular priests. The result of the change for O'Brien was that he then became a Philosophy lecturer and set about preparing courses in [[Logic]] and [[Theory of Knowledge]] and the [[Being|Philosophy of Being]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1967|pp=76–77}} Philosophy hitherto had been taught at Holy Name in programs of a traditional [[Thomist]] stamp, whether taught directly from the Catholic textbooks known as "manuals", or from private course notes which represented an updated form of the scholastic system. Even in the 1950s, textbooks were still in Latin, with students expected to know enough of the language to make their way through the three-volume ''Summula Philosophiae Scholasticae'' of [[J. S. Hickey]], or, if this was beyond them, with the simplified "dog Latin" of the ''Manuale Philosophiae ad Usum Seminariorum'' of [[Giovanni di Napoli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/A+Companion+to+Philosophy+in+Australia+and+New+Zealand/56/xhtml/chapter19.html John Owens S.M., "Theological Institutions (New Zealand), Philosophy in" ''A Companion to Philosophy in Australia and New Zealand'', Monash University] (retrieved 14 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien, with his broad interests and education, and his colleagues initiated great changes and he gave Philosophy studies at Holy Name Seminary some standing and "twenty years of clergy owe, if not an appreciation for scholarship at least an acceptance of it to him." {{sfn|Norris|1999|p=53}} O'Brien was well remembered by his students especially for his lectures in logic and [[metaphysics]] and for his keen interest in music, art and literature. For many years he supervised the choir at Holy Name Seminary.&lt;ref name="Zealandia"/&gt;

==Later years and wisdom==
O'Brien taught at Holy Name Seminary until it was closed in 1979. He then continued at [[Holy Cross College (New Zealand)|Holy Cross Seminary, Mosgiel]] where he lectured in literature and Art. In 1980 his health began to fail and he spent some time at the [[Little Sisters of the Poor|Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor]] in Dunedin. He died at the hospice of St John of God in Richmond, New South Wales, on 3 January 1982.&lt;ref name="Zealandia"/&gt;

O'Brien made a considerable contribution, especially in journals and book reviews, to the Catholic church in New Zealand. He once recalled an occasion when, as a young Jesuit in Australia, he barely escaped drowning. "I came to realise that God might call me in early years. I found that I could renounce life, if God so wished. This was a salutary experience – a deepening one."&lt;ref name="Zealandia"/&gt; He also wrote of the knowledge in every field of learning, and of the enormous change in the church since [[Vatican II]]. "Who can possibly hold that we are simply recalling the stand we took in the past, and adding to it?" He urged that Catholics should adopt what is needed for each new age. "We must learn to react to God's call when it is given, and wait for the time when it is ripe."&lt;ref name="Zealandia"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6166">The '''Carltona doctrine''' (or '''Carltona principle''') expresses the idea that, in [[United Kingdom law]], the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the [[Minister (government)|minister]] in charge of that department. The point was established in ''Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.''&lt;ref&gt;[1943] 2 All ER 560 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The judgment in ''Carltona''==

Faced with the requisition of their factory by the war-time government, the factory owners raised a [[Judicial Review in English Law|judicial review]] action to challenge the legality of the requisition order. The order had been made under the auspices of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which authorised the Commissioners of Works to requisition such land as they deemed necessary in the national interest. The Regulations specified that the Commissioner's powers were exercisable by, ''inter alia'' the Minister of Works and Planning. The factory owners sought to argue that the requisition was invalid because the order had not in fact been signed by the minister, but by an official within the Ministry of Works and Planning. In rejecting this contention, the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[Lord Greene]], acknowledged the realities of [[government]] in the 20th century:

{{Quotation|
"In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them...[therefore] The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case."}}

This statement of the way government operates has only become more true in recent decades as increased state interventionism and juridification have produced a rapid growth in the use of [[delegated legislation]]. Clearly, confronted with this reality, it would have been preposterous for the Court to construe the wording of the Regulations so narrowly that only the Minister, in person, could exercise the powers. Thus Lord Greene explained that:

{{Quotation|
"Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister."}}

It should be emphasised that the essence of the ''Carltona'' doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant Minister. It is emphatically not the case that the Minister has delegated his decision-making power to a subordinate and therefore the doctrine achieves consistency with the principle that Parliament's delegatees have, unless specifically provided by statute, no power to delegate ([[Delegata potestas non potest delegari|''delegatus non potest delegare'']]).

Lord Greene proceeded to reconcile this with the doctrine of parliamentary accountability on the basis that:

{{Quotation|
"It is he [the minister] who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them."}}

==Scope of the rule==

Despite suggestions to the contrary by some academic commentators,&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Woolf and Jowell ''Judicial Review of Administrative Action'' (5th edn.) para. 6-114&lt;/ref&gt; it seems that there is no restriction on the applicability of the doctrine on account of the nature of the power being wielded. In ''HMA v. Copeland''&lt;ref&gt;1988 SLT 249&lt;/ref&gt; it was opined, by the [[High Court of Justiciary|highest criminal court in Scotland]] that:

{{Quotation|
" ...there is no obligation on the minister to exercise his powers personally even when those powers involve a serious invasion of the freedom or property rights of the subject."
}}

However, in some instances Parliament has chosen to statutorily override this position by providing that the relevant minister must exercise the power in person.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. s.60(9)(a) Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) ("and not by a person acting under his authority") [https://archive.is/20120805181602/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;Year=1999&amp;number=33&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1888846&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1888933&amp;filesize=7868]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland ==

The [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] has confirmed that the Carltona doctrine applies to its fullest extent to the Irish civil service also- see ''Devanney v'' ''Shields'' [1998] 2 I.R. 230.

'''''Character Strengths and Virtues''''' ('''CSV''') is a book by [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] (2004) that attempts
to present a  measure of [[humanism|humanist]] ideals of [[virtue]] in an empirical,  rigorously scientific manner.
 
In the same way that the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' is used to assess and facilitate research on [[mental disorders]],  CSV  is intended to provide a theoretical framework to assist in developing practical applications for [[positive psychology]].&lt;ref name="CSV"&gt;{{cite book

The organization of the 6 virtues and 26 strengths is as follows:
# '''Wisdom and Knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]
# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]
# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]
# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]
# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]
# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]

CSV defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria. Character strengths are fulfilling; [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically valuable]], in an ethical sense ([[Intellectual giftedness|gifts]], [[skill]]s, [[aptitude]]s, and [[expert]]ise can be squandered, but character strengths and [[virtue]]s cannot); non-[[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]]; not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); [[Trait theory|trait-like]] (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV; personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; observable in [[child prodigy|child prodigies]] (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); absent in some individuals; and nurtured by societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[institution]]s.

The introduction of CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that these traits lead to increased happiness when practiced. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]] and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis.&lt;ref name="CSV" /&gt; These arguments are in line with the [[science of morality]].

Each of the 26 character traits is defined [[Behaviorism|behaviorally]], with [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] evidence demonstrating that it can be [[Reliability (statistics)|reliably]] measured.
The book shows that "empirically minded [[Humanism|humanists]] can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner."&lt;ref name="Cloninger"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical applications of positive psychology include helping individuals and organizations correctly identify their strengths and use them to increase and sustain their respective levels of well-being. Each trait "provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being."&lt;ref name="Cloninger" /&gt; Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness or disorder]].

Finally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 26 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 26 original traits.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F.

'''Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas''', also known as '''Kashinath''' and '''Madhusudandas''', was an Indian [[Hindu saints|saint]] born in [[Bihar]], India. His disciples included Shri Anandi Ma and Omdasji Maharaj. He was a master of [[Kundalini yoga|Kundalini Maha Yoga]] who was responsible for popularizing it in the United States..

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Kashinath  was born in winter of 1878* (Footnote 1) in Durgadi, a village in [[Bihar]], India, to Sampatti Devi Mishra and Ramdahin Mishra.  His parents named him ''Kashinath'' after [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. Prior to his birth, his mother reported having a vision of [[Krishna|Lord Krishna]].  Devotees in India regard such visions as auspicious signs indicating the coming of a ''great being''.

Kashinath grew up in a devout Hindu family.  While other children were playing, he was reportedly meditating.  By age seven, Kashinath was consumed by questions about identity and mortality. At one point, he reportedly ran away in search of the meaning of death, but was retrieved by his parents and sent to a school.  At age 13, Kashinath left home for good to reportedly search for spiritual enlightenment.

===Spiritual quest and meeting his Satguru===
For the next 30 years, Kashinath travelled across India.  He ofter visited remote and unsettled areas, seeking saints and [[yogis]] living in seclusion to teach him. He would eventually become adept at [[Mantra]], [[Yantra]], [[Hatha]], Raja and [[Jnana]] yogic practices and philosophies. At age 27, Kashinath took his vows of renunciation ([[sannyasa]]) and received the spiritual name of ''Madhusudandas''. 

Although he had mastered many yogic paths and practised intense austerities, Kashinath believed that he had failed to attain his ultimate goal of self-realization. In 1921, while practising stringent austerities in a cave on [[Mount Abu]] in [[Rajasthan]], Kashinath met his [[Satguru]]. Shri Yogiraj Parameshwardas, a master of [[Kundalini yoga]].  Shri Parameshwardas bestowed [[Shaktipat]] initiation on Kashinath. According to Kashinath, he immediately he attained the highest state of [[samadhi]] and his ultimate goal of self-realization.

Kashinath recounts that when he opened his eyes three days later, Shri Parameshwardas was sitting before him in the form of Lord [[Hanuman]]. Lord Hanuman, was the quintessential devotee of Shri [[Rama]] embodying the highest level of [[bhakti]] (devotional love), jnana (knowledge of Reality), [[vairagya]] (renunciation or detachment) and [[Selfless service|seva]] (selfless service). According to And these Divine qualities of Lord Hanuman became the hallmarks of Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas.

===Life Mission===
Through the guidance of Shri Parameshwardas, Kashinath became a master of Kundalini Maha Yoga.  This would give him the power to awaken the dormant Kundalini in spiritual aspirants, and to then guide their spiritual evolution from subtle levels. In recognition of this attainment, Shri Parameshwardas conferred on Kashinath the honorary title "[[Dhyanyogi]]." *(footnote 2)

After this, Kashinath carried on his work and teachings in a small [[ashram]] which he established in Bandhavad in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].

In 1960, Kashinath began widespread public instruction in Kundalini Maha Yoga, conducting group meditations throughout India. For millennia, Shaktipat had been an esoteric path to self-realization, not openly bestowed, or explicitly discussed in ancient [[Vedic]] scriptures like the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. Kashinath became one of the first teachers of this ancient tradition to openly work at a mass level by bestowing Shaktipat initiation on all who sought it from him. He said:  ''“All those who came to me for Shaktipat are worthy, and all of them are my spiritual heirs. For my energy works through them.” ''

In late 1960s and early 1970s, During a protracted drought and famine in Gujarat, Kashinath collected charitable funds for relief there.

On 7 December 1971, exhausted by his unceasing efforts for famine victims, Kashinath suffered a dramatic [[near-death experience]] (NDE) which he recounted in a pamphlet entitled ''"Death, Dying and Beyond"''. He reported being taken to a heavenly abode of [[Lord Rama]], his principal devotional deity. But then being sent back by Rama to his "dead" body to fulfill his desire to help many people, whose faces were shown to him from that subtle dimension beyond our Earthly "reality". After the NDE, Kashinath established a secondary school in Bandhwad, a hospital in a backward area of Bihar to help the needy, and a temple on his small Bandhwad ashram.

===Introduction of Kundalini Maha Yoga to America===
In 1976, Kashinath left India for the first time to expand his worldwide mission, described as helping spiritual seekers and raising humanity's consciousness. Following prior requests from American devotees, Kashinath came to the United States.  He traveled around the country teaching meditation and offering Shaktipat. .

During Kashinath's four years in the US, he established many local groups and initiated thousands into Kundalini Maha Yoga. In his US lectures, he revealed that during his 1971 NDE he had seen and identified many of the same people who came to him in the West. He said: ''“Many of those faces that I saw in the courtyard of Lord Rama, I have seen here, since I came to America. All of the people I saw are my family, and I have to help them.”'' In introducing Kundalini Maha Yoga to Americans, Kashinath said that it was not a religion but a spiritual practice bringing'' “lasting inner peace and happiness to individuals of any belief or religious affiliation.”'' He describes this path in the book ''“Shakti: An Introduction to Kundalini Maha Yoga.”''

===Final years and death===
In 1980, at age 102, Kashinath returned to India where he spent his remaining years in or near [[Ahmedabad]], in Gujarat.

On 29 August 1994, the anniversary of [[Lord Krishna]]'s birth, Kashinath died. To his devotees, it meant that he left his physical. Many of his devotees  report that they continue to experience his transformative [[shakti]] energy at subtle levels of awareness.

== Yogic powers ==
According to his devotees, Kashinath displayed extraordinary physical prowess,  emanated exceptional spiritual energy, and sometimes demonstrated what Westerners call “miracles”.  People witnessed him as a centenarian demonstrating difficult yogic postures – like head stands – and walking so fast that young people had to jog to keep up with his extraordinary pace.

Even after he became physically debilitated, Kashinath reportedly emanated an intense [[shakti]] energy field.  People (and even objects) touched by or near him were long imbued with this transformative energy. In ''"Death, Dying and Beyond"'' Kashinath told how three or four different people who attempted to help him during his NDE experience immediately fell unconscious into deep meditative states when they touched his body. Only after he returned to his body to help them were they able to awaken from these states.

Kashinath occasionally demonstrated  "miracles" to foster faith in the Divine. Many of those "miracles" were anecdotally reported by his devotees.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. his biography ''"This House Is on Fire: The Life of Shri Dhyanyogi”  by Shri Anandi Ma.'' and spiritual Memoirs of Ron Rattner [http://sillysutras.com/category/rons-memoirs/]&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings and lectures, Kashinath explained that yogic powers (''siddhis'') might be attained via control of life-force energies, but that they were seldom displayed; that such powers are used ''"sparingly and on occasion for humanitarian and other discretionary ends,"'' but not ''"for self-aggrandizement."       ~ Light on Meditation, Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas, page 71:''

Kashinath was especially interested in scientifically demonstrating yogic powers of mantra and of mind. Accordingly, he presided over scientific demonstrations of how [[pulse]] and [[blood pressure]] readings of meditators could be influenced by his chanting of powerful [[Bīja|Bija]] (seed) Mantras. Kashinath reportedly demonstrated that he could at will increase or decrease his own blood pressure by his yogic powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">'''Donald Dwight Evans''' (September 21, 1927 – January 5, 2018) was a Canadian educator, psychotherapist and spiritual counsellor. 

Born in [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]], Evans obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1950, following which he earned a [[B.Phil.]] from [[Oxford University]] and a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] from [[McGill University]]. He was ordained as a pastor in the [[United Church of Canada]] in 1955. He was a professor of divinity at McGill from 1960 to 1964 (during which time he received a [[D.Phil.]] from Oxford), an associate professor of philosophy from 1964 to 1968 and full professor from 1968 until 1993. 

In his early work, his ''The Logic of Self-Involvement'' (1963), Evans finds the meaning of religion within [[language]]. In his later works, his 1980 ''Faith, Authenticity, and Morality'' and his 1981 ''Struggle and Fulfillment,'' Evans finds the basis of religious belief in [[religious experience]].&lt;ref&gt;''Language, Experience and the life well-lived: a review of the work of Donald Evans'', [[Religious Studies Review]], Vol. 9, No. 1. January 1983, pp. 33-41&lt;/ref&gt; He died on January 5, 2018, aged 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20180112.93397616/BDAStory/BDA/deaths|title=globeandmail.com: PROF.

==Indignant compassion==
'''Indignant compassion''' is experienced by both believers and non-believers in [[God]]. It is a common identification with the suffering of others.  The prominent idea is that both believers and non-believers grieve and rebel against suffering.  To explain this term, Evans gives two fictional atheists--[[Dostoievsky]]'s [[Ivan Karamazov]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]]'s [[The Plague#Characters in "The Plague"|Dr. Bernard Rieux]]--as examples of those whose "compassion is compounded with a sense of outrage and revulsion that nature and men should inflict mental and physical toruture on human beings." Evans also quotes [[D. M. Mackinnon]]'s ''Christian Faith and Communist Faith'' (1953) "the man who revolts, determined somehow to affirm in this most desperate situation that God did not so make the world, is met by the mystery of God's own revolt against the world He made."   According to Evans, a belief in a God of '''indignant compassion''' means a belief in a God who suffers, which is what [[Bonhoeffer]] illustrates when—during his incarceration in a [[Nazi]] prison—he wrote "Christians stand by God in his hour of grieving."  &lt;ref&gt;''Science and Religion'', Ian Barbour, Harper Forum Books ([[Harper &amp; Row]]), 1968, pp. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;

ESOS is a [[Linux distribution#Niche distributions|niche]] [[Linux distribution]]. ESOS is intended to run on a [[USB flash drive]], or some other type of removable media such as [[Secure Digital]], [[CompactFlash]], etc. ESOS is a [[memory resident]] [[operating system]]: At boot, a [[tmpfs]] file system is initialized as the root file system and the [[USB flash drive]] image is copied onto this file system.&lt;ref name="smith_labman_2014"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Smith |title=Virtual Desktops - From Pilot to Reality and the Trip We Made |url=http://labman.unlv.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LabMan_2014_VDI.ppt |date=3 June 2014 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Configuration files and logs are periodically written to a [[USB flash drive]] (persistent storage) or by user intervention when configuration changes occur.&lt;ref name="smith_mmc_2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marc Smith |title=Building and Using Open Source Storage Solutions |url=http://www.merit.edu/mmc/pdf/2013_Smith_Storage.pdf |date=15 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731001912/http://www.merit.edu/mmc/pdf/2013_Smith_Storage.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interface ==
[[File:Esos ss main 20150111.png|thumb|Screenshot of the main TUI screen in ESOS (Enterprise Storage OS).]]

ESOS utilizes a [[text-based user interface]] (TUI) for system management, network configuration, and storage provisioning functions.&lt;ref name="smith_post_20120811"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marc Smith  |title=ESOS Update (8/11/2012) |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/esos-users/mnjWY8hURg0/goFdSOO6cWQJ |date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TUI used in ESOS is written in [[C (programming language)|C]]; the [[ncurses]] and [[CDK (programming library)|CDK]] libraries are used.

== Front-end connectivity ==
ESOS supports connectivity on several different front-end [[storage area network]] technologies.&lt;ref name="haguru_article_20130212"&gt;{{cite web |author=”HA Guru”  |title=Linux as an Open Storage Server |url=http://www.ha-guru.com/linux_open_storage_serve/ |date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These core functions are supported by [[SCST]] and third-party target drivers that vendors have developed for [[SCST]]:&lt;ref name="smith_post_20140724"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marc Smith |title=ESOS Project Update (July 2014)

* [[Fibre Channel]]: QLogic HBAs are natively supported, and Emulex OneConnect FC HBAs can be supported by a build time option (requiring the Emulex OCS SDK)&lt;ref name="avago_20141215"&gt;{{cite web |author=Avago Technologies |title=Mott Community College Increases Storage Performance with High-Availability Solution |url=http://www.lsi.com/downloads/Public/Syncro%20Shared%20Storage/docs/cs-storage-mott-college.pdf |date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[InfiniBand]]: [[Mellanox]], [[QLogic]], and [[Chelsio]] IB HCAs, among others, are supported&lt;ref name="monster_article_20140316"&gt;{{cite web |author=”Monster Network!” |title=Phase 10 is complete. |url=http://monsternetwork.wordpress.com/category/storage-area-networking/infiniband/ |date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fibre Channel over Ethernet]] (FCoE): A software  target implementation supports NICs with DCB/DCBX capabilities, or build time options exist for supporting [[Emulex]] OneConnect FCoE CNAs (requires the [[Emulex]] OCS SDK) and [[Chelsio]] Uwire FCoE CNAs.&lt;ref name="smith_article_20140714"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marc Smith |title=Open Storage: Dual-Controller OSS Disk Array |url=http://marcitland.blogspot.com/2014/07/open-storage-dual-controller-oss-disk.html |date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[iSCSI]]: Will work over any IP communication method supported by ESOS ([[Ethernet]], IPoIB).

==Back-end storage==
[[Open-source software]] projects and [[commodity computing]] server hardware are used on the back-end side to provide the underlying storage utilized by the front-end target interfaces:
* [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], and [[ext4]] are all supported file systems for virtual disk files used with the "vdisk_fileio" device handler.
* Popular, modern hardware RAID controllers from [[LSI Corporation|LSI]], [[Adaptec]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], and Areca are also supported in ESOS, including install-time CLI tool integration for these adapters.
* Clustering and high-availability support is made possible by the [[Pacemaker]] and [[Corosync]] cluster software stack.
* [[DRBD]] is fully supported to facilitate [[Replication (computing)|replication]] between ESOS storage servers, and/or to create redundant ESOS storage server clusters.
* [[Virtual Tape Library]] (VTL) support by the mhVTL project.
* Three SSD caching solutions: [[EnhanceIO]], [[bcache]], and [[dm-cache]] (lvmcache).
* Other block storage functions include the [[automated tiered storage]] via the BTIER project and [[Ceph (software)|Ceph]] RBD mapping.

==Installation==
ESOS differs from [[Linux distribution#Popular distributions|popular Linux distributions]] in that there is no bootable [[ISO image]] provided. ESOS consists of one archive file that is extracted on a local computer running a supported operating system (Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X).&lt;ref name="smith_article_20140714" /&gt; The local computer is only used for installing the ESOS image to a [[USB flash drive]] (or other removable media device).&lt;ref name="smith_post_20130310"&gt;{{cite web |author=Marc Smith |title=ESOS Project Status &amp; Updates (March 2013) |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/esos-users/WFz_nV32NVM/WD5dwV58ygMJ |date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of ESOS extract the archive and execute the ESOS install script. The ESOS installer script prompts the user for the installation target device, writes the image, and allow users to integrate proprietary [[Command-line interface|CLI]] [[RAID controller]] utilities into the ESOS [[USB flash drive]].

{{Platonism}}

The '''Euthyphro dilemma''' is found in [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Euthyphro]]'', in which [[Socrates]] asks [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]], "Is the [[piety|pious]] ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) loved by the [[deity|gods]] because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" ([[Stephanus pagination|10a]]) It implies that if moral authority must come from the gods it does not have to be good, and if moral authority must be good it does not have to come from the gods – a highly controversial idea at the time Socrates first presented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Was the Charge Against Socrates? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-was-the-charge-against-socrates-121060 |website=Thoughtco |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the argument applied to the many capricious gods of [[ancient Greece]], it has implications for the [[monotheism|monotheistic religions]] of today. "Is what is [[good and evil|morally good]] commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?"&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Leibniz stated, in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-010-1426-7_60#page-1 ''Reflections on the Common Concept of Justice''] (circa 1702):  "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a [[false dilemma]], and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.

==The dilemma==
Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's ''[[Euthyphro]]''. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious ([[:wikt:ὅσιος|τὸ ὅσιον]]) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods ([[:wikt:θεοφιλής|τὸ θεοφιλές]]), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).

At this point the [[dilemma]] surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very ''nature'' of the pious, but at most a ''quality'' of the pious (11ab).

==In philosophical theism==
The dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Leibniz]] presented this version of the dilemma: "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=516}}

Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar [[Terence Irwin]], the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2006}} More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in [[metaethics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.

=== God commands it because it is right ===

====Supporters====
The first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God ''because it is right'') goes by a variety of names, including [[intellectualism]], [[rationalism]], [[Moral realism|realism]], [[Natural law|naturalism]], and [[Moral universalism|objectivism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The [[Mu'tazilah]] school of [[Islamic theology]] also defended the view (with, for example, [[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Nazzam]] maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying),{{sfn|Wolfson|1976|p=579}} as did the [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] [[Averroes]].{{sfn|Hourani|1962|pp=13–40}} [[Thomas Aquinas]] never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue.{{sfn|Haldane|1989|p=40}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=I, pp. 553–556}} Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands,{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3057.htm#article2 57.2]}} with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of [[natural law]].{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=2a1ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2094.htm#article5 94.5]}} Thus he contends that not even God can change the [[Ten Commandments]] (adding, however, that God ''can'' change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal).{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=1a2ae [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2100.htm#article8 100.8]}} Among later [[Scholastics]], [[Gabriel Vásquez]] is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's.{{sfn|Pink|2005}}{{sfn|Irwin|2007|loc=II, pp. 6–10}} [[Early modern period|Modern]] natural law theory saw [[Grotius]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] also putting morality prior to [[Will of God|God's will]], comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarists]] like [[Pufendorf]] in philosophical controversy.&lt;ref&gt;See esp. {{harvnb|Grotius|1625|loc=1.1.10}} and {{harvnb|Leibniz 1702(?)}}; see also {{harvnb|Leibniz|1706|pp=64–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge Platonists]] like [[Benjamin Whichcote]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist [[metaethics]] of [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[Richard Price]];{{sfn|Gill|1999|loc=esp. pp. 272–74}}{{sfn|Mackie|1980|loc=Chapters 2, 8}}{{sfn|Gill|2011}} what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary [[Philosophy of religion|philosophers of religion]] who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include [[Richard Swinburne]]{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|pp=209–216}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}} and [[T. J. Mawson]]{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} (though see below for complications).

====Criticisms====

* [[Sovereignty]]: If there are moral standards independent of God's will, then "[t]here is something over which God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher. Moreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral standard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=247}} 18th-century philosopher [[Richard Price]], who takes the first horn and thus sees morality as "necessary and immutable", sets out the objection as follows: "It may seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally eternal and necessary."{{sfn|Price|1769|loc=Chapter 5}}
* [[Omnipotence]]: These moral standards would limit God's power: not even God could oppose them by commanding what is evil and thereby making it good.  This point was influential in Islamic theology: "In relation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|Ash'ari]] got rid of the whole embarrassing problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act as a standard for God's action."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=276}} Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]].{{sfn|Haldane|1989|pp=42–43}} As contemporary philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] puts the point, this horn "seems to place a restriction on God's power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and also] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to do what, independently of his will, is wrong."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}}
* [[Free will|Freedom of the will]]: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God's freedom of will: God could not command anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance with them.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} for a detailed discussion of this problem; also see {{harvnb|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6.22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Mark Murphy (philosopher)|Mark Murphy]] puts the point, "if moral requirements existed prior to God's willing them, requirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God's liberty would be compromised."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#2.1 Metaethical theological voluntarism: Considerations in Favor]}}
* [[Secular morality|Morality without God]]: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its authority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early modern political theorist [[Hugo Grotius]]: "What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him"{{sfn|Grotius|1625|loc=Prolegomenon, 11}} On such a view, God is no longer a "law-giver" but at most a "law-transmitter" who plays no vital role in the foundations of morality.{{sfn|Kretzmann|1999|p=423}} [[Nontheism|Nontheists]] have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming [[Argument from morality|moral arguments for God's existence]]: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the starting gate.{{sfn|Oppy|2009|pp=352–356}}

====Responses to criticisms====
Contemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a "subjective theory of value" that makes morality arbitrary.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=143–145}} They accept a theory of morality on which, "right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what ''anyone'' believes, wants, or prefers."{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=145–147}} They do not address the aforementioned problems with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of "maximal power", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not [[omnibenevolent]]). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.{{sfn|Hoffman|Rosenkrantz|2002|pp=166, 173–176}}

[[Richard Swinburne]] and [[T. J. Mawson]] have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to ''necessary'' moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still affect ''contingent'' moral truths.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 11}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008}} On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: "Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued."{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=210}} This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]]: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|p=192ff}} This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic.{{sfn|Swinburne|1993|loc=Chapter 9}}{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=217–222}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=26–29}} On the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|p=211}} Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners.{{sfn|Swinburne|1974|pp=211–215}}{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|pp=10–12}} Second, God can make an ''indirect'' moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.{{sfn|Swinburne|2008|p=10}}{{sfn|Mawson|2008|pp=29–32}}

===It is right because God commands it===

====Supporters====

The second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right ''because it is commanded by God'') is sometimes known as [[divine command theory]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]]. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by [[Duns Scotus]], who argued that not all [[Ten Commandments]] belong to the [[Natural Law]] in the strictest sense.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, "Do all the precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law?"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are [[Self-evidence|self-evident]], [[Analytic proposition|true by definition]], and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments "''are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotus|first1=John Duns|title=Selected Writings on Ethics|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967341-4|pages=Ordinatio III, D. 37, Q. UN, para. 25, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2013|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#NatLaw Ethics and Moral Psychology: The natural law]}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=312–316}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Cross|1999|p=92}} for the view that our duties to others "hold automatically [i.e., without God's commands] unless God commands otherwise."&lt;/ref&gt; Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that "those of weak character" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.

[[William of Ockham]] went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Quodlibeta'' 3.13&lt;/ref&gt; and even to ''hate'' God.&lt;ref&gt;William of Ockham. ''Reportata'' 4.16; see also {{harvnb|Osborne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Scholastics]] like [[Pierre D'Ailly]] and his student [[Jean Gerson|Jean de Gerson]] explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not "command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ailly, Pierre. ''Questions on the Books of the Sentences'' 1.14; quoted in {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}}, quoting Idziak 63–4; see {{harvnb|Wainwright|2005|p=74}} for similar quotes from Gerson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protestant]] reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that "for [God's] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it",{{sfn|Luther|1525|loc=§88}} and Calvin writing that "everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it."{{sfn|Calvin|1536|loc= 3.23.2}} The voluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by [[Descartes]], who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and that God was therefore capable of giving [[circles]] unequal [[radii]],{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 25}} giving [[triangles]] other than 180 internal degrees, and even making [[contradictions]] true.{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 235}} Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: "why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?"{{sfn|Descartes|loc=III 343}} [[Thomas Hobbes]] notoriously reduced the justice of God to "irresistible power"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "Of Liberty and Necessity" 12&lt;/ref&gt; (drawing the complaint of [[John Bramhall|Bishop Bramhall]] that this "overturns... all law").&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes. "A Defense of True Liberty", 12f&lt;/ref&gt; And [[William Paley]] held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested "urge" to avoid [[Hell]] and enter [[Heaven]] by acting in accord with God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, William. "Principles" 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's [[Ash'ari|Ash'arite theologians]], [[al-Ghazali]] foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view "was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization."{{sfn|Hourani|1960|p=270}}&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Frank|1994|pp=32–36}} for the view that al-Ghazali incorporated rationalist elements that moved him away from traditional Ash'arite voluntarism.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wittgenstein]] said that of "the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good", that which holds that "the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it" is "the deeper", while that which holds that "God wills the good, because it is good" is "the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as though' that which is good could be given some further foundation".&lt;ref name=Janik&gt;{{harvnb|Janik|Toulmin|1973|p=194}}. The passage is also quoted in {{harvnb|Baggett|2002|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).

====Criticisms====

This horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:

* No reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God's will, then God's commands are arbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based on reasons: "if theological voluntarism is true, then God's commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but] it cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some moral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining rather than another."{{sfn|Murphy|2012|loc=[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voluntarism-theological/#3.2 Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism: Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness]}} And as [[Michael J. Murray]] and [[Michael Rea]] put it, this would also "cas[t] doubt on the notion that morality is genuinely objective."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|pp=246–247}} An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain how true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by him.{{sfn|Doomen|2011}}
* No reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God's status as a [[Wisdom|wise]] and [[Rationality|rational]] being, one who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: "Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act."{{sfn|Leibniz|1686|loc=II}}
* Anything goes:{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} This arbitrariness would also mean that ''anything'' could become good, and ''anything'' could become bad, merely upon God's command. Thus if God commanded us "to gratuitously inflict pain on each other"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} or to engage in "cruelty for its own sake"{{sfn|Adams|1973}} or to hold an "annual sacrifice of randomly selected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged suffering for its victims",{{sfn|Morriston|2009|p=249}} then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher [[Ralph Cudworth]] put it: "nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.1.5}}
* Moral [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]: If morality depends on the [[Free will|perfectly free will]] of God, morality would lose its necessity: "If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves, then goodness can change [[Possible world|from world to world]] or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those who believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true."{{sfn|Murray|Rea|2008|p=246}} In other words, no action is necessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action which is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued that divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral [[supervenience]].{{sfn|Klagge|1984|pp=374–375}}
* Why do God's commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander has some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very commands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for God's commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his own will. As Cudworth put it: "For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of commanding others, and others {{sic}} obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own making, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in all laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer {{sic}} will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of the commander."{{sfn|Cudworth|1731|loc=1.2.4}} To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for creating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to our benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] writes: "Is the Reason exciting to concur with the Deity this, 'The Deity is our Benefactor?' Then what Reason excites to concur with Benefactors?"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1742|loc=I}} Or finally, one might resort to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s view: "The right of nature whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he required obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his ''irresistible power''."{{sfn|Hobbes|loc=31.5}} In other words, [[might makes right]].
* God's goodness: If ''all'' goodness is a matter of God's will, then what shall become of ''God's'' goodness? Thus [[William P. Alston]] writes, "since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to say that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he preaches, whatever that might be;"{{sfn|Alston|2002|p=285}} Hutcheson deems such a view "an insignificant [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], amounting to no more than this, 'That God wills what he wills.'"{{sfn|Hutcheson|1738|loc=2.7.5}} Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command theorists "deprive God of the designation ''good'': for what cause could one have to praise him for what he does, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?"{{sfn|Leibniz|1710|p=176}} A related point is raised by [[C. S. Lewis]]: "if good is to be ''defined'' as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is emptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as those of the 'righteous Lord.'"{{sfn|Lewis|1943|p=79}} Or again Leibniz: "this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the devil."{{sfn|Leibniz 1702(?)|p=561}} That is, since divine command theory trivializes God's goodness, it is incapable of explaining the difference between God and an all-powerful demon.
* The [[is-ought problem]] and the [[naturalistic fallacy]]: According to [[David Hume]], it is hard to see how moral propositions featuring the relation ''ought'' could ever be deduced from ordinary ''is'' propositions, such as "the being of a God."{{sfn|Hume|1739|loc=3.1.1.27}} Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral ''oughts'' from ordinary ''ises'' about God's commands.{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}} In a similar vein, [[G. E. Moore]] argued (with his [[open question argument]]) that the notion ''good'' is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] terms are guilty of the so-called "naturalistic fallacy."{{sfn|Moore|1903|loc=Chapters 1, 2, 4}} This would block any theory which analyzes morality in terms of God's will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that "when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the attitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever."{{sfn|Moore|1912|p=79}}
* No morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God's will, then if God does not exist, there is no morality. This is the thought captured in the slogan ([[q:Fyodor Dostoyevsky#The Brothers Karamazov (1879–1880)|often attributed to Dostoevsky]]) "[[The Brothers Karamazov|If God does not exist, everything is permitted.]]" Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for their view or a virtue of their view. [[Argument from morality|Many argue]] that morality does indeed require God's existence, and that this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist [[Robert Merrihew Adams]] contends that this idea ("that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God") is one that "will seem (at least initially) implausible to many", and that his theory must "dispel [an] air of paradox."{{sfn|Adams|1979|p=77}}

====Restricted divine command theory====

One common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between ''value'' and ''obligation''. Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a ''restricted'' divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the [[deontic]] region of obligation. This response is found in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s discussion of natural law and voluntarism in ''De legibus''{{sfn|Suárez|1872|loc=2.6 "Is the natural law truly a preceptive divine law?"}} and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1973}}, esp. p. 109 and {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=esp. p. 250}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip L. Quinn]],{{sfn|Quinn|2007|loc=esp. p. 71}} and William P. Alston.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=306–307}}

A significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=317–318}} God could not issue horrible commands: God's own essential goodness{{sfn|Wierenga|1983|p=397}}{{sfn|Quinn|2007|pp=81–85}}{{sfn|Alston|1990|p=317}} or loving character&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1979}}. In this early work, Adams's view is that it is logically possible but "unthinkable" that God would issue horrible commands: "the believer's concepts of ethical rightness and wrongness would break down in the situation in which he believed that God commanded cruelty for its own sake" (p. 324). In later work, Adams contends that "God ''cannot'' be sadistic" ({{harvnb|Adams|1999|p=47}}).&lt;/ref&gt; would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands.{{sfn|Adams|1999|pp=252–253}} These proposed solutions are controversial,&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms, see {{harvnb|Chandler|1985}}; {{harvnb|Morriston|2001}}; {{harvnb|Shaw|2002}}; and {{harvnb|Zagzebski|2004|pp=259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|pp=47–49}} on the problems of divine omnipotence and freedom of the will&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then on what ''does'' it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Adams|1999|loc=Chapter 1}}; {{harvnb|Quinn|2007}}; {{harvnb|Alston|1990}} distances himself from Platonism; see also {{harvnb|Kretzmann|1999|pp=375–376}} for a similar solution, put in terms of divine simplicity.&lt;/ref&gt; Alston offers the analogy of [[Metre#Prototype metre bar|the standard meter bar in France]]. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why ''God'' is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is "the end of the line," with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard.{{sfn|Alston|1990|pp=318–322}} On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's ''will'', it still depends on ''God'', and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.

This solution has been criticized by [[Wes Morriston]]. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those properties good because God has them?{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=253}} Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's essential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.{{sfn|Morriston|2001|p=266}}

Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]], disputing the perspective that "God is good" and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are "caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Practical Ethics|edition= 3d|last= Singer|first= Peter|year= 1993|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-43971-8|pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False dilemma===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like [[William James]]{{sfn|James|1891}} and Wittgenstein&lt;ref name=Janik/&gt; later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic [[abstract object|abstracta]] independently of God.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=186}} Classical [[Judaeo-Christian]] theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}} "The classical tradition," Rogers notes, "also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|2008|p=186}}; see also {{harvnb|Rogers|2000|pp=127–133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, "Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value."{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=8}}

====Jewish thought====
The basis of the false dilemma response—God's nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[prophet]]s, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], [[Hosea]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] and [[Isaiah]]. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before [[Thales]], traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) "Their message," writes British scholar [[Norman H. Snaith]], "is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=59}}. Written over many centuries by many authors, the Old Testament displays a marked ethical evolution in its portrayal&amp;nbsp;– and therefore understanding&amp;nbsp;– of God. In its earliest-written books, God appears at times as no more than a nationalistic tribal deity who orders the extermination of entire peoples hostile to Israel, such as the [[Midianites]] (Numbers 31: 1–54) and [[Amalekites]] (1 Samuel 15: 1–25). By the time of Amos, however, such "primitive and immature notions" are a thing of the past ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|loc=p. 52; see also pp. 61–62, 66–67}}). For a recent overview, see {{harvnb|Head|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; not least in its "special consideration for the poor and down-trodden."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snaith|1944|pp=68–69}}. It was this "bias towards the poor and needy" ({{harvnb|Snaith|1944|p=70}}) in the message of the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ that inspired the "[[preferential option for the poor]]" of late-twentieth-century Latin American [[liberation theology]].&lt;/ref&gt; As Snaith observes, ''tsedeq'', the Hebrew word for [[righteousness]], "actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land." This includes justice, but goes beyond it, "because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=70}} ''Tsedeq'' "is the norm by which all must be judged" and it "depends entirely upon the Nature of God."{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}

Hebrew has few [[abstract noun]]s. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=174}} In contrast to the Greek ''[[dikaiosyne|dikaiosune]]'' (justice) of the philosophers, ''tsedeq'' is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:
{{quote|''Tsedeq'' is something that happens here, and can be seen, and recognized, and known. It follows, therefore, that when the Hebrew thought of ''tsedeq'' (righteousness), he did not think of Righteousness in general, or of Righteousness as an Idea. On the contrary, he thought of a particular righteous act, an action, concrete, capable of exact description, fixed in time and space.... If the word had anything like a general meaning for him, then it was as it was represented by a whole series of events, the sum-total of a number of particular happenings.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|p=77}}}}
The Hebrew stance on what came to be called the [[problem of universals]], as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma.{{sfn|Snaith|1944|pp=9, 187–188}} This has not changed. In 2005, [[Jonathan Sacks]] wrote, "In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist."{{sfn|Sacks|2005|p=164}} Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as "misleading" because "it is not exhaustive": it leaves out a third option, namely that God "acts only out of His nature."{{sfn|Sagi|Statman|1995|pp=62–63}}

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Like [[Aristotle]], Aquinas rejected Platonism.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Metaphysics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics]'', Bk. 1, lectio 10, n. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness.{{sfn|McInerny|1982|pp=122–123}} On this analysis, the abstract "good" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, "Good is what all desire."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' 1.1; Aquinas, ''[http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/Ethics.htm Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics]'' 1, 9 and 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 5,1}} As he clarified, "When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 6,2 ad 2}} In other words, even those who desire evil desire it "only under the aspect of good," i.e., of what is desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on Aristotle's Ethics'' 1,10.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II q24, a2}}

Aquinas's discussion of [[sin]] provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. "Every sin," he writes, "consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I/II 72,2}} Thus, "in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge."{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc= I/II 58,2 and I/II 77,2}} "No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' 4,92.&lt;/ref&gt; God, however, has full knowledge ([[omniscience]]) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed&amp;nbsp;– for instance, by [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who wrote: "There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil"&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Nicolai. ''Ethik'' (3rd edition). Berlin, 1949, p. 378. Cited in {{harvnb|Pieper|2001|pp=78–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. [[Josef Pieper]], however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly [[anthropomorphic]] conception of God.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence,&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''[http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer.htm De Veritate]'' 24,3 ad 2.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a sign, of freedom (''quodam libertatis signum'').&lt;ref name=Ver22&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 22,6.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, "it does not belong to the [[essence]] of the free will to be able to decide for evil."&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''De Veritate'' 24,3 ad 2; ''Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard'' 2d,44,1,1 ad 1.&lt;/ref&gt; "To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom."&lt;ref name=Ver22/&gt; It is precisely humans' creatureliness&amp;nbsp;– that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient&amp;nbsp;– that makes them capable of sinning.{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=80}} Consequently, writes Pieper, "the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom&amp;nbsp;– contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue."{{sfn|Pieper|2001|p=79}} Pieper concludes: "Only ''the'' will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act"{{sfn|Aquinas c. 1265–1274|loc=I 63,1 }}{{sfn|Pieper|2001|pp=80–81}}&amp;nbsp;– and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.

====William James====
William James, in his essay "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: "Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}} Moral obligations are created by "personal demands," whether these demands&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gale|1999|p=44}}: In his essay, "James used 'desire', 'demand' and 'claim' interchangeably, using 'desire' and 'demand' each eleven times and 'claim' five."&lt;/ref&gt; come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that "ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well." However, whether "the purely human system" works "as well as the other is a different question."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section II}}

For James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls "the easy-going and the strenuous mood."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker's "various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value;&lt;ref&gt;James is acutely aware of how hard it is to "avoid complete moral skepticism on the one hand, and on the other escape bringing a wayward personal standard of our own along with us, on which we simply pin our faith." He briefly discusses several notions "proposed as bases of the ethical system", but finds little to help choose among them. ({{harvnb|James|1891|loc=Section III}})&lt;/ref&gt; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power." Our attitude is "entirely different" in a world where there are none but "finite demanders" from that in a world where there is also "an infinite demander." This is because "the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands", for in that case, "actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach." Even though "exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us", our postulation of him serves "to let loose in us the strenuous mood"{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} and confront us with an [[existential]]{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=40}} "challenge" in which "our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us."{{sfn|James|1891|loc=Section V}} In the words of Richard M. Gale, "God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably ''good''. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the ''Euthyphro''."{{sfn|Gale|1999|p=44}}

==In philosophical atheism==
===Atheistic resolutions===
[[Atheism]] challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed).  This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.

[[Secular humanism]] takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy.  Some secular humanists believe in [[ethical naturalism]], that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge.  Others have adopted [[moral relativism]] in the sense of [[meta-ethics]] – the idea that ethics are a [[social construct]] – but nonetheless by way of [[utilitarianism]] advocate imposing a set of [[moral universalism|universal ethics]] and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy.  These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: "Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?"

===Rejection of universal morality===
The other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by.  [[Moral nihilism]] challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely.  This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.

[[Moral relativism]] accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth.  This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws).  "Normative moral relativism" asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of [[religious pluralism]], strong [[relativism]] it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.

==In popular culture==
In the song "[[No Church in the Wild]]" from the album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', rapper [[Jay Z]] references the dilemma with the line, "Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? [[Socrates]] asked whose bias do y'all seek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-no-church-in-the-wild-lyrics#note-314340|title=Kanye West – No Church in the Wild Lyrics|accessdate = 5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In American legal thinking==

[[Yale Law School]] Professor [[Myres S. McDougal]], formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, "Do we protect it because it's a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Richard H. Stern]], [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/ScopeProtnProb.pdf  ''Scope-of-Protection Problems With Patents and Copyrights on Methods of Doing Business''], 10 {{smcaps|Fordham Intell. Prop., Media &amp; Ent.}} L.J. 105, 128 n.100 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'', 324 U.S. 499 (1945), Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] addressed whether there was a protectable property interest in a head of water lessened by federal action. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]ot all economic interests are "property rights;" only those economic advantages are "rights" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. ... We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a "property right;" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests.&lt;ref&gt;324 U.S. at 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's majority (per Justice Jackson) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. A dissenting opinion, however, considered that property rights existed ''a priori'' and that they dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.

{{nihongo|'''Gempō Yamamoto'''|山本玄峰|Yamamoto Genpō|1866-1961}} was the [[abbot]] of both [[Ryūtaku-ji]] and Shoin-ji in [[Japan]]—also serving temporarily as the head of the [[Myōshin-ji]] branch of [[Rinzai]] [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="victoria"&gt;Victoria, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
A renowned [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[calligrapher]], Yamamoto was a [[Rinzai]] [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] priest who followed in the footsteps of the famous Master [[Hakuin Ekaku]]. According to the book ''Zen and the Art of Calligraphy'', Yamamoto is sometimes called the "''twentieth century [[Hakuin]]''."&lt;ref name="terayama"&gt;Terayama, et al.; 113&lt;/ref&gt; Like so many prolific Zen masters throughout the ages, Yamamoto had no formal education. By today's standards Gempō would be deemed [[legally blind]], and it was not until later in life that he was able to write and read. At the age of 25 he became ordained as a [[monk]], travelling during this period to various temples throughout Japan. Yamamoto is probably most remembered for his many [[zenga]] paintings, which can be found hanging at Ryūtaku-ji today.

He also produced a number of [[Inuyama ware]].&lt;ref&gt;http://chiyodagarou.eshizuoka.jp/e1544239.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hakkutudou.com/shop/detail/8/stock/detail/7009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guðmundur Finnbogason (1934).jpg|thumb|Guðmundur Finnbogason (1934)]]
'''Guðmundur Finnbogason''' (June 6, 1873 – July 17, 1944)&lt;ref name="pind-2005-9-30"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 9, 30&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Iceland]]ic [[philosophy|philosopher]],  the son of Guðrún Jónsdóttir and Finnbogi Finnbogason.&lt;ref name="pind-2005-9"&gt;Pind (2005), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first Icelandic [[psychologist]]s.

==Career==
Guðmundur finished his studies at [[Lærði Skólinn]] in the spring of 1896. The same year, he began studying [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]; he graduated with a [[master's degree]] in psychology in 1901.&lt;ref name="pind-2005-10"&gt;Pind (2005), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Among his mentors were [[Harald Høffding]] and [[Alfred Lehmann]].&lt;ref name="pind-2005-12-13-15"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 12, 13 og 15&lt;/ref&gt; Lehmann had studied under [[Wilhelm Wundt]] in [[Germany]] and established a laboratory in Copenhagen in 1886.

During 1901 and 1902 Guðmundur traveled in Scandinavia and gathered information on teaching in these countries. The Icelandic national parliament, the [[Alþingi]], supported him. Based on this research, his first book, ''Lýðmenntun'' (People's education), was published in 1903. In it and a report to the parliament the same year, Guðmundur put forward his proposals for the education of children in Iceland.&lt;ref name="pind-2005-19-20-21"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 19, 20, 21&lt;/ref&gt; During 1903 and 1904, he traveled in Iceland to gather information on teaching in the country and then wrote another report to parliament. In 1907, a policy for teaching was agreed upon, largely based on Guðmundur's reports.&lt;ref name="pind-2005-22-23"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 and 1906, Guðmundur was the editor of ''[[Skírnir (journal)|Skírnir]]'' and also did some translation. Among others, he translated [[William James]]' lecture about human immortality and an article by [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref name="pind-2005-23-24"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 23, 24&lt;/ref&gt; He again served as editor of ''Skírnir'' from 1913 to 1920 and from 1933 to 1943.&lt;ref name="pind-2005-27"&gt;Pind (2005), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 to 1910 Guðmundur worked on his [[PhD]] thesis for the University of Copenhagen, titled ''Samúðarskilningurinn'' (Sympathetic understanding).&lt;ref name="pind-2005-24-25"&gt;Pind (2005), pp. 24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis defence]] took place in 1911,&lt;ref name="pind-2005-9" /&gt; and his book on the same topic, ''Hugur og heimur'' (Mind and the universe), was published in 1912.

During the same period as Guðmundur was completing and defending his thesis, the [[University of Iceland]] was founded and a professorship in philosophy was founded at the school. Guðmundur applied for the position, but [[Ágúst H. Bjarnason]] was appointed instead. Guðmundur became head of the [[National and University Library of Iceland|Icelandic National Library]].&lt;ref name="pind-2005-28"&gt;Pind (2005), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 he was appointed professor at the University, and served in that position until 1924, teaching [[applied psychology]] and performing experiments with students.

'''Iain Hamilton Grant''' is a senior lecturer at the [[University of the West of England]] in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]]. His research interests include [[ontology]], [[post-Kantian philosophy|European philosophy]], [[German Idealism]] (especially [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]), and both contemporary and [[Naturphilosophie|historical philosophy of nature]].&lt;ref name="UWE profile" /&gt; He is often associated with the recent philosophical current known as [[Speculative Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Speculative Realism in ''Collapse: Journal of Philosophical Research and Development'' (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2007), pp.306-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Grant was initially known as a translator of the prominent French philosophers [[Jean Baudrillard]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. His reputation as an independent philosopher comes primarily from his book ''Philosophies of Nature After Schelling'' (2006). In this book, Grant heavily criticizes the repeated attempts of philosophers to "reverse [[Platonism]]," and argues that they should try to reverse [[Immanuel Kant]] instead. He is highly critical of the recent prominence of [[ethics]] and the [[Philosophy of Life|philosophy of life]] in [[continental philosophy]], which in his view merely reinforce the undue privilege of human being. Against these trends, Grant calls for a renewed treatment of the inorganic realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=9663 |title=On an Artificial Earth: Philosophies of Nature after Schelling // Reviews // Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant views [[Plato]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] as his major allies among classic philosophical figures, and generally opposes both [[Aristotle]] and Kant for what he sees as their tendency to reduce reality to its expressibility for humans. Grant is also influenced by the French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]].

Grant wrote his PhD thesis on Kant and Lyotard in the Department of Philosophy at [[University of Warwick|Warwick University]]. Whilst at Warwick he was part of the [[Cybernetic Culture Research Unit]].

'''James M. Edie''' (November 3, 1927 – February 21, 1998) was an [[Americans|American]] philosopher.

==Life and career==
Edie was born in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]], [[North Dakota]].  He studied at [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John’s University]] in [[Minnesota]] and at the [[Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm]] [http://www.santanselmo.org/] in [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] before obtaining his doctorate in philosophy from the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]].

Over his career, Edie became an important figure in the publicizing and development of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] in North America.  He first taught philosophy for two years at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], [[New York State|New York]].  In 1961 Edie relocated to [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]], where he remained until his retirement, serving as Chair of the Philosophy Department from 1970 to 1977.  In 1962, along with  [[John Daniel Wild]], [[William A. Earle]], and others, he founded the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]] ([http://www.spep.org SPEP]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spep.org/Origins.html | title = The Origins of SPEP | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | last = Schrag | first = Calvin O |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080225235540/http://www.spep.org/Origins.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the Executive Committee of [http://www.iapl.info The International Association for Philosophy and Literature] for five years.

Edie was fluent in at least six languages.  He authored, co-authored, and edited a large corpus of academic papers and books during his career and, through his translations, introduced English readers to important works of contemporary continental philosophy.

James Edie died of cancer at his home in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiw.kuleuven.ac.be/eng/alumni/newslet8.pdf ''The Leuven Philosophy Newsletter'', vol. 8, 1999], Marquette U. Press, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Seeskin, "James M. Edie 1927-1998," ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', vol. 72, no. 2 (Nov/1998), pp. 119-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations from Edie's works==

===On his philosophical interests===
:"I studied, under my professors, a good deal of Husserl and his contemporaries but especially the ''Logical Investigations''.  It became clear to me, then, that the principal foci of my philosophical interests were in questions of epistemology and the philosophy of logic, broadly conceived. I had no more interest in the mathematization of formal logic, the creation of an "artificial language," than Husserl himself, but the study of the necessary formal constraints on thinking (and all the usages of language) together with the questions these imply whether in synchronic fact or diachronic history has monopolized my attention, almost to the exclusion of other questions.

:"It is said that one's self-presentation is rendered more palatable if one mentions some weaknesses.  Well, though I am not as apolitical as Husserl, nor, I hope, as lacking in common sense, questions of social and political philosophy, of value theory in general, and principally theoretical ethics leave me cold.  I once told a colleague, who was pressing me: if I ever write on ethical theory, it will be posthumously."

'''Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales''' or '''Jean-Baptiste Isoard de Lisle''' (29 April 1741 – 22 September 1816) was a [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]] noted for his multi-edition, multi-volume opus ''The Philosophy of Nature: Treatise on Human Moral Nature''.&lt;ref name="gerbi"&gt;{{citation|title=The Dispute of the New World: The History of a Polemic, 1750-1900|first1=Antonello|last1=Gerbi|first2=Jeremy|last2=Moyle|publisher=Univ of Pittsburgh Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8229-6081-2|pages=111–113}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Sales taught for the [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorians]] in [[Riom]] and [[Nantes]] until 1768, when he resigned to become an independent philosopher in Paris.&lt;ref name="israel"&gt;{{citation|title=Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights 1750–1790|first=Jonathan|last=Israel|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780191620041|pages=675–683|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOuSTyS2H7MC&amp;pg=PA675|contribution=The trial of Delisle de Sales (1775–1777)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His book
''The Philosophy of Nature'' was first published in 1770 and expanded over the years, supposedly going through seven editions and increasing in size to up to a dozen volumes. It has been described as "long-winded and conventional", a "hodgepodge of ideas".&lt;ref name="gerbi"/&gt;

De Sales challenged the [[young earth]] biblical 6,000-year-old date of creation which was popular in his day, instead believing on the basis of astronomical data that the earth was around 140,000 years old and that it took 40,062 years to cool down following its formation. He however rejected the three-million-year-old date of the earth which was taught in India at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Images of Savages: Ancient Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture|first=Gustav|last=Jahoda|authorlink=Gustav Jahoda|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415188555|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THl1iLw5gzMC&amp;pg=PA75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1776, a faction in the French court began a campaign against de Sales, as a way of attacking the French philosophical movement more generally. [[Voltaire]] championed his defense, but de Sales was imprisoned in March 1777 for publishing a book deemed to be anti-royalist, an event that brought his works out of obscurity.
De Sales became a supporter of the early philosophically-based stages of the [[French Revolution]], in 1789–1792. However, by 1794, feeling the Revolution had discarded its underlying principles, he returned to royalist sympathies, and was arrested for publishing anti-[[Jacobin]] works. Unlike many, he survived his arrest and the revolution.&lt;ref name="israel"/&gt;

Her book on [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''The Shadow of Death in the Work of Hans Holbein the Younger'' (1999) is considered a good book for scholarly audiences on the topic, according to the ''[[Library Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wkselman|first=Kathryn|date=May 2000|title=The Shadow of Death in the Work of Hans Holbein the Younger (Book Review)|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=3076040&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Library Journal|volume=125|issue=8|page=111|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwingenberger's exhibition "L'Homme-Paysage" at the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille]] (2006–07) presented an innovative display of works combining human figures with a landscape or environmental setting, reflecting the practice of 15th-century Renaissance artists but including more recent creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2007-01-04/Du-visage-au-paysage-depuis-la-Renaissance-_NP_-2007-01-04-280617|title=Du visage au paysage, depuis la Renaissance|author=Gignoux, Sabine|publisher=''La Croix''|date=4 January 2007|accessdate=24 April 2018 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to Information Ethics==
Weckert has contributed many ideas to Information Ethics, specifically relative to the relationship between the philosophical and applied sides of Information and Computer Ethics.

===Trust in an Online Environment===
Weckert has done extensive research on the idea of [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] within an online environment.  He sums up his theories in his 2005 article, "Trust in Cyberspace".&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ctools.umich.edu/access/content/group/aaaaaee7-1694-481e-95b6-090bdec54ec2/Required%20Readings/3%20Virtual%20Environments/Weckert%20Trust%20in%20Cyberspace%202005.pdf|title=Trust in Cyberspace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article, Weckert focuses on a few key issues regarding the concept of trust and if and when it may be possible in cyberspace. Trust has both cognitive and non-cognitive aspects: one may feel a certain way about another's trustworthiness without believing it in their mind. Trust opens one up to a degree of risk and is thus indispensable to friendship. Weckert opposes trust with monitoring by arguing that in order for trust to exist there must be limits on monitoring. He argues that a lack of community values or online social norms makes the internet less trustworthy but this obstacle may dissipate over time. He also addresses the hurdles that online anonymity and disembodiment put in front of online trust.

In terms of the effect trust has on the average person (or digital representation of a person) in an online environment, Weckert's ideas apply similarly.  He assesses some factors relevant to video gaming, where trust is often an issue, specifically when playing against human opponents.  In his 2005 article, he specifies some methods for obtaining online trust, and his second method focuses on how to do so in the context of e-commerce.  Near the end he mentions that developing trust in areas such as chat groups is not as much of a problem because not as much is at stake.&lt;ref name=ref2/&gt;  This is also true in some cases with respect to online gaming.  While gaming certainly does not place as much at stake as a financial transaction, players sometimes have a very strong connection to the game or some part of the game such as their avatar, and for this reason trust is an important factor for them within the game.

===Trust in Relation to Cheating===

Weckert's work with online trust also has significant implications on [[cheating]].  Due to the increased sense of community and closeness associated with the establishment of trust in an online environment, occurrences of cheating are likely to decline.  In Mia Consalvo's 2007 article on gaining advantages in video games, she states that one sense of cheating can be defined as "violating the spirit of the game."&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ctools.umich.edu/access/content/group/aaaaaee7-1694-481e-95b6-090bdec54ec2/Required%20Readings/3%20Virtual%20Environments/Consalvo%20Gaining%20Advantage%202007.pdf|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|title=Gaining Advantage in Videogames|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "spirit of the game" is less likely to be violated if each player in the virtual world has some type of trust that the others will respect the game in at least a similar sense to their own.  By definition, the spirit of the game would not be violated by the players (or at least minimally violated), therefore by definition this would mean that cheating would at least decline.

===Other Contributions===
In addition to his work related to trust, Weckert has contributed to many other areas within Information and Computer Ethics.  Recently, he has begun research on the application of the precautionary principle to nanotechnology.  This research involves a careful analysis of the real and potential risks of developments in nanotechnology, as well as an examination of just what the precautionary principle is.

==Publications==
Weckert has published both books and scholarly journal entries.  This is an abridged version of the list of his work, as he has contributed to many other publications including guest editorships, book chapters, conferences, talks, and professional magazines.&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cappe.edu.au/docs/staff-cvs/weckert.pdf|title=John Weckert's curriculum vittae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hayden Woods''' (born 1937) is a Canadian [[logician]] and [[philosopher]]. He currently holds the position of Director of the Abductive Systems Group at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) and is The UBC Honorary Professor of Logic. He is also affiliated with the Group on Logic, Information and Computation within the Department of Informatics at [[King's College London]] where he has held the Charles S. Peirce Visiting Professorship of Logic position since 2001.

Woods is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Life member of the Association of Fellows of the [[Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study]], and President Emeritus of the [[University of Lethbridge]].

Woods' education includes a B.A. and M.A. in [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Toronto]], and a 1965 Ph.D. in Philosophy from the [[University of Michigan]] where his adviser was [[Arthur Burks]].

Together with [[Doug Walton|Douglas Walton]], Woods has authored a number of books and papers on [[fallacies]]. According to [[Frans H. van Eemeren]], who calls this body of work the Woods-Walton approach, this is "the most continuous and extensive post-[[Charles Leonard Hamblin|Hamblin]] contribution to the study of fallacies".&lt;ref name="Eemeren2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. H. van Eemeren|title=Crucial concepts in argumentation theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpgfSPmaVFkC&amp;pg=PA154|year=2001|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5356-523-0|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[festschrift]] honoring and discussing Woods' work was published in 2005 by the [[University of Toronto Press]]. The book includes [[wikt:respondeo|respondeo]]s of Woods to the various papers contained in the book and a profile of Woods in the form of an introduction written by Kent Peacock and [[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]].&lt;ref name="IrvinePeacock2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

== Approach ==
Juniper holds that Buddhist ideas have enormous potential to benefit modern culture but, to do so, their religious and cultural wrapper must be removed so modern individuals can access these methods in a way that matches their sensibility and psychology. These methods must become integrated into modern culture just as they were in the cultures of India, China, Japan, Tibet and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniperpath.org/works/E67209/Heirs+To+Insight/ "Heirs to Insight: Assimilating Buddhist methods into Modern Culture"] Juniper Foundation (2009). p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[14th Dalai Lama|The 14th Dalai Lama]] acknowledged this principle when, in his book ''The Meaning of Life from a Buddhist Perspective'', he wrote 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to adopt the ''essence'' of Buddha's teaching, recognizing that Buddhism as it is practiced by Tibetans is influenced by Tibetan culture and thus it would be a mistake to try to practice a Tibetanized form of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama and Jeffrey Hopkins, ''The Meaning of Life from a Buddhist Perspective''. Snow Lion Publications 1992. p. 64. {{ISBN|978-0-86171-096-6}} &lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to adopt the essence of Buddha's teaching, recognizing that Buddhism as it is practiced by Tibetans is influenced by Tibetan culture and thus it would be a mistake to try to practice a Tibetanized form of Buddhism. By trying completely to Tibetanize your practice, in time there come to be difficulties, since such a system could not fit with your own mind and makes interaction with society difficult. Nowadays, some people are acting like Tibetans even to the point of keeping their heads down in an abject manner. Instead of copying such cultural forms, you should remain within your own cultural forms and implement Buddha's teaching if you find something useful and effective in it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Because Buddhist ideas value inquiry and critical thinking,&lt;ref&gt;H.H. the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso ''Path to Bliss: A Practical Guide to Stages of Meditation''. Snow Lion Publications 1991. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-937938-92-8}} "After all, the basic approach of the Buddhist is to subject concepts to rigorous logical processes, and if anything contradicts direct observation and logic, it should not be accepted just because it is taught in the sutras or the texts." 
Also, Ven. [[Soma Thera]], [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html ''Kalama Sutta: The Buddha’s Charter of Free Inquiry''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204141603/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html |date=2013-02-04 }}. accesstoinsight.org 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Juniper holds that we can apply these to build a bridge from ancient culture to modern life, one that is grounded in tradition but evolved to embrace discovery and modern social norms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniperpath.org/works/E67209/Heirs+To+Insight/ "Heirs to Insight: Assimilating Buddhist methods into Modern Culture"] Juniper Foundation (2009). p. 2. "We present here five principles we believe are necessary for the remarkable Buddhist system of inner development to take root and flourish in modern soil:
# Integrate science
# Integrate modern education
# Train gradually
# Provide equal opportunity
# Cultivate modern teacher relationships"
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lineage ==
Buddhist thought is not based on a centralized authority but is held in [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineages]]. Juniper's lineage is from an Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition dating back over two thousand years to the time of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]. This lineage passed through India and Tibet&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniperpath.org/works/E9A063/Awakening+the+Mind+%282nd+Ed.%29 "Awakening the Mind: An Introduction to Buddhist Training"]. Juniper Foundation (2009). pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and came to Juniper through its Brazilian born co-founder Segyu Choepel Rinpoche. In 1984, Segyu Rinpoche was recognized by the 98th [[Ganden Tripa]], the spiritual leader of the [[Gelug]] (Dge-lugs) school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], as a master and holder of a Gelug lineage known as the Segyu (Sed Gyued).&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Cottrell. [http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N56_4.html "A Precious Jewel for the East and West"] The Snow Lion Newsletter Fall, 2001. &lt;blockquote&gt;For those unfamiliar with the Segyu lineage, it was started by Jetsun Sherab Sengye at the request of the Great Lama Je Tsongkhapa near the end of his life in 1419. Je Tsongkhapa asked which of his disciples would preserve his Tantric teachings. One of his heart disciples, Jetsun Sherab Sengye, came forward to fulfill the request. With specific instructions from Je Tsongkhapa, Jetsun Sherab Sengye went to the 'Sed' district of the Tsang region of Tibet and established the Sed-Gyud Gaden Phodrang Monastery along with Dulnagpa Palden Zangpo in 1432. The Segyu monastery was the first Gelug Tantric College.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Segyu Rinpoche's primary teacher was [[Lati Rinpoche|Kyabje Lati Rinpoche]] (1922-2010), the former abbot of [[Ganden monastery|Ganden Shartse Monastery]], under whom Segyu Rinpoche received the full [[gelongma|gelong]] monastic ordination. For over twenty-five years Segyu Rinpoche studied under, and received initiations from, Kyabje Lati Rinpoche, Khensur Tara Tulku Rinpoche and other masters of the Gelug school.&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Cottrell. [http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N56_4.html "A Precious Jewel for the East and West"] The Snow Lion Newsletter Fall, 2001. "Venerable Segyu Rinpoche sought spiritual guidance from Venerable Gashar Khensur Lati Rinpoche and Venerable Gyuto Khensur Tara Tulku Rinpoche. Recognizing Venerable Segyu Rinpoche's gifts as a teacher and healer, they blessed him with many instructions about meditation practice."&lt;/ref&gt;  In tandem with his training, Segyu Rinpoche studied [[Traditional Tibetan medicine|Tibetan Medicine]], a tradition of healing that integrates the philosophy and practices of the Buddhist path. Through Segyu Rinpoche, Juniper works to pass the knowledge and methods of its lineage to others in a manner that propagates those methods in a secular form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juniperpath.org/works/E9A063/Awakening+the+Mind+%282nd+Ed.%29 "Awakening the Mind: An Introduction to Buddhist Training"].

'''Kenshō'''{{refn|group=note|{{CJKV|j=見性|t=見性|l=see [one's] [[Buddha-nature|nature]]{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=115}}}}}} (見性) is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term from the [[Japanese Zen|Zen tradition]]. ''Ken'' means "seeing," ''shō'' means [[Buddha-nature|"nature, essence"]].{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} It is usually translated as "seeing one's (true) nature," that is, the [[Buddha-nature]].

Kenshō is an ''initial'' insight or awakening, not full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=226}} It is to be followed by further training to deepen this insight, and learn to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida (translator)|1996}}{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}

The term kenshō is often used interchangeably with [[satori]], which is derived from the verb [[satoru]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A|p=88}} and means "comprehension; understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=&amp;eng=satori&amp;dict=edict Denshi Jisho – Online Japanese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Fischer-Schreiber, ''kenshō'' and ''[[satori]]'' are nearly synonymous, with a customary distinction of using ''kenshō'' for an initial enlightenment experience that still requires deepening, and ''satori'' for the [[Buddhahood]] enlightenment of a Buddha or Zen patriarch.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}} Hakuin uses the word "satori" for initial insight, synonymous with kensho.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Japanese Zen-tradition has a rich vocabulaire of terms related to "enlightenment": awakenening (''kaku''), true awakening (''shōgaku''), perfect awakening (''engaku''), insight (''sei''), attaining the Way (''jōdō''), becoming Buddha (''jōbutsu''), opening the eye (''kaigen''), liberation (''gedatsu''), aythetication (''shō''), the great death (''daishi''), self-enlightenment without a teacher (''mushi dokugo''), great satori with full penetration (''taigo tettei''), and peerless perfect enlightenment (''anokutara sanmyaku sanbodai'').{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} The list is not exhausted with these terms.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=90}} Another term for deep awakening is [[Daigo (Zen)|daigo]].}}

==Terminology==
The Chinese Buddhist term ''jianxing'' ({{zh|s=见性|t=見性|p=jiànxìng |w=chien-hsing}}) [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]]:
* ''jian'' [[wikt:見|見]] "see, observe, meet with, perceive";
* ''xing'' [[wikt:性|性]] "(inborn) nature, character, personality, disposition, property, quality,gender".

===History===
Buddhist monks who produced [[Chinese Buddhism#Early translation methods|Sanskrit-Chinese translations]] of sutras faced many linguistic difficulties:
* They chose Chinese ''jian'' 見 to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''dṛś'' [[wikt:दृश्|दृश्]] "see, look", and the central Buddhist idea of ''[[View (Buddhism)|dṛṣṭi]]'' [[wikt:दृष्टि|दृष्टि]] "view, seeing (also with the mind's eye), wisdom, false view".
* Translators used ''xing'' 性 or ''zixing'' 自性 "self-nature" for Sanskrit ''[[svabhava|svabhāva]]'' [[wikt:स्वभाव|स्वभाव]] "intrinsic nature, essential nature".
Thus, ''jianxing'' was the translation for ''dṛṣṭi-svabhāva'', "view one's essential nature".

The (c. 8th century) Chinese ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' (2, [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajñā]] "wisdom, understanding") first records ''jianxing''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hanyu Da Cidian]] 汉语大词典, vol. 10, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciations===
The [[Standard Chinese]] pronunciation ''jianxing'' historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] ''kien&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;sjäŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]] of this term exist:
* ''kenshō''  見性 or ケンショウ (''[[Kanji#On'yomi (Chinese reading)|on'yomi]]'') in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]
* {{Korean|hangul=견성|rr=gyeonseong}} in [[Sino-Korean vocabulary]]
* ''kiến tính'' in [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

==Meanings of kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhi|Wisdom in Buddhism{{!}}Prajna|Buddha-nature|Sunyata|Suchness|Dharmakaya|Alayavijnana}}

Translating ''kenshō'' into English is semantically complex.

===Encyclopedic and dictionary definitions===
Some encyclopedia and dictionary definitions are:
* Soothill (1934): "To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan (Zen) or Intuitive School."{{sfn|Soothill|1934|p=244}}
* Fischer-Schreiber (1991): Lit. "seeing nature"; Zen expression for the experience of awakening (enlightenment). Since the meaning is "seeing one's own true nature," ''kenshō'' is usually translated "self-realization." Like all words that try to reduce the conceptually ungraspable experience of enlightenment to a concept, this one is also not entirely accurate and is even misleading, since the experience contains no duality of "seer" and "seen" because there is no "nature of self' as an object that is seen by a subject separate from it.{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|1991|p=115}}
* Baroni (2002): "Seeing one's nature," that is, realizing one's own original Buddha Nature. In the Rinzai school, it most often refers more specifically to one's initial enlightenment attained through [[kōan]] practice.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}
* Muller (year unknown): To see one's own originally enlightened mind. To behold the Buddha-nature within oneself, a common saying of the Chan school, as seen for example, in the phrase 'seeing one's nature, becoming Buddha'  見性成佛.{{sfn|Muller|year unknown}}

===Definitions by Buddhist scholars===
Buddhist scholars have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* D.T. Suzuki: "Looking into one's nature or the opening of satori";{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-B|p=259}} "This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students 'satori' (''wu'' in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]]'')".{{sfn|Suzuki-1994-B|p=229}}{{refn|group=note|D.T. Suzuki has been criticized for his highly idealized and inaccurate picture of Japanese Zen.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi]] is the highest state of realization and awakening. Satori, or kensho, is a first glimpse into "nature", to be followed by further training.}}
* Dumoulin (1988/2005): "Enlightenment is described here as an insight into the identity of one's own nature with all of reality in an eternal now, as a vision that removes all distinctions. This enlightenment is the center and the goal of the Zen way. Hakuin prefers the term "seeing into one's nature", which for him means ultimate reality. The Buddha nature and the [[Dharmakaya|cosmic Buddha body]], wisdom (''prajna''), and emptiness (''sunyata''), [[Original face|the original countenance one had before one was born]], and other expressions from the rich palette of Mahayana terms were all familiar to him from his continued study of the sutras and [[Zen#Zen literature|Zen literature]]."{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}
* Peter Harvey (1990): "It is a blissful realization where a person's inner nature, the [[Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñāna|originally pure mind]], is directly known as an illuminating [[Sunyata|emptiness]], a [[Tathatā/Dharmatā|thusness]] which is dynamic and [[Five Ranks|immanent in the world]]."{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
* G. Victor Sogen Hori (2000): "The term consists of two characters: ''ken'', which means "see" or "seeing", and ''sho'', which means "nature", "character", "quality." To "see one's nature" is the usual translation for ''kensho''".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}}

===Definitions by Buddhist teachers and practitioners===
Buddhist teachers and practitioners have defined ''kenshō'' as:
* [[Jiyu-Kennett]]: "To see into one's own nature. The experience of enlightenment, satori."{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005b|p=263}}
* Myodo Ni Satomi, a student of [[Hakuun Yasutani]] (1993): "Seeing the-self, that is, the true self or Buddha nature."{{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=203}}

===Further notions===
The term ''kenshō'' refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and object in general,{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} but the term ''kenshō'' may also be applied in other contexts:{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} "How do you ''kenshō'' this?"{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}

''Kenshō'' is not a single experience, but refers to a whole series of realizations from a beginner's shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of emptiness equivalent to the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)#The first bhūmi, the Very Joyous|'Path of Seeing']] or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same 'thing' is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=31}}

"Kenshō" is commonly translated as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], a word that is also used to translate [[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], [[satori]] and [[buddhahood]]. Western discourse tends to use these terms interchangeably, but there is a distinction between a first insight, and the further development toward Buddhahood.

==Insight versus experience==
{{See also|Buddhist modernism|Transcendentalism|Perennial philosophy}}

Kensho is insight, an understanding of reality as-it-is.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}}{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b|p=380}}{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}} Contemporary understanding also describes kensho as an ''experience'', as in "enlightenment experience"; the term "enlightenment experience" is itself a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: "Kensho (enlightenment) is an enlightenment (kensho)-experience".

The notion of "experience" fits in a popular set of dichotomies: pure (unmediated) versus mediated, noncognitive versus cognitive, experiential versus intellectual, intuitive versus intellectual, nonrational versus rational, nondiscursive versus discursive, nonpropositional versus propositional.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}

The notion of ''pure experience'' (''junsui kuiken'') to interpret and understand kensho was introduced by [[Nishida Kitaro]] in his [[An Inquiry into the Good]] (1911), under influence of "his somewhat idiosyncratic reading of western philosophy",{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} especially [[William James]], who wrote [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]].{{refn|group=note|Victor Sogen Hori notes that Nishida Kitaro, although using a western terminology, tried to express basic Mahayana Teachings: "He borrowed, for example, the term, junsui keiken, "pure experience", from William James, but then went on to say that, while for James the individual preceded pure experience, for him, pure experience preceded the individual. That reversal makes Nishida’s notion of pure experience resemble less the psychology of William James and more the Mahayana notion of sunyata.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}}}} [[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for western interpretations and expectations regarding kensho, similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: "It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimization of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion."{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196-197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}} [[D.T. Suzuki]], who introduced Nishida Kitaro to western philosophy, took over this notion of ''pure experience'', describing it as the essence of all religions,{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=248}} but best represented in the [[Nihonjinron|superior Japanese culture and religion]].{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}

The influence of western psychology and philosophy on Japanese Buddhism was due to the persecution of Buddhism at the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the subsequent efforts to construct a [[Buddhist modernism|New Buddhism]] (''shin bukkyo''), adapted to the modern times.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=246-248}}{{sfn|Victoria|2006}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was this New Buddhism which has shaped [[Zen#Zen Narratives|the understanding of Zen in the west]],{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}} especially through the writings of D.T. Suzuki{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=247-248}}{{sfn|Borup|Year unknown}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and the [[Sanbo Kyodan]], an exponent of the Meiji-era opening of Zen-training for lay-followers.{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}

The notion of "experience" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that "experience" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995b}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: "[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience "altered states" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference pont for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the "path".{{sfn|Sharf|1995c|p=1}}}} The notion of "experience" introduces a false notion of duality between "experiencer" and "experienced", where-as the essence of kensho is the realisation of the "non-duality" of observer and observed.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=82}} "Pure experience" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what "experience" someone has, which means that this "experience" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by "cleaning the doors of perception"{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: "If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thru' narrow chinks of his cavern."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/2653 Quote DB]&lt;/ref&gt;}}, would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=284}}
The notion of "experience" also over-emphasises kensho, as if it were the single goal of Zen-training, where-as the Zen-tradition clearly states that "the stink of Zen"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=143}} has to be removed and the "experience" of kensho has to be integrated into daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}} In the Rinzai-school this post-satori training includes the study and mastering of great amounts of classical Chinese poetry, which is far from "universal" and culture-transcending. On the contrary, it demands an education in culture-specific language and behaviour, which is measured by specific and strict cultural norms.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=50-53}} Emphasising "experience" "reduces the sophisticated dialectic of Ch'an/Zen doctrine and praxis to a mere "means" or set of techniques intended to inculcate such experiences".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=266}}

==Kenshō "experiences"==

===Classical accounts===
The classical Zen-texts, such as the ''Kao-seng-chuan'' (Biographies of Eminent Monks) and the transmission lists, called "Transmission of the Lamp"{{refn|group=note|A literary device to establish a lineage.

The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Chinese: 碧巖錄 Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku) is a collection of 100 kōans compiled in 1125 by [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (圜悟克勤 1063–1135).}} contain accounts of "enlightenment experiences". These accounts are not verbatim recordings of such "experiences", but well-edited texts, written down decades or even decennia after the supposed sayings and meetings.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown}}

''The [[Denkōroku]]'', "The Record of the Transmission of the Light", written by [[Keizan Jōkin]] 瑩山紹瑾 (1268–1325), is an example of the "Transmission of the Lamp" genre. It contains literary accounts of the patriarchs of the Soto-lineage, from [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] to [[Koun Ejō]], in which kensho plays a central role. They are not to be taken as literal accounts of awakening, but as stories underpinning the legitimacy of the [[Sōtō|Dogen-shu]], which in its early history had seen a fierce internal conflict over the correct lineage during the [[Sandai sōron]].{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=xi-xii}}{{sfn|Faure|2000}}{{refn|group=note|Cook: "It is probably safe to say that few if any reputable modern scholars, and probably not many even within the Soto priesthood itself, believe that many of the central events and characters in the ''Denkoroku'' are based on historical fact [...] The origins and early developments of Chinese Zen are just now becoming clearer, and the gradually emerging picture is very different from the traditional Zen history found in such works as Keizan's record".{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=15}}}}

The Denkoroku gives the following account of Dogen's awakening:
{{quote|Once, during late-night zazen, [[Rujing]] told the monks, "Studying Zen is the dropping off of body and mind." Hearing this, the master was suddenly greatly awakened. He went at once to the Abbott's room and burned incense. Rujing asked him, "Why are you burning incense?" The master answered, "Body and mind have dropped off." Rujing said, "Body and mind have dropped off, the dropped-off body and mind." The master said, "This is a temporarily ability; you must not approve me without reason." Rujing replied, "I am not approving you without reason." The master asked, "Why are you not approving me without reason?" Rujing said, "You dropped off body and mind." The master bowed. Rujing said, "You have dropped off dropping off."{{sfn|Cook|2003|p=255}}}}

===Contemporary accounts===
Although the Zen tradition is reluctant to speak openly about the 'experience' of kensho,{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}} personal accounts can be found in Zen-texts.

[[Hakuin]] gives this description of his first kensho, when he was 21:{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|At around midnight on the seventh and final night of my practice, the boom of a bell from a distant temple reached my ears: suddenly, my body and mind dropped completely away. I rose clear of even the finest dust. Overwhelmed with joy, I hollered out at the tops of my lungs, "Old Yen-t'ou is alive and well! [...] After that, however, I became extremely proud and arrogant".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=23}}}}

Hakuin's ''kensho'' was not approved by Shoju Rojin, who subjected Hakuin to more koan-training. This resulted in a second kensho, where-after Hakuin left Shoju Rojin. It was only when he was 41 that he attained "his final great enlightenment":{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}
{{quote|[W]hen Shoju had asked his reason for becoming a monk, his reply – that he had done it because he was afraid of falling into hell – had brought the scornful retort: "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!" Not until eighteen years later, upon attainment of his final great enlightenment at the age of forty-one, would Hakuin fully grasp the significance of Shoju's reproach and with it the true meaning of "post-satori" practice. Years later, when Hakuin asked his student Torei the same question, Torei's answer – "To work for the salvation of my fellow beings" – brought a laugh from Hakuin. "A much better reason than mine", he said.{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxii}}}}

Keido Fukushima, a 20th-century Rinzai abbott, gives the following description:
{{quote|At Nanzenji there is a small hill. I used to walk near there, look at it, and often smile at the high school students who walked by there as well. One day as I walked by, I looked at the hill and it was truly amazing. i was totally lost as if there was no 'me'. I stood gazing at the hill. Some students walked by and one of them said something like 'look at that crazy monk'. Finally I came out of it. Life was never the same for me. I was free.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Harris: "After this experience Gensho still had two more years of ''koan'' study".{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=17}}}}}}

Other accounts can be found throughout the Zen-literature.{{refn|group=note|Kapleau gives ten different accounts of contemporary practitioners, including his own kensho under the initials "KP".{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}} Sekida gives an elaborate account of his own kenshos,{{sfn|Sekiad|1985|p=207-222}} and gives various accounts of others.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|194-206}} Satomi gives an account of becoming one with the mu-koan, the classical aimed kensho of the Sanbo Kyodan.{{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=106}} Maura O'Halloran also gives an account of herself becoming mu.{{sfn|O'Halloran|2007|p=78}}}}

===Spontaneous kenshō===
Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher. For example, Richard Clarke (1933), who studied with [[Philip Kapleau]], states that he had a spontaneous kensho when he was 13.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.payer.de/neobuddhismus/neobud040421.htm Japanischer Buddhismus in Amerika. Chronik Ab 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Genpo Merzel]] states he had what he described as an "awakening experience" in 1971:&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo&gt;[http://www.kripalu.org/article/313/ Big Mind: An Interview with Genpo Roshi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701071517/http://kripalu.org/article/313/ |date=2014-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was in February of that year, and I was 26 years old. My second serious relationship was ending, and I was feeling very confined and conflicted. I needed to get some space, so I went out to the Mojave desert for a three-day camping weekend with two friends. On the Friday, I hiked up a mountain alone. I knew nothing about meditation or spiritual practice. I was just sitting there, thinking about my life and the things going on. I felt I had gotten pretty screwed up for such a young age.&lt;br/&gt;
I could see my VW camper, my home for the weekend, parked a few miles away, . But at the same time, I was aware that my home was back in Long Beach, California. And a natural koan came to me: Where is home? All of a sudden, I had a kind of breakthrough. I felt myself fall away, and I became one with the cosmos, one with the universe, one with all things. I knew in that moment that wherever I am, that is home; home is everywhere. I also knew who I was, beyond description, but let’s call it Big Mind.&lt;br/&gt;
That experience completely changed my life.&lt;ref group=web name=Genpo /&gt;}}

More descriptions of "spontaneous kensho" can be found throughout the Zen-literature,{{refn|group=note|Sekida gives the example of a woman, who's "strong internal pressure (''gidan'') never stopped knocking from within at the door of her mind, demanding to be resolved [...] One day, when she was about to take a bath, a certain change occurred in her. Although this was later confirmed as kensho by a teacher, she had no idea what it was.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} Philip Kapleau describes a man who had kensho, which was explained as a "conversion experience" by psychiatrists.{{sfn|Kapleau|1980|p=52}} Flora Courtois gives an extensive account of her spontaneous kensho,{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=111-136}} on which Yasutani comments.{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=137-140}}}} while a classic example may be [[Ramana Maharshi#Awakening|Ramana Maharshi]]'s awakening.

==Training towards kenshō==
{{See also|Zen#Zen practice|l1=Zen practice}}

According to Harris, working towards kensho is usually a lengthy process stretched out over years or even decades.{{sfn|Harris|2004}} Contrary to this, Victor Hori notes that with koan-study kensho may appear within six months.
{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|Houn Jiyu-Kennett, a western [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|sei-kyoshi]]{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=66}} or soto-priest, also is reported to have attained kensho after six months of tarining in a Soto-monastery.{{sfn|Bluck|2006|p=65}}}}

[[Sōtō]] tends towards a gradual approach, preferring to let the experiences happen on their own. [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] tends toward the use of [[Koan]]s as a technique to unroot the habitual workings of the mind.{{sfn|Kasulis|2003}}

During intensive zazen various [[hallucination]]s and psychological disturbances may arise. These are referred to as [[makyo]]. Distinguishing these delusions from actual kensho is the primary function of the teacher, as the student may be erroneously convinced they have realized kensho.

===Rinzai===
In the [[Rinzai school]], kensho is seen as indispensable:
{{quote|At some point in time we pass from imprisonment in ignorance and delusion to a true vision of Zen realization: "Our enlightenment is timeless, yet our realization of it occurs in time." According to this belief experiencing a moment of awakening in this life is of central importance.{{sfn|Lachs|2012|p=4}}}}

In the Rinzai-training, the student is expected to pour oneself totally into both koan-study and daily activities 'to become one' with it.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=290}} Kenshō is used to describe the first breakthrough in [[kōan]] study.{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=188}}{{refn|group=note|See {{sfn|Satomi|1993|p=106}} for a description of 'becoming one with'.}}

===Sōtō===
In the [[Sōtō]] school there are two kinds of awakening.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} One is the practice of [[shikantaza]], which is the "actual enlightened activity of the Buddha".{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28}} The other is the accumulation of little bits of understanding, which come together, giving way to a deeper intuitive knowledge.{{sfn|Warner|2009|p=28-29}}

The "[[Genjōkōan|genjo-koan]]", or the "koan of everyday life" which "appears naturally in daily life",{{sfn|Dogen|year unknown}} is emphasized. Students are not encouraged to actively seek out kenshō experiences. In Sōtō practice kenshōs "are allowed to occur naturally, as a by-product of practice. Meditative training is seen as the unfolding of one great ''kenshō'':{{sfn|Harvey|1990|p=275-276}}
{{quote|According to the tradition of Soto Zen, although working on a koan is one way of attaining kensho, the best way is zazen. Indeed, [[Dogen]], the founder of Soto Zen, expounded that zazen itself is enlightenment, and as long as the adept maintains a pure state of non-thinking in Zen, he is a Buddha.{{sfn|Kit|2002|p=145}}}}

===Sanbō Kyōdan===
Kenshō also plays a central in the [[Sanbō Kyōdan]], a Japanese Zen organisation which played a decisive role in the transmission of Zen to the [[Zen in the United States|United States]].{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}} Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, was disappointed about the lack of interest in kensho in the Soto school. Yasutani's emphasis on koan training and the importance of kensho was transmitted to his American students:{{sfn|Sharf|1995c}}
{{quote|He was especially vocal concerning the point of kenshō, seeing one's true nature. He spoke more openly about it then anyone of his times, going so far as to have a public acknowledgement of those who had experienced kensho in a post-sesshin ceremony of bowing in gratitude to the three treasures.{{sfn|Jaffe|1979}}}}

It is also reflected in the inclusion of a relative great amount of kensho stories in "The Three Pillars of Zen", written by [[Philip Kapleau]], a student of Yasutani.{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}

==Training after kenshō==
{{See also|Bodhicitta|Karuṇā|Ten Bulls|Sahaja}}

Zen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life.{{sfn|Sekida|1996}}{{sfn|Kapleau|1989}}{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=91}}{{sfn|Maezumi|2007|p=54, 140}} According to the contemporary Chan Master [[Sheng Yen]]:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a [[Buddhahood|full Buddha]].{{sfn|Yen|1996|p=54}}}}

And the contemporary western Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett:
{{quote|One can easily get the impression that realization, kenshō, an experience of enlightenment, or however you wish to phrase it, is the end of Zen training. It is not. It is, rather, a new beginning, an entrance into a more mature phase of Buddhist training. To take it as an ending, and to "dine out" on such an experience without doing the training that will deepen and extend it, is one of the greatest tragedies of which I know. There must be continuous development, otherwise you will be as a wooden statue sitting upon a plinth to be dusted, and the life of Buddha will not increase.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|2005|p=225}}}}

To deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by [[Linji Yixuan]] in his [[Linji Yixuan#Three Mysterious Gates|Three mysterious Gates]], the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]],{{sfn|Low|2006}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]]{{sfn|Mumon|2004}} which detail the steps on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Path]].

===Seitai choyo===
Post-awakening practice is called ''seitai choyo'', the "long nurturing of the sacred fetus".{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kraft, one of the earliest expressions of this term is found in a 5th-century Chinese translation of the ''Prajnaparamitra Sutra on Benevolent Kings Protecting Their Countries''.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} In Chán-texts the term is first used by [[Mazu Daoyi|Mazu]] (709-788), and in Japan it was introduced by [[Dogen]] who learned it from his teacher T'ien t'ung Ju-ching (1163-1228).{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41}} See also Muso Soseki, ''Dialogues in a Dream translation'', translated by Thomas Yuho Kirchner, for its meaning and application.}} According to Spiegelberg,
{{quote|[I]t means a return to the purely secular life, a complete submersion in work and in the changing events of the world. Thus, for decades, many Zenists, after their awakening, went among the people, living among beggars and leading an existence of hard physical labor. Thus it was proved whether or not the truth received was of permanent value, or whether it would vanish among mundane affairs.{{sfn|Spiegelberg|1957}}}}

During the T'ang-era, the term became associated with the ideal of the recluse who leaves the world.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=41-42}} An ideal period of "twenty years" was taken for it, echoing a story from the ''Lotus Sutra'' about a prodigal son who wandered in poverty for twenty years before returning home.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} References to these twenty years are found throughout the Chán-tradition, for example Linji, who is reported to have studied under Huang-po for twenty years,{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}} and Daito, the founder of [[Daitoku-ji]], who famoulsy spent twenty years living under a bridge with beggars.{{sfn|Kraft|1997|p=42}}

===Cultivating bodhicitta===
According to Hakuin, the main aim of [[Dharma transmission#Further practice|"post-satori practice"]]{{sfn|Waddell|2004|p=xxv-xxvii}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Hisamatsu|2002|p=22}} (''gogo no shugyo''{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=145}} or ''kojo'', "going beyond"{{sfn|Hori|2006|p=144}}) is to cultivate the [[Bodhicitta|"Mind of Enlightenment"]],{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=33}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}} "benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching".{{sfn|Hakuin|2004|p=34}}{{refn|group=note|Shinkichi Takahashi: "After satori, teach."{{sfn|Takahashi|2000|p=165}}}} According to [[Yamada Koun]], "if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho".{{sfn|MacInnes|2007|p=75}} And according to Barry 
{{quote|Post-satori practice for Hakuin meant finally ceasing to be preoccupied with his own personal condition and attainment and to devote himself and his practice to helping and teaching others. Finally, at long last, he realized that true enlightenment is a matter of endless practice and compassionate functioning, not something that occurs once and for all in one great moment on the cushion.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://buddhism.about.com/od/enlightenmentandnirvana/a/What-Is-Enlightenment.htm Barbara O'Brien, ''What Is Enlightenment? And How Do You Know When You've "Got" It?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also Katsuhiro Yoshizawa, ''The Religious Art of Zen Master Hakuin'', pp.41-45, "Constant practice of the Four Universal Vows".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41-45}}}}}}

===Further practice===
One also has to purify oneself by ongoing practice,{{sfn|Low|2006|p=33-34}}{{sfn|Glassman|2007|p=54}} since 
{{quote|Kensho does not eradicate our unhealthy habits [...] There is a sudden awakening to the fact of "no-self" and then this insight has to be integrated into one's life which means that it has to be embodied and not just be a memory.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/online-retreats/great-heart-zen/entering-heart-zen Gerry Reply by Gerry Shishin Wick]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And "experience" has to be supplemented by intellectual understanding and study of the Buddhist teachings;{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=295-297}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35-37}}{{sfn|Kim|2007|p=115}} otherwise one remains a ''zen temma'', a "Zen devil".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=297}} Finally, these efforts are to result in a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=37-39}}

==Sudden insight==
{{Main|Subitism}}

Kenshō is described as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Sudden and gradual|appearing suddenly]], upon an interaction with someone else, at hearing or reading some significant phrase, or at the perceiving of an unexpected sound or sight.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005b}} The idea of "sudden insight" has been [[Chinese Chán#Shenhui and Huineng|hotly debated]] in the history of Zen. It became part of the [[Zen#Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN)|Traditional Zen Narrative]] in the 8th century.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

[[Jinul|Chinul]], a 12th-century Korean Seon master, emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. The contemporary Korean Seon master [[Seongcheol]] opposed this, emphasizing [[Seongcheol#Sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation|"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation"]]. But Jiyu-Kennett, a contemporary western teacher, warns that attaining kenshō does not mean that a person is free from morality, the laws of karma, or the consequences of ones actions.{{sfn|Jiyu-Kennett|1979|p=51}} This warning is reflected in the [[Wild fox koan]].

==Mushi-dokugo and mushi-dokkaku==
{{Main|Mushi-dokugo}}

Kenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher,{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=138-139}} as in the case of [[mushi-dokugo]]{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=48}} or (mushi-)dokkaku, a self-awakened [[pratyeka-buddha]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf Kyosho. The Awakening Gong. No.350, September/October 2011. Pages 14-15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628090745/http://www.sanbo-zen.org/kyosho_350_e.pdf |date=2013-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the literal meaning is self-awakened, or awakened on one's own, the emphasis in Zen, when using these terms, lies in the ultimate reliance on one's own insight, instead of the authority of a teacher:
{{quote|It is awakening that is one's true master.  With Shakyamuni, the awakening was his master.  In other words, the awakened self is one's master.  Apart from getting awakened to that master, there is no awakening.  Here practitioner and master are of one body, not two.  Instead of having another verify or confirm one's awakening, one does so for oneself.  Of course in this case the self that is verified and the master who does verification are undivided.  In their being completely identical is the autonomous, independent, or ultimate nature of the authenticity.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.fas.x0.com/writings/hisamatsu/onmutuallygoingintothematterofself.htm Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, ''On Mutually Going Into The Matter Of Self'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Similarities with other traditions==
While the Japanese term "kenshō" is generally used by practitioners of Zen Buddhism, the insight it refers to is not limited to Japanese Zen Buddhism, or even to Buddhism in general.{{sfn|Lathouwers|2000}}{{sfn|Grimstone|1985|p=13}}

===Theravada===
{{Main|Theravada|Vipassana|Vipassana movement}}

The [[Theravada]] tradition, which is best known in the west through the modern [[Vipassana movement]], discerns [[four stages of enlightenment]], in which [[Nirvana]] is being reached in four succeeding sudden steps of insight.

===Dzogchen===
{{Main|Dzogchen|Rigpa}}

The Dzogchen-traditions states that the ultimate nature of all sentient beings is ''pure, all-encompassing, primordial awareness'', or ''naturally occurring timeless awareness''. This intrinsic awareness has no form of its own, and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. It does so without being affected by those forms in any ultimate, permanent way.

The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. [[Rigpa]] is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity,{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}} which cannot be found by searching nor identified.{{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} One ''knows'' that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=144-145}}

===Advaita Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Advaita}}

In Advaita Vedanta [[moksha]] is attained by [[jnana]], insight-knowledge. In [[Shankaracharya|Shankara's]] philosophical synthesis insight [[samadhi]] is used as a subsidiary to this goal. [[Swami Vivekananda]] emphasized the ''experience'' of nirvikalpa samadhi as a means to validate religious, transcendental knowledge.{{sfn|Comans|1993}}

This is a list of popular culture examples of the [[Ship of Theseus|Theseus paradox]] that are not covered in the main article.



==Books==

===Nonfiction===

The French critic and essayist [[Roland Barthes]] refers at least twice to a ship that is entirely rebuilt, in the preface to his ''Essais Critiques'' (1971) and later in his ''Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes'' (1975); in the latter the persistence of the form of the ship is seen as a key structuralist principle. He calls this ship the ''[[Argo]]'', on which Theseus was said to have sailed with Jason; he may have confused the ''Argo'' (referred to in passing in Plutarch's ''Theseus'' at 19.4) with the ship that sailed from Crete (''Theseus'', 23.1).

In the book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' [[Douglas Adams]] discusses the [[Kinkaku-ji|Gold Pavilion Temple]] in Kyoto, which is an example similar to the Shinto shrine (discussed in the main article), and realised the following: 
:"The idea of the building, the intention of it, its design, are all immutable and are the essence of the building. The intention of the original builders is what survives. The wood of which the design is constructed decays and is replaced when necessary. To be overly concerned with the original materials, which are merely sentimental souvenirs of the past, is to fail to see the living building itself."

Theseus's paradox bears also on the question of virtual human identity discussed in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s and [[Daniel Dennett]]'s ''[[The Mind's I|The Mind's I: Fantasies and reflections on self and soul]]'' (1981). Speculations concerning [[Mind uploading#Issues|mind uploading]] suggest it is possible to transfer a human mind from an organic brain to a computer, incrementally and in such a way that consciousness is never interrupted, e.g. by replacing neurons one by one with electronics designed to simulate the neurons' firing patterns. Yet the result of this process is an object entirely physically distinct from the starting point.

The [[Talmud]] presents the paradox with three practical implications to Jewish law, and concludes that it is indeed considered as if it was a different object.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 24a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiction===

In the [[Oz books]] by [[L. Frank Baum]], the lumberjack [[Tin Woodman|Nick Chopper]]'s axe chopped off all his limbs one by one, and each time a limb was cut off, a smith made him a mechanical one, finally making him a torso and a head, thus turning him into the [[Tin Woodman]], an entirely mechanical being, albeit possessing the consciousness of the lumberjack he once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum |first=L. Frank |authorlink=L. Frank Baum |others=Denslow, W. W., illus. |title=[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] |chapter=Chapter 5 |chapter-url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz/Chapter_5 |accessdate=2008-10-28 |year=1900 |publisher=Geo. M. Hill |location=Chicago, New York |oclc=4051769}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Tin Woodman of Oz]] he seeks out his old girlfriend, to find that she has married Chopfyt, who was created partly from the leftover parts of Nick Chopper.

In the novel ''[[John Dies at the End]]'' the starting chapter presents the experiment as a riddle with an axe that has its handle and its head replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = John Dies at the End|last = Wong|first = David|publisher = Permuted Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0978970765|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Discworld]] series by [[Terry Pratchett]]:
* In ''[[The Fifth Elephant]]'', the dwarfish king compares changing a society's laws or customs to replacing components in an ancestral axe. 
* In ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', there are numerous references to the supposed inability of witches and wizards to cross the same river twice. The River Ankh in the city of Ankh-Morpork is the only river that is possible to cross twice because it is polluted and slow-moving to the point of being solid. The wizards refute this by demonstrating that an agile wizard can cross and recross a small river many times an hour. 
* Senior witch Granny Weatherwax possesses a flying broom whose handle and bristles have been replaced many times, yet remains unreliable to the point that she has to run up and down very quickly to essentially "bump-start" it. 
* Pratchett also directly references the paradox in ''[[The Bromeliad]]'' and ''[[The Carpet People]]''.

The short story ''[[The Man That Was Used Up]]'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] is about a man who reconstructs himself after going through a war.

[[Robert Graves]] employs the "grandfather's axe" version of the paradox in his historical novel, ''The Golden Fleece'', first published in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graves | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Golden Fleece | publisher = Hutchinson | year = 1983 | location = London| page = 445 | url = | isbn = 0-09-151771-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'' applies this to humanity; the title character being a robot gradually rebuilt by prostheses intended for humans. When contrasted with a human who has been "rebuilt" by the same prostheses, the question of the distinction between man and robot is explored.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cartesian Philosophy and the Flesh: Reflections on Incarnation in Analytical Psychology|last = Gray|first = Frances|publisher = Routledge|year = 2013|isbn = 9780415479363|location = |pages = 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1986 book ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], the ancient robot [[R. Daneel Olivaw]] says that over the thousands of years of his existence, every part of him has been replaced several times, including his [[brain]], which he has carefully redesigned six times, replacing it each time with a newly constructed brain having the positronic pathways containing his current memories and skills, along with free space for him to learn more and continue operating for longer.

[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] series by [[Douglas Adams]] makes continuing sport of classic paradoxes. In the trilogy's fourth book [[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]], [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] says of himself: "Every part of me has been replaced at least fifty times..." (except for the diodes down his left side, which hurt). In the sixth book of [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|the series]], character [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] has had so many body parts and functions replaced by technology that she doubts she is still the same person, referring to her present self as New Trillian and the past as Old Trillian.

Japanese manga and animated series [[Ghost in the Shell]] cyclically returns to this paradox of a "human" in which people often have their organic body parts replaced by artificial parts, sometimes going so far as to have their entire body replaced with a prosthetic one, leaving the brain as the only remaining original part.

The plot of the [[James Blish]] novel "[[Spock Must Die!]]" hinges on this philosophical dilemma.

In [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]]' interstellar sci-fi novel [[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]], the crew's ship is called Theseus.  It features technology to create and replace its own parts when broken, and can heal and replace crew members' organs and tissue when they are injured.

Likely hinted at in the Star Wars Legends novel ''[[Bloodlines (Star Wars novel)|Bloodlines]]'' by [[Karen Traviss]].  In the book, [[Boba Fett]] notes that the only original part of his ship [[Slave I]] that survives from his father's days was the pilot's chair.

In the 2017 book Run Program, by [[Scott Meyer (author)|Scott Meyer]], when trying to trick the [[artificial intelligence]] which is the main antagonist of the story, one of the characters references the Ship of Theseus.  When his reference can't be adequately explained, another character poses a thought experiment involving the transporters in [[Star Trek]].  She says when people use the transporter, a copy of themselves is made in the new location and the original is killed by the machine.

In [[Michael C. Rea|Michael Rea]]'s ''Material Constitution'', there is a scenario in which Socrates and Plato exchange the parts of their carriages one by one until, finally, Socrates's carriage is made up of all the parts of Plato's original carriage and vice versa. The question is whether, or at what point, they exchanged their carriages.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cannon Rea (editor), ''Material Constitution: A Reader'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, p. 210, {{ISBN|978-0847683833}}&lt;/ref&gt; This thought experiment is "a model for the philosophers": some say, "it remained the same," others say, "it did not remain the same".&lt;ref&gt;Rea, M., 1995: "The Problem of Material Constitution," The Philosophical Review, 104: 525-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hans Moravec]]'s ''Mind Children'', an example of [[mind uploading]] is given - a human brain is replaced a single neuron at a time by a nanorobot and computer that perfectly simulates the behaviour of the neuron and its neurotransmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence|last = Moravec|first = Hans|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 978-0674576186|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The end result is a completely digital copy of brain in simulation. However, there are other factors such as the fact that the intricate [[Neuroplasticity|structure of the brain is changing]] as the brain learns, so a simulated brain may not learn the same way.

In ''The Three Basic Facts of Existence'', Piyadassi Thera uses the teachings of [[Dharma]] to suggest that nothing in the universe is ever the same:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Three Basic Facts of Existence: I. Impermanence (Anicca)|url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel186.html|website = www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"The same man cannot step twice into the same river; for the so called man who is only a conflux of mind and body, never remains the same for two consecutive moments".

In Johann A. R. Roduit's poem '[https://www.academia.edu/28384305/Flesh_and_Foil Flesh &amp; Foil]', the imagery of the Ship of Theseus is used to illustrate the consequences [[Human enhancement|human enhancements]] could have on someone's physical body.&lt;ref&gt;JAR Roduit.

==Television series==

In the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' episode "[[Heroes and Villains (Only Fools and Horses)|Heroes and Villains]]", the road sweeper [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]] declares he has won an award for keeping the same broom for 20 years — "17 new heads and 14 new handles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Heroes and Villains|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/onlyfools/quotes/quote11.shtml|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Doctor Who Heaven Sent: your questions answered and that tricksy plot explained|url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-28/doctor-who-heaven-sent-your-questions-answered-and-that-tricksy-plot-explained|website = RadioTimes|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 documentary series ''[[Curiosity (TV series)|Curiosity]]'', an episode entitled "Can You Live Forever?", elaborates on the concept of replacing the human body, piece by piece. Adam Savage, the episode's host, presents the audience with several plausible scenarios.

In ''[[An Idiot Abroad]]'', [[Karl Pilkington]] ruminates over the restoration done to the [[Great Wall of China]] after discovering monkey bars that had been installed in the tourist area. Pilkington decides that the wall isn't very impressive because "it's not even the same bloody wall is it?"

=== Science fiction ===
In the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[The Six Million Dollar Mon]]," accountant [[Hermes Conrad]] replaces his body parts one by one with robotic ones. [[Zoidberg|Dr. Zoidberg]] requests to keep the discarded body parts, fashioning them into a [[marionette]] of Hermes, which he uses for a [[Stand-up Comedy|stand-up]] routine. When Hermes goes to replace his brain with a [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Roberto|robotic]] one, Zoidberg puts the old brain into his marionette body, bringing Hermes back to life as his old self and leaving his previous body to be taken over by the new brain.

In ''[[Star Trek]]'':
* In the episode "[[Life Support (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Life Support]]" of the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' series, the complete replacement of the brain is considered the destruction of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Life_Support_%28episode%29 ''Life Support''] on [[Memory Alpha]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The USS ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'', the starship featured in the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series, was very heavily refitted before its first appearance in film, the 1979 movie ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Almost nothing from the original TV version of the ship survived into the refitting. Captain Willard Decker, the ship's new commanding officer, describes it as "an almost totally new ''Enterprise''."
In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Deep Breath (Doctor Who)|Deep Breath]]", the Doctor postulates that a broom that has had its handle and brush replaced several times is not the same broom, "but you can still sweep the floor", when talking to an android who has replaced every part of himself several times. This is often taken to be a loving in-joke reference to the above stated "Trigger's Broom" scene in another well-known BBC TV series "Only Fools and Horses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is It Still the Same Broom? - "Deep Breath" Review|url = https://ravingsanity.wordpress.com/2014/08/26/is-it-still-the-same-broom-deep-breath-review/|website = ravingsanity|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films==

In the 1995 movie, ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995_film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', the main character, a woman who has been "cybernetically augmented" to become nearly 100% robot, encounters an intelligent entity claiming to be indistinguishable from a human, who is actually a rogue [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]]; this causes the main character to question her own reality and the nature of a human or being 'alive' or synthetic; with respect to how much of a human can you replace before it ceases to be human, or how human a robot can be before it ceases to be a robot, in an age of synthetic and cybernetic replacement of humans parts on a grand scale.

The 1999 movie ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', based on the novel, stars an android who develops a personality and replaces his entire physiology with cybernetic-organic parts, so that he is the same character but now mortal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]]'', it's suggested that possibly every single piece of the character WALL·E has been replaced by himself prior to the story.

In the 2009 film, ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', Michael C. Hall's character Ken Castle develops a nanotechnology method to supplant one's biological central nervous system with a synthetic one, cell by cell. The percentage of supplanted cells in an individual's brain varied by character, depending on the desired function (i.e.- wirelessly receive information like a computer, or send it, in the case of Ken Castle). Although not fully expressed in any character of the film, Castle ultimately presents the audience with the concept of fully supplanting one's biological brain with an entirely synthetic one. Midway into the film, Theseus' Ship Paradox does come into question when the character of Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick) shares that she would rather have the new parts removed, a statement that prompts Trace (Alison Lohman) to explain that such an attempt would kill the individual because it would mean removing a part of one's brain.

The 2012 movie ''[[John Dies at the End (film)|John Dies At The End]]'' based on the novel, begins with a narration recounting the axe variant of the paradox.

The 2013 movie ''[[Ship of Theseus (film)|Ship of Theseus]]'' portrays the paradox through intertwined stories of human organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Review: Ship Of Theseus is a work of art|url = http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-ship-of-theseus-is-a-work-of-art/20130719.htm|website = Rediff|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Sugababes]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] band,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6055250.stm Sugababes crown girl group list]&lt;/ref&gt; "were formed in 1998 [..] but one by one they left, till by September 2009 none of the founders remained in the band; each had been replaced by another member, just like the planks of Theseus’s boat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Membership of the British pop band [[The Pipettes]] has gradually changed such that none of the founding members are any longer part of the band.

[[Yes (band)|Yes]] no longer features any original members.

[[Stratovarius]] was formed in 1984 under the name Black Water. The "classic line-up" (1996–2005) has no members in common with the founding line-up. Also, as of 2018, the current incarnation of the band has no members in common with the 1994 line-up that recorded ''Dreamspace''; yet continuity was never broken.

[[Japanese idol]] groups such as [[AKB48]] are often like this, employing new members as the older ones "graduate", eventually coming to a point where none of the original members are part of the group anymore. Or they distribute members into teams and rotate them around, eventually coming to a point where the team no longer has any of its original members.

==Software==
Computer systems will sometimes split into two or more versions, such as when its programmers disagree and spit into rival teams. This may happen in [[open source software]] as a [[fork]], or commercially when company founders leave to create a new company doing similar work.  This can lead to situations where, for example, one team retains the original name but the other retains most of the core people.

==Games==
The 2013 game ''[[The Swapper]]'''s staple mechanic is a cloning device that allows the player to create perfect clones and swap consciousness between them. The majority of the game takes place aboard a spaceship named "Theseus", which is a heavy nod to the thought experiment's involvement in the game's use of themes such as the subject of consciousness and a lost sense of originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Impact Plays – The Swapper|url = http://www.impactnottingham.com/2014/10/impact-plays-the-swapper/|website = Impact Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-31|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 psychological horror game ''[[Soma (video game)|SOMA]]'' features dialogue and text records that presents the player with the paradox of the human body, as the cells of the body are all being replaced at different rates - the body and mind is always growing and changing. As every second passes, a person is never physically the same, but they always represent the same person, "a continuous flow of thought and perception keeps an unbroken chain of continuity that we know as our self".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SOMA review {{!}} Rock, Paper, Shotgun|url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/09/21/soma-review/|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLxQj4BuNoc&amp;t=16m45s|title = SOMA|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Frictional Games|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==

The contemporary writer Martin Cohen creatively imagined John Locke regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the sock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after a second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been replaced with patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cohen |first=M. |year=2010 |title=Philosophy for Dummies |location=Chichester |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An instance known generally as '''grandfather's axe''', where over time both the head and handle have been replaced, has been personified with the names of famous hatchet and axe wielders such as [[George Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Browne | first = Ray Broadus | authorlink = | title = Objects of Special Devotion: Fetishism in Popular Culture | publisher = Popular Press | year = 1982 | location = | page = 134 | url = | isbn = 0-87972-191-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=11893583 | title=Atomic Tune-Up: How the Body Rejuvenates Itself | publisher=[[National Public Radio]] | date=2007-07-14 | accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.rrstar.com/news/x1637131140 | title=Ax turns out to be Lincoln's last swing | author=Bruce Rushton | publisher=[[Rockford Register-Star]] | date=2008-02-22 | accessdate=2009-11-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912035420/http://www.rrstar.com/news/x1637131140 | archivedate=2012-09-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, several  independent tales and stories feature knives that have had their blades and handles replaced several times, but are still used and represent the same knife. France has Jeannot's knife,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Dumas in his Curricle | journal = Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine | volume = LV | issue = CCCXLI | page = 351 | date = January–June 1844 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gzWrsYBAsO8C&amp;pg=PA351&amp;dq=%22Jeannot%27s+knife%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of the Life and Correspondence of Henry Reeve, C.B., D.C.L.

In Japan, [[Shinto shrine]]s are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely "new wood". The continuity over the centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of [[Ise_Grand_Shrine|Ise Jingu's]] Naiku shrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. In 2013, the shrine was rebuilt for the 62nd time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/ise-shrine-japans-most-sacred-site-rebuilt-62nd-time-646921|title=Japan's most sacred site rebuilt, for the 62nd time|last=Olson|first=Brad|date=30 August 2013|newspaper=CNN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of identity posed by the ''Ship of Theseus'' remains problematic even in the 21st century, foremost with both the piecemeal and wholesale reconstruction of wooden boats and tall ships, as well as structures of historic merit and not.  An illustrative example is the [[provenance]] of the [[USS Constellation (1854)|USS ''Constellation'']], the [[USS_Constellation_(1854)#Identity_controversy|identity controversy over which]] long vexed even respected naval historians and publications of record.&lt;ref name=historic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicships.org/constellation.html|title=USS Constellation|publisher=Historic Ships of Baltimore|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credible records allowed its history to finally be resolved, but many instances occur whether either records are lacking or the matter is simply one of point of view.

'''Ludwig Noiré''' (26 March 1829 &amp;ndash; 27 March 1889) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]], known for his studies involving the philosophy of language. He was born in [[Alzey]].

He received his education at the [[University of Giessen]], and later relocated to [[Mainz]], where he worked as a grammar school teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespearealbum.de/en/biographies/ludwig-noire.html Ludwig Noiré] Shakespeare Album&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] attributed some of his ideas, formalized as [[tektology]], on the development of a monistic system to Ludwig Noiré.

Noiré contributed an historical introduction to [[Max Müller|F. Max Müller]]’s 1881 translation of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. It was titled "The Critique of Pure Reason as Illustrated by a Sketch of the Development of Occidental Philosophy" and was over 300 pages long.

== Early life ==
Michelle Paisley Reed was born in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on August 11, 1968. She attended high school in [[Fairfield, California|Fairfield]], [[California]], northeast of [[San Francisco]], and graduated [[summa cum laude]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[English major|English]] from [[California State University, Sacramento]].&lt;ref name=vth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesheraldonline.com/ci_18450274|title=Author hopes Holiday pays with first novel release|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/michellelpaisley|title=Michelle P Reed (author) on AuthorsDen|author=|date=|website=AuthorsDen.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news10&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc10.com/error/404|title=ABC10.com|author=|date=|website=KXTV|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from college in 1994, she worked as a reporter and features editor for the [[Benicia, California|Benicia]] Herald&lt;ref name="bh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beniciaherald.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/former-benician-pens-1st-novel/|title=Benicia Herald|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Contra Costa Times]] in [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]], CA. She then served as director of a [[non-profit]] enrichment program for children, program director for the [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] [[YMCA]] and finally as director of Renaissance ClubSport in Walnut Creek.

In 2002, Paisley earned a Registered [[Yoga]] Teacher (500 hours) certification from [[Yoga Alliance]] and launched her own studio, Yoga Junction. It was originally located in [[Suisun, California|Suisun City]] before moving to [[Green Valley, Solano County, California|Green Valley]]. In 2005-2006 she worked on her first book after sending dozens of [[query letter]]s, eventually publishing ''Yoga for a Broken Heart: A Spiritual Guide to Healing from Break-up, Loss, Death or Divorce'' with [[Findhorn Press]] in 2007.

In 2008, she was forced to change direction{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}}, so she obtained certifications as a [[Massage#United States|Massage Therapist]], [[Craniosacral therapy|Cranial Sacral Therapist]], [[Bowen technique|Bowen Therapist]], and [[Hypnotherapist]] as well as studying [[Emotional Freedom Technique|EFT]] [[alternative medicine]].

In between appointments at her 2009-2010 job, she gradually wrote her first novel, ''All in Her Head''. Through what she described as a [[Synchronicity|synchronistic]] [[Google]] event, she completed an agreement with the Strategic Book Group (the only publisher she contacted) within one week.

She has since owned a massage and yoga instruction studio, become a [[Reiki]] Master Therapist (Third Degree) and conducted a limited number of seminars entitled "Journey to Self-Love".&lt;ref name=ow /&gt;&lt;ref name=vth /&gt;&lt;ref name=adbio /&gt;&lt;ref name=diff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/thedifference/2011/06/30/the-difference-radiomichelle-paisley-30611|title=The Difference Radio:Michelle Paisley 30/6/11|author=|date=|website=BlogTalkRadio|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near death experience==
At the age of 22, Paisley had a [[Anaphylaxis|severe allergic reaction]] to a medication she was given and her heart stopped beating for several minutes. After this [[Near Death Experience|experience]], she threw herself into the study and practice of yoga, [[hypnotherapy]] and [[meditation]], searching for answers to her ordeal. After the publication of ''All in Her Head'', she studied [[PMH Atwater|P.M.H. Atwater’s]] 2011 book ''Near-Death Experiences, The Rest of the Story''.

Some of the motivation and themes in Paisley’s novel were born from this life-changing event.&lt;ref name="diff" /&gt;

==Novels==
===''All in Her Head'' (2011)===

''All in Her Head'' journeys into the psyche of Bridget Holiday, a 41-year-old freelance writer who is obsessed with her weight. She meets a beginning hypnotherapist who wants to help her confront her inner demons, but she instead regresses back to a time before her birth, when she is still in what the book describes as "spirit" form. Her yoga teacher guides her through this new [[Astral projection|astral world]], where she meets with her dead boyfriend. When faced with her own life-or-death crisis, Bridget realizes that her only hope is to embrace the life she is already living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779219261|title=All in her head|last=Michelle.|first=Paisley,|date=2011|publisher=Strategic Book Group|isbn=9781609764098|location=Durham, Ct.|oclc=779219261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aihhpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authorpressrelease.posterous.com/author-michelle-paisley-takes-readers-on-an-e|title=Good night, Posterous|author=|date=|website=authorpressrelease.posterous.com|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paisley describes the book's message as "learning to love your inner self... and (opening) yourself up to connect with your [[Soulmate|soul mate]] and with your dreams."&lt;ref name="sbg" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.michellepaisleyreed.com/books/|title=Books|website=Michelle Paisley Reed|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Movement Medicine''' is a movement meditation practice, intended to create an experiential and embodied connectedness with the world.&lt;ref&gt;Darling Khan, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by Susannah and Ya'Acov Darling Khan, who directed the Moving Centre School Europe, representing [[Gabrielle Roth]] and the [[5Rhythms]] in Europe until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps to Ecstasy: Teachings of an Urban Shaman |year=1989 |author=Roth, Gabrielle |authorlink=Gabrielle Roth |author2=Loudon, John |publisher=New World Library |isbn=978-0-931432-52-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Movement Medicine integrates physical, artistic, spiritual, [[shamanic]] and therapeutic practices so as to stimulate human creativity, healing and transformation, focussing on the relationship with ourselves, each other, the earth, and the spirit of life. It is non-denominational, aiming to answer the spiritual impulse without the need for dogma or belief. The Movement Medicine practice is meant to give people tools to integrate the freedom and aliveness of the dance into daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carey |first=Caroline |title=Ms'Guided Angel |year=2010 |publisher=My Voice Publishing |location=Eastborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides [[5Rhythms]], Movement Medicine is influenced by [[shamanism]], Helen Poynor's "Walk of Life" movement work,&lt;ref&gt;Poynor, Helen. [http://www.walkoflife.co.uk Walk of Life]. Retrieved 24 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and global environmental initiatives such as the "Awakening the Dreamer" Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;Pachamama Alliance. [http://awakeningthedreamer.org/]. Retrieved 24 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a [[social movement]] in the traditional sense of the word, the practice shows similarities with the [[Human Potential Movement]] and the [[New Age]] movement, sharing interest in a search for [[self actualization]], [[empowerment]] and [[spiritual transformation]].

There is a professional organization of [http://movementmedicineassociation.org/ Movement Medicine Teachers and Facilitators], and a Registered Charity which sponsors dancers from different countries to train to teach the practice.{{sfn|UK Charity Registration No 1124232}}

==Maps of Movement Medicine==

Movement Medicine works with 4 different 'maps', which focus on different aspects of life in general and the dance practice in particular. Each map is accompanied by different tools, exercises and practices.

Firstly, the map of the 4 Aristotelian elements, [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] is foundational to Movement Medicine. According to Ya'Acov and Susannah Darling Khan, these elements provide an opportunity to explore different movement qualities, and provide a language of metaphor to support the practice.&lt;ref name=Keift&gt;{{cite book| last=Kieft| first=Eline| title=Dance, Empowerment and Spirituality.  An ethnography of Movement Medicine |year=2013| location=Roehampton University |url=http://roehampton.openrepository.com/roehampton/handle/10142/283073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each element is considered to exist both inside and outside the dancer, who connects to them through movement and imagination.

Secondly, "the 5 dimensions of awareness" concern different dimensions of moving between micro and macro, individual, inter-personal and global. These are called "the 5 dimensions of awareness": Self, Relational, Environmental, Ancestral and Divine. The practice supports movement across each of these. According to Ya'Acov Darling Khan, trance is like "discovering that you've got second, third, fourth, and fifth gears of perception when you've been ambling along in first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/21/ecstatic-dance?INTCMP=SRCH | work=The Guardian | title=Ecstatic dance: rhythm to beat the blues | date=21 July 2009 | accessdate=9 November 2012 | author=Ottery, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third map, called "the 9 Gateways" provides an orientation in space and time and reflects the following 9 aspects of life, divided into groups of three, called "Journeys": 1 Body, 2 Heart, 3 Mind, 4 Past, 5 Present, 6 Future, 7 Fulfilment 8 Interconnection, 9 Realisation.

The 1st "Journey" covers the first three gateways; Body, Heart and Mind. In Movement Medicine, this is represented as a vertical axis from the feet, through the head upwards, and back down again. The 2nd "Journey" explores the 4th, 5th, and 6th gateways, which are Past, Present and Future, which are said to form an axis through time, with the 'present' represented ''in'' the body, connected horizontally to the past (behind) and future (in front). The "3rd Journey", which is visualised as a horizontal connection from side to side, aims to manifest individual qualities, a sense of connection with the culture or community around, and a sense of the realisation of the mystical experience of 'one-ness.'{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Finally, the last map reflects the dynamic relationship between yin and yang at the centre and the [[tree of life]] which is found in many cultures worldwide,.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, J. C. (1978). ''An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Traditional Symbols''. London, Thames and Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tree sits the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], which, as symbol for the power of transformation,&lt;ref&gt;Cirlot, J. E. (1971). A Dictionary of Symbols. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; seems to reflect the essence of Movement Medicine.

==Research==
A PhD research describes that Movement Medicine dancers experience fundamental shifts in their personal growth and wellbeing in areas of the body, emotions, mind and spirituality. Participants describe insights regarding personal beliefs and patterns, their relationship to ancestral and family history, and to cultural patterns and mechanisms. Furthermore, participants sometimes experience new awareness regarding the nature of life, oneness, and various other ‘life lessons’. Although the variety of different traditions that inform the practice has been criticized, the mixture of different techniques are united in a coherent structure, which offers people from many different backgrounds useful entry points.&lt;ref name=Keift/&gt;

A second PhD research project is still {{when|date=August 2014}} being carried out at Exeter University, which looks at the transformational aspects of Movement Medicine through the lens of leadership studies.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">The ''''Neerotta Yamaha Anthathi'''''' is a collection of Thirty one stanzas (''Venpaas'') in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] written by [[Siva Prakasar]] also called as 'Siva anuputhi selvar, 'Karpanai Kalangiyam', 'Thurai mangalam Sivaprakasar' . [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lisindia.net/tamil/tamil_lite.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204055550/http://www.lisindia.net/Tamil/Tamil_lite.html |archivedate=2014-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Those Thirty one poems  were compiled as four – four lines.

==Poet==
[[Siva prakasar]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennailibrary.com/moral/nanneri.html&lt;/ref&gt; a Tamil Phiolospher, Sage, Poet lived at the end of 17th century. It is a collection of venpaas.

==Historical Incidence to compile this book==
On one of his journeys around Tamil Nadu, Sivaprakasa Swamigal went to Tirunelveli to meet and be taught by a pandit who was an expert on grammar. This teacher accepted him as his student after Sivaprakasa Swamigal had demonstrated his exceptional proficiency in this subject. The pandit taught him everything he knew, but when Sivaprakasa Swamigal tried to pay for this tuition, he refused, saying that he would like payment of a different sort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poemhunter.com/siva-prakasar/biography/&lt;/ref&gt;

This pandit had been having a bitter feud with another scholar. Sivaprakasa Swamigal's teacher said, 'Go to this man, defeat him in a contest of Tamil prosody, and as a condition of his defeat, make him prostrate to me'. Sivaprakasa Swamigal accepted the assignment, located the rival scholar, and challenged himto compose spontaneous verses, on a specified topic that they would both pick, that had no labial sounds in them.  That is to say, the verses had to be composed without any letters such as 'm' and 'p', which are sounded by putting the lips together. The scholar was unable to compose a single verse with this restriction, whereas Sivaprakasa Swamigal managed to produce thirty-one on the prescribed theme. The rival scholar accepted defeat and went to prostrate before Sivaprakasa
Swamigal's grammar teacher.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3996">The '''New Philosophers''' ({{lang-fr|nouveaux philosophes}}) is the generation of [[French philosophy|French philosophers]] who broke with [[Marxism]] in the early 1970s. They include [[Alain Finkielkraut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], ''[[Left in Dark Times]]'', Random House Publishing Group, 2008, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Glucksmann]], [[Pascal Bruckner]], [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]], Jean-Marie Benoist, [[Christian Jambet]], Guy Lardreau, Claude Gandelman, Jean-Paul Dollé and Gilles Susong. They criticized [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[post-structuralism]], as well as the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

==Beginnings==
The term was created by Bernard-Henri Lévy in 1976. Most of the philosophers he included in that description had a previous history of [[Marxism]] with which they had recently broken. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s writings on ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' had a profound effect upon many of these former Leftists.{{fact|date=November 2012}}

==Basic characteristics==
The New Philosophers rejected what they saw as the power-worship of the Left, a tradition which they traced back to at least [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. They argued that various "master thinkers" had created the foundations for systems of oppression. More recently [[Pascal Bruckner]] has targeted [[multiculturalism]].

==Heterogeneity==
Because they are defined by a negative quality (i.e., the rejection of systems of authoritarian power) the New Philosophers are very disparate. In 1978, Michael Ryan argued that they exist in name only; their "homogeneity derives from their espousal of heterogeneity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] and Michael Ryan (June 1978). "Anarchism Revisited: A New Philosophy". ''Diacritics'', 67-68&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as "a brand name" for an "extremely heterogeneous group of about ten intellectuals who are held together more from without than from within... they do not serve as representatives of any clearly defined political movement or force."&lt;ref name="negt"&gt;Oskar Negt and Jamie O. Daniel (1983) "Reflections on France's 'Nouveaux Philosophes' and the Crisis of Marxism". ''SubStance'' 11(4), 56-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
They were attacked as superficial and ideological by critics such as [[Gilles Deleuze]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://1libertaire.free.fr/Deleuze03.html Gilles Deleuze, « Les nouveaux philosophes »], supplément au n° 24 de la revue ''Minuit'', repris dans ''Deux régimes de fous'', Minuit, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pierre-vidal-naquet.net/spip.php?article49 La critique du ''Testament de Dieu'' de Bernard-Henry Lévy (1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Bourdieu]], « Le hit-parade des intellectuels français, ou Qui sera juge de la légitimité des juges ? », ''Homo academicus'', ''Minuit'', [[1984]], annexe 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Badiou]],&lt;ref&gt;Éric Aeschimann, [http://www.liberation.fr/transversales/grandsangles/227608.FR.php « Mao en chaire »], ''[[Libération]]'', 10 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Lyotard]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]], ''Instructions païennes'', Éditions Galilée, [[1977]]. Le groupe des nouveaux philosophes, dont Lyotard analyse les pratiques discursives, est ici appelé la ''[[Maurice Clavel|Cie Clavel]]''. ''Cf.'' aussi du même, ''La condition postmoderne'', Minuit, 1979, et ''Le postmoderne expliqué aux enfants'' (1982-1985), Galilée, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cornelius Castoriadis]].&lt;ref&gt;Christos Memos.

'''Nicholas Roerich''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɛr|ɪ|k}}; October 9, 1874 – December 13, 1947) – known also as '''Nikolai Konstantinovich Rerikh''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Никола́й Константи́нович Ре́рих}}) – was a Russian painter, writer, [[archaeologist]], [[theosophist]], [[philosopher]], and [[public figure]], who in his youth was influenced by [[Russian Symbolism|a movement in Russian society around the spiritual]]. He was interested in [[hypnosis]] and other [[spiritual practice]]s and his paintings are said to have hypnotic expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2009-08-358/KLIMENTIEVA-THESIS.pdf Nicholas Roerich: In Search of Shambala by Victoria Klimentieva], стр. 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watkinsbooks.com/ushahidi/reports/view/266 Nicholas Roerich Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071558/http://www.watkinsbooks.com/ushahidi/reports/view/266 |date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], to a well-to-do [[notary public]] father of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] ancestry and a [[Russians|Russian]] mother,&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Znamenski, ''Red Shambhala: Magic, Prophecy, and Geopolitics in the Heart of Asia'', Quest Books (2011), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; he lived in various places around the world until his death in [[Naggar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/506736/Nicholas-Roerich|title=Nicholas Roerich - Russian set designer|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Himachal Pradesh, India]]. Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, [[archaeology]], and especially art.  Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He earned several nominations for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] long list.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=7805 Nobel Prize] Nomination Database&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[Roerich Pact]] was signed into law by the United States and most nations of the [[Pan-American Union]] in April 1935.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[Image:Nicholas Roerich, Guests from Overseas.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Guests from Overseas'', 1901 ([[Varangian]]s in Rus')]]

Raised in late-19th-century St. Petersburg, Roerich matriculated simultaneously at [[St. Petersburg University]] and the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] during 1893. He received the title of "artist" in 1897 and a degree in law the next year. He found early employment with the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]], whose school he directed from 1906 to 1917. Despite early tensions with the group, he became a member of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s "[[Mir Iskusstva|World of Art]]" society; he was president of the society from 1910 to 1916.

Artistically, he became known as his generation's most talented painter of Russia's ancient past, a topic that was compatible with his lifelong interest in archaeology. He also succeeded as a stage designer, achieving his greatest fame as one of the designers for Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]. His best-known designs were for [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin's]] ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (1909 and later productions), and costumes and set for ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913),&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Julie Besonen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/nyregion/visions-of-a-forgotten-utopian.html "Visions of a Forgotten Utopian"], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; composed by [[Igor Stravinsky]].

Along with [[Mikhail Vrubel]] and [[Mikhail Nesterov]] he is considered a major representative of the [[Russian Symbolism]] in art.&lt;ref name="symbolism"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=k44-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22&lt;/ref&gt; From an early period of his life, Roerich was influenced by apocrypha and medieval sectarian writings such as the mysterious [[Dove Book]].&lt;ref&gt;Н. В. Сергеева. Древнерусская традиция в символизме Н.К. Рериха. М.: Международный Центр Рерихов, 2003. {{ISBN|5-86988-080-7}}. Page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs for the [[Talashkino]] church were so radical that the Orthodox church refused to consecrate the building.&lt;ref name="symbolism"/&gt;

Another of Roerich's passions was architecture. His acclaimed publication "Architectural Studies" (1904–1905) – the dozens of paintings he completed of fortresses, monasteries, churches, and other monuments during two long trips through Russia – inspired his decades-long career as an activist on behalf of artistic and architectural preservation. He also designed religious art for places of worship throughout Russia and [[Ukraine]]: most notably the ''Queen of Heaven'' fresco for the Church of the Holy Spirit which the patroness [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Maria Tenisheva]] built near her [[Talashkino]] estate; and the stained glass windows for the [[Datsan Gunzechoinei]] during 1913–1915.

During the first decade of the 1900s and in the early 1910s, Roerich, largely due to the influence of his wife Helena, developed an interest in eastern religions, as well as alternative (to Christianity) belief systems such as [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]]. Both Roerichs became avid readers of the Vedantist essays of [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Vivekananda]], the poetry of [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.  The Roerichs' commitment to occult mysticism increased steadily. It was especially intense during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution|Russian revolutions of 1917]], to which the couple, like many Russian intellectuals, accorded apocalyptic significance. The influence of Theosophy, [[Vedanta]], [[Buddhism]], and other mystical topics can be detected not only in many of his paintings, but in the many short stories and poems Roerich wrote before and after the 1917 revolutions, including the ''Flowers of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]]'' cycle, begun in 1907 and completed in 1921.

===Revolution, emigration, and the United States===
[[Image:M Sherling Portrait Roerich.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nicholas Roerich. 1916]]
After the [[February Revolution of 1917]] and the end of the czarist regime, Roerich, a political moderate who valued Russia's cultural heritage more than ideology and party politics, had an active part in artistic politics. With [[Maxim Gorky]] and [[Aleksandr Benois]], he participated with the so-called "Gorky Commission" and its successor organization, the Arts Union (SDI). Both attempted to gain the attention of the [[Provisional Government]] and [[Petrograd Soviet]] on the need to form a coherent cultural policy and, most urgently, protect art and architecture from destruction and vandalism. At the same time, however, illness forced Roerich to leave the capital and reside in Karelia, the district bordering Finland. He had already quit the presidency of the World of Art society, and he now quit the directorship of the School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After the October Revolution and the acquisition of power of Lenin's [[Bolshevik Party]], Roerich became increasingly discouraged about Russia's political future. During early 1918, he, Helena, and their two sons [[George de Roerich|George]] and [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]] emigrated to Finland.

Two unresolved historical debates are associated with Roerich's departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people's commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture) which the Bolsheviks considered establishing during 1917–1918, but that he refused to accept the job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat.  It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot by the fact that the Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat.  Second, when he wished to reconcile with the USSR, Roerich maintained later that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in [[Karelia]] (there he painted a series of pictures under the name "[http://www.awdl.ru/russkaya-zhivopis-19-veka/grozovoe-oblako-karelskaya-sjuita-514 Karelian Suite]"), had been isolated from their homeland when [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] began in [[Finland]]. However, Roerich's extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime – prompted not so much by a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at [[Lenin]]'s ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia's artistic and architectural heritage – was amply documented.  He illustrated [[Leonid Andreyev]]'s anti-communist polemic "S.O.S." and had a widely published pamphlet, "Violators of Art" (1918–1919). Roerich believed that "the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Bowlt  | first = John E.  | title = Moscow and St. Petersburg 1900–1920: Art, Life and Culture  | publisher = The Vendome Press  | year = 2008  | location = New York  | pages = 69   | isbn =978-0-86565-191-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some months in Finland and Scandinavia, the Roerichs relocated to London, arriving in mid-1919. Engrossed with Theosophical mysticism, the Roerichs now had millenarian expectations that a new age was imminent, and they wished to travel to India as soon as possible. They joined the English-Welsh chapter of the Theosophical Society.  It was in London, in March 1920, that the Roerichs founded their own school of mysticism, ''[[Agni Yoga]]'', which they referred to also as "the system of living ethics."  To earn passage to India, Roerich worked as a stage designer for [[Thomas Beecham]]'s [[Covent Garden Theatre]], but the enterprise ended unsuccessfully in 1920, and the artist never received full payment for his work. Among the notable people Roerich befriended while in England were the famed British Buddhist [[Christmas Humphreys]], philosopher-author [[H. G. Wells]], and the poet and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (whose grand-niece [[Devika Rani]] would later marry Roerich's son [[Svetoslav Roerich|Svetoslav]]).

Later, a successful exhibition resulted in an invitation from a director at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], offering to arrange for Roerich's art to tour the United States. During the autumn of 1920, the Roerichs traveled to America by sea.

[[File:NicholasRoerichcar.jpg|thumb|Car of Nicolas Roerich in his museum at Naggar]]

The Roerichs remained in the United States from October 1920 until May 1923. A large exhibition of Roerich's art, organized partly by U.S. impresario Christian Brinton and partly by the Chicago Art Institute, began in New York in December 1920 and toured the country, to San Francisco and back, during 1921 and early 1922.  Roerich befriended acclaimed soprano [[Mary Garden]] of the [[Chicago Opera]] and received a commission to design a 1922 production of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'' for her. During the exhibition, the Roerichs spent significant amounts of time in Chicago, New Mexico, and California.

They settled in New York City, which became the base of their many American operations. The Roerichs initiated several institutions during these years: ''Cor Ardens'' and ''Corona Mundi'', both of which were meant to unite artists around the globe in the cause of civic activism; the Master Institute of United Arts, an art school with an exceptionally versatile curriculum, and the eventual home of the first [[Nicholas Roerich Museum]]; and an American Agni Yoga Society. They also joined various theosophical societies, and their activities with these groups dominated their lives.

===Asian Expedition (1925–1929)===
[[File:Family Roerich.JPG|thumb|left|230px|&lt;center&gt;Roerich's family (Kullu valley, India)&lt;/center&gt;]]

After leaving New York, the Roerichs – together with their son [[George de Roerich|George]] and six friends – began the five-year-long 'Roerich Asian Expedition' that, in Roerich's own words: "started from Sikkim through Punjab, Kashmir, [[Ladakh]], the [[Karakoram Mountains]], [[Khotan]], [[Kashgar]], Qara Shar, [[Urumchi]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Altai Mountains]], the [[Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast|Oyrot]] region of Mongolia, the Central [[Gobi]], [[Kansu]], [[Tsaidam]], and [[Tibet]]" with a detour through Siberia to Moscow in 1926. Roerichs' Asian expedition attracted attention from the foreign services and intelligence agencies of the USSR, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. In fact, prior to this expedition, Roerich himself solicited help of Soviet government and Bolshevik secret police to assist him in his expedition, promising in return to monitor British activities in the area, but received only a lukewarm response from Michail Abramowitsch Trilisser, chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence at that time. On the one hand, the Bolsheviks assisted him with logistics when Roerich was traveling through Siberia and Mongolia. Yet, on the other hand, they refused to totally commit themselves to his reckless utopian project of the Sacred Union of the East – a spiritual utopia that boiled down to Roerich's ambitious attempts to stir the Buddhist masses of inner Asia to create a highly spiritual cooperative commonwealth under the patronage of Bolshevik Russia. The official mission of this expedition, as Roerich put it, was to act as the embassy of [[Western Buddhism]] to Tibet. However, for Western media his expedition was presented as an artistic and scientific enterprise;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxPIHCsXnuI|title = Andrei Znamenski, "Nicholas Roerich Shambhala Warrior"}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the summer of 1927 and June 1928 the expedition was thought to be lost, since communication with them ceased for a year. They had been attacked in Tibet and only the "superiority of our firearms prevented bloodshed... In spite of our having Tibet passports, the expedition was forcibly stopped by Tibetan authorities." The expedition was detained by the government for five months, and forced to live in tents in sub-zero conditions and to subsist on meagre rations. Five men of the expedition died during this time. In March 1928 they were allowed to leave Tibet, and trekked south to settle in [[India]], where they founded a research center, the Himalayan Research Institute.

In 1929 Nicholas Roerich was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] by the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |title=Roerich Nominated for Peace Award |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0911F8385A127A93C1A91788D85F4D8285F9 |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=March 3, 1929 |accessdate=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received two more nominations in 1932 and 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nomination/peace/nomination.php?string=Nicholas%20Roerich&amp;action=simplesearch&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|title=Nomination Database - Peace|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His concern for peace resulted in his creation of the [[Pax Cultura]], the "[[Red Cross]]" of art and culture. His work for this cause also resulted in the United States and the twenty other nations of the [[Pan-American Union]] signing the [[Roerich Pact]] on April 15, 1935 at the White House. The Roerich Pact is an early international instrument protecting cultural property.

===Manchurian expedition===
In 1934–1935, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (then headed by Roerich admirer [[Henry A. Wallace]]) sponsored an expedition by Roerich and USDA scientists H. G. MacMillan and James F. Stephens to [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Manchuria]], and China. The expedition's purpose was to collect seeds of plants which prevent the destruction of benign layers of soil.

The expedition consisted of two parts. In 1934, they explored the [[Greater Khingan]] mountains and Bargan plateau in western Manchuria. In 1935, they explored parts of Inner Mongolia: the [[Gobi Desert]], [[Ordos Desert]], and [[Helan Mountains]]. The expedition found almost 300 species of [[xerophyte]]s, collected herbs, conducted archeological studies, and found antique manuscripts of great scientific importance.

===Later life and World War II ===
[[File:Nehru Gandhi Roerich.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Indira Gandhi]], Nicholas Roerich, and [[Mohammad Yunus (diplomat)|Mohammad Yunus]]. (Roerich's estate, Kullu).]]
Roerich was in India during the Second World War, where he painted Russian epic heroic and saintly themes, including: ''Alexander Nevsky'', ''The Fight of Mstislav and Rededia'' and ''Boris and Gleb''.&lt;ref name="Leek2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Leek |title=Russian Painting |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePYhUnX4vgUC&amp;pg=PA256 |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Parkstone International |isbn=978-1-78042-975-5 |pages=256– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Roerich received [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] at his house in Kullu and Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Together they discussed the fate of the new world: "We spoke about Indian–Russian cultural association [...] it is time to think about useful and creative cooperation".&lt;ref&gt;N. Roerich. Diary Leaves. V. 3. – Moscow, International Centre of the Roerichs. – 1996. – p.39. {{ISBN|5-86988-056-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi would later recall about several days spent together with Roerich's family: "That was a memorable visit to a surprising and gifted family where each member was a remarkable figure in himself, with a well-defined range of interests. ... Roerich himself stays in my memory. He was a man with extensive knowledge and enormous experience, a man with a big heart, deeply influenced by all that he observed".

During the visit, "ideas and thoughts about closer cooperation between India and USSR were expressed. Now, after India wins independence, they have got its own real implementation{{clarify|phrase after the comma is totally unclear|date=June 2013}}. And as you know, there are friendly and mutually-understanding relationships today between both our countries".&lt;ref name="Индира Ганди"&gt;

In 1942, the American–Russian cultural Association (ARCA) was created in New York. Its active participants were [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Emil Cooper]], [[Serge Koussevitzky]], and [[Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko]]. The Association's activity was welcomed by scientists like [[Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]].&lt;ref name="Drayer2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruth Abrams Drayer |title=Nicholas and Helena Roerich: The Spiritual Journey of Two Great Artists and Peacemakers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIoY64HNGysC&amp;pg=PA330 |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |year=2005 |publisher=Quest Books |isbn=978-0-8356-0843-5 |pages=330– }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich died on December 13, 1947.

==Cultural legacy==

[[Image:Altai. Peaks and passes named in honor of the family Roerich.jpeg|thumb|300px|left|[[Altai Mountains|Altai]]. Peaks and passes named in honor of the Roerich family.]]

Vice President of the United States [[Henry A. Wallace]] was a frequent correspondent and sometime advocate of Nicholas Roerich's teachings. Wallace became attracted to the idea of Sacred Union of the East, a spiritual and geopolitical utopia Nicholas and Helena Roerich contemplated to establish in the heart of Asia. Based on spiritual ideas, which the Roerichs claimed they received from otherworld masters, this utopia was to show the humankind a blueprint of ideal society. As the US Secretary of Agriculture, Wallace became so much interested in the whole project that he decided to sponsor the second Roerich expedition to Asia in 1933–1934. In the meantime, Helena Roerich was corresponding with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was intrigued by her "fiery letters." The whole project ended in a disaster and resulted in energetic efforts by Wallace and FDR to cut their ties with the Roerichs. The whole incident later partially resurfaced and became controversial when Wallace campaigned for President in 1948 and portions of the correspondence were printed by columnist Westbrook Pegler, becoming known as the Guru Letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TPfQ2EMeLo8|title = Andrei Znamenski, "Utopian in Power: Henry Wallace, Roerich, and the Sacred Union of the East}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the [[Nicholas Roerich Museum]] in New York City is a major institution for Roerich's artistic work. Numerous Roerich societies continue to promote his theosophical teachings worldwide. His paintings can be seen in several museums including the Roerich Department of the State Museum of Oriental Arts in Moscow; the Roerich Museum at the International Centre of the Roerichs in Moscow; the Russian State Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia; a collection in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow; a collection in the Art Museum in [[Novosibirsk]], Russia; an important collection in the [[National Gallery for Foreign Art]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]; a collection in the Art Museum in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] Russia; [[National Museum of Serbia]]; the Roerich Hall Estate in [[Naggar]], [[India]]; the [[Sree Chitra Art Gallery]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], India;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/dust-throws-a-blanket-over-prized-paintings/article4639568.ece|title = Dust throws a blanket over prized paintings}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in various art museums in India; and a selection featuring several of his larger works in [[The Latvian National Museum of Art]].

Roerich's biography and his controversial expeditions to Tibet and Manchuria have been examined recently by a number of authors, including two Russians, Vladimir Rosov and Alexandre Andreyev, American (Andrei Znamenski), and the German Ernst von Waldenfels.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Roerich: the Messenger of Zvenigorod (vol. 1: The Great Plan, vol. 2: The New Country) (2002–2004) [summary of the books in English at {{cite web |url=http://lebendige-ethik.net/engl/4-Rosovs_books.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110150834/http://lebendige-ethik.net/engl/4-Rosovs_books.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}]; Alexandre Andreyev, Gimalaiski mif i ego tvotry [Himalayan Myth and its Makers] (St. Petersburg: St. Petersburg University Press, 2004) [in Russian]; Andrei Znamenski, Red Shambhala: Magic, Prophesy, and Geopolitics in the Heart of Asia (Quest Books, 2011) [see an excerpt from the book at http://www.trimondi.de/EN/Red_Shambhala.htm]; Ernst von Waldenfels, Nicholas Roerich: Kunst, Macht und Okkultismus (Osburg, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H.P. Lovecraft]] refers numerous times to the "strange and disturbing paintings of Nicholas Roerich" in his Antarctic horror story ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]''.

The [[minor planet]] [[4426 Roerich]] in the [[Solar System]] was named in honor of Roerich.

In June 2013 during [[Russian Art Week]] in London, Roerich's ''Madonna Laboris'' sold at auction at [[Bonhams]] shop for £7,881,250 inc. buyer's premium, making it the most valuable painting ever sold at a Russian art auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20841/lot/63/|title=Bonhams : Nikolai Konstantinovich Roerich (Russian, 1874-1947) Madonna Laboris|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was the first [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] and first [[President of Ghana]]. Nkrumah had run governments under the supervision of the British government through [[Charles Arden-Clarke]], the [[Governor-General]]. His first government under colonial rule started from 21 March 1952 until independence. His first independent government took office on 6 March 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/photo.day.php?ID=20501 |title=1957 Govt. of Ghana |accessdate=2010-07-14 |publisher=Ghana Home Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; From  1 July 1960, Ghana became a republic and Nkrumah became the first [[president of Ghana]].  

In February 1966 his government was overthrown by the [[National Liberation Council#1966 coup|National Liberation Council military coup]].

'''The philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]''' has been a major influence in the development of [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[existentialism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been called the "Father of Existentialism".&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Alister E.  ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Thought''. Blackwell Publishing, 1993. p 202&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy also influenced the development of [[existential psychology]].&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;Matustik, M. J. and M. Westphal (eds). ''Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity'', Indiana University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-253-20967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard criticized aspects of the philosophical systems that were brought on by philosophers such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] before him and the Danish [[Hegelianism|Hegelians]]. He was also indirectly influenced by the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Kant"&gt;Green, Ronald M. ''Kierkegaard and Kant: The Hidden Debt''. SUNY Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7914-1107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He measured himself against the model of philosophy which he found in [[Socrates]], which aims to draw one's attention not to explanatory systems, but rather to the issue of how one exists.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'': "''Socrates' infinite merit is to have been an ''existing'' thinker, not a speculative philosopher who forgets what it means to exist… The infinite merit of the Socratic position was precisely to accentuate the fact that the knower is an existing individual, and that the task of existing is his essential task.''" Swenson/Lowrie translation (1941), pp. 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kierkegaard's recurrent themes is the importance of subjectivity, which has to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', he argues that "subjectivity is truth" and "truth is subjectivity." What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Howard V. and Edna H. "Subjectivity/Objectivity." ''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers''. Vol. 4. Indiana University Press, 1975, pp. 712-13. {{ISBN|0-253-18243-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note on pseudonyms==
{{see also|Søren Kierkegaard#Indirect_communication_and_pseudonymous_authorship|l1=Indirect Communication and Pseudonymous Authorship}}
Many of Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is ''Anti-Climacus'', a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of ''The Point of View'': Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.&lt;ref name="Journals"&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Papers and Journals'', trans. A. Hannay, London, Penguin Books, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, ''Johannes Climacus'' is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. ''Anti-Climacus'', as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.&lt;ref name="Journals"/&gt;

Most of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85168-317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where appropriate, this article will mention the respective author, pseudonymous or not.

==Themes in his philosophy==

===Alienation===
[[Social alienation|Alienation]] is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any "literal" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.

Humanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with [[logic]], historical research, or [[scientific analysis]]. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny. 

Kierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and [[Marx's theory of alienation]]. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843#To Gain One’s Soul In Patience|gain their souls]] from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as [[Karl Marx]] does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.{{Quotation|Let us speak further about the wish and thereby about sufferings. Discussion of sufferings can always be beneficial if it addresses not only the self-willfulness of the sorrow but, if possible, addresses the sorrowing person for his upbuilding. It is a legitimate and sympathetic act to dwell properly on the suffering, lest the suffering person become impatient over our superficial discussion in which he does not recognize his suffering, lest he for that reason impatiently thrust aside consolation and be strengthened in double-mindedness. It certainly is one thing to go out into life with the wish when what is wished becomes the deed and the task; it is something else to go out into life away from the wish.

Abraham had to leave his ancestral home an emigrate to an alien nation, where nothing reminded him of what he loved – indeed, sometimes it is no doubt a consolation that nothing calls to mind what one wishes to forget, but it is a bitter consolation for the person who is full of longing. Thus a person can also have a wish that for him contains everything, so that in the hour of the separation, when the pilgrimage begins, it is as if he were emigrating to a foreign country where nothing but the contrast reminds him, by the loss, of what he wished; it can seem to him as if he were emigrating to a foreign country even if he remains at home perhaps in the same locality – by losing the wish just as among strangers, so that to take leave of the wish seems to him harder and more crucial than to take leave of his senses.

Apart from this wish, even if he still does not move from the spot, his life’s troublesome way is perhaps spent in useless sufferings, for we are speaking of those who suffer essentially, not of those who have the consolation that their sufferings are for the benefit of a good cause, for the benefit of others. It was bound to be thus – the journey to the foreign country was not long; in one moment he was there, there in that strange country where the suffering ones meet, but not those who have ceased to grieve, not those whose tears eternity cannot wipe away, for as an old devotional book so simply and movingly says, “How can God dry your tears in the next world if you have not wept?” Perhaps someone else comes in a different way, but to the same place. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 1993 pp. 102-103}}

[[Albert Camus]] wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|stranger]] for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called "the existential attitude philosophical suicide." This is how he put it in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus|The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings]]'' {{Quotation|Now, it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is seen that existential thought for [[Lev Shestov|Chestov]] (Lev Shestov 1866-1938) presupposes the absurd but proves it only to dispel it. Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror's emotional trick. When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in opposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and redemption. Hence, there is basically in that definition of the absurd an approbation that Chestov grants it. What is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so in Kierkegaard. To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in so elusive a writer. But, despite apparently opposed writings, beyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt throughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same time as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in the last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap. Kierkegaard’s view that despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin. For sin is what alienates from God. The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the consciousness of man, does not lead to God. Perhaps this notion will become clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin without God. It is a matter of living in that state of the absurd. I am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential attitude philosophical suicide. But this does not imply a judgment. It is a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation. For the existential negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. (Let me assert again: it is not the affirmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the logic leading to that affirmation.) Albert Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus and other essays'' p. 26-32 Vintage books 1955 Alfred A Knopf}}

Kierkegaard put it this way in ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843 and ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (1846). {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;Getting the majority vote on one’s side and one’s God-relationship transformed into a speculative enterprise on the basis of probability and partnership and fellow shareholders is the first step toward becoming objective.
*''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong p. 66.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The love which covers a multitude of sins in never deceived. When the heart is niggardly, when one gives with one eye and with seven eyes looks to see what one will get in return, then one easily discovers a multitude of sins. But when the heart is filled with love, then the eye is never deceived; for love when it gives, does not scrutinize the gift, but its eye is fixed on the Lord. When the heart is filled with envy, then the eye has power to call forth uncleanness even in the pure; but when love dwells in the heart, then the eye has the power to foster the good in the unclean; but this eye does not see the evil but the pure, which it loves and encourages it by loving it. Certainly there is a power in this world which by its words turns good into evil, put there is a power above which turns the evil into good; that power is the love which covers a multitude of sins.

When hate dwells in the heart, then sin lies at a man’s door, and its manifold desires exist in him; but when love dwells in the heart, then sin flees far away, and he sees it no more. When disputes, malice, wrath, quarrels, dissensions, factions fill the heart, does one then need to go far in order to discover the multitudinousness of sin, or does a man need to love very long to produce these outside of himself! But when joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance dwell in the heart, what wonder, then, that a man, even if he were surrounded by a multitude of sins, remains an alien, a stranger, who understands only a very little about the customs of the country, even if these were explained to him? Would not this, then, be a covering of the multitude of sins?
* Soren Kierkegaard ''Three Edifying Discourses'' 1843, Swenson translation 1943 p. 69.

Love does not seek its own. Love does not seek its own, for there are no mine and yours in love. But "mine" and "yours" are only relational specifications of "one's own"; thus, if there are no mine and yours, there is no "one's own" either. But if there is no "one's own" at all, then it is of course impossible to seek one's own. Justice is identified by its giving each his own, just as it also in turn claims its own. This means that justice pleads the cause of its own, divides and assigns, determines what each can lawfully call his own, judges and punishes if anyone refuses to make any distinction between mine and yours. The individual has the right to so as he pleases with this contentious and yet legally entitled mine; and if he seeks his own in no other way than that which justice allows, justice has nothing with which to reproach him and has no right to upbraid him for anything. As soon as someone is defrauded of his own, or as soon as someone defrauds another of his own, justice intervenes, because it safeguards the common security in which everyone has his own, which he rightfully has.-But sometimes a change intrudes, a revolution, a war, an earthquake, or some such terrible misfortune, and everything is confused. Justice tries in vain to secure for each person his own; it cannot maintain the distinction between mine and yours; in the confusion it cannot keep the balance and therefore throws away the scales-it despairs! Terrible spectacle! Yet does not love in a certain sense, even if in the most blissful way, produce the same confusion? But love, it too is an event, the greatest of all, yet also the happiest. Love is a change, the most remarkable of all, but the most desirable-in fact we say in a very good sense that someone who is gripped by love is changed or becomes changed. Love is a revolution, the most profound of all, but the most blessed!

===Abstraction===
An element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, ''[[Two Ages]]'', is the mention of [[money]] — which he calls an [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''The Two Ages'', trans. Howard and Edna Hong. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-07226-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Robert L. ''Two Ages: International Kierkegaard Commentary''. Mercer University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-86554-081-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an [[ersatz]] reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] reality, neither now nor in the future.

How is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that "a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right."&lt;ref&gt;''Two Ages'', p.75, Hong translation.&lt;/ref&gt; But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. {{Quotation|Do not forget to do good and to share – Hebrews 13.16 - But do not forget either that this incessant talk by worldliness about beneficence and benevolence and generosity and charitable donations and gift upon gift is almost merciless. Ah, let the newspaper writers and tax collectors and parish beadles talk about generosity and count and count; but let us never ignore that Christianity speaks essentially of mercifulness, that Christianity would least of all be guilty of mercilessness, as if poverty and misery not only needed money etc. but also were excluded from the highest, from being able to be generous, beneficent, benevolent. But people prattle and prate ecclesiastically-worldly and worldly-ecclesiastically about generosity, beneficence-but forget, even in the sermon, mercifulness. Preaching should indeed be solely and only about mercifulness. If you know how to speak effectually about this, then generosity will follow of itself and come by itself accordingly as the individual is capable of it. But bear in mind, that if a person raised money, money, money by speaking about generosity-bear this in mind, that by being silent about mercifulness he would be acting mercilessly toward the poor and miserable person for whom he procured relief by means of the money of wealthy generosity. Bear this I mind, that if poverty and misery disturb us with their pleas, we can of course manage to get help for them through generosity; but bear this in mind, that it would be much more appalling if we constrained poverty and misery “to hinder our prayers,” as Scripture says (1 Peter 3:7), by grumbling against us to God-because we were atrociously unfair to poverty and misery by not telling that they are able to practice mercifulness. We shall now adhere to this point in this discourse about mercifulness and guard ourselves against confusing mercifulness with what is linked to external conditions, that is, what love as such does not have in its power, whereas it truly has mercifulness in its power just as surely as it has a heart in its bosom. It does not follow that because a person has a heart in his bosom he has money in his pocket, but the first is still more important and certainly is decisive with regard to mercifulness. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' Hong 1995 pp. 315-316}}

Below are three quotes concerning Kierkegaard's idea of abstraction which cannot be thought about without thinking about concretion. He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in ''Either/Or'' and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''.{{Quotation|As has already been noted above, all [[classic]] productions stand equally high, because each one stands infinitely high. If, despite this fact, one were to attempt to introduce an order of rank into the classic procession, one would evidently have to choose as a basis for such a distinction, something that was not essential; for if the basis were essential, the difference itself would become an essential difference; from that it would again follow that the word "classic" was wrongly predicated of the group as a whole. The more abstract the idea is, the smaller the probability of a numerous representation. But how does the idea become concrete? By being permeated with the [[historical]] [[consciousness]]. The more concrete the idea, the greater the probability. The more abstract the medium, the smaller the probability; the more concrete, the greater. But what does it mean to say that the medium is concrete, other than to say it is language, or is seen in approximation to language; for language is the most concrete of all media. The idea, for example, which comes to expression in sculpture is wholly abstract, and bears no relation to the historical; the medium through which it is expressed is likewise abstract, consequently there is a great probability that the section of the classic works which includes sculpture will contain only a few. In this I have the testimony of time and experience on my side. If, on the other hand, I take a concrete idea and a concrete medium, then it seems otherwise. [[Homer]] is indeed a classic [[poet]], but just because the epic idea is a concrete idea, and because the medium is language, it so happens that in the section of the classics which contains the epic, there are many epics conceivable, which are all equally classic, because history constantly furnishes us with new epic material. In this too, I have the testimony of history and the assent of experience. ''Either/Or Part I'', Swenson p. 49, 53}}  {{Quotation|The two positions touched on here could be regarded as attempts to actualize an ethical life-view. The reason that they do not succeed is that the individual has chosen himself in his isolation or has chosen himself abstractly. To say it in other words, the individual has not chosen himself [[ethics|ethically]]. He therefore has no connection with [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]], and when that is the case no ethical way of life can be put into practice. But the person who chooses himself ethically chooses himself concretely as this specific individual, and he achieves this concretion because this choice is identical with the [[repentance]], which ratifies the [[choice]]. The individual with these capacities, these inclinations, these drives, these passions, influenced by this specific social milieu, as this specific product of a specific [[Social environment|environment]]. But as he becomes aware of all this, he takes upon himself [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for all of it. He does not hesitate over whether he will take this particular thing or not, for he knows that if he does not do it something much more important will be lost. In the moment of choice, he is in complete isolation, for he withdraws from his social milieu, and yet at the same moment he is in absolute continuity, for he chooses himself as a product. And this choice is freedom’s choice in such a way that in choosing himself as product he can just as well be said to produce himself. At the moment of choice, he is at the point of consummation, for his personality is consummating itself, and yet at the same moment he is at the very beginning, because he is choosing himself according to his freedom. Either/Or Part II, Hong p. 251}}{{Quotation|When in pure thinking mention is made of an immediate unity of reflection-in-itself and reflection-in-the-other and of the annulment of this immediate unity, then something must indeed come between the elements of the immediate unity. What is this? Yes, it is time. But time cannot be assigned a place within pure thinking. What, then, do annulment and transition and a new unity signify? What, if anything, does it mean to think in such a way that one always merely makes a show of it because everything that is said is absolutely revoked? And what does it mean not to admit that one thinks this way but then continually to proclaim from the housetops the positive truth of this pure thinking? Just as existence has joined thinking and existing, inasmuch as an existing person is a thinking person, so are there two media: the medium of abstraction and the medium of actuality. But pure thinking is yet a third medium, very recently invented. It begins, it is said, after the most exhaustive abstraction. Pure thinking is-what shall I say-piously or thoughtlessly unaware of the relation that abstraction still continually has to that from which it abstracts. Here in this pure thinking there is rest for every doubt; here is the eternal positive truth and whatever one cares to say. This means that pure thinking is a phantom. And if Hegelian philosophy is free from all postulates, it has attained this with one insane postulate: the beginning of pure thinking. For the existing person, existing is for him his highest interest, and his interestedness in existing in his actuality. What actuality is cannot be rendered in the language of abstraction. Actuality is an ''inter-esse'' [between being] between thinking and being in the hypothetical unity of abstraction. Abstraction deals with possibility and actuality, but its conception of actuality is a false rendition, since the medium is not actuality but possibility. Only by annulling actuality can abstraction grasp it, but to annul it is precisely to change it into possibility. Within abstraction everything that is said about actuality in the language of abstraction is said within possibility. That is, in the language of actuality all abstraction is related to actuality as a possibility, not to an actuality within abstraction and possibility. Actuality, existence, is the dialectical element in a trilogy, the beginning and end of which cannot be for an existing person, who ''qua'' existing is in the [[dialectic]]al element. Abstraction merges the trilogy. Quite right. But how does it do it? Is abstraction a something that does it, or is it not the act of the abstractor? But the abstractor is, after all, an existing person, and as an existing person is consequently in the dialectical element, which he cannot mediate or merge, least of all absolutely, as long as he is existing. If he does do it, then this must be related as a possibility to actuality, to the existence which he himself is. He must explain how he goes about it-that is, how he as an existing person goes about it, or whether he ceases to be an existing person, and whether an existing person has a right to do that. As soon as we begin to ask such questions, we are asking ethically and are maintaining the claim of the ethical upon the existing person, which cannot be that he is supposed to abstract from existence, but that he is supposed to exist, which is also the existing person’s highest interest. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Vol 1, pp. 314-315 Hong translation}}

===Death===
[[Death]] is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend."&lt;ref&gt;''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong 1992 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death?&lt;ref&gt;''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dread or anxiety===
For Kierkegaard's author, ''Vigilius Haufniensis'', [[anxiety]]/[[Existential dread|dread]]/[[angst]] (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our "dizziness of freedom."&lt;blockquote&gt;Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]] becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, [[anxiety]] is the dizziness of [[Free will|freedom]], which emerges when the spirit wants to [[wikt:Special:Search/posit#Verb|posit]] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, [[psychology]] cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the [[leap of faith|leap]], which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as [[ambiguous]]ly guilty as it is possible to become. Vigilius Haufniensis, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' p. 61.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed [[original sin]], Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.

However, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. ([[Jean-Paul Sartre]] calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.
{{Quotation|Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate. … Anxiety is freedom’s possibility, and only such anxiety is through faith absolutely educative, because it consumes all finite ends and discovers all their deceptiveness. And no [[Tomás de Torquemada|Grand Inquisitor]] has such dreadful torments in readiness as anxiety has, and no secret agent knows as cunningly as anxiety to attack his suspect in his weakest moment or to make alluring the trap in which he will be caught, and no discerning judge understands how to interrogate and examine the accused as does anxiety, which never lets the accused escape, neither through amusement, nor by noise, nor during work, neither by day nor by night.|Vigilius Haufniensis|The Concept of Anxiety pp. 155-156.}}

===Despair===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
{{Quotation|Is despair a merit or a defect? Purely dialectically it is both. If one were to think of despair only in the abstract, without reference to some particular despairer, one would have to say it is an enormous merit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast, and it is an advantage which characterizes him quite otherwise than the upright posture, for it bespeaks the infinite erectness or loftiness of his being spirit. The possibility of this sickness is man’s advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christian’s advantage over natural man; to be cured of this sickness is the Christian’s blessedness. |Anti-Climacus|The Sickness Unto Death p. 45}}

Most emphatically in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'', Kierkegaard's author argues that the human self is a composition of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the "relationship of the two to itself," and a consciousness of "the power that posited" the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the "self" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of [[Existential despair|despair]]. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.
In ''[[Either/Or]]'', ''A'' and ''Judge William'' each has one [[epistolary novel]] in two volumes. The ''A'' is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend ''Judge William,'' argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.
Another perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious "faith." This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite.
In ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', ''Johannes de Silentio'' argues that the choice of [[Abraham]] to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward "the absolute" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be "before god" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts ''with fear and trembling'' that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking.

Despair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''.

The first level is "The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self." Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.

The next level of despair is "The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading "Despair over the earthly."

The second level of conscious despair under the heading "Despair over the eternal." Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God.

The last and lowest form of despair is the desire "In despair to will to be oneself." This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as "demonic despair" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and "Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it." At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer.

===Ethics===
[[File:Abraham.jpg|250px|right|thumb|In [[Fear and Trembling]], Johannes de Silentio analyzes [[Abraham]]'s action to sacrifice [[Isaac]].  Silentio argues that Abraham is a knight of faith.]]
Many philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of ''Johannes de Silentio'') ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a [[divine command theory|divine command]] law of ethics. The divine command theory is a [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by [[God]]; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God ''transcends'' ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the ''[[Teleology|teleological]] suspension of the ethical''. Abraham, the [[knight of faith]], chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of ''Father of Faith''. Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.

But there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).

In ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an "eternal happiness", or the [[salvation]] of the [[soul]] as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, but remember that your soul belongs to God, not to the world. {{Quotation| By now you have easily seen that in his life the ethical individual goes through stages we previously set forth as [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Three stages of life|separate stages]]. He is going to develop in his life the [[Personal identity|personal]], the [[Civics|civic]], the [[religious]] virtues, and his life advances through his continually translating himself from one stage to another. As soon as a person thinks that one of these stages is adequate and that he dares to concentrate on it one-sidedly, he has not chosen himself ethically but has failed to see the significance of either isolation or continuity and above all has not grasped that the truth lies in the identity of the two. The person who has ethically chosen and found himself possess himself defined in his entire concretion. He then possesses himself as an [[individual]] who has these [[Aptitude|capacities]], these [[Passion (emotion)|passions]], these [[wikt:tendency|inclinations]], these [[habit (psychology)|habit]]s, who is subject to these external influences, who is influenced in one direction thus and in another thus. Here he then possesses himself as a task in such a way that it is chiefly to order, shape, temper, inflame, control-in short, to produce an evenness in the soul, a harmony, which is the fruit of the personal virtues.'' Either/Or Part 2'', Hong p. 262}}

{{Quotation|[[Resignation]] has made the [[individual]] face or has seen to it that he face toward an eternal happiness as the [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] ("end", "purpose", or "goal"). This τέλος is not an element among other elements. Thus the both-and of mediation is not much better, even though less naïve, than the previously described jovial chatter that includes everything. At the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice the individual is allowed to salute the absolute τέλος-but then, then comes the mediation. So, too, a dog can be taught to walk on two legs for a moment but then, then comes the mediation, and the dog walks on four legs – mediation also does that. Spiritually understood, a human being’s upright walk is his absolute respect for the absolute τέλος, otherwise he walks on all fours. When it is a matter of relative elements mediation has its significance (that they are all equal before mediation), but when it is a matter of the absolute end or goal, mediation means that the absolute τέλος is reduced to a [[relativism|relative]] τέλος. It is not true, either, that the absolute τέλος becomes concrete in the relative ends, because resignation’s absolute distinction will at every moment safeguard the absolute τέλος against all fraternizing. It is true that the individual oriented toward the absolute τέλος, is in the relative ends, but he is not in them in such a way that the absolute τέλος is exhausted in them. It is true that before God and before the absolute τέλος we are all equal, but it is not true that God or the absolute τέλος is equal with everything else for me or for a particular individual. It may be very commendable for a particular individual to be a councilor of justice, a good worker in the office, no.1 lover in the society, almost a virtuoso on the flute, captain of the popinjay shooting club, superintendent of the orphanage, a noble and respected father-in short, a devil of a fellow who can both-and has time for everything. But let the councilor take care that he does not become too much a devil of a fellow and proceed to do both all this and have time to direct his life toward the absolute τέλος. In other words, this [[both-and]] means that the absolute [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]] is on the same level with everything else. But the absolute τέλος has the remarkable quality of wanting to be the absolute τέλος at every moment. If, then, at the moment of resignation, of collecting oneself, of choice, an individual has understood this, it surely cannot mean that he is supposed to have forgotten it the next moment. Therefore, as I said before, resignation remains in the individual and the task is so far from getting the absolute τέλος [[mediation|mediated]] into all sorts of both-and that, on the contrary, it is to aim at the form of existence that permanently has the pathos of the great moment.

In ''[[Works of Love]]'' and ''Purity of Heart'', Kierkegaard skillfully examines [[Christian ethics]] and the maxim, ''Love Thy Neighbour''.&lt;ref&gt;Here are some verses from the Bible about loving your neighbor [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Bible-Verses-About-Love-Your-Neighbor/ Love thy neighbor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SK.org"&gt;{{cite web | title=D. Anthony Storm | work=Kierkegaard Commentary | url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org | accessdate=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard stressed that it was [[Christianity]] that "discovered the neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;Works of Love, Hong p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Test it, place as the middle term between the lover and the beloved the neighbor, whom one shall love, place as a middle term between two friends the neighbor, whom one shall love, and you will immediately see jealousy. Yet the neighbor is self-denial’s middle term that steps in between self-love’s I and I, but also between erotic love’s and friendship’s I and the other I. .... Love for the neighbor is therefore the eternal equality in loving. Equality is simply not to make distinctions and eternal equality is unconditionally not to make the slightest distinction, unqualifiedly not to make the slightest distinction. The essential Christian is itself too weighty, in its movements too earnest to scurry about, dancing, in the frivolity of such facile talk about the higher, highest, and the supremely highest. Think of the most cultured person, one of whom we all admiringly say, “He is so cultured!” Then think of Christianity, which says to him, “You shall love the neighbor!” of course, a certain social courtesy, a politeness toward all people, a friendly condescension toward inferiors, a boldly confident attitude before the mighty, a beautifully controlled freedom of spirit, yes, this is culture – do you believe that it is also loving the neighbor? With the neighbor you have the equality of a human being before God. God is the middle term. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong p. 44-61}}

===Individuality===
For Kierkegaard, true [[individual]]ity is called selfhood. Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our [[pleasure]]s—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in ''Either/Or'', &lt;blockquote&gt;Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because if there is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little [[teleology]] as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and [[contemplate]] life. Now you rest in despair. [[Absurdism|Nothing concerns you]]; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 195-196, 272ff&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Sickness Unto Death]]'' specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a "self" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation.

An individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in "the public" (or "the crowd" or "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]] Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. &lt;blockquote&gt;In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. ''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the [[false idol]] of "the public", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In [[Works of Love]] he writes, {{Quotation| To bring about similarity among people in the world, to apportion to people, if possible equally, the conditions of temporality, is indeed something that preoccupies worldliness to a high degree. But even what we may call the well-intentioned worldly effort in this regard never comes to an understanding with Christianity. Well-intentioned worldliness remains piously, if you will, convinced that there must be one temporal condition, one earthly dissimilarity – found by means of calculations and surveys or in whatever other way – that is [[Liberalism|equality]]. ''Works of Love'', by Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong 1995 pp. 71-72 see pp. 61-90}}

Although Kierkegaard attacked "the public", he is supportive of communities:
{{Quotation|In community, the individual is, crucial as the prior condition for forming a community. … Every individual in the community guarantees the community; the public is a chimera, numerality is everything…|Søren Kierkegaard|Journals&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

===Pathos (passion)===
For Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute. Kierkegaard names this desire ''Passion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.uab.cat/pub/enrahonar/0211402Xn29p119.pdf Kangas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this philosophy, some scholars have drawn similarities between the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] concept of [[Apatheia]] and Subjective Truth as the highest form of Wisdom. For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/?id=-01DAM9kgEMC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=apathy+kierkegaard], Kierkegaard and the Greek World: Aristotle and other Greek authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond [[reason]]. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to [[Plato]], is a kind of desire for [[immortality]]—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. [[Erotic love]] itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of [[time]] and [[space]]. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. {{Quotation|If anyone is unwilling to learn from Christianity to love himself in the right way, he cannot love the neighbor either. He can perhaps hold together with another or a few other persons, “through thick and thin,” as it is called, but this is by no means loving the neighbor. To love yourself in the right way and to love the neighbor correspond perfectly to one another, fundamentally they are one and the same thing. When the Law’s ''as yourself'' has wrested from you the self-love that Christianity sadly enough must [[presuppose]] to be in every human being, then you actually have learned to love yourself. The Law is therefore: you shall love yourself in the same way as you love your neighbor when you love him as yourself.

Whoever has any [[knowledge]] of people will certainly admit that just as he has often wished to be able to move them to relinquish self-love, he has also had to wish that it were possible to teach them to love themselves. When the bustler wastes his time and powers in the service of the futile, [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inconsequential inconsequential] pursuits, is that not because he has not [[learn]]ed rightly to love himself? When the light-minded person throws himself almost like a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonentity nonentity] into the folly of the moment and makes nothing of it, is this not because he does not know how to love himself rightly?

When the depressed person desires to be rid of life, indeed of himself, is this not because he is unwilling to learn earnestly and rigorously to love himself? When someone surrenders to [[despair (emotion)|despair]] because the world or another person has faithlessly left him betrayed, what then is his fault (his innocent suffering is not referred to here) except not loving himself in the right way? When someone self-tormentingly thinks to do God a service by torturing himself, what is his sin except not willing to love himself in the right way? And if, alas, a person presumptuously lays violent hands upon himself, is not his sin precisely this, that he does not rightly love himself in the sense in which a person ''ought'' to love himself?

Oh, there is a lot of talk in the world about treachery, and faithlessness, and, God help us, it is unfortunately all too true, but still let us never because of this forget that the most dangerous traitor of all is the one every person has within himself. This treachery whether it consists in selfishly loving oneself or consists in selfishly not willing to love oneself in the right way – this treachery is admittedly a secret. No cry is raised as it usually is in the case of treachery and faithlessness. But is it not therefore all the more important that Christianity’s doctrine should be brought to mind again and again, that a person shall love his neighbor as himself, that is as he ought to love himself?  …  You shall love – this, then is the word of the [[Great Commandment|royal Law]]. ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 22-24}}

One can also look at this from the perspective of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.

Passion is closely aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. [[Faith]] as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.

Kierkegaard wrote of the subjective thinker's task in his ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the [[objectification]] of religion.{{Quotation|There is an old proverb: ''oratio, tentatio, meditatio, faciunt theologum'' [prayer, trial, meditation, make a theologian]. Similarly, for a subjective thinker, [[imagination]], [[feeling]] and dialectics in impassioned existence-inwardness are required. But first and last, passion, because for an existing person it is impossible to think about existence without becoming passionate, inasmuch as existing is a prodigious contradiction from which the subjective thinker is not to abstract, for then it is easy, but in which he is to remain. In a world-historical dialectic, individuals fade away into humankind; in a dialectic such as that it is impossible to discover you and me, an individual existing human being, even if new magnifying glasses for the concrete are invented. The subjective thinker is a [[dialectic]]ian oriented to the [[existential]]; he has the intellectual passion to hold firm the qualitative disjunction. But, on the other hand, if the qualitative disjunction is used flatly and simply, if it is applied altogether abstractly to the [[individual]] [[human]] [[being]], then one can run the ludicrous risk of saying something infinitely decisive, and of being right in what one says, and still not say the least thing. Therefore, in the psychological sense it is really remarkable to see the absolute disjunction deceitfully used simply for evasion. When the death penalty is placed on every crime, the result is that no crimes at all are punished. It is the same with the absolute disjunction when applied flatly and simply; it is just like a silent letter-it cannot be pronounced or, if it can be pronounced, it says nothing. The [[Subjectivity|subjective]] [[Intellectual|thinker]], therefore, has with intellectual [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] the absolute disjunction as belonging to existence, but he has it as the final decision that prevents everything from ending in a quantifying. Thus he has it readily available, but not in such a way that by abstractly recurring to it, he just frustrates [[existence]]. The subjective thinker, therefore, has also [[esthetic]] passion and [[ethics|ethical]] passion, whereby concretion is gained. All existence-issues are passionate, because existence, if one becomes [[conscious]] of it, involves passion. To think about them so as to leave out passion is not to think about them at all, is to forget the point that one indeed is oneself and existing person. Yet the subjective thinker is not a poet even if he is also a poet, not an ethicist even if he is also an ethicist, but is also a dialectician and is himself essentially existing, whereas the poet’s existence is inessential in relation to the poem, and likewise the ethicist’s in relation to the teaching, and the dialectician’s in relation to the thought. The subjective thinker is not a scientist-scholar; he is an artist. To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is esthetic enough for his life to have esthetic content, ethical enough to [[Regulation|regulate]] it, dialectical enough in thinking to master it. The subjective thinker’s task is to understand himself in existence. pp. 350-351}}

===Subjectivity&lt;!--linked from 'Perspectivism'--&gt;===

''Johannes Climacus'', in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'', writes the following cryptic line: "[[Subjectivity]] is Truth". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual ''who he is in distinction from others''. It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the ''unique'' relationship between the subject and object.

Johann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]''. &lt;blockquote&gt;I must, however, remind my reader that the "I" who speaks in the book is not the author himself, but it is his earnest wish that the reader should himself assume this character, and that he should not rest contented with a mere historical apprehension of what is here said, but really and truly, during reading, hold converse with himself, deliberate, draw conclusions, and form resolutions, like his representative in the book, and, by his own labour and reflection, developed out of his own soul, and build up within himself, that mode of thought the mere picture of which is laid before him in the work. Preface&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature—or perhaps the truth of [[history]]. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans.

In most respects, Climacus did not have problems with [[science]] or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws—and by doing so could ascertain what a human’s true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'': {{Quotation|It is the existing [[spirit]] who asks about [[truth]], presumably because he wants to exist in it, but in any case the questioner is [[conscious]] of being an existing individual human being. In this way I believe I am able to make myself understandable to every Greek and to every [[Rationality|rational]] human being. If a German philosopher follows his inclination to put on an act and first transforms himself into a superrational something, just as alchemists and sorcerers bedizen themselves fantastically, in order to answer the question about truth in an extremely satisfying way, this is of no more concern to me than his satisfying answer, which no doubt is extremely satisfying-if one is fantastically dressed up. But whether a German philosopher is or is not doing this can easily be ascertained by anyone who with enthusiasm concentrates his soul on willing to allow himself to be guided by a sage of that kind, and uncritically just uses his guidance compliantly by willing to form his [[existence]] according to it. When a person as a [[learner]] enthusiastically relates in this way to such a German professor, he accomplishes the most superb epigram upon him, because a speculator of that sort is anything but served by a learner’s honest and enthusiastic zeal for expressing and accomplishing, for existentially appropriating his [[wisdom]], since this wisdom is something that the Herr Professor himself has [[imagination|imagined]] and has written books about but has never attempted himself. It has not even occurred to him that it should be done. Like the customers clerk who, in the belief that his business was merely to write, wrote what he himself could not read, so there are speculative thinkers who merely write, and write that which, if it is to be read with the aid of action, if I may put it that way, proves to be nonsense, unless it is perhaps intended only for fantastical beings. P. 191}}

Hegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.

Subjectivity is that which the individual—and no one else—has. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a [[car]] or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: {{Quotation|We are truly reluctant to make a young person arrogant prematurely and teach him to get busy judging the world. God forbid that anything we say should be able to contribute to developing this malady in a person. Indeed, we think we ought to make his life so strenuously inwardly that from the very beginning he has something else to think about, because it no doubt is a morbid hatred of the world that, perhaps without having considered the enormous responsibility, wants to be persecuted. But on the other hand we are also truly reluctant to deceive a young person by suppressing the difficulty and by suppressing it at the very moment we endeavor to recommend Christianity, inasmuch as that is the very moment we speak. We put our confidence in boldly daring to praise Christianity, also with the addition that in the world its reward, to put it mildly, is ingratitude. We regard it as our duty continually to speak about it in advance, so that we do not sometimes praise Christianity with an omission of what is essentially difficult, and at other times, perhaps on the occasion of a particular text, hit upon a few grounds of comfort for the person tried and tested in life. No, just when Christianity is being praised most strongly, the difficulty must simultaneously be emphasized. (….) Christianly the world’s opposition stands in an essential relationship to the inwardness of Christianity. Moreover, the person who chooses Christianity should at that very moment have an impression of its difficulty so that he can know what it is that he is choosing. Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, Hong 1995, pp. 193-194}}

The goal of life, according to [[Socrates]], is to know thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' {{Quotation|Everyone must make an accounting to God as an individual; the king must make an accounting to God as an individual, and the most wretched beggar must make an accounting to God as an individual – lest anyone be arrogant by being more than an individual, lest anyone despondently think that he is not an individual, perhaps because in the busyness of the world he does not even have a name but is designated only by a number. What else, indeed, is the accounting of eternity than that the voice of conscience is installed eternally in its eternal right to be the only voice!...Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God; are you living in such a way that this awareness can acquire the time and stillness and liberty to withdraw from life, from an honorable occupation, from a happy domestic life – on the contrary, that awareness will support and transfigure and illuminate your conduct in the relationships of life. You are not to withdraw and sit brooding over your eternal accounting, whereby you only take on a new responsibility. You will find more and more time for your duties and tasks, while concern for your eternal responsibility will keep you from being busy and from busily taking part in everything possible – an activity that can best be called a waste of time...Have you made up your mind about how you want to perform your work, or are you continually of two minds because you want to be in agreement with the crowd? Do you stick to your bid, not defiantly, not despondently, but eternally concerned; do you, unchanged, continue to bid on the same thing and want to buy only the same thing while the terms are variously being changed?...Are you hiding nothing suspicious in your soul, so that you would still wish things were different, so that you would dare robber-like to seize the reward for yourself, would dare to parade it, would dare to point to it; so that you would wish the adversity did not exist because it constrains in you the selfishness that, although suppressed, yet foolishly deludes you into thinking that if you were lucky you would do something for the good that would be worth talking about, deludes you into forgetting that the devout wise person wishes no adversity away when it befalls him because he obviously cannot know whether it might not indeed be a good for him, into forgetting that the devout wise person wins his most beautiful victory when the powerful one who persecuted him wants, as they say, to spare him, and the wise one replies: I cannot unconditionally wish it, because I cannot definitely know whether the persecution might not indeed be a good for me. Are you doing good only out of the fear of punishment, so that you scowl even when you will the good, so that in your dreams at night you wish the punishment away and to that extent also the good, and in your daydreams delude yourself into thinking that one can serve the good with a slavish mind? 
* Soren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong pp. 127-140}}

Subjectivity comes with consciousness of myself as a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.

Kierkegaard decided to step up to the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] for himself, replacing [[Adam]], and make his [[choice]] in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in ''Fear and Trembling''. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about [[culpability|guilt]] and [[innocence]]. His book, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.

In [[Kierkegaard]]'s meaning, purely theological assertions are [[subjective truth]]s and they cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Robert C. Solomon, No Excuses: Existentialism and the Meaning of Life, The Great Courses, The Teaching Company, http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=437&lt;/ref&gt; For him, choosing if one is for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a [[leap of faith]], since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; For him the Christian faith is the result of the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices).&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt; Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

===Three stages of life&lt;!--linked from 'Søren Kierkegaard'--&gt;===
Early American Kierkegaard scholars tried to reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. "Early American scholars" and "European circles" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against "reflecting oneself out of reality" and partitioning the "world of the spirit" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. He wrote about Hegel's stages in his book, ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion'': {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;These stages may be compared to those of the ages of man. The child is still in the primal immediate unity of the will with nature, as representing both his own nature and the nature which surrounds him. The second stage, adolescence, when individuality is in process of becoming independent, is the living spirituality, the vitality of Spirit, which while setting no end before it as yet, moves forward, has aspirations, and takes an interest in everything which comes its way. The third is the age of manhood; this is the period of work for a particular end, to which the man makes himself subserviently, to which he devotes his energies. Finally, old age might be considered as a last stage, which having the Universal before it as an end, and recognizing this end, has turned back from the particular interests of life and work to the universal aim, the absolute final end, and has, as it were, gathered itself together out of the wide and manifold interests of actual outward existence and concentrated itself in the infinite depths of its inner life. Such are the determinations which follow in a logical manner from the nature of the Notion. At the close it will become apparent that even the original immediacy does not exist as immediacy, but is something posited. The child itself is something begotten.  George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel,  ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion vol 1'' translated by Rev. E B Speiers 1895 p. 266ff&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/philosophyofreli01hegeuoft#page/n283/mode/1up ''Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion vol 1''] also see Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, March 13, 1847 by Soren Kierkegaard, copyright 1993 by Howard Hong, Princeton University Press p. 12ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the world of the spirit, the different stages are not like cities on a journey, about which it is quite all right for the traveler to say directly, for example: We left Peking and came to Canton and were in Canton on the fourteenth. A traveler like that changes places, not himself; and thus it is alright for him to mention and to recount the change in a direct, unchanged form. But in the world of the spirit to change place is to be changed oneself, and there all direct assurance of having arrived here and there is an attempt a la [[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]].

I ask for nothing better than to be known in our ''objective'' times as the only person who was not capable of being objective. That subjectivity, inwardness, is truth, that existing is the decisive factor, that this was the way to take to Christianity, which is precisely inwardness, but please note, not every inwardness, which was why the preliminary stages definitely had to be insisted upon-that was my idea, I thought that I had found a similar endeavor in the pseudonymous writings, and I have tried to make clear my interpretation of them and their relation to my ''[[Philosophical Fragments|Fragments]]''.

In one popular interpretation of stage theory, each of the so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Works of Love'' and ''Practice in Christianity''&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|1=Back to the ''[[Stages on Life's Way|Stages]]''. It is markedly different from ''[[Either/Or]]'' by a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|tripartition]]. There are three stages, an esthetic, an ethical, a religious, yet not [[Abstract object|abstract]] as the immediate mediate, the unity, but concrete in the qualification of existence categories as pleasure-perdition, action-victory, suffering. But despite this tripartition, the book is nevertheless an either/or. That is, the ethical and the religious stages have an essential relation to each other. The inadequacy of ''Either/Or'' is simply that the work ended ethically, as has been shown. In ''Stages'' that has been made clear, and the religious is maintained in its place. .... A story of suffering; suffering is the religious category.

He did not say, "Peter must first change and become another person before I can love him again." No, he said exactly the opposite, "Peter is Peter, and I love him. My love, if anything will help him to become another person." Therefore he did not break off the friendship in order perhaps to renew it if Peter would have become another person; no, he preserved the friendship unchanged and in that way helped Peter to become another person. Do you think that Peter would have been won again without Christ's faithful friendship? But it is so easy to be a friend when this means nothing else than to request something in particular from the friend and, if the friend does not respond to the request, then to let the friendship cease, until it perhaps begins again if he responds to the request. Is this a relationship of friendship? Who is closer to helping an erring one than the person who calls himself his friend, even if the offense is committed against the friend! But the friend withdraws and says (indeed, it is as if a third person were speaking): When he has become another person, then perhaps he can become my friend again. We are not far from regarding such behavior as magnanimous. But truly we are far from being able to say of such a friend that in loving he loves the person he sees. Christ’s love was boundless, as it must be if this is to be fulfilled: in loving to love the person one sees. This is very easy to perceive. However much and in whatever way a person is changed, he still is not changed in such a way that he becomes invisible. If this-the impossible-is not the case, then of course we do see him, and the duty is to love the person one sees. Ordinarily we think that if a person has essentially changed for the worse, he is then so changed that we are exempt from loving him. But Christianity asks: Can you because of this change no longer see him? The answer to that must be: Certainly I can see him; I see that he is no longer worth loving. But if you see this, then you do not really see him (which you certainly cannot deny you are doing in another sense), you see only the unworthiness and the imperfection and thereby admit that when you loved him you did not see ''him'' in another sense but merely saw his excellence and perfections, which you loved. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 172-173

When a person to whom the possible pertains relates himself equally to the duality of the possible, we say: He expects. To expect contains within itself the same duality that the possible has, and to expect is to relate oneself to the possible purely and simply as such. Then the relationship divides according to the way the expecting person chooses. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which for that very reason cannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope. To relate oneself expectancy to the possibility of evil is to fear. But both the one who hopes and the one who fears are expecting. As soon, however, as the choice is made, the possible is changed, because the possibility of the good is the eternal. It is only in the moment of contact that the duality of the possible is equal; therefore, by the decision to choose hope, one decided infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision.

People think that they are speaking with ample experience in dividing a person’s life into certain periods and ages and then call the first period the age of hope or of possibility. What nonsense! Thus, in talk about hope they completely leave out the eternal and yet speak about hope. But how is this possible, since hope pertains to the possibility of the good, and thereby to the eternal! On the other hand, how is it possible to speak about hope in such a way that it is assigned to a certain age! Surely the eternal extends over the whole of life and there is and should be hope to the end; then there is no period that is the age of hope, but a person’s whole life should be the time of hope! And then they think they are speaking with ample experience about hope-by abolishing the eternal. 
*Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'' (1847) Hong 1995 p. 249-251}}

====Stage one: aesthetic====
Kierkegaard was interested in [[aesthetics]], and is sometimes referred to as the "poet-philosopher" because of the passionate way in which he approached [[philosophy]]. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were "on stage." There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author ''A'' is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;You love the accidental. A smile from a pretty girl in an interesting situation, a stolen glance, that is what you are hunting for, that is a motif for your aimless fantasy. You who always pride yourself on being an observateur must, in return, put up with becoming an object of observation. Ah, you are a strange fellow, one moment a child, the next an old man; one moment you are thinking most earnestly about the most important scholarly problems, how you will devote your life to them, and the next you are a lovesick fool. But you are a long way from marriage. ''Either/Or Part II'' p. 7-8&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Just consider, your life is passing; for you, too, the time will eventually come even to you when your life is at an end, when you are no longer shown any further possibilities in life, when recollection alone is left, recollection, but not in the sense in which you love it so much, this mixture of fiction and truth, but the earnest and faithful recollection of your conscience. Beware that it does not unroll a list for you-presumably not of actual crimes but of wasted possibilities, showdown pictures it will be impossible for you to drive away. The [[intellectual]] agility you possess is very becoming to youth and diverts the eye for a time. We are astonished to see a clown whose joints are so loose that all the restraints of man’s gait and posture are annulled. You are like that in an intellectual sense; you can just as well stand on your head as on your feet. Everything is [[Logical possibility|possible]] for you, and you can surprise yourself and others with this possibility, but it is unhealthy, and for your own peace of mind I beg you to watch out lest that which is an advantage to you end by becoming a curse. Any man who has a conviction cannot at his pleasure turn himself and everything topsy-turvy in this way. Therefore I do not warn you against the world but against yourself and the world against you. ''Either/Or II'', Hong p. 16&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage two: ethical====
The second level of existence is the ethical. This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for [[goodness and value theory|good]] and [[evil]] and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls [[repentance]]. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with [[Dharma]] - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as "dharma", though dharma is also a [[law]]). &lt;blockquote&gt;"He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely." ....  “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product." .... "It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam."  ... "The [[Either/Or]] I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose ''eo ipso'' the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice." Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Judge Wilhelm," a pseudonymous author of ''Either/Or'' and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. 
{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The Christian God is spirit and Christianity is spirit, and there is discord between the flesh and the spirit but the flesh is not the sensuous-it is the selfish. In this sense, even the spiritual can become sensuous-for example, if a person took his spiritual gifts in vain, he would then be carnal. And of course I know that it is not necessary for the Christian that Christ must have been physically beautiful; and it would be grievous-for a reason different from the one you give-because if beauty were some essential, how the believer would long to see him; but from all this it by no means follows that the sensuous is annihilated in Christianity. The first love has the element of beauty in itself, and the joy and fullness that are in the sensuous in its innocence can very well be caught up in Christianity. But let us guard against one thing, a wrong turn that is more dangerous than the one you wish to avoid; let us not become too spiritual. Either/Or Part II p. 50&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question, namely, is this: Can this love be actualized? After having conceded everything up to this point, you perhaps will say: Well, it is just as difficult to actualize marriage as to actualize first love. To that I must respond: No, for in marriage there is a law of motion. First love remains an unreal [[Noumenon#Positive and negative noumena|in itself]] that never acquires inner substance because it moves only in the external medium. In the ethical and religious intention, marital love has the possibility of an inner history and is as different from first love as the historical is from the unhistorical. This love is strong, stronger than the whole world, but the moment it doubts it is annihilated; it is like a sleepwalker who is able to walk the most dangerous places with the complete security but plunges down when someone calls his name. Marital love is armed, for in the intention not only is attentiveness directed to the surrounding world but the will is directed toward itself, toward the inner world. Either/Or II p. 94&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The choice itself is crucial for the content of the personality: through the choice the personality submerges itself in that which is being chosen, and when it does not choose, it withers away in atrophy. ... Imagine a captain of a ship the moment a shift of direction must be made; then he may be able to say: I can do either this or that. But if he is not a mediocre captain he will also be aware that during all this the ship is ploughing ahead with its ordinary velocity, and thus there is but a single moment when it is inconsequential whether he does this or does that. So also with a person-if he forgets to take into account the velocity-there eventually comes a moment where it is no longer a matter of an Either/Or, not because he has chosen, but because he has refrained from it, which also can be expressed by saying: Because others have chosen for him-or because he has lost himself. Either/Or II p. 163-164&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

====Stage three: religious====
The ethical and the [[religious]] are intimately connected:  a person can be ethically serious without being religious, but the religious stage includes the ethical. Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some [[Moral absolutism|moral absolute]], living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' like this: {{Quotation|Johannes the [[Seducer]] ends with the [[thesis]] that woman is only the moment. This in its general sense is the essential esthetic thesis, that the moment is all and to that extent, in turn, essentially nothing, just as the [[Sophist]]ic thesis that everything is true is that nothing is true. On the whole the conception of [[time]] is the decisive element in every standpoint up to the paradox, which paradoxically accentuates time. To the degree that time is accentuated, to the same degree there is movement from the esthetic, the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], to the [[ethical]], the religious, and the [[Christian]]-religious. Where Johannes the Seducer ends, the Judge begins: Woman’s beauty increases with the years. Here time is accentuated ethically, but still not in such a way that precludes the possibility of recollection’s withdrawal out of [[existence]] into the [[Immortality|eternal]]. p. 298-299

If a man like Kant, standing on the pinnacle of scientific scholarship, were to say in reference to demonstrations of the existence of God: Well, I do not know anything more about that than that my father told me it was so-this is humorous and actually says more than a whole book about demonstrations, if the book forgets this. p. 552-553}}

The Kierkegaardian pseudonyms who speak of stage theory consider religion to be the highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called ''Religiousness A'' and ''Religiousness B''.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' p. 555ff&lt;/ref&gt; One type is symbolized by the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Socrates]], whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is [[sin]]ful and is the source of untruth.  In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the [[paradox]] that is [[Jesus]], the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—[[Attributes of God in Christianity#Transcendence|God, the transcendent]], coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. &lt;blockquote&gt;The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity came up with the idea that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. ''The Sickness Unto Death'', Hannay, 1989 p. 115&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. … The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. … To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin. ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong, 1991, p. 67-68&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Kierkegaard's thoughts on other philosophers==

===Kierkegaard and Fichte===
[[File:Johann Gottlieb Fichte.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fichte]] Kierkegaard wrote much about [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] in his thesis ''[[The Concept of Irony]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Concept of Irony'', p. 272ff&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in his first book ''[[De omnibus dubitandum est]]'', written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals. Fichte wrote the book ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800) which called for a progression in the life of the human being from doubt to knowledge and then to faith. ''De omnibus dubitandum est'' is from Descartes and means everything must be doubted. Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: "In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative. But in order for subjectivity to get out of this movement of emptiness in which it moved in infinite abstraction, it had to be negated; in order for thought to become actual, it had to become concrete."&lt;ref&gt;Soren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Irony, Hong p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by — to use the words of another author — Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and [[Robespierre]]'s attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment — whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong — both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.     Soren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', Our Journalistic Literature November 28, 1835}}

===Kierkegaard and Hegel===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|150px|thumb|Hegel]]
Many philosophers think that one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.
{{Quotation | Now everything is set in motion, and usually this also involves making the system popular — per systema influxus physici it lays hold of all men. How [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was treated in his time is well known, and therefore I need only mention the infinite mass of lexicons, summaries, popular presentations, and explanations for everyman, etc. And how did Hegel fare later, Hegel, the most modern [[philosopher]], who because of his rigorous form would most likely command silence? Has not the logical trinity been advanced in the most ludicrous way? And therefore it did not astound me that my shoemaker had found that it could also be applied to the development of boots, since, as he observes, the dialectic, which is always the first stage in life, finds expression even here, however insignificant this may seem, in the squeaking, which surely has not escaped the attention of some more profound research psychologist. Unity, however, appears only later, in which respect his shoes far surpass all others, which usually disintegrate in the dialectic, a unity which reached the highest level in that pair of boots Carl XII wore on his famous ride, and since he as an orthodox shoemaker proceeded from the thesis that the immediate (feet without shoes — shoes without feet) is a pure [[abstraction]] and took it [the dialectical] as the first stage in the development. And now our modern [[politicians]]! By veritably taking up Hegel, they have given a striking example of the way one can serve two masters, in that their revolutionary striving is paired with a life-outlook which is a remedy for it, an excellent remedy for lifting part of the illusion which is necessary for encouraging their fantastic striving. And the actuality of the [[phenomenon]] will surely not be denied if one recalls that the words "immediate or spontaneous unity" occur just as necessarily in every scientific-scholarly treatise as a brunette or a blonde in every well-ordered romantic household. At the happy moment everyone received a copy of Holy Scriptures, in which there was one book which was almost always too brief and sometimes almost invisible, and this was, I regret — the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. And how curious it is to note that the present age, whose social striving is trumpeted quite enough, is ashamed of the monks and nuns of the [[Middle Ages]], when at the same time, to confine ourselves to our own native land, a society has been formed here which seems to embrace almost the entire kingdom and in which a speaker began thus: Dear Brothers and Sisters. How remarkable to see them censure the Jesuitry of the Middle Ages, since precisely the liberal development, as does every one-sided enthusiasm, has led and must lead to that. And now Christianity — how has it been treated? I share entirely your disapproval of the way every Christian concept has become so volatilized, so completely dissolved in a mass of fog, that it is beyond all recognition. To the concepts of faith, incarnation, tradition, inspiration, which in the Christian sphere are to lead to a particular historical fact, the philosophers choose to give an entirely different, ordinary meaning, whereby faith has become the immediate consciousness, which essentially is nothing other than the vitale Fluidum of mental life, its atmosphere, and tradition has become the content of a certain experience of the world, while inspiration has become nothing more than God's breathing of the life-spirit into man, and incarnation no more than the presence of one or another idea in one or more individuals. — Journals IA 328 1836 or 1837}}

In a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote:
{{Quotation|If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived.  As it is, he is merely comic. |Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1844&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;)}}

While Kierkegaard was a student of theology at the University of Copenhagen, [[Hegelianism]] had become increasingly popular. [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] were key figures in Danish Hegelianism. Kierkegaard remarked in his journal on 17 May 1843 that Heiberg's writings were "borrowed" from Hegel, implying Heiberg would have been a nobody without Hegel.

Kierkegaard objected to Hegel's claim that he had devised a system of thought that could explain the whole of reality, with a [[Dialectical#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] analysis of history leading the way to this whole. Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity - including the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|doctrine of Incarnation]], a God who is also human - cannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. {{Quotation|Let a doubting youth, but an existing doubter with youth’s lovable, boundless confidence in a hero of scientific scholarship, venture to find in Hegelian positivity the truth, the truth of existence-he will write a dreadful epigram on Hegel. Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean that every youth is capable of overcoming Hegel, far from it. If a young person is conceited and foolish enough to try that, his attack is inane. No, the youth must never think of wanting to attack him; he must rather be willing to submit unconditionally to Hegel with feminine devotedness, but nevertheless with sufficient strength also to stick to his question-then he is a satirist without suspecting it. The youth is an existing doubter; continually suspended in [[doubt]], he grasps for the truth-so that he can exist in it. Consequently, he is negative, and Hegel’s philosophy is, of course, positive-no wonder he puts his trust in it. But for an existing person pure thinking is a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] when the truth is supposed to be the truth in which to exist. Having to exist with the help of the guidance of pure thinking is like having to travel in Denmark with a small map of Europe on which Denmark is no larger than a steel pen-point, indeed, even more impossible. The youth’s admiration, his enthusiasm, and his limitless confidence in Hegel are precisely the satire on Hegel. This would have been discerned long ago if pure thinking had not maintained itself with the aid of a reputation that impresses people, so that they dare not say anything except that it is superb, that they have understood it-although in a certain sense that it is indeed impossible, since no one can be led by this philosophy to understand himself, which is certainly an absolute condition for all other understanding. Socrates has rather ironically said that he did not know for sure whether he was a human being or something else, but in the confessional a Hegelian can say with all solemnity: I do not know whether I am a human being-but I have understood the system. I prefer to say: I know that I am a human being, and I know that I have not understood the system. And when I have said that very directly, I shall add that if any of our Hegelians want to take me into hand and assist me to an understanding of the system, nothing will stand in the way from my side. In order that I can learn all the more, I shall try hard to be as obtuse as possible, so as not to have, if possible, a single presupposition except my ignorance. And in order to be sure of learning something, I shall try hard to be as indifferent as possible to all charges of being unscientific and unscholarly. Existing, if this is to be understood as just any sort of existing, cannot be done without passion.

To refute Hegel's claim that Christianity should be understood as a part of the necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of [[Abraham]] to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.
{{Quotation|Kierkegaard's strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader. … Kierkegaard's tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce an elaborate parody of Hegel's entire system. The pseudonymous authorship, from ''[[Either/Or]]'' to ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]'', presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is designed to lead readers away from knowledge rather than towards it.|Søren Kierkegaard|[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/#Rhet William McDonald]}}

By doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic ''would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything'', which Hegel called the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Theology|Dogmatics]] must not explain [[Original Sin|hereditary sin]] but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance that he was in the German sense a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] on a large scale, because he ''a tout prix'' [at any price] must explain all things. ''The Concept of Anxiety'', by Reidar Thomte Princeton University Press 1980 P. 20&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section ''Spheres of existence'' for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]].

This process of reconciliation leads to a "both/and" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work ''[[Either/Or]]'' is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between "A" and "B" (Judge Vilhelm) in ''Either/Or'' and ''Stages on Life's Way''.

Here are two more from 1846
{{Quotation|As is well known, Hegelian philosophy has canceled the principle of contradiction, and Hegel himself has more than once emphatically held judgment day on the kind of thinkers who remained in the sphere of understanding and reflection and who have therefore insisted that there is an either/or. Since that time, it has become a popular game, so that as soon as someone hints at an aut/aut [either/or] a Hegelian comes riding trip-trap-trap on horse and wins a victory and rides home again. Among us, too, the Hegelians have several times been on the move, especially against Bishop Mynster, in order to win [[Continental philosophy|speculative]] thought’s brilliant victory; and [[Jacob Peter Mynster|Bishop Mynster]], has more than once become a defeated standpoint, even though for being a defeated standpoint he is holding up very well, and it is rather to be feared that the enormous exertion of the victory has been too exhausting to the undefeated victors. And yet there may be a misunderstanding at the root at the conflict and the victory, Hegel is perfectly and absolutely right in maintaining that, looked at eternally, ''sub specie aeterni'', there is no aut/aut [[either/or]] in the language of abstraction, in [[pure thought]] and pure being. Where the devil would it be, since abstraction, after all, simply removes the contradiction; therefore Hegel and the Hegelians should instead take the trouble to explain what is meant by the masquerade of getting contradiction, movement, transition, etc. into logic. The defenders of aut/aut are in the wrong if they push their way into the territory of pure thinking and want to defend their cause there. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, Volume I'' p. 305}}
{{Quotation | According to Hegel the truth is the continuous world-historical process. Each generation, each stage of this process, is legitimated and yet is only an element of the truth. Short of resorting to a bit of charlatanry, which helps by assuming that the generation in which Hegel lived or the one after him is ''[[imprimatur]]'', and this generation is the last and [[History of the world|world history]] is past, we are all implicated in [[skepticism]]. The passionate question of truth does not even come up, because philosophy has first tricked the [[individual]]s into becoming [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]. The positive Hegelian truth is just as deceptive as happiness was in paganism. Not until afterward does one come to know whether or not one has been happy, and thus the next generation comes to know what truth was in the preceding generation. The great secret of the system is close to [[Protagoras]]’s [[sophism]] “[[Relativism|Everything is relative]]”, except that here everything is relative in the continuous process. But no living soul is served by that … ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]] Volume I'', by Johannes Climacus, edited by Søren Kierkegaard, Copyright 1846 – Edited and Translated by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong 1992, Princeton University Press. Note p. 33}}

The whole idea of one generation spending all its time studying past generations and then the next generation spending their time studying past generations and making moral and social comments about preceding generations was called, "The Hegelian cud-chewing process with three-stomachs - first immediacy - then regurgitation - then down again." He said, "Maybe a succeeding master-mind could continue this with four stomachs, etc., down once more and up again. I don't know if the master-mind grasps what I mean."&lt;ref&gt;Journals and Papers 25 August 1936 1A229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard and Schelling===
[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling.png|150px|thumb|Schelling]]
In 1841–1842, Kierkegaard attended the [[Berlin]] lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]. Schelling was a critic of [[Georg Hegel]] and a professor at the [[University of Berlin]]. The university started a lecture series given by Schelling in order to espouse a type of [[positive philosophy]] which would be diametrically opposed to [[Hegelianism]]. Kierkegaard was initially delighted with Schelling. Before he left Copenhagen to attend Schelling's lectures in Berlin, he wrote to his friend Peter Johannes Sprang:
{{Quotation|Schelling lectures to a select, numerous, and yet also ''undique conflatum auditorium''. During the first lectures it was almost a matter of risking one's life to hear him. I have never in my life experienced such uncomfortable crowding — still, what would one not do to be able to hear Schelling? His main point is always that there are two philosophies, one positive and one negative. The negative is given, but not by Hegel, for Hegel's is neither negative nor positive but a refined Spinozaism. The positive is yet to come. In other words, in the future it will not be only the lawyers who become the ''doctores juris utriusque'', for I venture to flatter myself that without submitting another dissertation I shall become a ''magister philosophiae utriusque''.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

At Berlin, Kierkegaard gave high praises to Schelling. In a journal entry made sometime around October or November 1841, Kierkegaard wrote this piece about Schelling's second lecture:
{{Quotation|I am so pleased to have heard Schelling's second lecture -- indescribably! I have sighed for long enough and my thoughts have sighed within me; when he mentioned the word, "reality" in connection with the relation of philosophy to reality the fruit of my thought leapt for joy within me. I remember almost every word he said from that moment on.  … Now I have put all my hopes in Schelling!|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1841)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

As time went on, however, Kierkegaard, as well as many in Schelling's audience, began to become disillusioned with Schelling. In a particularly insulting letter about Schelling, Kierkegaard wrote to his brother, Peter Kierkegaard:
{{Quotation|Schelling drivels on quite intolerably! If you want to form some idea what this is like then I ask you to submit yourself to the following experiment as a sort of self-inflicted sadistic punishment. Imagine person R's meandering philosophy, his entirely aimless, haphazard knowledge, and person Hornsyld's untiring efforts to display his learning: imagine the two combined and in addition to an impudence hitherto unequalled by any philosopher; and with that picture vividly before your poor mind go to the workroom of a prison and you will have some idea of Schelling's philosophy. He even lectures longer to prolong the torture. … Consequently, I have nothing to do in Berlin. I am too old to attend lectures and Schelling is too old to give them. So I shall leave Berlin as soon as possible. But if it wasn't for Schelling, I would never have travelled to Berlin. I must thank him for that. … I think I should have become utterly insane if I had gone on hearing Schelling.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 27 February 1842)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

{{Quotation|It is common knowledge that [[Aristotle]] used the term first philosophy primarily to designate [[metaphysics]], though he included within it a part that accorded to our conception belongs to [[theology]]. In paganism it is quite in order for theology to be treated there. It is related to the same lack of an infinite penetration reflection that endowed the theater in paganism with reality as a kind of divine worship. If we now abstract from this ambiguity, we could retain the designation and by first philosophy understand that totality of science which we might call “ethnical,” whose essence is immanence and is expressed in Greek thought by “recollection,” and by second philosophy understand that totality of science whose essence is transcendence or repetition. Schelling called attention to this Aristotelian term in support of his own distinction between negative and positive philosophy. By negative philosophy he meant “logic”; that was clear enough. On the other hand, it was less clear to me what he really meant by positive philosophy, except insofar as it became evident that it was the philosophy that he himself wished to provide. However, since I have nothing to go by except my own opinion, it is not feasible to pursue this subject further. [[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Constantin Constantius]] has called attention to this by pointing out that immanence runs aground upon “interest.” With this concept, actuality for the first time comes into view. Søren Kierkegaard, ''The Concept of Anxiety'' 1844, p. 21 and Note p. 21 Nichol}}

Kierkegaard became disillusioned with Schelling partly because Schelling shifted his focus on actuality, including a discussion on ''quid sit'' [what is] and ''quod sit'' [that is], to a more mythological, psychic-type pseudo-philosophy. Kierkegaard's last writing about Schelling's lectures was on 4 February 1842. He wrote the following in 1844, {{Quotation|Some men of [[Naturphilosophie|Schelling’s school]] have been especially aware of the alteration that has taken place in nature because of sin. Mention has been made also of the anxiety that is supposed to be in inanimate nature.  Schelling’s main thought is that anxiety, etc., characterize the suffering of the deity in his endeavor to create. In Berlin he expressed the same thought more definitely by comparing God with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and Jon Von Muller,&lt;ref&gt;See his Universal History published in 1818 https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL4431565A/John_von_Muller&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom felt well only when producing, and also by calling attention to the fact that such a bliss, when it cannot communicate itself, is unhappiness. ''The Concept of Anxiety'' P. 59-60 Note p. 59}}

Although Schelling had little influence on Kierkegaard's subsequent writings, Kierkegaard's trip to Berlin provided him ample time to work on his masterpiece, ''[[Either/Or]]''. In a reflection about Schelling in 1849, Kierkegaard remarked that Schelling was ''like the [[Rhine]] at its mouth where it became stagnant water - he was degenerating into a Prussian "Excellency". (Journals, January 1849)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

===Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer===
[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|150px|thumb|Arthur Schopenhauer]]
Kierkegaard became acquainted with [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s writings quite late in his life. Kierkegaard felt Schopenhauer was an important writer, but disagreed on almost every point Schopenhauer made. In several journal entries made in 1854, a year before he died, Kierkegaard spoke highly of Schopenhauer:
{{Quotation|In the same way that one disinfects the mouth during an epidemic so as not to be infected by breathing in the poisonous air, one might recommend students who will have to live in Denmark in an atmosphere of nonsensical Christian optimism, to take a little dose of Schopenhauer's Ethic in order to protect themselves against infection from that malodourous twaddle.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

However, Kierkegaard also considered him, ''a most dangerous sign'' of things to come:
{{Quotation|Schopenhauer is so far from being a real pessimist that at the most he represents 'the interesting': in a certain sense he makes [[asceticism]] interesting--the most dangerous thing possible for a pleasure-seeking age which will be harmed more than ever by distilling pleasure even out of asceticism… is by studying asceticism in a completely impersonal way, by assigning it a place in the system.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Kierkegaard believes Schopenhauer's ethical point of view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to deaden or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy:
{{Quotation|After reading through Schopenhauer's Ethic one learns - naturally he is to that extent honest - that he himself is not an ascetic. And consequently he himself has not reached contemplation through asceticism, but only a contemplation which contemplates asceticism. This is extremely suspicious, and may even conceal the most terrible and corrupting voluptuous [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]: a profound [[misanthropy]]. In this too it is suspicious, for it is always suspicious to propound an ethic which does not exert so much power over the teacher that he himself expresses. Schopenhauer makes ethics into genius, but that is of course an unethical conception of ethics. He makes ethics into genius and although he prides himself quite enough on being a genius, it has not pleased him, or nature has not allowed him, to become a genius where asceticism and mortification are concerned.|Søren Kierkegaard|(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;}}

Little else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. "Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If I could talk to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [my philosophy]."  ''(Journals, 1854)&lt;ref name="Journals" /&gt;''

==Kierkegaard and Eastern philosophy==
Because Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, and because Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy, it would seem that Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations.&lt;ref&gt;Masugata, Kinya, “A Short History of Kierkegaard's Reception in Japan”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 31-52&lt;/ref&gt; There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, Finn Hauberg, ''Kierkegaard Made in Japan'', University Press of Southern Denmark, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James “Introduction: Kierkegaard's among the Temples of Kamakura”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 1-30&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Nolan Pliny, “The Predicament of Man in Zen Buddhism and Kierkegaard”, ''Philosophy East and West'' 2, 1952, 238-253&lt;/ref&gt; A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in ''Purity of Heart'' where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, James, “To Practice One Thing: Kierkegaard through the Eyes of Dogen”, in J. Giles (ed.) ''Kierkegaard and Japanese Thought'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp. 87-105&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is "to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God" (cf. Kierkegaard, "Purity of Heart").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=2523&amp;C=2401&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the "crowd" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, "On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' ")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/k/kierkegaard/untruth/untruth.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] (cf. Kierkegaard, "Fear and Trembling").&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, ed. and trans. Howard and Edna Hong, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harald Hoffding]] (1843-1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century. He compared Kierkegaard to Eastern philosophy in his 1914 book ''The Philosophy Of Religion'' in this way: {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;A characteristic and very frequent type of religious faith is determined by the need of rest. The main cause of fatigue and exhaustion in life is chiefly unrest and distraction of mind. We are influenced on so many sides that it is difficult for us to collect our thoughts; we are drawn in so many directions that we find it difficult to focus our will on any one aim; so many different and changing feelings are aroused that the inner harmony of the mind is exposed to the danger of dissolution. Owing to this feeling of misfit with our ideal we experience an inner need, while our outer needs are borne in upon us in the guise of pain, frailty, and dependence on the elementary wants of life. In the [[Upanishads]] we find: "The Self (Atma), the sinless one, who redeems from old age, death, suffering, hunger, and thirst, whose wishes are the right ones and whose decree is the right one I am that self which men must inquire after and seek to know. He who has found and known this Self has attained all worlds and all wishes." And in another place: “Save me, for I feel in this world’s life like a frog in a sealed fountain." Jesus of Nazareth says: " Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Learn of me, and ye shall find rest for your souls." “Unquiet is our heart," says Augustine to his God, “until it find rest in Thee." This need for rest rises to a passion in natures such as [[St. Theresa]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and Soren Kierkegaard. There is no doubt an element of deep pathos in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] also, but in his case we have the Platonist and the prince of the church combined with the earnest seeker, and it is the combination of all these elements which renders him such a unique figure in the history of the religious life. St. Theresa felt the need of union with God so powerfully that death alone could satisfy it: "I knew not where else to seek this life but in death. The fish, drawn out of the water, sees at any rate the end of its torment; but what death can compare with the life in which I languish?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With Kierkegaard, too, his great desire was to be released from the struggle of life. The lines which he desired should be inscribed on his gravestone express this longing: “A little while the search is o’er. The din of battle sounds no more." In this life the believer finds himself in an alien element; between the inner and the outer, between life and its conditions there is a want of harmony. In Kierkegaard s case, too, we get the metaphor of the fish out of water; it is characteristic of this type that the same figure should be employed by the ancient Indians in the Upanishads, by the Spanish nun of the sixteenth century, and by the northern thinker of the nineteenth century. This trait sheds a light on the psychology of religion. The aim of man is infinite, but he is condemned to spend his life in the world of finitude, and hence it follows that his existence acquires a sort of spasmodic character. In Kierkegaard, and even in Pascal, this opposition is more sharply brought out than in St. Theresa. In the latter it evokes longing and inner aspiration, but her will is occupied entirely by the highest object, and only her memory and her imagination are free to analyse her experiences. But both Pascal and Kierkegaard have constantly to summon the will to their aid; in their case they have a desperate struggle to keep themselves upright in face of the harsh discord between the true life and the conditions of actual life; to hold fast to the thought of the object of faith and to resist the onslaughts of doubt. ''The Philosophy Of Religion'', Dr. Harald Hoffding p. 116-118, Translated from the German Edition, By B. E. Meyer 1914&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

'''Possibilianism''' is a philosophy which rejects both the diverse claims of traditional  [[theism]] and the positions of certainty in [[strong atheism]] in favor of a middle, exploratory ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-beyond-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html Beyond God and atheism: Why I am a possibilian], David Eagleman, ''New Scientist'', Sep 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onpointradio.org/2009/02/envisioning-the-afterlife Envisioning the Afterlife],  interview with David Eagleman on NPR's ''[[On Point]]'', Feb 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "nytimesPaperCuts"&gt;[http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/stray-questions-for-david-eagleman Stray questions for David Eagleman], ''[[New York Times]]''  Paper Cuts, July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpbs.org/news/2009/mar/16/neuroscientist-imagines-40-different-versions-of/ Neuroscientist Imagines 40 Different Versions of the Afterlife], [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]] interview with David Eagleman, Mar 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TexasObserver"&gt;[http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/the-soul-seeker The Soul Seeker: A neuroscientist's search for the human essence], ''[[Texas Observer]]'' cover story, June 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was invented by Robbie Parrish,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090223184309/http://www.possibilian.com/ history]&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] who defined the term in relation to his book of fiction ''[[Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives]]''.&lt;ref name="TOTN"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=100778241 NPR Talk of the Nation: Interview with David Eagleman], Feb 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  
==History ==
Asked whether he was an atheist or a religious person on a [[National Public Radio]] interview in February 2009, Eagleman  replied "I call myself a Possibilian: I'm open to...ideas that we don't have any  way of testing right now."&lt;ref name="TOTN" /&gt;  In a subsequent interview with the ''New York Times'', Eagleman expanded on the definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our ignorance of the cosmos is too vast to commit to atheism, and yet we know too much to commit to a  particular religion. A third position, [[agnosticism]], is often an uninteresting stance in which a person  simply questions whether his traditional religious story (say, a man with a beard on a cloud) is true  or not true. But with Possibilianism I'm hoping to define a new position — one that emphasizes the  exploration of new, unconsidered possibilities. Possibilianism is comfortable holding multiple ideas  in mind; it is not interested in committing to any particular story." &lt;ref name= "nytimesPaperCuts"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' profile of Eagleman—entitled "The Possibilian"—Burkhard Bilger wrote:&lt;ref name="newyorker2011"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/25/110425fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all The Possibilian: David Eagleman and the Mysteries of the Brain], ''The New Yorker'', Apr 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Science had taught him to be skeptical of cosmic certainties, [Eagleman] told me. From the unfathomed complexity of brain tissue—"essentially an alien computational material"—to the mystery of [[dark matter]], we know too little about our own minds and the universe around us to insist on strict atheism, he said. "And we know far too much to commit to a particular religious story." Why not revel in the alternatives? Why not imagine ourselves, as he did in ''Sum'', as bits of networked hardware in a cosmic program, or as particles of some celestial organism, or any of a thousand other possibilities, and then test those ideas against the available evidence? "Part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple [[hypotheses]] in mind at the same time," he said. "As [[Voltaire]] said, uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An adherent of possibilianism is called a '''possibilian'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trashotron.com/agony/news/2009/03-09-09-podcast.htm#podcast031309 "I'm a possibilian"], Rick Kleffel's ''The Agony Column'', Mar 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-henley/are-you-surrounded-with-a_b_170583.html Are you  surrounded with authentic communities?], [[The Huffington Post]], 1 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;[http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/09/10/2063070.aspx?p=1 Choose your afterlife],  [[MSNBC.com]], Sept 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibilian perspective is distinguished from [[agnosticism]] in its active exploration of novel possibilities and its emphasis on the necessity of holding multiple positions at once if there is no available data to privilege one over the others.&lt;ref name="TexasObserver" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/may/09/school-of-life-possibilianism-david-eagleman Ideas for modern living: uncertainty]. ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK). 9 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eagleman has emphasized that possibilianism reflects the scientific temperament of creativity and intellectual humility in the face of "the known unknowns."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LENqnjZGX0A Why I am a Possibilian], TEDx talk by David Eagleman, Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lanham, F. [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/features/6266014.html# Writing about what comes next].  ''Houston Chronicle''. 16 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
According to the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' and [[MSNBC]], the possibilian concept—including various spellings (e.g. "possibillion") and modifications (e.g. "possibilitarian")—has become popular on the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN-eagleman_0616gd.ART0.State.Edition1.50ba880.html Houston author stunned by buzz over 'possibilian'  theory], ''Dallas Morning News'', June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 2009, ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'' Magazine wrote: "[[Googling]] 'possibilian', the position Eagleman invented to explain his belief system, throws up the beginnings of a worldwide movement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.list.co.uk/article/21958 Choose (after)life]. ''The List Magazine'', Issue 643, 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles about possibilianism have appeared in major news outlets around the globe—for example, in the ''[[Daily Monitor]]'' of [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/LifeStyle/Religion/-/689744/839870/-/jvslvu/-/index.html You could be a Possibilian...], ''The Daily Monitor'', Uganda. Jan 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economic Times of India]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Beyond-good-and-bad/articleshow/6230800.cms Beyond Good and Bad], ''Economic Times of India'', July 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727795.300-beyond-god-and-atheism-why-i-am-a-possibilian.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the ''New Statesman'', the atheist author [[Philip Pullman]] declared himself a possibilian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2011/06/afghanistan-pullman-means Philip Pullman on what he owes to the Church of England], ''New Statesman'', 9 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired magazine]]'' founding editor [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] in an interview in the ''LA Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/13/opinion/la-oe-morrison-kelly-20110813-2 Patt Morrison Asks: The Possibilian, Kevin Kelly], 13 Aug 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 2011, "close to a thousand [[Facebook]] members had switched their [[religious affiliation]] to Possibilianism."&lt;ref name="newyorker2011" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] (a [[new atheist]]) has attacked possibilianism as "intellectually dishonest", and its description of strict atheism as a straw man. Harris writes that the position Eagleman espouses "is, simply, atheism."  Harris calls on Eagleman "to admit that “possibilianism,” this middle position of yours, is just a piece of performance art, rather than a serious thesis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/whither-eagleman/ Whither Eagleman?], Sam Harris, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
In response, Eagleman stated that "[Harris'] braggadocio appears to be emblematic of the neo-atheist posture, and confirms why I don't feel completely at home in that camp."&lt;ref&gt;[http://eagleman.com/blog/item/43-why-i-am-a-possibilian Eagleman Blog: Why I am a possibilian], David Eagleman, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Journalist Steve Volk in the Huffington Post suggested that Harris and Eagleman should be "new allies": "If we're going to get beyond the typical exchanges between new atheists and the religious, I'd argue that it's through figures like Eagleman and Harris that we will find the most productive path: men who are eager to use science while demonstrating a capacity to consider ideas from other areas of human experience and systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-volk/culture-wars-allies_b_935187.html New Allies In The Theist/Atheist Debate], Steve Volk, Huffington Post, 8/25/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4970">'''Ptolemais of Cyrene''' ({{lang-grc|Πτολεμαῒς ἡ Κυρηναία}}) was a harmonic theorist, author of ''Pythagorean Principles of Music'' (Πυθαγορικὴ τῆς μουσικῆς στοιχείωσις).  She lived perhaps in the 3rd century BC, and "certainly not after the first century AD."&lt;ref&gt;Rocconi 2003, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Almost nothing is known about her life; her work is known only from references in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721083538/http://www.toxolyros.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5663&amp;Itemid=857 commentary] on [[Ptolemy#Music|Ptolemy's ''Harmonics'']].&lt;ref&gt;Rocconi 2003, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;  She shares the same place of origin ([[Cyrene, Libya]]) as [[Arete of Cyrene]] (a female philosopher of the [[Cyrenaic]] school, whose doctrines included [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] elements) and [[Eratosthenes]] (whose many interests included music theory).&lt;ref&gt;Rocconi 2003, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  She is one of several women writers associated with Pythagoreanism.&lt;ref&gt;Rocconi 2003, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In her work, written in the form of a [[catechism]], she commented on the music-theoretical debate concerning the proper roles of reason and sensory experience in the study of music.  Despite her apparent adherence to Pythagoreanism, a school whose theorists (the ''canonici'') put music on a rational and mathematical basis, there is no apparent hostility in her citations of the empiricist followers of [[Aristoxenus]] (the ''musici''); perhaps the methodological division was not a stark absolute during her period or from her point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Rocconi 2003, pp. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemais also makes reference to musicologists who gave equal importance to perception and reason, preferring to see Aristoxenus himself (as opposed to his followers) in this light, and even stressing the compatible role of perception in the Pythagorean theory:&lt;ref&gt;Plant, pp. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''What is the distinction between those who preferred a combination of both [reason and perception]?'' While some adopted both perception and reason in the same way, as being of equal importance, others took one as the leader and the other as a follower.  Aristoxenus of Tarentum adopted them both in the same way. For neither can what is perceived be composed by itself without reason, nor is reason strong enough to establish something if it does not take its starting points from perception, and the conclusion of the theorising does not agree again with the perception.

''In what way does he want perception to be in advance of theory?'' In order, but not in importance. For he says when what is perceptible whatever it is, is grasped, then we must promote reason for the theoretical study of it.

''Who treats both together?'' Pythagoras and his successors.  For they want to adopt perception as a guide for reason at the beginning, as if to provide a spark for it, but to treat reason, when it has started off from such a beginning, as separating from perception and working by itself. So if the composite whole is found in a study by reason to be no longer in accord with perception, they do not turn back, but make their own accusations, saying that the perception is mistaken, and that reason by itself finds what is correct and refutes perception.}}

In this same passage, Ptolemais criticizes the extreme partisans of both schools, "the Pythagoreans who enjoyed disputing with the musici" for dismissing perception entirely (despite their contradictory "adoption of something perceivable in the beginning"), and "some of the musici who follow Aristoxenus" for adopting their master's "theory based upon thought" but proceeding "through expertise on musical instruments" and "regard[ing] perception as authoritative, and reason as accompanying it, and for necessity only."

'''Qutb''', '''Qutub''', '''Kutb''', '''Kutub''', or '''Kotb''' ({{lang-ar|قطب}}), means 'axis', 'pivot' or 'pole'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Oxford dictionary of Islam|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Qutb can refer to celestial movements and used as an astronomical term or a spiritual symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobson|first=J. Peter|title=The Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam|year=2001|publisher=Stacey International &amp; Cyril Glasse|location=London, England|pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sufism]], a Qutb is the perfect human being, ''[[al-insān al-kāmil]]'' (The Universal Man), who leads the saintly hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Insan e Kamil (The Universal Man)"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sult̤ān Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman|title=Sultan Bahoo: The Life and Teachings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=murshid+kamil+akmal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=murshid%20kamil%20akmal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sultan-ul-Faqr Publications|isbn= 978-9-699-79518-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qutb is the Sufi spiritual leader that has a divine connection with God and passes knowledge on which makes him central to, or the axis of, Sufism, but he is unknown to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brill|first=E.J.|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam.

They are only revealed to a select group of mystics because there is a "human need for direct knowledge of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=The Oxford dictionary of Islam|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Institute of Ismaili Studies, "In mystical literature, such as the writings of al–Tirmidhi, Abd al–Razzaq and [[Ibn Arabi]] (d. 1240), [Qutb] refers to the most perfect human being who is thought to be the universal leader of all saints, to mediate between the divine and the human and whose presence is deemed necessary for the existence of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iis.ac.uk/glossary_list.asp?f=l&amp;t=q&amp;l=en A glossary of terms, The Institute of Ismaili Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009091802/http://iis.ac.uk/glossary_list.asp?f=l&amp;t=q&amp;l=en |date=2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural evidence==
In the teachings of [[Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]], there is evidence to suggest that the Qutb is the head of the saintly hierarchy which provides scriptural evidence to support the belief in the qutb. The hadīth attributed to Ibn Mas‘ūd has been used as proof that a qutb exists.&lt;ref name="Bearman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bearman|first=P.|title=Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition|url=http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_COM-0550|publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |access-date=April 2, 2011| author2=Kunitzsch, P.|author3=Jong, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal Qutb and cosmic Qutb==
===Temporal Qutb===
There are two different conceptions of the Qutb in Sufism: temporal Qutb and cosmic Qutb. The temporal and cosmic qutb are connected which guarantees that God is present in the world at all times. The temporal qutb is known as "the helper" or ''al-ghawth'' and is located in a person on Earth. The cosmic qutb is manifested in the temporal qutb as a virtue which can be traced back to al-Hallādj. The temporal qutb is the spiritual leader for the earth-bound saints.  It is said that all beings - secret, animate, and inanimate - must give the qutb their pledge which gives him great authority.  The only beings exempt from this are ''al-afrād'', which belong to the angels; the ''djinn'', who are under the jurisdiction of [[Khidr|Khadir]]; and those who belong to the tenth stratum of ''ridjālal-ghayb''.&lt;ref name="Bearman"/&gt;

Due to the nature of the Qutb, the location where he resides, whether temporal or cosmic, is questionable.  It is thought by most that the Qutb is corporeally or spiritually present in [[Mecca]] at the [[Ka'ba]], which is referred to as his ''maqām''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewisohn|first=Leonard|title=An Introduction to the History of Modern Persian Sufism, Part II: A Socio-Cultural Profile of Sufism, from the Dahahbi Revival to the Present Day|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|year=1999|volume=62|issue=1|pages=36–59|jstor=3107388|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00017559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic Qutb===
The cosmic Qutb is the ''Axis of the Universe'' in a [[Planes of existence|higher dimension]] from which originates the power (ultimately from [[Allah]]) of the temporal Qutb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khidr.org/gunawardhana.htm "Idris and Al Khidr"--see ''Axis of the Universe'' about one-fourth of the way down the web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/The_Tree_Symbol_in_Islam-by_Noble_Ross_Reat.aspx "The Tree Symbol in Islam" by Noble Ross:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiachat.com/forum/index.php?/topic/35435-how-many-worlds-are-there/ Discussion of the [[Planes of existence]] as conceived in Shi’ism:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cosmic hierarchy of the Qutb==
The cosmic hierarchy is the way that the spiritual power is ensured to exist through the cosmos.  Two descriptions of the hierarchy come from notable Sufis.  The first is [[Ali Hujwiri]]'s divine court.  There are three hundred ''akhyār'' (“excellent ones”), forty ''[[abdal|abdā]]l'' (“substitutes”), seven ''abrār'' (“piously devoted ones”), four ''awtād'' (“pillars”) three ''nuqabā'' (“leaders”) and one qutb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnirazvi.net/qadiri/sufis/awliya.htm The Saints of Islam, quoting The Mystics of Islam by Dr. [[Reynold A. Nicholson]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second version is [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn Arabī]]’s which has a different, more exclusive structure.  There are eight ''nujabā'' (“nobles”), twelve ''nuqabā'', seven ''abdāl'', four ''awtād'', two ''a’immah'' (“guides”), and the qutb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Farmington Hills, MI|isbn=0-02-865733-0|pages=8821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People named Qutb==
For those named '''Qutb ad-Din''', with many variant transliterations, see [[Qutb ad-Din]]. Notable people include:
*[[Sayyid Qutb]] (1906–1966), an Islamist and Egyptian Muslim Brother executed for plotting the assassination of Gamal Abdel Nasser
*Members of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]], the ruling family of the kingdom of Golconda in southern India from 1518 to 1687
*[[Hoda Kotb]], an American news anchor 
*Kutup [[Osman Fazli]] (1632-1691), a Sufi who died in Cyprus

==Buildings==
* [[Qutb complex]], a group of monuments and buildings at Mehrauli in Delhi, India
* [[Qutb Minar]], a tall brick minaret in Delhi, India
* [[Hauz e Qutb]], also known as [[Kankaria Lake]], in Ahmedabad, India

'''Sir Robert Alexander Falconer''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|KCMG|FRSC}} (10 February 1867 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1943) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] academic and bible scholar.

==Life==
He was born in [[Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island]], the eldest child of a [[Presbyterian]] minister and his wife. He attended high school in [[Port of Spain]] [[Trinidad]] while his father was posted there&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/bios/robertfalconer.htm | title=Robert Alexander Falconer(1867-1943) | publisher=www.marianopolis.edu | accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a scholarship to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/sir-robert-falconer | title=Falconer, Sir Robert Alexander | author = A.B. MCKILLOP | publisher=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com | accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1889 and then spent three years at the divinity school of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].

Falconer was ordained in 1892 but never held a clerical position. He returned to Canada that year and took a lecturership in New Testament Greek and [[exegesis]] at the [[Presbyterian]] college in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He also began to publish articles in learned journals. In 1907 he became president of the [[University of Toronto]]. He steered a middle path, combining pure scholarship with practicality. Thus he introduced more vocational subjects, while also developing higher degree programmes. He sought to maximise the independence of the university, battling unsuccessfully to retain German faculty members in 1914. Nonetheless he was knighted in 1917 for his advocacy of wartime recruitment. Falconer believed in the need to increase public awareness of, and accessibility to, Canada's historical records. He was a long time member of [[Champlain Society|The Champlain Society's]] Council, serving as its Vice-President (1909-1935) and President (1936-42).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Champlain Society|title=Former Officers of the Champlain Society (1905-2012)|website=http://www.champlainsociety.ca/about-us/|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falconer wrote several books on current affairs, including ''The German Tragedy and its Meaning for Canada'' (1915), ''Idealism in National Character'' (1920) and ''The United States as a Neighbour'' (1926). He was an advocate of broad cooperation between the English speaking nations in international affairs, but was concerned to avoid American dominance of these relationships. Ill health obliged him to decline the principalship of the University of Edinburgh in 1929, and he retired in 1932. However he continued his scholarly work, producing ''Pastoral Epistles'', his most notable work of religious scholarship in 1937.

''Sir Robert Falconer: a biography'' by James G Greenlee was published in 1988.

Sahaja Yoga is not only the name of the movement, but also the [[meditation]] technique the movement teaches and the state of awareness that is said to be achieved by the technique.&lt;ref name="WIPO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/d2001-0467.html|title=Administrative Panel Decision 'Vishwa Nirmala Dharma a.k.a.

Srivastava described Sahaja Yoga as the pure, universal religion integrating all other religions.&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; She also claimed that she herself was a divine incarnation,&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; more precisely an incarnation of the Holy Ghost, or the Adi Shakti of the Hindu tradition, the great mother goddess who had come to save humanity.&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Fit with other religions==

The teachings, practices and beliefs of Sahaja Yoga are mainly Hindu-based, with a predominance of elements from mystical traditions, as well as local customs of India.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; There are however important elements of Christian origin, such as the eternal battle between good and evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt; References to a variety of other religious, spiritual, mystical as well as modern scientific frameworks are also interwoven in Srivastava's teachings, although to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney Socialising Processes" /&gt;

==Countries where active==

Sahaja Yoga ashrams are present in diverse countries which include the following : [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States|United States of America]], but are not limited to the aforementioned countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/worldwidecontacts/|title=Sahaja Yoga Worldwide Contacts - Locate Sahaja Yoga Near You|website=www.sahajayoga.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the name ==
The word '[[Sahaja]]' in Sanskrit has two components: 'Saha' meaning 'with you' and 'ja' meaning 'born'.&lt;ref name="inform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inform.ac/node/8|title=Meditation and Mindfulness|last=INFORM staff|first=|date=|year=|website=INFORM - the information network on religious movements|publisher=|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'' gives the literal translation of Sahaja as "innate" and defines it as "denoting the natural presence of enlightenment (bodhi) or purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2004|title=Sahaja|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Buddhism|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198605607.001.0001/acref-9780198605607-e-1532|isbn=9780191726538}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yoga]] means ''union'' or ''yoking'' and refers to a spiritual path or a state of spiritual absorption. According to a book published by the movement, Sahaja Yoga means ''spontaneous'' and ''born with you'' meaning that the kundalini is born within us and can be awakened spontaneously, without effort.&lt;ref name="Sahaja Yoga Book 1" /&gt;

The term 'Sahaja Yoga' goes back at least to the 15th Century Indian mystic [[Kabir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Nihar Ranjan|date=October 2000|title=The concept of 'Sahaj' in Guru Nanak’s theology|url=http://www.sikhreview.org/october2000/theology.htm|journal=The Sikh Review|volume=48|number=562|accessdate=2011-11-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011616/http://www.sikhreview.org/october2000/theology.htm|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used to refer to [[Surat Shabd Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sar Bachan: An Abstract of the Teachings of Soami Ji Maharaj, the Founder of the Radha Soami System of Philosophy and Spiritual Science: The Yoga of the Sound Current|publisher=Radha Soami Satsang Beas|others=Translated by Sardar Sewa Singh and Julian P. Johnson|year=1934|location=Beas, India|author=Soami Ji Maharaj|authorlink=Shiv Dayal Singh}}{{Page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the term 'Sahaja Yoga' was trademarked in the United States by Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov|title=Sahaja Yoga|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|work=[[Trademark Electronic Search System]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before starting Sahaja Yoga, its founder Nirmala Srivastava earned a reputation as a faith healer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamans, Mystics and Doctors: A Psychological Inquiry into India and Its Healing Traditions|last=Kakar|first=Sudhir|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1982|isbn=0-226-42279-8|location=Chicago|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a small group of devotees around her, she began spreading her message of Sahaja Yoga in India in the year 1970. As she moved with her husband to London, UK, she continued her work there, and year by year the movement grew and spread throughout Europe, by the mid-80's reaching North America. In 1989, Srivastava made her first trip to Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of American religions|last=Melton|first=J. Gordon|publisher=Gale|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7876-6384-1|edition=8th|location=Detroit|pages=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Srivastava charged no money, insisting that her lesson was a birthright which should be freely available to all. "There can be no peace in the world until there is peace within," she said.&lt;ref name="funding" &gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Posner |url= http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20110311.OBDEVIATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |title= Spiritual leader founded Sahaja yoga movement |date= 11 March 2011 |accessdate= 2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
&lt;!-- this isn't in the reference provided Sahaja yogis respect and accept people from all religions and believe that the state achieved through self-realization makes the truth behind all religions apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.org/questionsandanswers/#religions |title= Questions And Answers&amp;nbsp;– Self Realization through Sahaja Yoga |website= sahajayoga.org |publisher= Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Sahaja Yoga beliefs are seen by the organisation as a re-discovered ancient knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahaja-europe.net/ |title= Home Page |website= sahaja-europe.net |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that should be treated respectfully and scientifically, like a hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahajayoga.org.au/2007/12/05/the-subtle-system-of-sahaja-yoga/ |title=The subtle system of Sahaja Yoga |website=sahajayoga.org.au |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112124757/http://www.sahajayoga.org.au/2007/12/05/the-subtle-system-of-sahaja-yoga/ |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy }}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if found by experiments as truth, should be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.irelandyoga.org/talks/sahaja-yoga-in-detail/ |title= Sahaja Yoga in Detail |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091231061311/http://www.irelandyoga.org/talks/sahaja-yoga-in-detail/ |archivedate= 2009-12-31 |website= irelandyoga.org |publisher= The Life Eternal Trust}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is considered to be an "avatar" by many of her followers and as a carrier of the divine presence which leads some critics to find the organization as cultic.
&lt;!-- reference incomplete The technique itself is said to be already researched and does not require further development.{{refn|group=n|[[Nirmala Srivastava]] stated at a conference, "I call Sahaja Yoga as meta science because the method of science is not employed in Sahaja Yoga, e. g. in the medical science when we want to search something then we take a hypothesis. We think possibly this might be the solution of a particular disease... Unless we know what are we made of and what is our inner being, and how these diseases are caused, we will not be able to do some thing accurately. Specially allopathic medicines are very heat creating. So we have to take something to neutralise the heat that is also another blind alley, Sahaja Yoga is a meta science. Here you do not have to research anything. It is already researched and we do not have to go working hard for it for years"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Srivastava |first= Nirmala |authorlink= Nirmala Srivastava |work= Doctor's Conference |date= 7 August 1993 |location= Moscow}}{{Full|date=September 2013}}{{npsn|date=April 2014}}{{Page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} --&gt; 
Advanced concepts are not generally taught until a beginner is understood to have gained enough knowledge of their own subtle system through actual experience. Without direct experience of the meditation, some people have reported difficulties understanding or proceeding to the more advanced material. Sociologist, Judith Coney, for example, reported facing a challenge in getting behind what she called "the public facade".{{refn|group=n|name= "Socializing_Processes_p214"|Judith Coney wrote in her book ''Sahaja Yoga: Socializing Processes in a South Asian New Religious Movement'', "Finally, throughout the study I faced the challenge of getting Sahaja yogis to let me get behind the public facade. This was achieved with varying degrees of success. On one fortunate occasion, for instance, I attended a national puja, after which there was an extremely frank and revealing discussion of why Sahaja Yoga had been seen as a cult in a particular press article and of the level of secrecy in the group. There I listened to a number of speakers talk about the ways in which they disguised some of their beliefs when in contact with non-members."{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=214}}}} She described Sahaja yogis as adopting a low profile with uncommitted individuals to avoid unnecessary conflict.&lt;ref name=children_in_new_religions&gt;{{cite book |first= Judith |last= Coney |chapter= |title= Children in New Religions |editor1-first= Susan J. |editor1-last= Palmer |editor2-first= Charlotte |editor2-last= Hardman |publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]] |year= 1999 |pages= |isbn= 9780813526201 |ref= {{SfnRef|Coney|1999b}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahaja Yoga also states that spreading Sahaja Yoga techniques should be free for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sahajayoga.org.uk/ |title= Sahaja Yoga Meditation |website= sahajayoga.org.uk |accessdate= 2011-03-19|publisher= Life Eternal Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Coney observed that the movement tolerates a variety of world views and levels of commitment with some practitioners choosing to remain on the periphery.{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=}}

===The Subtle System – Chakras and Nadis===
[[File:DiagrammaChakraKundalini.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chakra Kundalini Diagram]]
Sahaja Yoga believes that in addition to our physical body there is a [[subtle body]] composed of [[nadis]] (channels) and [[chakras]] (energy centres). There is no biomedical evidence of chakras.&lt;ref name= "Shermer 2002"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]] |publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 9781576076538|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA538 538] |editor-last= Shermer |editor-first= Michael |editor-link= Michael Shermer |volume= 1 |year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that [[Nirmala Srivastava]]'s additions to this widespread traditional '[[tantra|tantric]]' model include giving it a scientific, neurological veneer, an elaboration of the health aspects and an introduction of notions of traditional Christian morality.{{refn|group=n|Sudhir Kakar wrote in his book ''Shamans, Mystics and Doctors'', "Essentially, Mataji's model of the human psyche is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the traditional tantric and hatha yoga notions of the subtle body, with its 'nerves' and 'centers,' and fuelled by a pervasive 'subtle energy' that courses through both the human and the divine, through the body and the cosmos. Mataji's contributions to this ancient model are not strikingly original: as a former medical student she has sought to give it a scientific, neurological veneer; as a former faith healer, she has elaborated upon those aspects of the model that are concerned with sickness and health; as someone born into an Indian Christian family she has tried to introduce notions of traditional Christian morality into an otherwise amoral Hindu view of the psyche."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kakar |first= Sudhir |year= 1984 |title= Shamans, Mystics and Doctors: A Psychological Inquiry into India and Its Healing Traditions |isbn= 0226422798 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=b_EBs3A7Z1YC&amp;pg=PA196 196] |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |ref= {{SfnRef|Kakar|1984}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Nirmala Srivastava equates the Sushumna [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]] with the parasympathetic nervous system, the Ida nadi with the left and the Pingala nadi with the right sides of the sympathetic nervous system.
{{-}}

===Kundalini, Self-Realization and vibratory awareness===
Sahaja Yoga believes that the [[chakras]] can be balanced by awakening the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] in the [[sacrum|sacrum bone]], which is conceived of as a normally dormant 'mother' energy. [[Nirmala Srivastava]] has said that the kundalini is the reflection within us of the [[Holy Spirit]] or Adi (Primordial) [[Shakti]].

A Sahaja Yoga belief is that upon self-realization, the practitioner may also experience thoughtless awareness (Nirvichar [[Samādhi]]).&lt;ref name=syintro /&gt;

==Organization==
'''Vishwa Nirmala Dharma''' (trans: Universal Pure Religion, also known as '''Sahaja Yoga International''') is the organizational part of the movement. It is a registered organisation in countries such as Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mininteriorjusticia.gov.co/adminFiles/REGISTRO%20PUBLICO%20ENTIDADES%20RELIGIOSAS%2030-06-2004%20.xls |title= Registro Publico Entidades Religiosas 30-06-2004 |trans-title= Public Registry of Religious Entities |publisher= [[Ministry of the Interior and Justice (Colombia)|Ministry of the Interior and Justice]]: Republic of Colombia |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010408/http://www.mininteriorjusticia.gov.co/adminFiles/REGISTRO%20PUBLICO%20ENTIDADES%20RELIGIOSAS%2030-06-2004%20.xls |archivedate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/followup/b5ngo.htm |title= List of ECOSOC/Beijing and New Accredited NGOs that attended the special session of the General Assembly |website= un.org |publisher= [[United Nations]] |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71367.htm |title= Austria - 2006 Report on International Religious Freedom |publisher= [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]: [[United States Department of State|US Dept. of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as a religion in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_526_2006.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910213600/http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_526_2006.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Religion in Spain |website=sahajayoga.org |publisher=Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |department=Sahaja Worldwide News and Announcements (SWAN) |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--source shows the legal documents --&gt;

In addition to directly promoting Sahaja Yoga, the council promotes Sahaja culture, runs schools, a health centre, a youth movement, and a project for the rehabilitation of "destitute women and orphaned children".

=== Membership statistics ===
There are no available statistical data about Sahaja Yoga membership. In 2001, the number of core members worldwide were estimated to 10,000, in addition to which around 100,000 practitioners more or less in the periphery were estimated to be found.&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; There are varying reports about the movement's distribution worldwide. According to the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation, Sahaja Yoga centers are established in over 95 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shrimataji.org/site/life/biography-from-nirmala-srivastava-to-shri-mataji.html|title=From Nimala Srivastava to Shri Mataji|last=Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation|first=|date=2017-05-07|website=Shri Mataji: A Life Dedicated to Humanity|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a news article in Indian Express published on the occasion of Srivastava's death in 2011, however, Sahaja Yoga centers were told to be found in over 140 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Yuvashakti===
Sahaja Yoga's youth movement is called "Yuvashakti" (also "Nirmal Shakti Yuva Sangha"), from the Sanskrit words Yuva (Youth) and [[Shakti]] (Power).

The movement is active in forums such as the World Youth Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.youthlink.org/globalguide.pdf |title= Guide to the Global Youth Movement |website= youthlink.org |editor-first= Jonah |editor-last= Wittkamper |year= 2002 |publisher= Global Youth Action Network |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051222200027/http://www.youthlink.org/globalguide.pdf |archivedate= 2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TakingITGlobal]] which aim at discussing global issues, and ways of solving them.

The Yuvashakti participated in the 2000 "Civil Society &amp; Governance Project"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/civsoc/final/india/ind7.doc |title= Case Study Civil Society &amp; Governance Project |date=February 2000 |first= Vinita |last= Tatke |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040103160620/http://www.ids.ac.uk/ids/civsoc/final/india/ind7.doc |archivedate= 2004-01-03 |accessdate= 6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they were "instrumental in reaching out to women from the poor communities and providing them with work".

===Vishwa Nirmal Prem ashram===
The ''Vishwa Nirmala Prem Ashram'' is a not-for profit project by the NGO '''Vishwa Nirmala Dharma''' (Sahaja Yoga International) located in Noida, [[Delhi]], [[India]], opened in 2003. The ashram is a "facility where women and girls are rehabilitated by being taught meditation and other skills that help them overcome trauma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-16/edit-page/27827906_1_girls-drunken-man-mother  |title= A New Childhood |first= Arshiya |last= Khanna |newspaper= [[The Times of India]] |date= 16 Nov 2006 |accessdate= 2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|magazine=Blossom Times |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=31 August 2007 |url=http://www.blossomtimes.org/site/pdf/BlossomTimes_issue3.pdf |title=An interview with Gisela Matzer |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926011530/http://www.blossomtimes.org/site/pdf/BlossomTimes_issue3.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The methods for practising Sahaja Yoga are made available free of charge to those interested. According to the official Sahaja Yoga website there is a fee for attending international [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s to cover costs and voluntary [[dakshina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_358_2005.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120915070213/http://www.sahajayoga.org/swan/view/swan_358_2005.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 September 2012 |title=Puja/Dakshina Costs |website=sahajayoga.org |publisher=Vishwa Nirmala Dharma |department=Sahaja Worldwide Announcements and News (SWAN) |date=20 July 2005 |accessdate=2011-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[David V. Barrett]], "Shri Mataji neither charged for her lectures nor for her ability to give Self Realization, nor does one have to become a member of this organisation. She insisted that one cannot pay for enlightenment and she continued to denounce the [[false self]]-proclaimed 'gurus' who are more interested in the seekers' purse than their spiritual ascent".  However, the movement had been criticised because of encouragement of its members to make donations to pay the travel charges for Mataji's visits to their respective countries.&lt;ref name=barrett&gt;{{cite book |last= Barrett |first= David V. |authorlink= David V. Barrett |title= The New Believers |publisher= Cassell |year= 2001 |isbn= 0304355925 |pages= 297–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--this isn't a refutation to the previous line
Sahaja Yoga leaders have denied this, pointing out that their group is  recognised in both the US and Russia, that all members are free to come and go as they please. They admit that members are asked for voluntary contributions to events and projects, but that the money does not go to the founder herself. A current member of 25 years said: "All the organisation owns is a few properties in various countries. If we were into making money, that would be a pretty feeble return."&lt;ref name=eveningstandard/&gt; --&gt;

==Cult allegations and refutations==

Judith Coney found that most people who leave the movement voluntarily still had positive things to say about it.{{refn|group=n|name="Socializing_Processes_p214"}}{{sfn|Coney|1999|p=184}} A smaller group of ex-members have made complaints against the movement which have been reported in the press. In 2001, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that certain ex-members say "that Sahaja Yoga is a cult which aims to control the minds of its members" and ex-members claim that the organisation insists all family ties are broken and all communication with them cease. The article further details a number of beliefs - including that crying children are possessed by daemons, that negative and positive vibrations need 'clearing', advocates husbands slapping their spouses and hides many of the more occult practices from new members - including the high costs for participating in rituals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/shri-who-must-be-obeyed-9263416.html|title=Shri who must be obeyed|date=2001-07-13|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]'' reported that some critics who feel that the group is a cult have started their own websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NzMxNTk4 |title=Hundreds fill weekend with devotion, bliss |newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]] |first=John |last=Chadwick |date=24 July 2005 |location=[[Bergen County, New Jersey]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320154926/http://www.northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk2NzMxNTk4 |archivedate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Sahaja yogis in one centre reflected on the ways in which some of their beliefs are disguised when in contact with non-members. Coney described this discussion as a "frank and revealing".{{refn|group=n|name="Socializing_Processes_p214"}}

A 2008 court case in Brussels ruled that Sahaja Yoga had been wrongly labelled as a cult by a Belgian state authority and awarded the group compensation.&lt;ref name= "HRWF2008"&gt;{{Cite conference |last1= Fautré |first1= Willy |last2= [[Human Rights Without Frontiers]] (HRWF) |title= Religious intolerance in the OSCE space |conference= OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting: Working Session 10: Tolerance and Non-discrimination |publisher= [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) |date= 6 October 2008 |location= Warsaw |page= |ref= {{SfnRef|Fautré, HRWF|2008}} |url= http://www.osce.org/odihr/34018?download=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sahaja Yoga is geen sekte |url=http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/255219/2008/04/25/Sahaja-Yoga-is-geen-sekte.dhtml |newspaper=[[De Morgen]] |date=22 July 2008 |trans-title=Sahaja Yoga is not a cult |language=Dutch |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Auteur: jav |url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=dmf20062006_009 |trans-title= Sahaja Yoga is not a cult |title= Sahaja Yoga is geen sekte |newspaper= [[De Standaard]] |language= nl |date=19 June 2006 |accessdate= 2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[De Morgen]]'' reported that the Belgian Department of State Security monitors how often politicians are contacted and lobbied by organisations. The list of organisations includes Sahaja Yoga, as well as [[Scientology]] and [[The Muslim Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[De Morgen]] |title= Staatsveiligheid houdt Wetstraat in de gaten |trans-title= State keeps an eye Wetstraat |first1= Buxant |last1= Martin |first2= Steven |last2= Samyn |date= 2 February 2013 |url= http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/989/Binnenland/article/detail/1572744/2013/02/02/Staatsveiligheid-houdt-Wetstraat-in-de-gaten.dhtml |language= nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, The ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' reported that Sahaja Yoga has been "described as a dangerous cult" and "has a dissident website created by former members". The reporter, John Crace, wrote about an event he attended and noted that a Sahaja Yoga representative asked him to feel free to talk to whomever he wanted. He remarked, "Either their openness is a PR [[charm offensive]], or they genuinely have nothing to hide." He proposed that "one of the key definitions of a cult is the rigour with which it strives to recruit new members" and concluded that there was no aggressive recruitment squeeze.&lt;ref name=eveningstandard&gt;{{cite news |title= Monday night with the divine mother |newspaper= [[London Evening Standard]] |date= 18 July 2001 |first= John |last= Crace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[INFORM]] leaflet says that the emphasis on complete devotion has led to problems and controversy. There is a culture amongst a minority of Sahaja yogis to believe that those who deviate in particular ways may be possessed by 'negativity' or may be said to be mentally abnormal. Those who fight the pressure to follow the Guru's suggestions and radically change their lifestyle risk being expelled. It is claimed that this may bring problems for those who still believe in the power of the Guru and fear 'losing vibrations'.&lt;ref name="inform" /&gt; This expulsion is not enforced but is something understood socially and other yogis are not expected to change the way they react to those who have been expelled. It is also not a permanent expulsion; there have been cases of returning Sahaja yogis following brief periods 'out'.

[[David V. Barrett]] wrote that some former members say that they were expelled from the movement because they "resisted influence that Mataji had over their lives". According to Barrett, the movement's founder's degree of control over members' lives has given rise to concerns.&lt;ref name=barrett/&gt; The Austrian Ministry for Environment, Youth and Family states that "Sahaja Yoga" regards Nirmala Srivastava as an authority who cannot be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sekten!

==Sahaja meditation and associated research==

In the [[meditation]] practice of the Sahaja movement the focus is on thoughts ceasing.
&lt;ref&gt;"...real meditation, which is a state of thoughtless awareness" http://www.sahajayogaportal.org/en/meditation/how-to-meditate.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sahajdhyana.blogspot.co.uk/p/four-meditations-guided-by-shri-mataji.html|title=Four meditations guided by Shri Mataji.|website=sahajdhyana.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"How to do meditation, many people ask. Don’t do anything, to just go into thoughtless awareness. Try to go to the thoughtless awareness. If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness, you’ve done your job, because that’s the point where you are with the truth, with the reality, with the joy, with everything that is so fundamental." https://tricitiesmeditation.com/founder/on-thoughtless-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"Mentally, you may initially find that your thoughts wander to the past or are planning future events. Try to watch them and let them go. Some time later, you can get to the interval between two thoughts and reach a state of deep meditation, that is, complete thoughtlessness." https://sahajayogaarmenia.wordpress.com/meditation-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non-meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non-meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none has recorded a decrease in skin temperature.

&lt;ref&gt;One study has led to suggestions that Sahaja meditation involves 'switching off' irrelevant brain networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information.

{{Nihongo|'''Samu'''|作務|samu}} refers to physical work that is done with [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] as a simple, practical and spiritual practice. Samu might include activities such as cleaning, cooking, gardening, or chopping wood. Samu is a way to bring mindfulness into everyday life as well as to get things done. Samu is popular in [[Zen]] monasteries, particularly as a means of maintaining the monastery and as practicing mindfulness.&lt;ref name="ZenDenver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Samu|url=http://zencenterofdenver.org/samu.aspx|publisher=Zen Center of Denver|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414085131/http://www.zencenterofdenver.org/samu.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=samu|url=http://www.emptybowlzendo.org/#/zen-practices/samu|publisher=Empty Bowl Zendo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=samu|url=http://www.meditation-zen.org/de|publisher=Zen-Tempel Kosanryumonji}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=samu|url=http://www.soto-zen.de/html-seiten/samu.html|publisher=Soto-Zen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If you consider quietude right and activity wrong, then this is seeking the real aspect by destroying the worldly aspect, seeking nirvana, the peace of extinction, apart from birth and death. When you like quiet and hate activity, this is the time to apply effort. Suddenly when in the midst of activity, you topple the sense of quietude-that power surpasses quietistic meditation [seated meditation] by a million billion times.|[[Dahui Zonggao]]&lt;ref name="ZenDenver"/&gt;}}

Mindfulness means accepting reality just as it is. Samu is a means of finding [[Buddha-nature]] in everyday life, that reality has ever been pure from the very beginning, which was the central idea behind a Japanese movement called "primordial enlightenment".{{cn|date=June 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2445">'''Seit Devdariani''' ({{lang-ka|სეით დევდარიანი}}) (1879, in [[Kutaisi]] — September 21, 1937, in [[Tbilisi]]) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] philosopher and political activist who was executed during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]].

Devdariani graduated from the [[Tbilisi Theological Seminary]] in 1898. He was involved in [[Georgian Menshevik Party|Menshevik Party]] in 1900. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], he was a leading [[Menshevik]] in [[Kharkiv]]. He was a member of the [[Georgian National Council]] from 1917 to 1919 and of the [[Constituent Assembly of Georgia|Constituent Assembly]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] for the [[Georgian Menshevik Party|Social-Democrats]] from 1919 to 1921. After the [[Soviet invasion of Georgia|fall of the Georgian republic]], Devdariani became involved in [[anti-Soviet]] opposition. Between 1921 and 1924 he was a Chairman of the underground Central Committee of the Georgian Social-Democratic party, in 1922-1924 member of the underground Committee of Independence of Georgia. In 1937, he was arrested in [[Tbilisi]] and executed by the Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2004), ''Stalin and His Hangmen: An Authoritative Portrait of a Tyrant and Those Who Served Him'', p. 49. [[Viking Press]], {{ISBN|0-670-91088-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devdariani was the author of several works on philosophy, including a three-volume history of Georgian thought which was lost after his execution. Only one chapter, that on the 18th-century [[Catholicos Anton I of Georgia|Catholicos Anton I]], survived to be published in 1989.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;Rayfield, Donald (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', p. 297.

'''Simone Adolphine Weil''' ({{IPAc-en|v|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/weil "Weil"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|simɔn vɛj|lang|Fr-Simone Veil.ogg}}; 3 February 1909 – 24 August 1943) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], [[Mysticism|mystic]], and [[political activist]].  The [[mathematician]] [[Andre Weil]] was her brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil_family|class=HistTopics|title=Weil family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to [[political activism]], work that would see her assisting in the trade union movement, taking the side of the [[Anarchism in Spain#Anarchist presence in the Spanish Civil War|Anarchists]] known as the [[Durruti Column]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and spending more than a year working as a labourer, mostly in auto factories, so she could better understand the [[working class]].

Taking a path that was unusual among twentieth-century left-leaning intellectuals, she became more religious and inclined towards [[mysticism]] as her life progressed. Weil wrote throughout her life, though most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and 1960s, her work became famous in continental Europe and throughout the [[English-speaking world]]. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields.&lt;ref&gt;Especially philosophy and theology—also political and social science, feminism, science, education, and classical studies.&lt;/ref&gt; A meta study from the [[University of Calgary]] found that between 1995 and 2012 over 2,500 new scholarly works had been published about her.&lt;ref name = "Calgary"&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
[[File:Simone Weil 14.jpg|thumb|150px| Weil with her father]]

[[File:Simone Weil 1922.jpg|thumb|upright|Weil at age 13. The photograph was taken during a family holiday to Belgium, where she was laughing with her brother [[André Weil|André]].]]

===Early life===
Weil was born in her parents' apartment in [[Paris]] on 3 February 1909. Her mother was Saolomea Weil and her father Bernard was a medical doctor. Both were [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Jews]] who had moved to Paris after the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] by [[Germany]].  Weil was a healthy baby for her first six months, until she had a severe attack of [[appendicitis]]—thereafter she struggled with poor health throughout her life. She was the second of her parents' two children; her older brother was mathematician [[André Weil]], with whom she would always enjoy a close relationship. Their parents were [[agnosticism|agnostic]] and fairly affluent, raising their children in an attentive and supportive atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil suffered some distress due to her father's having to leave home for several years after being drafted in [[World War I]]. According to several Weil scholars, including [[Eva Fogelman]] and [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]], this experience may have been related to the exceptionally strong [[altruism]] displayed throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;According to Fogelman, Cole, and others, various studies have found that a common formative experience for marked altruists is to suffer a hurtful loss and then to receive strong support from loving carers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  
Weil acquired from her family home an obsession with cleanliness; in her later life she would sometimes speak of her "disgustingness" and think that others would see her this way, despite the fact that in her youth she was considered highly attractive.&lt;ref&gt;According to Pétrement (1988) p. 14, family friends would refer to Simone and André as "the genius and the beauty".&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Weil was generally highly affectionate, she almost always avoided any form of physical contact, even with female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 4–7, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her friend and biographer, Simone Pétrement, Weil decided early in life that she would need to adopt masculine qualities and sacrifice opportunities to have love affairs in order to fully pursue her vocation to improve social conditions for the disadvantaged. From her late teenage years, Weil would generally disguise her "fragile beauty" by adopting a masculine appearance, hardly ever using makeup and often wearing men's clothes.&lt;ref name = "Hellman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual life===
Weil was a [[wikt:precocious|precocious]] student, proficient in [[Ancient Greek]] by age 12. She later learned [[Sanskrit]] after reading the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. Like the Renaissance thinker [[Pico della Mirandola]], her interests in other religions were universal and she attempted to understand each religious tradition as an expression of transcendent wisdom.

As a teenager, Weil studied at the Lycée Henri IV under the tutelage of her admired teacher [[Émile Chartier]], more commonly known as "Alain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hellman | first=John | title=Simone Weil: An Introduction to her Thought | publisher=Wilrid Laurier University Press | year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first attempt at the entrance examination for the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in June 1927 ended in failure, due to her low marks in history.

She was called the "Red virgin",&lt;ref name="bandw"/&gt; and even "The Martian" by her admired mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Alain, "Journal" (unpublished). Cited in Petrement, ''Weil'', 1:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[École Normale Supérieure]], she studied philosophy, earning her DES (''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'', roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]]) in 1931 with a thesis under the title "Science et perfection dans Descartes" ("Science and Perfection in Descartes").&lt;ref name="Schrift"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrift |first=Alan D. |editor= |others= |title=Twentieth-century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=1-4051-3217-5 |page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her ''[[agrégation]]'' that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rhe.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/?q=agregsecondaire | title=Les agrégés de l'enseignement secondaire.

===Political activism===
[[File:Lev Trotsky.jpg|thumb|upright|Leon Trotsky. Weil arranged for Trotsky to stay at her parents' apartment in December 1933 while he was in Paris for secret meetings. She had argued against Trotsky both in print and in person, suggesting that élite communist bureaucrats could be just as oppressive as the worst capitalists. Weil was one of the rare few who appeared to hold her own with the [[Red Army]] founder in a face-to-face debate.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 189–191&lt;/ref&gt;]]
She often became involved in political action out of sympathy with the [[working class]]. In 1915, when she was only six years old, she refused sugar in solidarity with the troops entrenched along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1919, at 10 years of age, she declared herself a [[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]]. In her late teens, she became involved in the workers' movement. She wrote political tracts, marched in demonstrations, and advocated workers' rights. At this time, she was a [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[pacifism|pacifist]], and [[trade union]]ist. While teaching in Le Puy, she became involved in local political activity, supporting the unemployed and striking workers despite criticism.  Weil had never formally joined the Communist party, and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to Pétrement, she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx, where élite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists.&lt;ref name="Simone Pétrement 1988; p. 176"&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Weil visited Germany to help Marxist activists who were at the time considered to be the strongest and best organised communists in Western Europe, but Weil considered them no match for the then up-and-coming fascists. When she returned to France, her political friends in France dismissed her fears, thinking Germany would continue to be controlled by the centrists or those to the left. After Hitler rose to power in 1933, Weil spent much of her time trying to help German communists fleeing his regime.&lt;ref name="Simone Pétrement 1988; p. 176"/&gt; Weil would sometimes publish articles about social and economic issues, including "Oppression and Liberty" and numerous short articles for [[trade union]] journals. This work criticised popular Marxist thought and gave a pessimistic account of the limits of both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Trotsky]] himself personally responded to several of her articles, attacking both her ideas and her as a person. However, according to Pétrement, he was influenced by some of Weil's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil participated in the French [[general strike]] of 1933, called to protest against unemployment and [[Wage labour|wage]] cuts. The following year, she took a 12-month [[leave of absence]] from her teaching position to work incognito as a labourer in two factories, one owned by [[Renault]], believing that this experience would allow her to connect with the working class. In 1935, she resumed teaching and donated most of her income to political causes and charitable endeavours.

In 1936, despite her professed [[pacifism]], she travelled to the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] side, and joined the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti. She even took a rifle, but was expelled from combat line by her comrades, as she was extremely short-sighted, and they feared Simone shooting one of them. She hit a pot of boiling liquid because of her short-sightedness, had noticeable burns, and her family came to Spain to bring her back home. During her stay in the Aragon front, she sent some chronicles to the French publication: 'Le Libertaire'. She identified herself as an anarchist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=McLellan, David | title=Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil | publisher=Poseidon Press | year=1990}}, p121&lt;/ref&gt; and upon arriving in Spain, sought out the anti-fascist commander [[Julián Gorkin]], asking to be sent on a mission as a covert agent, to rescue the prisoner [[Joaquín Maurín]]. Gorkin refused, saying she would almost certainly be sacrificing herself for nothing, as it would be most unlikely she could pass as a Spaniard. Weil replied that she had "every right"&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; to sacrifice herself if she chose, but after arguing for more than an hour, she was unable to convince Gorkin to give her the assignment. Instead she joined a unit of the [[Sébastien Faure Century]], which specialised in high-risk "commando"&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;-style engagements.

The unit was part of the French-speaking section of the [[Durruti Column|anarchist militia]]. From seeing her practice on makeshift shooting ranges, her comrades saw she was a very poor shot and tried to avoid taking her on missions, though she did sometimes insist. Her only direct participation in combat was to shoot with her rifle at a bomber during an air raid; in a second raid, she tried to man the group's [[heavy machine gun]], but her comrades prevented her, as they thought it would be best for someone less clumsy and short-sighted to use the weapon.  After being with the group for a few weeks, she burnt herself over a cooking fire. She was forced to leave the unit, and was met by her parents who had followed her to Spain. They helped her leave the country, to recuperate in [[Assisi]]. About a month after her departure, Weil's unit was nearly wiped out at an engagement in [[Perdiguera]] in October 1936, with every woman in the group being killed.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;  On returning to Paris, Weil continued to write essays on [[Labour relations|labour]], on [[management]], [[war]] and [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); pp. 280–330&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil was born into a secular household and raised in "complete agnosticism".&lt;ref&gt;S. Weil, ''What is a Jew'', cited by Panichas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

As a teenager, she considered the existence of God for herself and decided nothing could be known either way. In her ''Spiritual Autobiography'' however, Weil records that she always had a Christian outlook, taking to heart from her earliest childhood the idea of loving one's neighbour. Weil became attracted to the Christian faith beginning in 1935, the first of three pivotal experiences for her being when she was moved by the beauty of villagers singing hymns during an outdoor service that she stumbled across during a holiday to Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;

While in Assisi in the spring of 1937, Weil experienced a [[religious ecstasy]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]]—the same church in which [[Saint]] [[Francis of Assisi]] had prayed. She was led to pray for the first time in her life as Cunningham (2004: p.&amp;nbsp;118) relates: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Below the town is the beautiful church and convent of San Damiano where Saint Clare once lived. Near that spot is the place purported to be where Saint Francis composed the larger part of his "Canticle of Brother Sun". Below the town in the valley is the ugliest church in the entire environs: the massive baroque basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, finished in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the nineteenth century, which houses a rare treasure: a tiny Romanesque chapel that stood in the days of Saint Francis—the "Little Portion" where he would gather his brethren. It was in that tiny chapel that the great mystic Simone Weil first felt compelled to kneel down and pray.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Lawrence (2004). ''Francis of Assisi: performing the Gospel life''.

She had another, more powerful, [[revelation]] a year later while reciting [[George Herbert]]'s poem ''Love III'', after which "Christ himself came down and took possession of me",&lt;ref&gt;cited by Panichas and other Weil scholars,&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 1938 on, her writings became more [[mysticism|mystical]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]], while retaining their focus on [[social relation|social]] and [[political]] issues. She was attracted to [[Roman Catholicism]], but declined to be [[baptism|baptized]], preferring to remain outside due to "the love of those things that are outside Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;S.

&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], she lived for a time in [[Marseille]], receiving spiritual direction from a [[Dominican Order|Dominican Friar]]. Around this time, she met the French [[Catholic]] author [[Gustave Thibon]], who later edited some of her work.

Weil did not limit her curiosity to Christianity. She was keenly interested in other religious traditions—especially the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]; [[Hinduism]] (especially the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]]); and [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. She believed that all these and other traditions contained elements of genuine revelation,&lt;ref name = "Eliot"&gt;{{cite book

Greece, Egypt, ancient India, the beauty of the world, the pure and authentic reflection of this beauty in art and science...these things have done as much as the visibly Christian ones to deliver me into Christ's hands as his captive. I think I might even say more.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Father Perrin, 26 May 1942&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
She was, nevertheless, opposed to religious [[syncretism]], claiming that it effaced the particularity of the individual traditions: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Each religion is alone true, that is to say, that at the moment we are thinking of it we must bring as much attention to bear on it as if there were nothing else ... A "synthesis" of religion implies a lower quality of attention.&lt;ref&gt;''Notebooks of Simone Weil'', volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Last years===

In 1942, Weil traveled to the [[United States|United States of America]] with her family. She had been reluctant to leave [[France]], but agreed to do so as she wanted to see her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her. She was also encouraged by the fact that it would be relatively easy for her to reach Britain from the United States, where she could join the [[French Resistance]]. She had hopes of being sent back to France as a covert agent.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); chpt. 15 'Marseilles II', see esp. pp. 462-463.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Older biographies suggest Weil made no further progress in achieving her desire to return to France as an agent—she was limited to desk work in London, although this did give her time to write one of her largest and best known works: ''[[The Need for Roots]]''.&lt;ref&gt;This was originally a lengthy report on options for regenerating France after an allied victory, though it was later published as a book.&lt;/ref&gt;
Yet there is now evidence that Weil was recruited by the [[Special Operations Executive]], with a view to sending her back to France as a clandestine wireless operator. In May 1943, plans were underway to send her to [[Thame Park]] in Oxfordshire for training, but were cancelled soon after, as her failing health became known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seteuropeablaze.com/2012/11/simone-weil.html "Simone Weil" by Nigel Perrin] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210045454/http://blog.seteuropeablaze.com/2012/11/simone-weil.html |date=2012-12-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil Personal File, ref. HS 9/1570/1, National Archives, Kew&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SimoneWeilGraveAug2012.jpg|thumb|right|Weil's grave in Bybrook Cemetery, [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Kent]], August 2012]]
The punishing work-régime she assumed soon took a heavy toll; in 1943, she was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and instructed to rest and eat well. However, she refused special treatment because of her long-standing [[political idealism]] and her detachment from material things. Instead, she limited her food intake to what she believed residents of [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]] ate. She most likely ate even less, as she refused food on most occasions. Her condition quickly deteriorated, and she was moved to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Ashford, Kent]], England.&lt;ref name = "Coles"/&gt;

After a lifetime of battling illness and frailty, Weil died in August 1943 from [[cardiac failure]] at the age of 34. The coroner's report said that "the deceased did kill and slay herself by refusing to eat whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=McLellan, David | title=Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil | publisher=Poseidon Press | year=1990}}, Inquest verdict quoted on p. 266
&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of solidarity toward the victims of the war. Others think that Weil's self-starvation occurred after her study of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, David (1990). ''Utopian Pessimist: The Life and Thought of Simone Weil''. Poseidon Press., p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; (In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation, Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial). However, Simone Pétrement,&lt;ref&gt;Pétrement, Simone (1988). Simone Weil: A life. Schocken, 592 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Weil's first and most significant biographers, regards the coroner's report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated, Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and even ate a little bit a few days before her death; according to her, it is in fact Weil's poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988); chpt. 17 'London', see esp. pp. 530-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil's first English biographer, [[Richard Rees]], offers several possible explanations for her death, citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in Occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ. Rees sums up by saying: "As for her death, whatever explanation one may give of it will amount in the end to saying that she died of love".&lt;ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{Christian mysticism}}
===Mysticism in ''Gravity and Grace''===
While ''Gravity and Grace'' ({{lang-fr|La Pesanteur et la grâce}}) is one of the books most associated with Simone Weil, the work was not one she wrote to be published ''as a book''. Rather, the work consists of various passages selected from Weil's notebooks and arranged topically by Gustave Thibon, who knew and befriended her. Weil had in fact given to Thibon some of her notebooks, written before May 1942, but not with any idea or request to publish them. Hence, the resulting work, in its selections, organization and editing, is much influenced by Mr. Thibon, a devout Catholic. (See Thibon's Introduction to ''Gravity and Grace'' ([[Routledge|Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul]], 1952).)

[[T. S. Eliot]]'s preface to ''[[Simone Weil#The Need for Roots|The Need for Roots]]'' suggests that Weil might be regarded as a modern-day [[Marcion]]ite,&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, "Preface" to ''The Need for Roots'', p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; due to her virtually wholesale rejection of the [[Old Testament]] and her overall distaste for the [[Judaism]] that was technically hers by birth. Her niece, Sylvie Weil, and biographer Thomas R. Nevin have sought, on the contrary, to demonstrate that Weil did not reject Judaism and was heavily influenced by its precepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivry|first=Benjamin|title=Simone Weil's Rediscovered Jewish Inspiration|url=http://forward.com/articles/104410/simone-weil-s-rediscovered-jewish-inspiration/|publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absence====
Absence is the key image for her [[metaphysics]], [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]], [[cosmogony]], and theodicy. She believed that God created by an act of self-delimitation—in other words, because God is conceived as a kind of utter fullness, a perfect being, no creature could exist except where God was not. Thus creation occurred only when God withdrew in part. Similar ideas occur in [[Tzimtzum|Jewish mysticism]].

This is, for Weil, an original ''[[kenosis]]'' ("emptiness") preceding the corrective kenosis of Christ's incarnation (cf. [[Athanasius]]). We are thus born in a sort of damned position not owing to [[original sin]] as such, but because to be created at all we had to be precisely what God is not, i.e., we had to be the opposite of what is [[holy]]. (See [[Apophatic theology]].)

This notion of creation is a cornerstone of her [[theodicy]], for if creation is conceived this way (as necessarily containing evil within itself), then there is no [[problem of evil|problem]] of the entrance of evil into a perfect world. Nor does this constitute a delimitation of God's [[omnipotence]], if it is not that God could not create a perfect world, but that the act which we refer towards by saying "create" in its very [[essence]] implies the impossibility of perfection.

However, this notion of the necessity of evil does not mean that we are simply, originally, and continually doomed; on the contrary, Weil tells us that "Evil is the form which God's [[mercy]] takes in this world".&lt;ref&gt;''Gravity and Grace'', Metaxu, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Weil believed that evil, and its consequence, affliction, served the role of driving us out of ourselves and towards God—"The extreme affliction which overtakes human beings does not create human misery, it merely reveals it."&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Simone. ''Gravity and Grace''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Affliction====
Weil's concept of [[Suffering|affliction]] (''malheur'') goes beyond simple [[suffering]], though it certainly includes it. Only some souls are capable of truly experiencing affliction; these are precisely those souls which are least deserving of it—that are most prone or open to spiritual realization. Affliction is a sort of suffering "plus", which transcends both body and mind; such physical and mental anguish scourges the very soul.&lt;ref&gt;This notion of Weil's bears a strong resemblance to the Asian notion of ''han'', which has received attention in recent Korean theology, for instance in the work of Andrew Park. Like "affliction", ''han'' is more destructive to the whole person than ordinary suffering.&lt;/ref&gt;

War and oppression were the most intense cases of affliction within her reach; to experience it, she turned to the life of a [[factory]] worker, while to understand it she turned to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. (Her essay "[[The Iliad or the Poem of Force]]", first translated by [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], is a piece of Homeric literary criticism.) Affliction was associated both with necessity and with [[Randomness|chance]]—it was fraught with necessity because it was hard-wired into existence itself, and thus imposed itself upon the sufferer with the full force of the inescapable, but it was also subject to chance inasmuch as chance, too, is an inescapable part of the nature of existence. The element of chance was essential to the unjust character of affliction; in other words, my affliction should not usually—let alone always—follow from my sin, as per traditional Christian theodicy, but should be visited upon me for no special reason.

{{quote| The man who has known pure joy, if only for a moment ... is the only man for whom affliction is something devastating. At the same time he is the only man who has not deserved the punishment. But, after all, for him it is no punishment; it is God holding his hand and pressing rather hard. For, if he remains constant, what he will discover buried deep under the sound of his own lamentations is the pearl of the silence of God.

====''Metaxu'': "Every separation is a link"====
The concept of ''[[Metaxy|metaxu]]'', which Weil borrowed from [[Plato]], is that which both separates and connects (e.g., as a wall separates two prisoners but can be used to tap messages). This idea of connecting distance was of the first importance for Weil's understanding of the created realm. The world as a whole, along with any of its components, including our physical [[Human body|bodies]], is to be regarded as serving the same function for us in relation to God that a blind man's stick serves for him in relation to the world about him. They do not afford direct insight, but can be used experimentally to bring the mind into practical contact with reality. This metaphor allows any absence to be interpreted as a presence, and is a further component in Weil's theodicy.

====Beauty====
For Weil, "The beautiful is the experimental proof that the incarnation is possible". The beauty which is inherent in the form of the world (this inherency is proven, for her, in [[geometry]], and expressed in all good [[art]]) is the proof that the world points to something beyond itself; it establishes the essentially telic character of all that exists. Her concept of beauty extends throughout the universe: "we must have faith that the universe is beautiful on all levels...and that it has a fullness of beauty in relation to the bodily and psychic structure of each of the thinking beings that actually do exist and of all those that are possible. It is this very agreement of an infinity of perfect beauties that gives a transcendent character to the beauty of the world...He (Christ) is really present in the universal beauty. The love of this beauty proceeds from God dwelling in our souls and goes out to God present in the universe". She also wrote that "The beauty of this world is Christ's tender smile coming to us through matter".&lt;ref&gt;Weil, Simone. ''Waiting For God''. Harper Torchbooks, 1973, pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beauty]] also served a [[soteriology|soteriological]] function for Weil: "Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right to the soul." It constitutes, then, another way in which the [[divinity|divine]] reality behind the world invades our lives. Where affliction conquers us with brute force, beauty sneaks in and topples the empire of the self from within.

==Works==
::&lt;blockquote&gt;In the decades since her death, her writings have been assembled, annotated, criticized, discussed, disputed, and praised. Along with some twenty volumes of her works, publishers have issued more than thirty biographies, including ''Simone Weil: A Modern Pilgrimage'' by Robert Coles, [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning professor, who calls Weil 'a giant of reflection.'&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. McDonald, from the forward ''Wrestling with God, An Introduction to Simone Weil'' by The Trinity Forum c. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Need for Roots''===
Weil's book ''[[The Need for Roots]]'' was written in early 1943, immediately before her death later that year. She was in London working for the [[French Resistance]] and trying to convince its leader, [[Charles de Gaulle]], to form a contingent of nurses who would serve at the front lines.

''The Need for Roots'' has an ambitious plan. It sets out to address the past and to set out a road map for the future of France after World War&amp;nbsp;II. She painstakingly analyzes the spiritual and ethical [[Social environment|milieu]] that led to France's defeat by the German army, and then addresses these issues with the prospect of eventual French victory.

==Legacy==
[[Image:SimoneWeilAvenue.jpg|thumb|right|''Simone Weil Avenue'', a section of the [[A28 road]] which runs close to her grave in Ashford, was named in honour of the philosopher in 1983.]]
During her lifetime, Weil was only known to relatively narrow circles; even in France, her essays were mostly read only by those interested in radical politics. Yet during the first decade after her death, Weil rapidly became famous, attracting attention throughout the West. For the 3rd quarter of the twentieth century, she was widely regarded as the most influential person in the world on new work concerning religious and spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Even some of her critics conceded this, see Hellman (1982), p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Her philosophical,&lt;ref&gt;Note however that while Weil's philosophical work received much popular attention, including by intellectuals, she was relatively little studied by professional philosophers, especially in the English-speaking world, despite philosophy being the subject in which she was professionally trained. See for example the Introduction of  ''Simone Weil: "The Just Balance"'' by [[Peter Winch]] This is an excellent source for a philosophical discussion of her ideas, especially for those interested in the overlap between her work and that of Wittgenstein.&lt;/ref&gt; social and political thought also became popular, although not to the same degree as her religious work.&lt;ref&gt;Various scholars have listed her among the top five French political writers of the first half of the twentieth century, see Hellman (1982), p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as influencing fields of study, Weil deeply affected the personal lives of numerous individuals; [[Pope Paul VI]], for example, said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences.&lt;ref&gt;The other two being [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Georges Bernanos]]; see Hellman (1982), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Weil's popularity began to decline in the late sixties and seventies. However more of her work was gradually published, leading to many thousands of new secondary works by Weil scholars; some of whom focused on achieving a deeper understanding of her religious, philosophical and political work. Others broadened the scope of Weil scholarship to investigate her applicability to fields like classical studies, cultural studies, education and even technical fields like ergonomics.&lt;ref name = "Sian"/&gt; In 2010, Julia Haslett released the film ''An encounter with Simone Weil''; she noted that Weil had become "a little-known figure, practically forgotten in her native France, and rarely taught in universities or secondary schools".&lt;ref name = "encounter"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
However Weil's work has continued to be the subject of ongoing scholarship, with a metastudy finding that over 2500 new scholarly works had been published about her between 1995 and 2012.&lt;ref name = "Calgary"/&gt;

Many commentators who have assessed Weil as a person were highly positive; many described her as a saint, some even as the greatest saint of the twentieth century, including [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Leslie Fiedler]], and [[Robert Coles (psychiatrist)|Robert Coles]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hellman (1982) for a list her biographers who portrayed her as a saint.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weil biographer [[Gabriella Fiori]] writes that Weil was "a moral genius in the orbit of ethics, a genius of immense revolutionary range."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1120206.html "The Lonely Pilgrimage of Simone Weil", ''The Washington Post'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 [[Albert Camus]] wrote that she was "the only great spirit of our times."&lt;ref name = "Hellman"/&gt; Foolish though she may have appeared at times—dropping a suitcase full of French resistance papers all over the sidewalk and scrambling to gather them up—her deep engagement with both the theory and practice of [[Charity (virtue)|caritas]], in all its myriad forms, functions as the unifying force of her life and thought. [[Gustave Thibon]], the French philosopher and close friend, recounts their last meeting, not long before her death: "I will only say that I had the impression of being in the presence of an absolutely transparent soul which was ready to be reabsorbed into original light".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ericadacosta.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/simone-weil.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weil has however been criticised even by those who otherwise deeply admired her, such as Eliot, for being excessively prone to divide the world into good and evil, and for her sometimes intemperate judgments. Weil was a harsh critic of the influence of [[Judaism]] on Western civilisation, and an even harsher critic of the [[Roman empire]], in which she refused to see any value at all.&lt;ref&gt;She even disliked Romans who are normally admired by progressives, like [[Virgil]], [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Tacitus]], reserving moderate praise only for the [[Gracchi]].&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, according to Eliot, she held up the [[Catharism|Cathars]] as exemplars of goodness, despite there being in his view little concrete evidence on which to base such an assessment.&lt;ref name = "Eliot"/&gt; According to Pétrement she idolised [[Lawrence of Arabia]], considering him to be a Saint.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Pétrement (1988), p. 329, 334&lt;/ref&gt; A few critics have taken an overall negative view: several Jewish writers, including Susan Sontag, accused her of [[anti-Semitism]], though this was far from a universal shared perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Several of her most ardent admirers have also been Jewish, Wladimir Rabi, a contemporary French intellectual for example, called her the greatest French spiritual writer of the first half the twentieth century. See Hellman (1982), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A small minority of commentators have judged her to be psychologically unbalanced or sexually obsessed.&lt;ref name = "Hellman"/&gt;  General [[Charles de Gaulle]], her ultimate boss while she worked for the ''French Resistance'', considered her "insane",&lt;ref&gt;"Elle est folle". See Malcolm Muggeridge, "The Infernal Grove", Fontana: Glasgow (pbk), 1975, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; though even he was influenced by her and repeated some of her sayings for years after her death.&lt;ref name = "Hellman"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sian"/&gt;

The [[sociology of science|sociology]] and [[philosophy of science]], as well as the entire field of [[science studies]], have in the 20th century been occupied with the question of large-scale patterns and trends in the development of [[science]], and asking questions about how science "works" both in a philosophical and practical sense.

==Science as a social enterprise==

Science as a social enterprise has been developing exponentially for the past few centuries. In antiquity, the few people who were able to engage in natural inquiry were either wealthy themselves, had rich benefactors, or had the support of a religious community. Today, scientific research has tremendous government support and also ongoing support from the private sector.

Available methods of communication have improved tremendously over time. Instead of waiting months or years for a hand-copied letter to arrive, today scientific communication can be practically instantaneous. Earlier, most natural philosophers worked in relative isolation, due to the difficulty and slowness of communication. Still, there was a considerable amount of cross-fertilization between distant groups and individuals.

Nowadays, almost all modern scientists participate in a [[scientific community]], hypothetically global in nature (though often based around a relatively few nations and institutions of stature), but also strongly segregated into different fields of study. The scientific community is important because it represents a source of established knowledge which, if used properly, ought to be more reliable than personally acquired knowledge of any given individual. The community also provides a [[feedback]] mechanism, often in the form of practices such as [[peer review]] and [[reproducibility]]. Most items of scientific content (experimental results, theoretical proposals, or literature reviews) are reported in [[scientific journal]]s and are hypothetically subjected to peer scrutiny, though a number of scholarly critics from both inside and outside the scientific community have, in recent decades, began to question the effect of commercial and government investment in science on the peer review and publishing process, as well as the internal disciplinary limitations to the scientific publication process.

A major development of the [[Scientific Revolution]] was the foundation of scientific societies: [[Academia Secretorum Naturae]] (Accademia dei Segreti, the Academy of the Mysteries of Nature) can be considered the first scientific community; founded in [[Naples]] 1560 by [[Giambattista della Porta]]. The Academy had an exclusive membership rule: discovery of a new law of nature was a prerequisite for admission. It was soon shut down by [[Pope Paul V]] for alleged [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].

The Academia Secretorum Naturae was replaced by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], which was founded in [[Rome]] in 1603. The Lincei included [[Galileo]] as a member, but failed upon his condemnation in 1633. The [[Accademia del Cimento]], [[Florence]] 1657, lasted 10 years. The [[Royal Society]] of London, 1660 to the present day, brought together a diverse collection of scientists to discuss theories, conduct experiments, and review each other's work. The [[Académie des Sciences]] was created as an institution of the government of France 1666, meeting in the King's library. The [[Akademie der Wissenschaften]] began in [[Berlin]] 1700.

Early scientific societies provided valuable functions, including a community open to and interested in [[empirical]] inquiry, and also more familiar with and more educated about the subject. In 1758, with the aid of his pupils, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the Turin Academy.

Much of what is considered the modern institution of science was formed during its professionalization in the 19th century. During this time the location of scientific research shifted primarily to [[university|universities]], though to some extent it also became a standard component of [[industry]] as well. In the early years of the 20th century, especially after the role of science in the [[World War I|first World War]], governments of major industrial nations began to invest heavily in scientific research. This effort was dwarfed by the funding of scientific research undertaken by all sides in [[World War II]], which produced such "wonder weapons" as [[radar]], [[rocket]]ry, and the [[atomic bomb]]. During the [[Cold War]], a large amount of government resources were poured into science by the United States, [[USSR]], and many European powers. It was during this time that [[DARPA]] funded nationwide computer networks, one of them eventually under the [[internet protocol]]. In the post-Cold War era, a decline in government funding from many countries has been met with an increase of industrial and private investment. The funding of science is a major factor in its historical and global development.  So although science is hypothetically international in scope, in a practical sense it has usually centered around wherever it could find the most funding.

===Major events in the history of scientific communication===
[[File:Gutenberg.press.jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]-era [[printing press]]es allowed the rapid spread of new ideas across 15th and 16th century Europe.]]

*The [[cave painting]]s depicted events, with no commentary. From 40,000 BC to 15,000 BC.
*The [[Ishango Bone]] dated 25,000 years ago could only show [[Tally marks|tallies]] in [[mathematical notation]].
*The clay tablets of Mesopotamia show the ''scale'' of the commentary or the information: the argument and logic of a discovery would be limited to what fit on the tablet. From late [[4th millennium]] onwards.
*[[Poetry]] and [[rhyme]] allowed people to remember memorable events more easily. For example, the [[China|Chinese]] [[generation name]]s are taken from a poem selected by each family.
*The [[parchment]] and [[paper]] [[scroll]]s which arose in Greek and in Chinese culture could start to contain the history and development of ideas and discoveries. Parchment was invented in [[Pergamon]] in the 2nd century BC, while the manufacture of paper was described for the first time in 105 AD in China. It was brought to Western world only in the 13th century.
*The [[codex]] or [[book]] of medieval times allowed ''random access'' to specific passages. The systematic printing and production of books could then allow the systematic production of new ideas. From late 1st century onwards.
*By the 20th century, the scale and scope of scientific work allowed [[collaboration]] of researchers and the definition of consistent [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s for this collaboration in scientific work.

==Political support==
One of the basic requirements for a scientific community is the existence and approval of a political sponsor; in England, the [[Royal Society]] operates under the aegis of the monarchy; in the US, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] was founded by Act of the [[United States Congress]]; etc. Otherwise, when the basic elements of knowledge were being formulated, the political rulers of the respective communities could choose to arbitrarily either support or disallow the nascent scientific communities. For example, [[Alhazen]] had to feign madness to avoid execution. The polymath [[Shen Kuo]] lost political support, and could not continue his studies until he came up with discoveries that showed his worth to the political rulers. The admiral [[Zheng He]] could not continue his voyages of exploration after the emperors withdrew their support. Another famous example was the suppression of the work of [[Galileo]], by the twentieth century, Galileo would be pardoned.

==Patterns in the history of science==
{{see also|Scientific consensus#Scientific consensus and the scientific minority}}

One of the major occupations with those interested in the history of science is whether or not it displays certain patterns or trends, usually along the question of change between one or more scientific theories. Generally speaking, there have historically been three major models adopted in various forms within the [[philosophy of science]].

[[File:Three models of theory change.png|right|frame|Three models of change in scientific theories, depicted graphically to reflect roughly the different views associated with [[Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]].]]

The first major model, implicit in most early histories of science and generally a model put forward by practicing scientists themselves in their textbook literature, is associated with the criticisms of [[logical positivism]] by [[Karl Popper]] (1902&amp;ndash;1994) from the 1930s. Popper's model of science is one in which [[scientific progress]] is achieved through a [[Falsifiability|falsification]] of incorrect theories and the adoption instead of theories which are progressively closer to truth. In this model, scientific progress is a linear accumulation of facts, each one adding to the last. In this model, the [[physics]] of [[Aristotle]] (384 BC{{spaced ndash}}322 BC) was simply subsumed by the work of [[Isaac Newton]] (1642&amp;ndash;1727) ([[classical mechanics]]), which itself was eclipsed by the work of [[Albert Einstein]] (1879&amp;ndash;1955) ([[Theory of relativity|Relativity]]), and later the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] (established in 1925), each one more accurate than the last.

A major challenge to this model came from the work of the historian and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]] (1922&amp;ndash;1996) in his work ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' published in 1962. Kuhn, a former physicist, argued against the view that scientific progress was linear, and that modern scientific theories were necessarily just more accurate versions of theories of the past. Rather, Kuhn's version of scientific development consisted of dominant structures of thought and practices, which he called "[[paradigm]]s", in which research went through phases of "[[normal science|normal]]" science ("puzzle solving") and "[[revolutionary science|revolutionary]]" science (testing out new theories based on new assumptions, brought on by uncertainty and crisis in existing theories). In Kuhn's model, different paradigms represented entirely different and [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurate]] assumptions about the universe.  The mode was thus uncertain about whether paradigms shifted in a way which necessarily relied upon greater attainment of truth. In Kuhn's view, Aristotle's physics, Newton's classical mechanics, and Einstein's Relativity were entirely different ways to think about the world; each successive paradigm defined what questions could be asked about the world and (perhaps arbitrarily) discarded aspects of the previous paradigm which no longer seemed applicable or important. Kuhn claimed that far from merely building on the previous theory's accomplishments, each new paradigm essentially throws out the old way of looking at the universe, and comes up with its own vocabulary to describe it and its own guidelines for expanding knowledge within the new [[paradigm]].

Kuhn's model met with much suspicion from scientists, historians, and philosophers. Some scientists felt that Kuhn went too far in divorcing scientific progress from truth; many historians felt that his argument was too codified for something as polyvariant and historically contingent as scientific change; and many philosophers felt that the argument did not go far enough. The furthest extreme of such reasoning was put forth by the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] (1924&amp;ndash;1994), who argued that there were no consistent methodologies used by all scientists at all times which allowed certain forms of inquiry to be labeled "scientific" in a way which made them different from any other form of inquiry, such as [[witchcraft]]. Feyerabend argued harshly against the notion that falsification was ever truly followed in the history of science, and noted that scientists had long undertaken practices to arbitrarily consider theories to be accurate even if they failed many sets of tests. Feyerabend argued that a pluralistic methodology should be undertaken for the investigation of knowledge, and noted that many forms of knowledge which were previously thought to be "non-scientific" were later accepted as a valid part of the scientific canon.

Many other theories of scientific change have been proposed over the years with various changes of emphasis and implications. In general, though, most float somewhere between these three models for change in scientific theory, the connection between theory and truth, and the nature of scientific progress.

==The nature of scientific discovery==

Individual ideas and accomplishments are among the most famous aspects of science, both internally and in larger society.  Breakthrough  figures like [[Sir Isaac Newton]] or [[Albert Einstein]] are often celebrated as [[genius]]es and [[hero]]es of science.  Popularizers of science, including the news media and scientific biographers, contribute to this phenomenon.  But many scientific historians emphasize the collective aspects of scientific discovery, and de-emphasize the importance of the [[eureka effect|"Eureka!" moment]].

A detailed look at the history of science often reveals that the minds of great thinkers were primed with the results of previous efforts, and often arrive on the scene to find a crisis of one kind or another.  For example, Einstein did not consider the physics of motion and gravitation in isolation.  His major accomplishments solved a problem which had come to a head in the field only in recent years &amp;mdash; empirical data showing that the speed of light was inexplicably constant, no matter the apparent speed of the observer.  (See [[Michelson-Morley experiment]].)  Without this information, it is very unlikely that Einstein would have conceived of anything like relativity.

The question of who should get credit for any given discovery is often a source of some controversy.  There are many priority disputes, in which multiple individuals or teams have competing claims over who discovered something first.  Multiple simultaneous discovery is actually a surprisingly common phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;''How We Know: An Exploration of the Scientific Process,'' by Goldstein, I.F. and Goldstein, M. (Westview / Da Capo {{ISBN|978-0-306-80140-2}} , 1981) page 255&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps largely explained by the idea that previous contributions (including the emergence of contradictions between existing theories, or unexpected empirical results) make a certain concept ready for discovery.  Simple priority disputes are often a matter of documenting when certain experiments were performed, or when certain ideas were first articulated to colleagues or recorded in a fixed medium.

Many times the question of exactly which event should qualify as the moment of discovery is difficult to answer.  One of the most famous examples of this is the question of the discovery of [[oxygen]].  While [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] were able to concentrate oxygen in the laboratory and characterize its properties, they did not recognize it as a component of air.  Priestly actually thought it was ''missing'' a hypothetical component of air, known as [[phlogiston theory|phlogiston]], which air was supposed to absorb from materials that are being burned.  It was only several years later that [[Antoine Lavoisier]] first conceived of the modern notion of oxygen &amp;mdash; as a substance that is consumed from the air in the processes of burning and respiration.

By the late 20th Century, scientific research has become a large-scale effort, largely accomplished in institutional teams.  The amount and frequency of inter-team collaboration has continued to increase, especially after the rise of the [[Internet]], which is a central tool for the modern scientific community.  This further complicates the notion of individual accomplishment in science.

{{Platonism}}

The &lt;!-- "theory" lowercase as in all other theories--&gt;'''theory of Forms''' or '''theory of Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respect tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W. D. Ross, Plato's ''Theory of Ideas'' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This quote has to be checked including the erroneous volume no. (there are only 2), the missing page number, and the uppercase "theory"--&gt; The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. However, it is attributed to Plato without any direct textual evidence that Plato himself holds the views of the speakers of the dialogues. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}..., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | page=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a viewpoint attributed to [[Plato]], which holds that non-physical (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) forms (or ideas)&lt;!--not uppercase here because normal English words modified by the descriptive "abstract"--&gt; represent the most accurate reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.''&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this sense, the word ''form''&lt;!-- but not the article--&gt; or ''idea'' is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). Encyclopædia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that ''Form'' or ''Idea'' get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Even whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theory is considered [[Platonic realism|a classical solution]] to the [[problem of universals]].

The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. 

==Forms&lt;!--linked from 'Third man argument'--&gt;==
The meaning of the term {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), "visible form", and related terms μορφή (''morphē''), "shape",&lt;ref&gt;Possibly cognate with Sanskrit ''bráhman''. See Thieme (1952): ''Bráhman'', ZDMG, vol. 102, p. 128.{{cite web | title=ZDMG online | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/93820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and φαινόμενα (''phainomena''), "appearances", from φαίνω (''phainō''), "shine", [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰeh₂-|''*bʰeh₂-'']]'' or ''*bhā-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=*bhā- | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition: Appendix I | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], starting with [[Thales]], noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes "really" is. The answer was [[Substance theory|substance]], which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?

Thus, the theory of matter and form (today's [[hylomorphism]]) was born. Starting with at least Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratics the forms were considered as being "in" something else, which Plato called nature (''physis''). The latter seemed as carved "wood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.G. |last=Liddell |first2=R. |last2=Scott |first3=J.M. |last3=Whiton |year=1891 |title=A Lexicon Abridged From Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Harper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;pg=PA725 |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; ὕλη (''hyle'') in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to ''materia'' in [[Latin]], from which the English word "[[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]" is derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=matter | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/M0155100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.

The Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness. Form answers the question, "What is that?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or "really" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. [[The problem of universals]] – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects. For example, [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] states, "Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed."&lt;ref name="Parmenides"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p129}} Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 389: "For neither does every smith, although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary ...."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' 185d–e: "...the mind in itself is its own instrument for contemplating the common terms that apply to everything." "Common terms" here refers to ''existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, unity'' and ''number''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is ''aspatial'' (transcendent to space) and ''atemporal'' (transcendent to time). Atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time.  It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The creation of the universe is the creation of time: "For there were no days and nights and months and years ... but when he (God) constructed the heaven he created them also." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 37. For the creation God used "the pattern of the unchangeable," which is "that which is eternal." — paragraph 29. Therefore "eternal" – ''to aïdion'', "the everlasting" – as applied to Form means atemporal.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location.&lt;ref&gt;Space answers to matter, the place-holder of form: "... and there is a third nature (besides Form and form), which is space (chōros), and is eternal (aei "always", certainly not atemporal), and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things ... we say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy space ...." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 52. Some readers will have long since remembered that in Aristotle time and space are accidental forms. Plato does not make this distinction and concerns himself mainly with essential form. In Plato, if time and space were admitted to be form, time would be atemporal and space aspatial.&lt;/ref&gt; They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).&lt;ref&gt;These terms produced with the English prefix a- are not ancient. For the usage refer to {{cite web | title=a- (2) | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=a- }} They are however customary terms of modern metaphysics; for example, see {{cite book | first=Martha C. | last=Beck | title=Plato's Self-Corrective Development of the Concepts of Soul, Form and Immortality in Three Arguments of the Phaedo | publisher=Edwin Mellon Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-7734-7950-3 | page=148 }} and see {{cite book | first=Dr. Katherine | last=Hawley | title=How Things Persist | year=2001 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-924913-X | nopp=true | page=Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is an objective "blueprint" of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 28: "The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect ...."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forms are perfect themselves because they are unchanging.  For example, say we have a triangle drawn on a blackboard.  A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.  The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect.  However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form "triangle" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form "triangle" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, the time is that of the observer and not of the triangle.

=== Etymology ===
The words, εἶδος (''eidos'') and ἰδέα (''idea'') come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-|''*weyd-'']] or ''*weid-'' "see" (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''vétti''). ''Eidos'' (though not ''idea'') is already attested in texts of the [[Homer|Homeric]] era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression "theory of Ideas." The word is however not the English "idea," which is a mental concept only.

===Terminology===
[[File:Allegory of the Cave blank.png|thumb|In the [[Allegory of the Cave]], the objects that are seen are not real, according to Plato, but literally mimic the real Forms.]]
The English word "form" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward "form" or appearance of something, and "Form" in a new, technical nature, that never&lt;blockquote&gt;...assumes a form  like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses  of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner....&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 Plato's ''Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The objects that are seen, according to [[Plato]], are not real, but literally ''mimic'' the real Forms. In the [[Allegory of the Cave]] expressed in ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the [[archetype]]s of the many [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (that is, of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]) of things observed.

===Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms===
Plato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''Republic'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the ''Phaedo'', for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (''Phd.'' 109a-111c). In the ''Phaedrus'' the Forms are in a "place beyond heaven" (''huperouranios topos'') (''Phdr.'' 247c ff); and in the ''Republic'' the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (''noēton topon'') in the famous Allegory of the Cave.

It would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one.&lt;ref&gt;"No sensible man would insist that these things are as I have described them..." (''Phd.'' 114d).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"there is no Platonic 'elsewhere', similar to the Christian 'elsewhere'." ([[Iris Murdoch]], "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals" (London, Chatto &amp; Windus 1992)  399).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/#3 Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we read in the ''Symposium'' of the Form of Beauty: "It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself," (211b). And in the ''Timaeus'' Plato writes: "Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, ''nor itself enters into anything anywhere'', is one thing," (52a, emphasis added).

===Ideal state===
{{original research|date=February 2016}}
According to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Analogy of the Cave, Rep. 514a–520a.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, "the offspring of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, 508b trans. Grube&lt;/ref&gt; Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.

Plato lays out much of this theory in the "Republic" where, in an  attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Phaedo, Meno, Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt;

The republic is a greater imitation of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class,&lt;ref&gt;The word is ''ethnos'', "people". For the full range of meanings consult the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] online under [http://www.bartleby.com/61/88/E0228800.html ethnic].&lt;/ref&gt; but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word "founding" (''oikidzomen''), which is used of colonization.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], [[Solon]]). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word "purge" (''diakathairountes'')&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 399e line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.

The purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes&lt;ref&gt;"Types" (''genē'') rather than the English economic classes or the favored populations of the real Greek cities.&lt;/ref&gt; as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English "intelligence") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.

The views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: "... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.

Their genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: "... he ([[Asclepius]], a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: "... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.

Perhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians "... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 412.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: "Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as "stuffs," the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.

==Evidence of Forms==
Plato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] only and is as follows.

===Human perception===
We call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] in ''Metaphysics'' Α987a.29–b.14 and Μ1078b9–32 says that Plato devised the Forms to answer a weakness in the doctrine of [[Heraclitus]], who held that nothing exists, but everything is in a state of flow. If nothing exists then nothing can be known. It is possible that Plato took the Socratic search for definitions and extrapolated it into a distinct metaphysical theory. Little is known of the historical Socrates' own views, but the theory of Forms is likely a Platonic innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D, (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor. {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfection===
No one has ever seen a [[Perfection|perfect]] circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?

==Criticisms of Platonic Forms==
===Self-criticism===
Plato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered  his own criticisms of it in his dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']].  There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems  that are made to puzzle the younger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by [[Aristotle]] in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of ''Parmenides'' "sets up" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the "participation" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of "participate", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous [[third man argument]] of Parmenides,&lt;ref&gt;The name is from [[Aristotle]], who says in ''Metaphysics'' A.IX.990b.15: "(The argument) they call the third man." A summary of the argument and the quote from Aristotle can be found in the venerable {{Cite journal | first=George | last=Grote | author-link=George Grote | contribution=App I Aristotle's Objections to Plato's Theory  | title=Aristotle: Second Edition with Additions | year=1880 | pages=559–60 note b | place=London | publisher=John Murray }} (downloadable Google Books). Grote points out that Aristotle lifted this argument from the ''Parmenides'' of Plato; certainly, his words indicate the argument was already well-known under that name.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the argument has been going on for quite a number of centuries now and some analyses are complex, technical and perhaps tedious for the general reader. Those who are interested in the more technical analyses can find more of a presentation in {{cite journal | last=Hales | first=Steven D. |  title=The Recurring Problem of the Third Man | journal=Auslegung | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=67–80 | year=1991 | url=http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf }} and {{cite journal | last=Durham | first=Michael | title=Two Men and the Third Man | journal=The Dualist: Undergraduate Journal of Philosophy (Stanford University) | volume=4 | year=1997 | url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/durham.pdf | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An [[infinite regress]]ion would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.

The young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they "mime" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into [[Representative realism|representationalism]], that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.

Socrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Plato to a large extent identifies what today is called [[insight]] with recollection: "whenever on seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?" — ''[[Phaedo]]'', paragraph 229. Thus geometric reasoning on the part of persons who know no geometry is not insight but is  recollection. He does recognize insight: "... with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem ..." (with regard to "the course of scrutiny") — ''[[The Seventh Letter]]'' 344b. Unfortunately the hidden world can in no way be verified in this world and its otherworldness can only be a matter of speculation. Plato was aware of the problem: "How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me." — ''[[Cratylus]]'', paragraph 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comedian [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[The Clouds]]'', poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.

===Aristotelian criticism===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).  Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher Forms, while Aristotle disagrees and points downwards to the here-and-now, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
The topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]], by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.

In the summary passage quoted above&lt;ref name=summ&gt;Paragraph 50 a–c, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato distinguishes between real and non-real "existing things", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher [[W.D. Ross]] objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.&lt;ref name=rossXI&gt;Ross, Chapter XI, initial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted "I have often been puzzled about these things"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', paragraph 130c.&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, "it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form."

Ross&lt;ref name=rossXI/&gt; also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from "A is not B" to "A is Not-B." Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only ''particulars'' of Form Otherness that somehow ''suppress'' Form Greek.

Regardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.

Plato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's [[metempsychosis|past lives]] and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of [[epistemology]] are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, "that which is non-existent cannot be known".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' 71b.25.&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' III 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Book III Chapters 3–4, paragraphs 999a ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The '''Weymouth New Testament''' ("WNT"), otherwise known as '''''The New Testament in Modern Speech''''' or '''''The Modern Speech New Testament''''', is a translation of the New Testament into nineteenth century English by [[Richard Francis Weymouth]].

It was based on the text of ''The Resultant Greek Testament''. The text was produced by Weymouth. It was what resulted from his compilation of readings from Stephens (1550), Lachmann, Tregelles, [[Tischendorf]], Lightfoot, Ellicott, Alford, Weiss, the Bâle edition (1880), Westcott and Hort, and the Revision Committee of London. Where these editions differed, Weymouth selected the reading favoured by the majority of editors. The text was prepared for final publication by his secretary, Reverend Ernest Hampden-Cook, after Weymouth's death in 1902.

Weymouth also prepared a translation of his text, with notes. His aim was to discover how the inspired writers would have expressed and described the events of the [[New Testament]] had they been writing in nineteenth-century English. The translation was edited for publication by Hampden-Cook, also in 1903. It was published in 1903 by Baker &amp; Taylor Company (New York) and James Clarke &amp; Co (London). The Preface to the original states that the version was chiefly designed to ''furnish a succinct and compressed running commentary (not doctrinal) to be used side by side with its elder compeers.'' &lt;ref name="http://www.bible-researcher.com/weymouth.html"&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/weymouth.html Bible Research: Weymouth New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second edition appeared in 1904, and a third in 1909. A pocket edition, without notes, was published in 1913. A fourth edition was revised by James Alexander Robertson and several other well-known New Testament scholars, and published in 1924. A further revision was published in 1929.&lt;br /&gt;

The translation has been in print ever since with millions of copies sold. Weymouth succeeded in rendering the New Testament into a dignified modern English edition without ecclesiastical or doctrinal bias making it desirable to Christian readers of all denominations.

'''William of Saint-Amour''' was a minor figure in thirteenth-century [[scholasticism]], chiefly notable for his withering attacks on the [[friars]].

==Biography==
William was born in [[Saint-Amour, Jura]], then part of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], in c. 1200. Under the patronage of the [[Count of Savoy]], he was active at the [[University of Paris]] from the 1220s, becoming master of arts in 1228. From a reference in a letter by [[Gregory IX]], it is evident that he had become a doctor of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] by 1238. By 1250 he had been made master of [[theology]].

The controversy on which his fame rests began in earnest in the 1250s. The gradual encroachment of the newly formed [[mendicant orders]] into the university was the immediate cause of this. The secular clergy had previously enjoyed unrivalled teaching privileges at Paris, but the friars presented a serious challenge to their monopoly, gaining a number of prominent lecturing posts: the career of [[Bonaventure]] is indicative of the friars' rising stature in academia. The seculars bitterly resented this incursion, and engaged in a prolonged conflict with the friars. According to [[Matthew Paris]]' ''Chronica Majora'', this controversy brought the university to a point of near-collapse, 'exposed to danger, owing to the suspension of its lectures and disputations, and the dispersion of many of its scholars...owing to the insults and reproaches of the Preachers and Minors'. Particularly offensive was the friars' desire to increase the number of teaching positions, entirely against established custom. At length the dispute was brought before the [[Roman Curia|papal curia]]. William had emerged as the mouthpiece of the secular party, and in 1254 he and five other masters directly petitioned [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]]. The pope proved sympathetic to their concerns: Innocent duly limited many of the friars' powers, and reduced the number of chairs they could legitimately occupy at the university. This victory, however, was short-lived. Innocent died in the December of the same year, and was replaced by [[Pope Alexander IV|Alexander IV]]. Alexander was cardinal protector of the [[Franciscans]] and therefore unlikely to side with the seculars: he promptly overturned the restrictions imposed by his predecessor, allowing the friars to be readmitted to Paris.

Hostilities resumed immediately, and William began to produce some of his most sustained and vitriolic sermons and treatises. As might be expected, his campaign against the regulars was not tolerated for long. In 1255 Pope Alexander ordered an inquiry into William's orthodoxy, resulting in his suspension from all teaching and administrative duties. In 1256 William produced ''De periculis novissimorum temporum'' (On the Dangers of the Final Days), a vicious tirade against the friars, and the culmination of his antifraternal thought. This ridiculed the more extreme eschatological speculations of some friars (e.g., [[Gerard da Burgo Santo Donnino]], author of the ''Introductorius ad Evangelium Aeternum''), who alleged that the fraternal orders would usher in the third and final age of the world, a glorious era of the [[Holy Spirit]]. ''De Periculis'' implied that the friars would indeed be instrumental in precipitating the end of the world, but only because they would facilitate the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. The treatise attracted written opposition from [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], both Dominican friars, and was examined by a curial committee. Thomas Aquinas wrote [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraImpugnantes.htm Contra Impugnantes] to rebut William's charges. In 1257 Alexander ordered William's treatise to be burned: he also excommunicated William, and exiled him from France. Upon Alexander's death in 1266, William returned to Paris, although does not appear to have been reinstated at the university. He died at Burgundy in September 1272.

== Works ==

=== ''De periculis novissimorum temporum'' ===
William's major work had an influence far beyond the compass of his own lifetime. It became the fountainhead of a long polemical tradition. Its most important section consists of thirty-nine 'signa' (or forty-one, in some versions) by which 'false Apostles' may be known. Although it is never openly stated, these 'signs' describe the behaviour of friars. The signs are, in order:
{| class="wikitable"
|
'''I.''' entry into houses and women's private chambers;
'''II.''' flattery and deceit;
'''III.''' refusal to be corrected;
'''IV.''' boastfulness;
'''V.''' seeking letters of commendation;
'''VI.''' preaching without a summons;
'''VII.''' claiming authority in their own name rather than that of God;
'''VIII.''' teaching their own traditions rather than the lessons of the gospel;
'''IX.''' living by begging rather than their own labour;
'''X.''' rejoicing when praise is given to them rather than to God;
'''XI.''' preaching for temporal gain;
'''XII.''' claiming greater authority than parish priests;
'''XIII.''' extorting goods under pretence of friendship;
'''XIV.''' arguing against the truth;
'''XV.''' coercing men to hear or receive them;
'''XVI.''' defying and enraging secular rulers;
'''XVII.''' disregarding true prophecies;
'''XVIII.''' desiring gold and silver from their congregations;
'''XIX.''' causing discord in the church;
'''XX.''' not suffering persecution;
'''XXI.''' ministering to the congregations of parish priests;
'''XXII.''' obstinacy and pride;
'''XXIII.''' wishing only to please men;
'''XXIV.''' desiring luxurious foodstuffs;
'''XXV.''' preferring the esteem of their neighbours to the grace of God;
'''XXVI.''' building grand and ornate lodgings;
'''XXVII.''' prospering from the labour of others while living in idleness;
'''XXVIII.''' claiming the power to command the Holy Ghost;
'''XXIX.''' promoting themselves rather than Christ;
'''XXX.''' participating in secular entertainments;
'''XXXI.''' dining at the tables of others;
'''XXXII.''' hatefulness;
'''XXXIII.''' vengefulness towards all who challenge or question them;
'''XXXIV.''' preaching only to men already converted to the faith;
'''XXXV.''' trespassing on other priests' territories;
'''XXXVI.''' demanding the credit for works God has achieved through them;
'''XXXVII.''' relying on logic and reason rather than divine revelation;
'''XXXVIII.''' nepotism;
'''XXXIX.''' courting worldly support.

William decorates these imputations with various allusions to the [[Benedictine Rule]], the [[Pauline epistles]] and [[Acts of the Apostles]]. The friars are variously likened to ravening wolves (''lupi graves''), stealers into people's homes (''penetrantes domos''), idlers and meddlers (''otiosos et curiosos''), aimless wanderers (''gyrovaguos'') and, most recurrently, false preachers (''pseudo-praedicatores'').

In Penn Szittya's phrase, this set of accusations and themes formed an enduring 'symbolic language', one that persisted among the friars' opponents for the next three centuries. In [[France]], William's attacks were reiterated in the Parisian disputes of 1354, when two prominent bishops delivered diatribes against the friars; they also directly stimulated the satires of [[Rutebeuf]] and [[Jean de Meun]]. In [[Ireland]], his arguments formed the backbone of [[Richard Fitzralph]]'s ''Defensio Curatorum'', a much-copied and widely circulated sermon of 1350. In [[Scotland]], [[Dunbar]] and [[Robert Henryson]] drew on William's motifs; in [[Germany]], the Lutheran pamphleteers [[Johann Eberlin von Gunzburg]] and [[Heinrich Spelt]] made much use of his ideas. William's work proved especially influential in England, where one of his earliest supporters, a Master Laurence, appears to have been active. The work of [[William Langland|Langland]], [[John Gower]] and [[Chaucer]] directly echoes ''De Periculis'', while its key ideas were assimilated into [[Lollard]] ideology from [[Wyclif]] onwards (see especially [[Pierce the Ploughman's Crede]]). William's ideas even re-emerge in the Protestant writings of [[William Tyndale]], [[John Bale]] and [[John Foxe]], whose ''Actes and Monuments'' quotes ''De Periculis'' in its entirety. Although his own struggle against the friars ended in abject failure, William's legacy was thus extremely far-reaching. He powerfully stigmatised one of the dominant factions in the late medieval church, providing generations of critics with an arsenal of ready-made indictments.
