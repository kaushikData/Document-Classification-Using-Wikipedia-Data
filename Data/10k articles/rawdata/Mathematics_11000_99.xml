      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7440">In [[mathematics]], '''{{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ⋯}}''' is the [[infinite series]] whose terms are the successive [[powers of two]]. As a [[geometric series]], it is characterized by its first term, 1, and its [[Geometric series#Common ratio|common ratio]], 2. As a series of [[real number]]s it [[divergent series|diverges]] to [[infinity]], so in the usual sense it has no sum. In a much broader sense, the series is associated with another value besides ∞, namely −1, which is the limit of the series using the [[p-adic numbers|2-adic metric]].

==Summation==
The partial sums of {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯}} are {{nowrap|1, 3, 7, 15, …;}} since these diverge to infinity, so does the series. 

:&lt;math&gt;2^0+2^1+..+2^k = 2^{k+1}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, any [[totally regular summation method]] gives a sum of infinity, including the [[Cesàro summation|Cesàro sum]] and [[Abel summation|Abel sum]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is at least one generally useful method that sums {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯}} to the finite value of −1. The associated [[power series]]

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 1+2x+4x^2+8x^3+\cdots+2^n{}x^n+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-2x}&lt;/math&gt; 

has a [[radius of convergence]] around 0 of only {{sfrac|1|2}}, so it does not converge at {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 1}}. Nonetheless, the so-defined function ''f'' has a unique [[analytic continuation]] to the [[complex plane]] with the point {{nowrap|1=''x'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}}} deleted, and it is given by the same rule {{nowrap|1=''f''(x) = {{sfrac|1|1 − 2''x''}}}}. Since {{nowrap|1=''f''(1) = −1}}, the original series {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯}} is said to be summable ([[Euler summation|E]]) to −1, and −1 is the (E) sum of the series. (The notation is due to [[G. H. Hardy]] in reference to [[Leonhard Euler]]'s approach to divergent series).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy pp.8, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

An almost identical approach (the one taken by Euler himself) is to consider the power series whose coefficients are all 1, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;1+y+y^2+y^3+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-y}&lt;/math&gt;

and plugging in ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. Of course these two series are related by the substitution ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''x''.

The fact that (E) summation assigns a finite value to {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + …}} shows that the general method is not totally regular. On the other hand, it possesses some other desirable qualities for a summation method, including stability and linearity. These latter two axioms actually force the sum to be −1, since they make the following manipulation valid:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
s &amp; = &amp;\displaystyle 1+2+4+8+16+\cdots \\
  &amp; = &amp;\displaystyle 1+2(1+2+4+8+\cdots) \\
  &amp; = &amp;\displaystyle 1+2s
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

In a useful sense, ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ is a root of the equation {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 1 + 2''s''.}} (For example, ∞ is one of the two [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the [[Möbius transformation]] {{nowrap|1=''z'' → 1 + 2''z''}} on the [[Riemann sphere]]). If some summation method is known to return an ordinary number for ''s'', ''i.e.'' not ∞, then it is easily determined. In this case ''s'' may be subtracted from both sides of the equation, yielding {{nowrap|1=0 = 1 + ''s''}}, so {{nowrap|1=''s'' = −1}}.&lt;ref&gt;The two roots of {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 1 + 2''s''}} are briefly touched on by Hardy p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above manipulation might be called on to produce −1 outside the context of a sufficiently powerful summation procedure. For the most well-known and straightforward sum concepts, including the fundamental convergent one, it is absurd that a series of positive terms could have a negative value. A similar phenomenon occurs with the divergent geometric series [[Grandi's series|1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ⋯]], where a series of [[integer]]s appears to have the non-integer sum {{sfrac|1|2}}. These examples illustrate the potential danger in applying similar arguments to the series implied by such [[recurring decimal]]s as 0.111… and most notably [[0.999...|0.999…]]. The arguments are ultimately justified for these convergent series, implying that {{nowrap|1=0.111… = {{sfrac|1|9}}}} and {{nowrap|1=0.999… = 1}}, but the underlying [[mathematical proof|proof]]s demand careful thinking about the interpretation of endless sums.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner pp.&amp;nbsp;93–99; the argument on p.&amp;nbsp;95 for {{nowrap|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ⋯}} is slightly different but has the same spirit.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to view this series as convergent in a number system different from the real numbers, namely, the [[P-adic number|2-adic numbers]]. As a series of 2-adic numbers this series converges to the same sum, −1, as was derived above by analytic continuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Koblitz |first=Neal|title = p-adic Numbers, p-adic Analysis, and Zeta-Functions|series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics, vol. 58|publisher = Springer-Verlag|isbn = 0-387-96017-1|year = 1984|pages = chapter I, exercise 16, p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)''' is a 15-question 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% on the [[American Mathematics Contest|AMC 12]] high school mathematics contest (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% on the [[American Mathematics Contest|AMC 10]].

The AIME is the second of two tests used to determine [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad#Qualification|qualification]] for the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad]] (USAMO), the first being the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitational Competitions|url=http://www.maa.org/math-competitions/invitational-competitions|publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of calculators is not allowed on the test.

==Format and scoring==

The exam consists of 15 questions of increasing difficulty, where each answer is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive. Thus the test effectively removes the element of chance afforded by a multiple-choice test while preserving the ease of automated grading; answers are entered onto an [[Optical mark recognition|OMR]] sheet, similar to the way grid-in math questions are answered on the [[SAT]]. Leading zeros must be gridded in; for example, answers of 7 and 43 must be written and gridded in as 007 and 043, respectively.

Concepts typically covered on the exam include topics in [[elementary algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], as well as [[number theory]], [[probability]], and [[combinatorics]]. Many of these concepts are not directly covered in typical [[high school]] mathematics courses; thus, participants often turn to supplementary resources to prepare for the exam.

One point is earned for each correct answer, and no points are deducted for incorrect answers. No partial credit is given.  Thus AIME scores are integers from 0 to 15 inclusive.

Some recent results are:

&lt;center&gt;

{| class=wikitable

| Year || Students&lt;br&gt;sitting || Mean&lt;br&gt;score
| Median&lt;br&gt;score || Students with&lt;br&gt;perfect scores
|----- align="center"
| 2006 || 22764 || 2.741 || - || 4

|----- align="center"
| 1999 || 11945 || 2.195 || 2 || 4
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

A student's score on the AIME is used in combination with his score on the [[American Mathematics Competitions|AMC]] to determine eligibility for the [[USAMO]]. A student's score on the AMC is added to 10 times his score on the AIME. In 2006, the cutoff for eligibility in the USAMO was 217 combined points.

During the 1990s it was not uncommon for fewer than 2,000 students to qualify for the AIME, although 1994 was a notable exception where 99 students achieved perfect scores on the AHSME and the list of high scorers, which usually was distributed in small pamphlets, had to be distributed several months late in thick newspaper bundles.

==History==

The AIME began in 1983. It was given once per year on a Tuesday or Thursday in late March or early April. Beginning in 2000, the AIME is given twice per year, the second date being an "alternate" test given to accommodate those students who are unable to sit for the first test because of Spring Break, illness, or any other reason. However, under no circumstances may a student officially take both exams. The alternate test, commonly called the "AIME2" or "AIME-II," is usually given exactly two weeks after the first test, on a Tuesday in early April. However, like the AMC, the AIME recently has been given on a Tuesday in early March, and on the Wednesday 15 days later, e.g. March 7 and 22, 2006.

==Sample problems==

*Given that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{((3!)!)!}{3!} = k \cdot n!, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is as large as possible, find &lt;math&gt;k + n.&lt;/math&gt; (''2003 AIME I #1'')
:''Solution: 839''


*If the integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is added to each of the numbers &lt;math&gt;36&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;300&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;596&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the squares of three consecutive terms of an arithmetic series. Find &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.  (''1989 AIME #7'')

In [[graph theory]], an  '''Andrásfai graph''' is a [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] [[circulant graph]] named after {{ill|Béla Andrásfai|hu|Andrásfai Béla}}.

==Properties ==
The Andrásfai graph And({{mvar|n}}) for any natural number &lt;math&gt; n \geq 1 &lt;/math&gt; is a circulant graph on &lt;math&gt;3n-1&lt;/math&gt; vertices, in which vertex &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is connected by an edge to vertices &lt;math&gt;k\pm j&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; that is congruent to 1 mod 3. For instance, the [[Wagner graph]] is an Andrásfai graph, the graph And(3).

The graph family is triangle-free, and And({{mvar|n}}) has an [[independence number]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15119">'''Behavioral operations research''' ('''BOR''') examines and takes into consideration human behavior and emotions when facing complex decision problems. BOR is part of [[Operations research|Operational Research]]. BOR relates to the behavioural aspects of the use of [[operations research]] in problem solving and decision support. Specifically, it focuses on understanding behaviour in, with and beyond models&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952973172|title=Behavioral operational research : theory, methodology and practice|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Kunc, Martin,, Malpass, Jonathan,, White, Leroy,|isbn=9781137535511|location=[London]|oclc=952973172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The general purpose is to make better use and improve the use of operations research theories and practice, so that the benefits received from the potential improvements to operations research approaches in practice, that arise from recent findings in behavioural sciences, are realised .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioural Operational Research (BOR)|url = http://bor.aalto.fi/ejor.html|website = bor.aalto.fi|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; BOR approaches have heavily influenced [[supply chain management]] research&lt;ref&gt;Schorsch, T., Wallenburg, C.M., &amp; Wieland, A. (2017): The human factor in SCM: Introducing a meta-theory of behavioral supply chain management, International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management, 47(4), 238-262, https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJPDLM-10-2015-0268&lt;/ref&gt;, amongst others.

==Overview==
[[Operations research]] (or operational research) involves a wide range of problem–solving skills aiming to help individuals or organizations to make more rational decisions as well as improving their efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Operations Research?|url=https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/What-is-Operations-Research|website=Informs|publisher=Informs.org|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, operations research often assumes that agents involved in the process or operating system, such as employees, consumers and suppliers, make fully rational decisions. Their decisions are not affected by their emotions as well as their surroundings and that they are able to react and distinguish between different types of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Bendoly|first1 = Elliot|title = Behavioral Operations Management|url = https://www.linkedin.com/grps/Behavioral-Operations-Management-3704620|website = Linkedin|publisher = Linkedin.com|accessdate = 25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, this is not always true; human behavior has an important role in decision making and worker motivation, and therefore should be considered in the study of operations. This has led to the rise of behavioral operations research, which is defined as the study of impacts that human behavior has on operations, design and business interactions in different organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Toward a Theory of Behavioral Operations|url = http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/msom.1070.0205|journal = Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management|date = 2008-03-11|issn = 1523-4614|pages = 676–691|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1287/msom.1070.0205|first = Francesca|last = Gino|first2 = Gary|last2 = Pisano}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral operations research aims to understand the decision making of managers and tries to make improvements to the supply chain using the insight obtained. Behavioral operations research includes knowledge from a number of fields, such as economics, behavioral science, psychology and other social sciences. Traditional operations research and behavioral operations research have a common intellectual goal, aiming to make differences in operations outcomes, such as flexibility, efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behavioral Operations - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Behavioral_Operations|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical influence==
Humans have limitations in their ability to collect and react to relevant information. When a decision or conclusion has to be made through complex information, human decision-makers often fail to comply with normative decision theories. Moreover, a person's lifestyle, social interaction and collective behaviors has clear influence on people's decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:CognitivePsychology.svg|thumb|The breakdown of Cognitive Psychology Study which refers to the study of human mental processes and their role in thinking,feeling and behaving.|194x194px]]

===Cognitive psychology===
This is a relatively new branch of psychology which focuses on humans' ability to make decisions, solve problems, learning, attention, memory and forgetting, these are only a few of the practical applications of this science, to some extent it is also related to motivation and emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cognitive Psychology: The Science of How We Think|url = http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/f/cogpsych.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is interested in what is happening within the mind when new information is received, how people respond to this information, and how this response affects their behavior and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cognitive Psychology? - Definition &amp; Theories - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cognitive-psychology-definition-theories-quiz.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychology is considered to be one of the dominant theoretical force in behavioral science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cognitive psychology and instruction|last = Alan|first = Lesgold|publisher = Plenum Press, in coordination with NATO Scientific Affairs Division|year = 1977|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|191x191px|The Asch experiment shows that participants tend to adhere to the group norms.]]
People often react and behave differently when they are put into different social situations. The aim of social psychology is to understand the nature and causes of individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212175704/http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-psychology.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-12 |title=Social Psychology |date=2007 |accessdate=25 October 2015 |website=SimplyPsychology |publisher=SimplyPsychology |last=McLeod |first=Saul |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It questions or provides an insight of how human behavior relies on the physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;Argyle, M., Collett, P. and Furnham, A. (1995). Social psychology at work. London: Routledge, p.271.&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychology theories explain why there are competition between individuals, why it is often the case that individuals or organisations seek to protect and maintain their status, and why it has been observed that individuals and organisations are willing to sacrifice efficiency to achieve their goal of staying at a higher hierarchical position. In addition to status, social psychology also includes people's behavior towards goal setting, feedback and controls, interdependence, and reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Organizational behavior===
The use of psychology in behavioral operations research links to the idea of judging the relationship between people's mental health and wellbeing and their behavior at work. Psychology experts often set up indicators to evaluate how an employee's surroundings, such as working environment and noise, can affect their productivity at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Role of Psychology in Organizational Behavior?|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-role-of-psychology-in-organizational-behavior.htm|website = wiseGEEK|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational behavior is the study of ways people react or behave when they are organized in groups. The purpose of this study is to improve business productivity, trying to create a more efficient business organization. Organizational behavior theories are applied towards human resource trying to maximize the output from individual group members. The study of organization behavior can be broken down into different sections, including Personality, Job Satisfaction and Reward Management, Leadership, Authority, Power and Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organizational Behavior (OB) Definition {{!}} Investopedia|url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organizational-behavior.asp|website = Investopedia|accessdate = 2015-11-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main streams of research==
There are four main streams of research that can be considered a part of behavior operations research. These give us an idea of the weakness of the current operations research model and the effectiveness of behavioral operations research in predicting human decisions and reactions when facing different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-technical view of technology management===
Physical technologies can be defined as a socio-technology system, which consists of humans, human activity, spaces, artifacts, tools, and communications media. This theory suggests that social interaction at the workplace is determined by the technology and techniques used at work. Therefore, a change in technology used at work can lead to unexpected consequences. This may include differences in motivation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human factor engineering===
Human factor engineering can be applied to improve workplaces, working systems and products aiming to reduce human errors during operations as well as improving human efficiency, productivity and operational performance. It often involves improvements of large machineries to reduce accidents during work. It is believed that behavior operations research can be related to human factor engineering as systematic errors, which happens very often technology and different machineries, can affect people's decision making and their interaction with the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ogp.org.uk/pubs/454.pdf|title = Human factors engineering in projects|last = |first = |date = August 2011|journal = International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Producers|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 25 October 2015|volume = 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bulwhip efect.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of Bullwhip effect|300x300px]]

===The bullwhip effect===
The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect|url = http://www.quickmba.com/ops/bullwhip-effect/|website = www.quickmba.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, 'fear' can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bullwhip Effect and Your Supply Chain|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232953|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System dynamics models in operations contexts===
System dynamics models in operations contexts focuses on the importance of how components in a system interact with each other as well as providing an overview of the processes that takes place within the system. Behavioral operations research often benefits from the development of comprehensive systems models as they are able to analyse and provide an insight of the operational system. This allows the study of behavioral operations to understand how people in these settings or work conditions think about the context in which they operate. In an operations system, it often involves levers for managers to manipulate the components involved in the system. The uses of these levers are determined by human behaviors and these behaviors include feelings of stress and fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Handbook of Behavioral Operations Management: Social and Psychological Dynamics in Production and Service Settings|last = Bendoly|first = Elliot|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 25 June 2015|isbn = 0199357226|location = United States|pages = 6–8|last2 = van Wezel|first2 = Wout|last3 = Banchrach|first3 = Daniel G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

===Newsvendor problem===
The [[newsvendor model]] (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) is a mathematical model used in operations management and applied economics to determine optimal level products or services to keep in stock when the demand is unknown. This model is also known as the newsvendor problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must make on time stocking decision of how many copies of newspaper to keep in stock when facing uncertain demand. If the newspaper vendor stocks too much, these newspaper may end up worthless by the end of the day as they are no longer up-to-date. However, if the newspaper vendor stocks too little, he misses the opportunity too make more profit and suffer loss of goodwill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Newsvendor Model|last = Adelman|first = Dan|date = 1999|journal = The Operations Quadrangle: Business Process Fundamentals|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Barnes-Schuster|first2 = Dawn|first3 = Don|last3 = Eisenstein|publisher = The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|pages = |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuristic performance regarding the secretary problem –
Expected success probabilities for three heuristics]]

===Assignment problem===
The assignment problem is a complex optimization problem. The problem involves number of agents and a number of tasks. The purpose is to assign each agent with a task. All agents are expected or aimed to be allocated in a way that will maximize productivity and efficiency and minimize the total cost of the assignment.

===Secretary problem===

The secretary problem can also be called the optimal stopping theory. It focuses heavily on applied probability, statistics and decision theory. The idea behind the secretary problem is that to make the best decisions when there is a pool of different options, other options are unknown, details of other options will only be given if the currently existing option is given up. The problem comes down to the idea of optimal strategy, maximizing the probability of selecting the best option.

In [[computer engineering]] and in [[programming language implementation]]s, a '''belt machine''' is a real or emulated computer that uses a ''first in, first out'' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]) queue rather than individual machine [[processor register]]s to evaluate each sub-expression in the program.  A belt computer is programmed with an [[instruction set]] that specifies arguments explicitly but results implicitly.&lt;ref&gt;http://millcomputing.com/docs/belt/&lt;/ref&gt;

The common alternative to belt machines are [[register machine]]s, in which each instruction explicitly names the specific registers to use for locations of operand arguments and results. Belt machines are related to [[stack machine]]s, which specify both arguments and results implicitly using a pushdown [[Stack (data structure)|stack]]. Other alternatives are [[accumulator machine]]s, which have only one visible general-purpose temp register, and memory-to-memory machines, which have no visible temp registers.

A belt machine implements temporary storage with a fixed-length FIFO queue, or ''belt'' by analogy to a ''[[conveyor belt]]''. The operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]]s (ALUs) and other functional units may be taken from any position on the belt, and the result from the computation is ''dropped'' (stored) in the front position of the belt, advancing the belt to make room. As the belt is fixed length, drops in the front are matched by older operands falling off the back; pushed-off operands become inaccessible and must be explicitly saved if still needed for later work. Most operations of the [[instruction set]] work only with data on the belt, not on data registers or main memory cells.

For a typical instruction like &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, both argument operands come from explicitly named positions on the belt, and the result is dropped on the front, ready for the next instruction. Operations with multiple results simply drop more values at the belt front.  Most belt instructions are encoded as just an ''operation code'' ([[opcode]]) and two belt positions, with no added fields to specify a result register, memory address, or literal constant.  This encoding is easily extended to richer operations with more than two inputs or more than one result.  Constant operands are dropped by separate &lt;code&gt;load immediate&lt;/code&gt; instructions.  All access of program variables in main ''[[random-access memory]]'' (RAM) is segregated into separate &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; instructions containing one memory address, or some way to calculate that address from belt operands.

All belt machines have variants of the [[instruction set|load/store]] opcodes to access [[local variable]]s and the heap.  This can be by offsets, from a pointer on the belt, or from various special-purpose base registers. Similarly, there will be instructions to branch to an address taken from the belt, along with branches relative to the program counter.

== Temporal addressing ==
Because each drop of a result moves the prior belt content along to later positions in the queue, a given operand continually changes its position (and hence address) as a result of later execution. In effect, an access to the operand at position zero is a request for the most recent value dropped to the belt, while (for example) a reference to position five is to the sixth most recent drop. Thus the addresses of belt operands reflect the belt history over time. This is ''temporal addressing''. It is hard for human programmers to keep track of belt contents, and hence operand addresses, when writing assembly code for a belt machine. However, it is easy for a compiler to track the changing contents and emit the correct position addresses in generated code.

== Spill and fill ==
The belt is fixed length and may be too short to hold all live transient operands before they are pushed off the end. If an operand is needed for longer than its belt lifetime, it must be saved while still on the belt (spill) and later restored to the belt when needed again (fill). This situation is equivalent to the need to spill registers to memory when a program runs out of registers in a general-register machine. Spilled operands may be written to memory using normal store instructions, and restored using normal load instructions, or spill and fill may use special-purpose storage and associated operations that are faster or offer other advantages over load and store.

== Freedom from hazard ==
The operands on the belt are read-only. New results do not overwrite prior values. The belt is thus a [[Assignment (computer science)#Single assignment|single-assignment]] structure, and is immune to the [[Hazard (computer architecture)#Data hazards|data hazards]] that must be dealt with by modern out-of-order general-register machines.

== Compact object code ==
[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very costly and limited, even on [[mainframe computer]]s. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of [[minicomputer]]s, and then [[microprocessor]]s. Density remains important today, for applications for [[smartphone]], or downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ''[[read-only memory]]'' (ROM) for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.

Belt machines have smaller instructions than register-based machines, due to not needing a destination address for results. This saving can make a significant difference for fixed-length instruction formats, which normally use power-of-two instruction widths. If there are thirty-two addressable elements (registers on a general-register machine, belt positions on a belt machine), then each element address occupies five bits in the instruction, needing 15 bits for the three-address format of a general-register machine, but only 10 bits using the two-address format of a belt machine. Because bits are also needed for opcode and other information in the instruction, the (power-of-two constrained) instruction width often determines the maximum number of addressable elements possible in a design. Typically a belt machine instruction can support the encoding of double the number of addressable elements compared to a general-register machine of the same instruction width. There are similar gains in variable-length instruction encodings.

Overall, belt machine code is less compact than for stack machines, which use no operand addresses, but often must introduce stack-manipulation instructions unneeded on a belt machine. The instructions for accumulator machines are not padded out with multiple register fields, instead, they use the return stack and need no extra memory reference instructions.

== Implementation ==
While a belt machine presents an operand queue as the program model, there is not necessarily a physical queue ([[shift register]]) in the implemented hardware. Instead, a belt design may use an implementation analogous to the [[register renaming]] common in modern general-register machines. Live data values are kept in conveniently addressable physical resources (individual registers, register files, [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), or [[operand forwarding]] from functional units) and generally not moved for the duration of their belt lifetime. [[Instruction decoder]] maps logical belt positions to physical locations. The mapping is updated to reflect the changes of logical position arising from newly dropped results.

The belt-machine architecture was created by startup Mill Computing, Inc., for use in their [[Mill architecture]] family of general-purpose CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benchoff|first1=Brian|title=The Mill CPU Architecture|url=http://hackaday.com/2013/08/02/the-mill-cpu-architecture/|website=Hackaday|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Families with these properties have efficient [[algorithm]]s for problems including the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]] and [[model checking]] for the first order theory of graphs.

==Definition and equivalent characterizations==
A ''t''-shallow minor of a graph ''G'' is defined to be a graph formed from ''G'' by contracting a collection of vertex-disjoint subgraphs of radius ''t'', and deleting the remaining vertices of ''G''. A family of graphs has bounded expansion if there exists a function ''f'' such that, in every ''t''-shallow minor of a graph in the family, the ratio of edges to vertices is at most ''f''(''t'').&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{citation

Equivalent definitions of classes of bounded expansions are that all shallow minors have [[chromatic number]] bounded by a function of ''t'',&lt;ref name="no"/&gt; or that the given family has a bounded value of a ''topological parameter''. Such a parameter is a [[graph invariant]] that is monotone under taking subgraphs, such that the parameter value can change only in a controlled way when a graph is subdivided, and such that a bounded parameter value implies that a graph has bounded [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]].&lt;ref name="now"&gt;{{citation

==Polynomial expansion and separator theorems==
A stronger notion is '''polynomial expansion''', meaning that the function ''f'' used to bound the edge density of shallow minors is a [[polynomial]]. If a hereditary graph family obeys a [[Planar separator theorem|separator theorem]], stating that any ''n''-vertex graph in the family can be split into pieces with at most ''n''/2 vertices by the removal of ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;) vertices for some constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, then that family necessarily has polynomial expansion. Conversely, graphs with polynomial expansion have sublinear separator theorems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Classes of graphs with bounded expansion==
Because of the connection between separators and expansion, every [[Robertson–Seymour theorem|minor-closed graph family]], including the family of [[planar graph]]s, has polynomial expansion. The same is true for [[1-planar graph]]s, and more generally the graphs that can be embedded onto surfaces of bounded [[genus]] with a bounded number of crossings per edge, as well as the [[biclique-free graph|biclique-free]] [[string graph]]s, since these all obey similar separator theorems to the planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, 14.2 Crossing Number, pp.&amp;nbsp;319–321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Instances of the [[subgraph isomorphism problem]] in which the goal is to find a target graph of bounded size, as a subgraph of a larger graph whose size is not bounded, may be solved in [[linear time]] when the larger graph belongs to a family of graphs of bounded expansion. The same is true for [[clique problem|finding cliques]] of a fixed size, finding [[dominating set]]s of a fixed size, or more generally testing properties that can be expressed by a formula of bounded size in the first-order [[logic of graphs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}, 18.3 The Subgraph Isomorphism Problem and Boolean Queries, pp.&amp;nbsp;400–401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Cryptography in simple terms means the use of any alphabet or numerical statement  which has a meaning or stores a message.[[File:Ztel2.jpg|thumb|right|A portion of the "[[Zimmermann Telegram]]" as decrypted by [[British Naval Intelligence]] codebreakers. The word ''Arizona'' was not in the German codebook and had therefore to be split into phonetic syllables.]]

In [[cryptology]], '''a code''' is a method used to encrypt a [[message]] that operates at the level of meaning; that is, words or phrases are converted into something else. A code might transform "change" into "CVGDK" or "cocktail lounge". A ''[[codebook]]'' is needed to encrypt, and decrypt the phrases or words.

By contrast, [[ciphers]] encrypt messages at the level of individual letters, or small groups of letters, or even, in modern ciphers, individual [[bit]]s. Messages can be transformed first by a code, and then by a cipher. Such [[multiple encryption]], or "superencryption" aims to make [[cryptanalysis]] more difficult.

Another comparison between codes and ciphers is that a code typically represents a letter or groups of letters directly without the use of mathematics. As such the numbers are configured to represent these three values: 1001 = A, 1002 = B, 1003 = C, ... . The resulting message, then would be 1001 1002 1003 to communicate ABC. Ciphers, however, utilize a mathematical formula to represent letters or groups of letters.  For example, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, ... . Thus the message ABC results by multiplying each letter's value by 13. The message ABC, then would be 13 26 39.

Codes have a variety of drawbacks, including susceptibility to [[cryptanalysis]] and the difficulty of managing the cumbersome [[codebook]]s, so ciphers are now the dominant technique in modern cryptography.

In contrast, because codes are representational, they are not susceptible to mathematical analysis of the individual codebook elements. In our the example, the message 13 26 39 can be cracked by dividing each number by 13 and then ranking them alphabetically. However, the focus of codebook cryptanalysis is the comparative frequency of the individual code elements matching the same frequency of letters within the plaintext messages using [[frequency analysis]]. In the above example, the code group, 1001, 1002, 1003, might occur more than once and that frequency might match the number of times that ABC occurs in plain text messages.

(In the past, or in non-technical contexts, ''code'' and ''cipher'' are often used to refer to any form of [[encryption]]).

==One- and two-part codes==
Codes are defined by "codebooks" (physical or notional), which are dictionaries of codegroups listed with their corresponding plaintext. Codes originally had the codegroups assigned in 'plaintext order' for convenience of the code designed, or the encoder. For example, in a code using numeric code groups, a plaintext word starting with "a" would have a low-value group, while one starting with "z" would have a high-value group. The same codebook could be used to "encode" a plaintext message into a coded message or "codetext", and "decode" a codetext back into plaintext message.

In order to make life more difficult for codebreakers, codemakers  designed codes with no predictable relationship between the codegroups and the ordering of the matching plaintext. In practice, this meant that two codebooks were now required, one to  find codegroups for encoding, the other to look up codegroups to find plaintext for decoding. Such "two-part" codes required more effort to develop, and twice as much effort to distribute (and discard safely when replaced), but they were harder to break. The [[Zimmermann Telegram]] in January 1917 used the German diplomatic "0075" two-part code system which contained upwards of 10,000 phrases and individual words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611190600921165 "Zimmermann Telegram: The Original Draft"], 2007, Joachim von zur Gathen, "Cryptologia", Volume 31, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-time code==
A one-time code is a prearranged word, phrase or symbol that is intended to be used only once to convey a simple message, often the signal to execute or abort some plan or confirm that it has succeeded or failed.  One-time codes are often designed to be included in what would appear to be an innocent conversation. Done properly they are almost impossible to detect, though a trained analyst monitoring the communications of someone who has already aroused suspicion might be able to recognize a comment like "Aunt Bertha has gone into labor" as having an ominous meaning. Famous example of one time codes include:

*"One if by land; two if by sea" in "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]" made famous in the poem by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]
*"Climb Mount Niitaka" - the signal to Japanese planes to begin the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]
*During [[World War II]] the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]'s overseas service frequently included "[[Radio Londres#Coded messages|personal messages]]" as part of its regular broadcast schedule. The seemingly nonsensical stream of messages read out by announcers were actually one time codes intended for [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) agents operating behind enemy lines. An example might be "The princess wears red shoes" or "Mimi's cat is asleep under the table". Each code message was read out twice. By such means, the [[French Resistance]] were instructed to start sabotaging rail and other transport links the night before [[D-day]].
*"Over all of Spain, the sky is clear" was a signal (broadcast on radio) to start [[Spanish Civil War#Outbreak of the war|the nationalist military revolt in Spain]] on July 17, 1936.

Sometimes messages are not prearranged and rely on shared knowledge hopefully known only to the recipients. An example is the telegram sent to U.S. President [[Harry Truman]], then at the [[Potsdam Conference]] to meet with Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]], informing Truman of the [[Trinity test|first successful test]] of an [[atomic bomb]]. 
:"Operated on this morning. Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations. Local press release necessary as interest extends great distance. [[Leslie Groves|Dr. Groves]] pleased. He returns tomorrow. I will keep you posted."

==Idiot code==

An ''idiot code'' is a code that is created by the parties using it. This type of communication is akin to the hand signals used by armies in the field.

Example: Any sentence where 'day' and 'night' are used means 'attack'. The location mentioned in the following sentence specifies the location to be attacked.
*''Plaintext:'' Attack X.
*''Codetext:'' We walked day and night through the streets but couldn't find it! Tomorrow we'll head into X.

An early use of the term appears to be by George Perrault, a character in the science fiction book ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]''&lt;ref name="FridayP163"&gt;''Friday'' (1982) by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Robert A. Heinlein]]:

:The simplest sort [of code] and thereby impossible to break. The first ad told the person or persons concerned to carry out number seven or expect number seven or it said something about something designated as seven. This one says the same with respect to code item number ten. But the meaning of the numbers cannot be deduced through statistical analysis because the code can be changed long before a useful statistical universe can be reached. It's an idiot code... and an idiot code can never be broken if the user has the good sense not to go too often to the well.

Terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp said that the men who carried out the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] on the United States used basic e-mail and what he calls "idiot code" to discuss their plans.&lt;ref name="JihadOnline"&gt;Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty: [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/06/a3d6bec4-ace3-4592-a271-f3f9b9c912cd.html "Middle East: Islamic Militants Take Jihad To The Internet" By Jeffrey Donovan], 16 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Cryptanalysis of codes==
While solving a [[monoalphabetic substitution cipher]] is easy, solving even a simple code is difficult. Decrypting a coded message is a little like trying to translate a document written in a foreign language, with the task basically amounting to building up a "dictionary" of the codegroups and the plaintext words they represent.

One fingerhold on a simple code is the fact that some words are more common than others, such as "the" or "a" in English. In telegraphic messages, the codegroup for "STOP" (i.e., end of sentence or paragraph) is usually very common. This helps define the structure of the message in terms of sentences, if not their meaning, and this is cryptanalytically useful.

Further progress can be made against a code by collecting many codetexts encrypted with the same code and then using information from other sources 
*spies
*newspapers
*diplomatic cocktail party chat
*the location from where a message was sent
*where it was being sent to (i.e., [[traffic analysis]])
*the time the message was sent, 
*events occurring before and after the message was sent
*the normal habits of the people sending the coded messages
*etc.

For example, a particular codegroup found almost exclusively in messages from a particular army and nowhere else might very well indicate the commander of that army. A codegroup that appears in messages preceding an attack on a particular location may very well stand for that location.

[[crib (cryptanalysis)|Crib]]s can be an immediate giveaway to the definitions of codegroups. As codegroups are determined, they can gradually build up a critical mass, with more and more codegroups revealed from context and educated guesswork. One-part codes are more vulnerable to such educated guesswork than two-part codes, since if the codenumber "26839" of a one-part code is determined to stand for "bulldozer", then the lower codenumber "17598" will likely stand for a plaintext word that starts with "a" or "b". At least, for simple one part codes.

Various tricks can be used to "[[gardening (cryptography)|plant]]" or "sow" information into a coded message, for example by executing a raid at a particular time and location against an enemy, and then examining code messages sent after the raid. Coding errors are a particularly useful fingerhold into a code; people reliably make errors, sometimes disastrous ones. Planting data and exploiting errors works against ciphers as well.

* The most obvious and, in principle at least, simplest way of cracking a code is to steal the codebook through bribery, burglary, or raiding parties &amp;mdash; procedures sometimes glorified by the phrase "practical cryptography" &amp;mdash; and this is a weakness for both codes and ciphers, though codebooks are generally larger and used longer than cipher [[key (cryptography)|key]]s. While a good code may be harder to break than a cipher, the need to write and distribute codebooks is seriously troublesome.

Constructing a new code is like building a new language and writing a dictionary for it; it was an especially big job before computers. If a code is compromised, the entire task must be done all over again, and that means a lot of work for both cryptographers and the code users. In practice, when codes were in widespread use, they were usually changed on a periodic basis to frustrate codebreakers, and to limit the useful life of stolen or copied codebooks.

Once codes have been created, codebook distribution is logistically clumsy, and increases chances the code will be compromised. There is a saying that "Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead," ([[q:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin - Wikiquote]]) and though it may be something of an exaggeration, a secret becomes harder to keep if it is shared among several people. Codes can be thought reasonably secure if they are only used by a few careful people, but if whole armies use the same codebook, security becomes much more difficult.

In contrast, the security of ciphers is generally dependent on protecting the cipher keys. Cipher keys can be stolen and people can betray them, but they are much easier to change and distribute.

== Superencipherment ==
It was common to encipher a message after first encoding it, to increase the difficulty of  cryptanalysis. With a numerical code, this was commonly done with an "additive" - simply a long key number which was digit-by-digit added to the code groups, modulo 10. Unlike the codebooks, additives would be changed frequently. The famous Japanese Navy code, [[JN-25]], was of this design.

'''Color vision''' is the ability of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequency|frequencies]]) of the [[light]] they [[reflected light|reflect]], [[Light emission|emit]], or [[Transmittance|transmit]]. [[Color]]s can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the [[brain]] responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of [[cone cell]]s in the [[eye]]. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.

==Wavelength and hue detection==
[[Isaac Newton]] discovered that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]], after being split into its component colours when passed through a [[dispersive prism]], could be recombined to make white light by passing them through a different prism. 

The characteristic colours are, from long to short wavelengths (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause a difference in the perceived [[hue]]; the [[just-noticeable difference]] in wavelength varies from about 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] in the [[blue-green]] and [[yellow]] wavelengths, to 10&amp;nbsp;nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure [[spectral color]]s are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] can be quite high.{{Ambiguous|date=October 2013}}

In very low light levels, vision is [[scotopic]]: light is detected by [[rod cell]]s of the [[retina]]. Rods are maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and play little, if any, role in colour vision. In brighter light, such as daylight, vision is [[photopic]]: light is detected by [[cone cell]]s which are responsible for colour vision. Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, but are most sensitive to wavelengths near 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Between these regions, [[mesopic vision]] comes into play and both rods and cones provide signals to the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s. The shift in colour perception from dim light to daylight gives rise  to differences known as the [[Purkinje effect]]

The perception of "white" is formed by the entire spectrum of visible light, or by mixing colours of just a few wavelengths in animals with few types of colour receptors. In humans, white light can be perceived by combining wavelengths such as red, green, and blue, or just a pair of [[complementary colour]]s such as blue and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;"Eye, human." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology of color perception==

[[File:Modern Color Vision Model.svg|thumb|The modern model of human color perception as it occurs in the retina, pertaining to both the [[trichromatic]] and [[opponent process]] theories introduced in the 19th century.]]

[[File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg|thumb|Normalized response spectra of human cones, to monochromatic spectral stimuli, with wavelength given in nanometers.]]

[[File:Spectrum locus 12.png|thumb|The same figures as above represented here as a single curve in three (normalized cone response) dimensions]]

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|[[Photopic]] relative brightness sensitivity of the human visual system as a function of wavelength ([[luminosity function]])]]

Perception of color begins with specialized retinal cells containing pigments with different [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]], known as [[cone cell]]s. In humans, there are three types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]].

Each individual cone contains pigments composed of [[opsin]] apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular Genetics of Human Color Vision: The Genes Encoding Blue, Green, and Red Pigments |first1=Jeremy |last1=Nathans |first2=Darcy |last2=Thomas |first3=David S. |last3=Hogness |journal=Science|date= April 11, 1986 |jstor=169687 |bibcode=1986Sci...232..193N |volume=232 |pages=193–202 |doi=10.1126/science.2937147 |pmid=2937147 |issue=4747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cones are conventionally labeled according to the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]]: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as we know them. Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina and it will be finalized in the [[visual cortex]] and associative areas of the brain.

For example, while the L cones have been referred to simply as [[red]] receptors, [[microspectrophotometry]] has shown that their peak sensitivity is in the greenish-yellow region of the spectrum. Similarly, the S- and M-cones do not directly correspond to [[blue]] and [[green]], although they are often described as such. The [[RGB color model]], therefore, is a convenient means for representing color, but is not directly based on the types of cones in the human eye.

The peak response of human cone cells varies, even among individuals with so-called normal color vision;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Neitz J, Jacobs GH |title=Polymorphism of the long-wavelength cone in normal human color vision |journal=Nature |volume=323 |issue=6089 |pages=623–5 |year=1986 |pmid=3773989 |doi=10.1038/323623a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |bibcode=1986Natur.323..623N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305161805/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
Two complementary theories of color vision are the [[trichromatic theory]] and the [[opponent process]] theory. The trichromatic theory, or [[Young–Helmholtz theory]], proposed in the 19th century by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. [[Ewald Hering]] proposed the opponent process theory in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Zur Lehre vom Lichtsinne |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch–Naturwissenschaftliche Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=III Abtheilung |volume=LXVI.

Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the adjacent diagram.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985p168&gt;Ali, M.A. &amp; Klyne, M.A. (1985), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Green&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Magenta and Blue&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In the same way that there cannot exist a "slightly negative" positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green.

A range of wavelengths of light stimulates each of these receptor types to varying degrees. Yellowish-green light, for example, stimulates both L and M cones equally strongly, but only stimulates S-cones weakly.  Red light, on the other hand, stimulates L cones much more than M cones, and S cones hardly at all; blue-green light stimulates M cones more than L cones, and S cones a bit more strongly, and is also the peak stimulant for rod cells; and [[blue]] light stimulates S cones more strongly than red or green light, but L and M cones more weakly. The brain combines the information from each type of receptor to give rise to different perceptions of different wavelengths of light.

The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X [[chromosome]]; defective encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of [[color blindness]]. The [[OPN1LW]] gene, which codes for the opsin present in the L cones, is highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants in a sample of 236 men).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Verrelli BC, Tishkoff SA |title=Signatures of Selection and Gene Conversion Associated with Human Color Vision Variation |journal=Am.

=== Color in the human brain ===
[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|left|Visual pathways in the human brain.  The [[ventral stream]] (purple) is important in color recognition.  The [[dorsal stream]] (green) is also shown.  They originate from a common source in the [[visual cortex]].]]

Color processing begins at a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz's trichromatic theory, and Hering's opponent process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises at the level of the receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of [[retinal ganglion cells]] and beyond.  In Hering's theory opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light–dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency, but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.

Visual information is then sent to the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the [[optic nerve]] to the [[optic chiasma]]: a point where the two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses to the other side of the brain. After the optic chiasma the visual tracts are referred to as the [[optic tract]]s, which enter the [[thalamus]] to synapse at the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).

The lateral geniculate nucleus is divided into laminae (zones), of which there are three types: the M-laminae, consisting primarily of M-cells, the P-laminae, consisting primarily of P-cells, and the koniocellular laminae.  M- and P-cells receive relatively balanced input from both L- and M-cones throughout most of the retina, although this seems to not be the case at the fovea, with midget cells synapsing in the P-laminae.  The koniocellular laminae receive axons from the small bistratified ganglion cells.&lt;ref name = "The First Steps in Seeing"&gt;R.W. Rodieck, "The First Steps in Seeing".

After [[Synapse|synapsing]] at the LGN, the visual tract continues on back to the primary [[visual cortex]] (V1) located at the back of the brain within the [[occipital lobe]]. Within V1 there is a distinct band (striation). This is also referred to as "striate cortex", with other cortical visual regions referred to collectively as "extrastriate cortex". It is at this stage that color processing becomes much more complicated.

In V1 the simple three-color segregation begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to some parts of the spectrum better than others, but this "color tuning" is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized "color cells" often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such "double-opponent" cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.158.3803.942 | title = Goldfish Retina: Organization for Simultaneous Color Contrast | author = Nigel W.

From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the "thin stripes" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only  V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO.&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway BR, Moeller S, Tsao DY | year = 2007 | title = Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 560–73 | pmid = 17988638 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway BR, Tsao DY | year = 2009 | title = Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 106 | issue = 42| pages = 18035–18039 | pmid = 19805195 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810943106 | pmc = 2764907 |bibcode = 2009PNAS..10618034C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Area V4 was initially suggested by [[Semir Zeki]] to be exclusively dedicated to color, but this is now thought to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=John Allman |author2=Steven W.

Anatomical studies have shown that neurons in extended V4 provide input to the inferior [[temporal lobe]] . "IT" cortex is thought to integrate color information with shape and form, although it has been difficult to define the appropriate criteria for this claim. Despite this murkiness, it has been useful to characterize this pathway (V1 &gt; V2 &gt; V4 &gt; IT) as the [[ventral stream]] or the "what pathway", distinguished from the [[dorsal stream]] ("where pathway") that is thought to analyze motion, among many other features.

=== Subjectivity of color perception ===
{{see also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Nothing categorically distinguishes the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from invisible portions of the broader spectrum.  In this sense, color is not a property of electromagnetic radiation, but a feature of visual perception by an observer.  Furthermore, there is an arbitrary mapping between wavelengths of light in the visual spectrum and human experiences of color.  Although most people are assumed to have the same mapping, the philosopher [[John Locke]] recognized that alternatives are possible, and described one such hypothetical case with the "[[inverted spectrum]]" thought experiment.  For example, someone with an inverted spectrum might experience green while seeing 'red' (700&amp;nbsp;nm) light, and experience red while seeing 'green' (530&amp;nbsp;nm) light.  [[Synesthesia]] (or [[ideasthesia]]) provides some atypical but illuminating examples of subjective color experience triggered by input that is not even light, such as sounds or shapes.  The possibility of a clean dissociation between color experience from properties of the world reveals that color is a subjective psychological phenomenon.

The [[Himba people]] have been found to categorize colors differently from most Euro-Americans and are able to easily distinguish close shades of green, barely discernible for most people.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, Davidoff, Davies &amp; Shapiro. referred by Debi Roberson, University of Essex 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Himba have created a very different color scheme which divides the spectrum to dark shades (''zuzu'' in Himba), very light (''vapa''),  vivid blue and green (''buru'') and dry colors as an adaptation to their specific way of life.

Perception of color depends heavily on the context in which the perceived object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as [[color constancy]].

=== In other animal species ===

Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet "colors" and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

The basis for this variation is the number of cone types that differ between species. Mammals in general have color vision of a limited type, and usually have [[red-green color blindness]], with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.

In most [[Catarrhini]] (Old World monkeys and apes—primates closely related to humans) there are three types of [[color receptors]] (known as [[cone cell]]s), resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]]. These primates, like humans, are known as [[Trichromacy|trichromats]]. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are [[dichromat]]s, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may have little or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ali|first=Mohamed Ather|last2=Klyne|first2=M.A.|title=Vision in Vertebrates|place=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1985|pages=174–175|isbn=0-306-42065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

Many [[invertebrate]]s have color vision. [[Honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet.

Reptiles and amphibians also have four cone types (occasionally five), and probably see at least the same number of colors that humans do, or perhaps more.

In the evolution of mammals, segments of color vision were lost, then for a few species of primates, regained by [[gene duplication]]. [[Eutherian]] mammals other than primates (for example, dogs, mammalian farm animals) generally have less-effective two-receptor ([[dichromat]]ic) color perception systems, which distinguish blue, green, and yellow—but cannot distinguish oranges and reds. There is some evidence that a few mammals, such as cats, have redeveloped the ability to distinguish longer wavelength colors, in at least a limited way, via one-amino-acid mutations in opsin genes.&lt;ref&gt;Shozo Yokoyamaa and F. Bernhard Radlwimmera, "The Molecular Genetics of Red and Green Color Vision in Mammals", Genetics, Vol. 153, 919–932, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptation to see reds is particularly important for primate mammals, since it leads to identification of fruits, and also newly sprouting reddish leaves, which are particularly nutritious.

However, even among primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, including monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. [[New World monkeys]] may or may not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs G.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Evolution of color vision}}
Color perception mechanisms are highly dependent on evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent is thought to be satisfactory recognition of food sources. In [[herbivorous]] primates, color perception is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In [[hummingbird]]s, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, [[nocturnal]] mammals have less-developed color vision, since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that [[ultraviolet]] light plays a part in color perception in many branches of the [[animal|animal kingdom]], especially [[insect]]s.  In general, the optical spectrum encompasses the most common [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transitions]] in matter and is therefore the most useful for collecting information about the environment.

The [[Evolution of color vision in primates|evolution of trichromatic color vision in primates]] occurred as the ancestors of modern monkeys, apes, and humans switched to [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] (daytime) activity and began consuming fruits and leaves from flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] |title=[[How the Mind Works]] |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=191 |isbn=0-393-04535-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color vision, with UV discrimination, is also present in a number of arthropods—the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to possess this trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=M. |last2=Nagata |first2=T. |last3=Katoh |first3=K. |last4=Yamashita |first4=S. |last5=Tokunaga |first5=F. |year=2008 |title=Molecular Evolution of Arthropod Color Vision Deduced from Multiple Opsin Genes of Jumping Spiders  |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9065-9 |pmid=18217181|bibcode=2008JMolE..66..130K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics of color perception ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016 }}
A "physical color" is a combination of pure [[spectral color]]s (in the visible range).  Since there are, in principle, infinitely many distinct spectral colors, the set of all physical colors may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional [[vector space]], in fact a [[Hilbert space]].  We call this space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;. More technically, the space of physical colors may be considered to be the (mathematical) [[cone (topology)|cone]] over the [[simplex]] whose vertices are the spectral colors, with white at the [[centroid]] of the simplex, black at the apex of the cone, and the monochromatic color associated with any given vertex somewhere along the line from that vertex to the apex depending on its brightness.

An element ''C'' of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; is a function from the range of visible wavelengths—considered as an interval of real numbers [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;]—to the real numbers, assigning to each wavelength ''w'' in [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] its intensity ''C''(''w'').

A humanly perceived color may be modeled as three numbers: the extents to which each of the 3 types of cones is stimulated. Thus a humanly perceived color may be thought of as a point in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. We call this space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since each wavelength ''w'' stimulates each of the 3 types of cone cells to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions ''s''(''w''), ''m''(''w''), ''l''(''w'') corresponding to the response of the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' cone cells, respectively.

Finally, since a beam of light can be composed of many different wavelengths, to determine the extent to which a physical color ''C'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to ''w''), over the interval [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;], of ''C''(''w'')·''s''(''w''), of ''C''(''w'')·''m''(''w''), and of ''C''(''w'')·''l''(''w''). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color ''C'' (which is an element in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the "physical" space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; can all result in the same single perceived color in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.

Thus human color perception is determined by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Technically, the image of the (mathematical) cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, by this linear mapping, is also a (mathematical) cone in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.  Moving directly away from the vertex of this cone represents maintaining the same [[chromaticity]] while increasing its intensity. Taking a cross-section of this cone yields a 2D chromaticity space.  Both the 3D cone and its projection or cross-section are convex sets; that is, any mixture of spectral colors is also a color.

[[File:Cie Chart with sRGB gamut by spigget.png|thumb|The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram with a triangle showing the [[gamut]] of the [[sRGB]] color space. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in [[kelvin]]s. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers (blue). Note that the colors in this file are being specified using '''sRGB'''. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered because they are out of the gamut of sRGB, therefore they have been interpreted. Note that the colors depicted depend on the color space of the device you use to view the image (number of colors on your monitor, etc.), and may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position.]]

In practice, it would be quite difficult to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them ''S'', ''M'', and ''L''. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' would have to be added with some intensity to the ''physical test color'', and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.

By considering all the resulting combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a subset of 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' had to be added to the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of "chromaticities" (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross section, corresponding to constant ''X''+''Y''+''Z'' of the [[CIE 1931 color space]], gives the CIE chromaticity diagram.

This system implies that for any hue or non-spectral color not on the boundary of the chromaticity diagram, there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general there is no such thing as ''the'' combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the "line of purples" can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.

The CIE chromaticity diagram is horseshoe-shaped, with its curved edge corresponding to all spectral colors (the ''spectral [[locus (mathematics)|locus]]''), and the remaining straight edge corresponding to the most saturated [[purple]]s, mixtures of [[red]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]].

== Chromatic adaptation ==
{{Main|Chromatic adaptation}}

In color science, '''chromatic adaptation''' is the estimation of the representation of an object under a different light source from the one in which it was recorded. A common application is to find a ''chromatic adaptation transform'' (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral ([[color balance]]), while keeping other colors also looking realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Süsstrunk, Sabine. [http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818184220/http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between [[ICC profile]]s with different [[white point]]s. [[Adobe Photoshop]], for example, uses the Bradford CAT.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbloom, Bruce. [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223613/http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In color vision, chromatic adaptation refers to [[color constancy]]; the ability of the visual system to preserve the appearance of an object under a wide range of light sources.&lt;ref name=CAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|first=Mark D.|last=Fairchild|chapter=8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5888">In [[mathematical finance]], '''convexity''' refers to non-linearities in a [[financial model]]. In other words, if the price of an underlying variable changes, the price of an output does not change linearly, but depends on the [[second derivative]] (or, loosely speaking, [[higher-order terms]]) of the modeling function. Geometrically, the model is no longer flat but curved, and the degree of curvature is called the convexity.

== Terminology ==
Strictly speaking, convexity refers to the second derivative of output price with respect to an input price. In [[derivative pricing]], this is referred to as [[Gamma (finance)|Gamma]] (Γ), one of the [[Greeks (finance)|Greeks]]. In practice the most significant of these is [[bond convexity]], the second derivative of bond price with respect to interest rates.

As the second derivative is the first non-linear term, and thus often the most significant, "convexity" is also used loosely to refer to non-linearities generally, including higher-order terms. Refining a model to account for non-linearities is referred to as a '''convexity correction'''.

== Mathematics ==
Formally, the convexity adjustment arises from the [[Jensen inequality]] in probability theory: the expected value of a convex function is greater than or equal to the function of the expected value:
:&lt;math&gt;E[f(X)] \geq f(E[X]).&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, if the model price curves up on both sides of the present value (the payoff function is convex up, and is ''above'' a tangent line at that point), then if the price of the underlying changes, the price of the output is ''greater'' than is modeled using only the first derivative. Conversely, if the model price curves down (the convexity is ''negative,'' the payoff function is ''below'' the tangent line), the price of the output is ''lower'' than is modeled using only the first derivative.{{Clarify|date=June 2018}}

The precise convexity adjustment depends on the model of future price movements of the underlying (the probability distribution) and on the model of the price, though it is linear in the convexity (second derivative of the price function).

== Interpretation ==
The convexity can be used to interpret derivative pricing: mathematically, convexity is optionality – the price of an option (the value of optionality) corresponds to the convexity of the underlying payout.

In [[Black–Scholes]] pricing of options, omitting interest rates and the first derivative, the Black–Scholes equation reduces to &lt;math&gt;\Theta = -\Gamma,&lt;/math&gt; "(infinitesimally) the time value is the convexity". That is, the value of an option is due to the convexity of the ultimate payout: one has the ''option'' to buy an asset or not (in a call; for a put it is an option to sell), and the ultimate payout function (a [[hockey stick]] shape) is convex – "optionality" corresponds to convexity in the payout. Thus, if one purchases a call option, the expected value of the option is ''higher'' than simply taking the expected future value of the underlying and inputting it into the option payout function: the expected value of a convex function is higher than the function of the expected value (Jensen inequality). The price of the option – the value of the optionality – thus reflects the convexity of the payoff function{{Clarify|date=June 2018}}.

This value is isolated via a [[straddle]] – purchasing an at-the-money straddle (whose value increases if the price of the underlying increases or decreases) has (initially) no delta: one is simply purchasing convexity (optionality), without taking a position on the underlying asset – one benefits from the ''degree'' of movement, not the ''direction''.

From the point of view of risk management, being long convexity (having positive Gamma and hence (ignoring interest rates and Delta) negative Theta) means that one benefits from volatility (positive Gamma), but loses money over time (negative Theta) – one net profits if prices move ''more'' than expected, and net lose if prices move ''less'' than expected.

== Convexity adjustments ==
From a modeling perspective, convexity adjustments arise every time the underlying financial variables modeled are not martingale under the pricing measure. Applying [[Girsanov theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1805984 D. Papaioannou (2011): "Applied Multidimensional Girsanov Theorem", SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; allows expressing the dynamics of the modeled financial variables under the pricing measure and therefore estimating this convexity adjustment. Typical examples of convexity adjustments include:
* Quanto options: the underlying is denominated in a currency different from the payment currency. If the discounted underlying is martingale under its domestic risk neutral measure, it is not any more under the payment currency risk neutral measure  
* [[Constant Maturity Swap]] (CMS) instruments (swaps, caps/floors)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/050118_hagan.pdf P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6281">In [[geometry]], a set of points in space are '''coplanar''' if there exists a geometric [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] that contains them all. For example, three points are always coplanar, and if the points are distinct and [[non-collinear points|non-collinear]], the plane they determine is unique. However, a set of four or more distinct points will, in general, not lie in a single plane.

Two [[Line (geometry)|lines]] in three-dimensional space are coplanar if there is a plane that includes them both. This occurs if the lines are [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]], or if they [[Line-line intersection|intersect]] each other. Two lines that are not coplanar are called [[skew lines]].

[[Distance geometry]] provides a solution technique for the problem of determining whether a set of points is coplanar, knowing only the distances between them.

==Properties in three dimensions==
In three-dimensional space, two [[linearly independent]] vectors with the same initial point determine a plane through that point. Their [[cross product]] is a [[normal (geometry)|normal]] vector to that plane, and any vector [[orthogonal]] to this cross product through the initial point will lie in the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Earl W.|last=Swokowski|title=Calculus with Analytic Geometry|edition=Alternate|year=1983|publisher=Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt|isbn=0-87150-341-7|page=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the following coplanarity test using a [[scalar triple product]]. Four distinct points, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} are coplanar if and only if,
:&lt;math&gt;[(x_2 - x_1) \times (x_4 - x_1)] \cdot (x_3 - x_1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;(x_3 - x_1) \cdot [(x_2 - x_1) \times (x_4 - x_1)] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
If three vectors {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} and {{math|'''c'''}} are coplanar, then if {{math|1='''a'''⋅'''b''' = 0}} (i.e., {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are orthogonal) then
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat a})\mathbf{\hat a} + (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{\hat b})\mathbf{\hat b}  = \mathbf{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat a}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[unit vector]] in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}}. That is, the [[vector projection]]s of {{math|'''c'''}} on {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''c'''}} on {{math|'''b'''}} add to give the original {{math|'''c'''}}.
&lt;!--
===Plane formula===
Another technique involves computing the formula for the planes defined by each subset of three non-[[collinear]] points. First, the [[normal vector]] for each plane is computed using some [[orthogonalization]] technique. If the planes are parallel, then the dot-product of their unit normal vectors will be 1 or −1. More specifically, the angle between the normal vectors can be computed. This is called the dihedral angle, and represents the smallest possible angle between the two planes. The formula for a plane in 3-dimensional space is:

:&lt;math&gt;ax+by+cz+d=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt; is the normal vector of the plane.

The value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; can be computed by substituting one of the points and then solving. If &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the same for all subsets of three points, then the planes are the same.

One advantage of this technique is that it can work in higher dimensional spaces. For example, suppose one wants to compute the dihedral angle between two ''m''-dimensional hyperplanes defined by ''m'' points in (''m'' + 1)-dimensional space. If &lt;math&gt;n-m&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then there are an infinite number of normal vectors for each hyperplane, so the angle between two of them is not necessarily the dihedral angle. However, if the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] is used, using the same initial vector in both cases, then the angle between the two normal vectors will be minimal, and therefore will be the dihedral angle between the hyperplanes.
--&gt;

==Coplanarity of points in ''n''-dimensions whose coordinates are given==

Since three or fewer points are always coplanar, the problem of determining when a set of points are coplanar is generally of interest only when there are at least four points involved. In the case that there are exactly four points, several ad hoc methods can be employed, but a general method that works for any number of points uses vector methods and the property that a plane is determined by two [[linearly independent vectors]].

In an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space ({{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}), a set of {{math|''k''}} points, {{math|{''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;} }} are coplanar if and only if the matrix of their relative differences, that is, the matrix whose columns (or rows) are the vectors &lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{p_0 p_1}, \overrightarrow{p_0 p_2}, \ldots, \overrightarrow{p_0 p_{k-1}} &lt;/math&gt; is of [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2 or less. 

For example, given four points, {{math|1=''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|1=''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;#8239;...&amp;#8239;,&amp;#8239;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 - w_1 &amp; x_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; x_n - w_n \\
y_1 - w_1 &amp; y_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_n - w_n \\
z_1 - w_1 &amp; z_2 - w_2 &amp; \dots &amp; z_n - w_n \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
is of rank 2 or less, the four points are coplanar.

In the special case of a plane that contains the origin, the property can be simplified in the following way:
A set of {{math|''k''}} points and the origin are coplanar if and only if the matrix of the coordinates of the {{mvar|k}} points is of rank 2 or less.

==Geometric shapes==

A [[skew polygon]] is a [[polygon]] whose [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are not coplanar. Such a polygon must have at least four vertices; there are no skew triangles.

A [[polyhedron]] that has positive [[volume]] has vertices that are not all coplanar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1289">In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindrification''' is a construction that associates a [[cylindric numbering]] to each [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]]. The concept was first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973.

== Definition ==

Given a numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the '''cylindrification''' &lt;math&gt;c(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Domain}(c(\nu)) := \{\langle n, k \rangle | n \in \mathrm{Domain}(\nu)\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c(\nu)\langle n, k \rangle := \nu(i)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle n, k \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cantor pairing function]].
The cylindrification operation takes a relation as input of arity k and outputs a relation of arity k + 1 as follows : Given a relation R of arity K, its cylindrification denoted by c(R), is the following set {(a1,...,ak,a)|(a1,...,ak)belongs to R and a belongs to A}. Note that the cylindrification operation increases the arity of an input by 1.

== Properties ==
* Given two numberings &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\nu \le \mu \Leftrightarrow c(\nu) \le_1 c(\mu)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\nu \le_1 c(\nu)&lt;/math&gt;

==Early life and education==
Hille was born in [[New York City]]. His parents were both immigrants from [[Sweden]] who separated before his birth. His father, Carl August Heuman, was a civil engineer.  He was brought up by his mother, Edla Eckman, who took the surname Hille. When Einar was two years old, he and his mother returned to [[Stockholm]]. Hille spent the next 24 years of his life in Sweden, returning to the United States when he was 26 years old. Hille entered the [[University of Stockholm]] in 1911. Hille was awarded his first degree in mathematics in 1913 and the equivalent of a master's degree in the following year. He received a Ph.D. from Stockholm in 1918 for a doctoral dissertation entitled ''Some Problems Concerning Spherical Harmonics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Career==
In 1919 Hille was awarded the [[Mittag-Leffler Institute|Mittag-Leffler]] Prize and was given the right to teach at the University of Stockholm. He subsequently taught at [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1933, he became an endowed professor on mathematics in the Graduate School of [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate= January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hille's main work was on [[integral equation]]s, [[differential equation]]s, [[special function]]s, [[Dirichlet series]] and [[Fourier series]]. Later in his career his interests turned more towards [[functional analysis]]. His name persists among others in the [[Hille&amp;ndash;Yosida theorem]]. Hille was a member of the [[London Mathematical Society]] and the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]]. Hille served as president of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (1937–38) and was the Society's Colloquium lecturer in 1944. He received many honours including election to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] (1953) and the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences]]. He was awarded by Sweden with the [[Order of the Polar Star]].

In mathematics, the '''Fatou conjecture''', named after [[Pierre Fatou]], states that a quadratic family of maps from the complex plane to itself is hyperbolic for an open dense set of parameters.

{{italic title}}
'''''Foundations of Algebraic Geometry''''' is a book by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André|last=Weil|year=1946|year2=1962}} that develops [[algebraic geometry]] over [[field (mathematics)|field]]s of any [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]. In particular it gives a careful treatment of [[intersection theory]] by defining the local intersection multiplicity of two [[Subvariety|subvarieties]].

Weil was motivated by the need for a rigorous theory of correspondences on [[algebraic curve]]s in positive characteristic, which he used in his proof of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] for curves over a [[finite field]].

Weil introduced [[Abstract variety|abstract]] rather than [[Projective variety|projective varieties]] partly so that he could construct the [[Jacobian of a curve]]. (It was not known at the time that Jacobians are always projective varieties.) It was some time before anyone found any examples of [[complete variety|complete abstract varieties]] that are not projective.  
 
In the 1950s Weil's work was one of several competing attempts to provide satisfactory foundations for algebraic geometry, all of which were superseded by [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]]'s development of [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s.

      <comment>/* Proof of the graph theoretic version */</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16895">'''Hall's marriage theorem''', proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Philip|last=Hall|authorlink=Philip Hall|year=1935}}, is a theorem with two equivalent formulations:
* The [[Combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]] formulation deals with a collection of finite sets. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition for being able to select a distinct element from each set.
* The [[Graph theory|graph theoretic]] formulation deals with a [[bipartite graph]]. It gives a necessary and sufficient condition for finding a [[matching (graph theory)|matching]] that covers at least one side of the graph.

== Combinatorial formulation ==

Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a (possibly infinite) [[Family of sets|family]] of [[finite set|finite]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where the members of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are [[multiplicity (mathematics)|counted with multiplicity]]. (That is, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; may contain the same set several times.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}. It is also possible to have infinite sets in the family, but the number of sets in the family must then be finite, counted with multiplicity. Only the situation of having an infinite number of sets while allowing infinite sets is not allowed.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Transversal (combinatorics)|transversal]]''' for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the image of an [[injective function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the set &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the family &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; selects one representative from each set in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that no two sets from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; get the same representative. An alternative term for ''transversal'' is ''system of distinct representatives''.

The collection ''S'' satisfies the '''marriage condition''' when for each subfamily &lt;math&gt;W \subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|W| \le \Bigl|\bigcup_{A \in W} A\Bigr|.&lt;/math&gt;

Restated in words, the marriage condition asserts that every subfamily &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; covers at least &lt;math&gt;|W|&lt;/math&gt; different members of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

If the marriage condition fails then there cannot be a transversal &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

{{collapse top|title=Proof|width=50%}}
Suppose that the marriage condition fails, i.e., that for some subcollection &lt;math&gt;W_0&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |W_0| &gt; |\bigcup_{A \in W_0} A|.&lt;/math&gt; Suppose, by way of contradiction, that a transversal &lt;math&gt;f(S)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; also exists.

The restriction of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to the offending subcollection &lt;math&gt;W_0&lt;/math&gt; would be an injective function from &lt;math&gt;W_0&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bigcup_{A \in W_0}&lt;/math&gt;. This is impossible by the [[pigeonhole principle]] since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |W_0| &gt; |\bigcup_{A \in W_0} A| &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore no transversal can exist if the marriage condition fails.
{{collapse bottom}}

Hall's theorem states that the converse is also true:

{{math_theorem|name=Hall's Marriage Theorem|math_statement=A family ''S'' of finite sets has a transversal if and only if ''S'' satisfies the marriage condition.}}

=== Examples ===
[[File:Halls theorem positive example2.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|example 1, marriage condition met]]
Example 1: Consider ''S'' = {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;} with
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, 2, 3}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, 4, 5}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; = {3, 5}.

A valid transversal would be (1, 4, 5).  (Note this is not unique: (2, 1, 3) works equally well, for example.)
[[File:Halls theorem negartive example2.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|example 2, marriage condition violated]]
Example 2: Consider ''S'' = {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;} with
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; = {2, 3, 4, 5}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; = {4, 5}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; = {5}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt; = {4}.

No valid transversal exists; the marriage condition is violated as is shown by the subcollection {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

Example 3: Consider ''S''= {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt;} with
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; = {a, b, c}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt; = {b, d}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; = {a, b, d}
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''4''&lt;/sub&gt; = {b, d}.

The only valid transversals are (c, b, a, d) and (c, d, a, b).

=== Application to marriage ===
The standard example of an application of the marriage theorem is to imagine two groups; one of ''n'' men, and one of ''n'' women. For each woman, there is a subset of the men, any one of which she would happily marry; and any man would be happy to marry a woman who wants to marry him.  Consider whether it is possible to pair up (in [[marriage]]) the men and women so that every person is happy.

If we let ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of men that the ''i''-th woman would be happy to marry, then the marriage theorem states that each woman can happily marry a man if and only if the collection of sets {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} meets the marriage condition.

Note that the marriage condition is that, for any subset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of the women, the number of men whom at least one of the women would be happy to marry, &lt;math&gt;|\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i|&lt;/math&gt;, be at least as big as the number of women in that subset, &lt;math&gt;|I|&lt;/math&gt;.  It is obvious that this condition is ''necessary'', as if it does not hold, there are not enough men to share among the &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; women.  What is interesting is that it is also a ''sufficient'' condition.

== Graph theoretic formulation ==
[[File:Halls theorem matching graph theory2.svg|thumb|blue edges represent a matching]]
Let ''G'' be a finite [[bipartite graph]] with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' ( ''G'':= (''X'' + ''Y'', ''E'')).    For a set ''W'' of vertices in ''X'', let &lt;math&gt;N_G(W)&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighborhood]] of ''W'' in ''G'', i.e. the set of all vertices in ''Y'' [[Adjacent (graph theory)|adjacent]] to some element of ''W''.  The marriage theorem in this formulation states that there is a [[matching (graph theory)|matching]] that entirely covers ''X'' [[if and only if]] for every subset ''W'' of ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;|W| \leq |N_G(W)|.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words: every subset ''W'' of ''X'' has sufficiently many adjacent vertices in ''Y''.

Given a finite bipartite graph ''G'':= (''X'' + ''Y'', ''E''), with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' of equal size, the marriage theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a [[perfect matching]] in the graph.

A generalization to general graphs (that are not necessarily bipartite) is provided by the [[Tutte theorem]].

=== Proof of the graph theoretic version ===

An [[matching (graph theory)|''X''-saturating matching]] is a matching which covers every vertex in ''X''.

We first prove: If a bipartite graph ''G'' = (''X'' + ''Y'', ''E'') = ''G''(''X'', ''Y'') has an ''X''-saturating matching, then |N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')| ≥ |''W''| for all ''W'' ⊆ ''X''.

Suppose M is a matching that saturates every vertex of ''X''. 
Let the set of all vertices in ''Y'' matched by M to a given ''W'' be denoted as M(''W''). Therefore, |M(''W'')|=|''W''|, by the definition of matching.
But M(''W'') ⊆ N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W''), since all elements of M(''W'') are neighbours of ''W''.
So, |N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')| ≥  |M(''W'')| and hence, |N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')| ≥ |''W''|.

Now we prove: If |N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')| ≥ |''W''| for all ''W'' ⊆ X, then ''G''(''X'',''Y'') has a matching that saturates every vertex in ''X''.

Assume for contradiction that ''G''(''X'',''Y'') is a bipartite graph that has no matching that saturates all vertices of ''X''.
Let ''M'' be a maximum matching, and ''u'' a vertex not saturated by M. Consider all ''alternating paths'' (i.e., paths in ''G'' alternately using edges outside and inside M) starting from ''u''. Let the set of all points in ''Y'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths be ''T'', and the set of all points in ''X'' connected to ''u'' by these alternating paths (including ''u'' itself) be ''W''.
No maximal alternating path can end in a vertex in ''Y'', lest it would be an ''augmenting path'', so that we could augment M to a strictly larger matching by toggling the status (belongs to ''M'' or not) of all the edges of the path. Thus every vertex in ''T'' is matched by M to a vertex in ''W'' \ {''u''}. Conversely, every vertex ''v'' in ''W'' \ {''u''} is matched by M to a vertex in ''T'' (namely, the vertex preceding ''v'' on an alternating path ending at ''v''). Thus, M provides a bijection of ''W'' \ {''u''} and ''T'', which implies |''W''| = |''T''| + 1. On the other hand, N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'') ⊆ ''T'': let ''v'' in ''Y'' be connected to a vertex ''w'' in ''W''. If the edge (''w'',''v'') is in M, then ''v'' is in ''T'' by the previous part of the proof, otherwise we can take an alternating path ending in ''w'' and extend it with ''v'', getting an augmenting path and showing that ''v'' is in ''T''. Hence,  |N&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''W'')| &lt;= |''T''| = |''W''| − 1&lt;|''W''|, a contradiction.

=== Equivalence of the combinatorial formulation and the graph-theoretic formulation ===

Let ''S'' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) where the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are finite sets which need not be distinct. Let the set ''X'' = {''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;} (that is, the set of names of the elements of ''S'') and the set ''Y'' be the union of all the elements in all the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. 

We form a finite [[bipartite graph]] ''G'':= (''X'' + ''Y'', ''E''),  with bipartite sets ''X'' and ''Y'' by joining any element in ''Y'' to each ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; which it is a member of. A transversal of ''S'' is an [[matching (graph theory)|''X''-saturating matching]] (a matching which covers every vertex in ''X'') of the bipartite graph ''G''. Thus a problem in the combinatorial formulation can be easily translated to a problem in the graph-theoretic formulation.

== Marshall Hall Jr. variant ==
By examining [[Philip Hall]]'s original proof carefully, [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall, Jr.]] (no relation to Philip Hall) was able to tweak the result in a way that permitted the proof to work for infinite ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variant refines the marriage theorem and provides a lower bound on the number of transversals that a given ''S'' may have. This variant is:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=pg.90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose that (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), where the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are finite sets that need not be distinct, is a family of sets satisfying the marriage condition, and suppose that |''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;| ≥ ''r'' for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''. Then the number of different transversals for the family is at least ''r'' ! if ''r'' ≤ ''n'' and ''r''(''r'' - 1) ... (''r'' - ''n'' +1) if ''r'' &gt; ''n''.

Recall that a transversal for a family ''S'' is an ordered sequence, so two different transversals could have exactly the same elements. For instance, the family ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {1,2,3}, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {1,2,5} has both (1,2) and (2,1) as distinct transversals.

==Applications==
The theorem has many other interesting "non-marital" applications. For example, take a [[Playing card|standard deck of cards]], and deal them out into 13 piles of 4 cards each.  Then, using the marriage theorem, we can show that it is always possible to select exactly 1 card from each pile, such that the 13 selected cards contain exactly one card of each rank (Ace, 2, 3, ..., Queen, King).

More abstractly, let ''G'' be a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and ''H'' be a finite [[subgroup]] of ''G''. Then the marriage theorem can be used to show that there is a set ''T'' such that ''T'' is a transversal for both the set of left [[coset]]s and right cosets of ''H'' in ''G''.

The marriage theorem is used in the usual proofs of the fact that an (r &amp;times; n) [[Latin rectangle]] can always be extended to an ((r+1) &amp;times; n) Latin rectangle when r &lt; n, and so, ultimately to a [[Latin square]].

==Marriage condition does not extend==
The following example, due to Marshall Hall, Jr., shows that the marriage condition will not guarantee the existence of a transversal in an infinite family in which infinite sets are allowed. 

Let ''S'' be the family,  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {1, 2, 3, ...}, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {1}, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {2}, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = {i}, ... 

The marriage condition holds for this infinite family, but no transversal can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall, Jr.|1986|loc=pg. 51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more general problem of selecting a (not necessarily distinct) element from each of a collection of nonempty sets (without restriction as to the number of sets or the size of the sets) is permitted in general only if the [[axiom of choice]] is accepted.

== Logical equivalences ==

This theorem is part of a collection of remarkably powerful theorems in combinatorics, all of which are related to each other in an informal sense in that it is more straightforward to prove one of these theorems from another of them than from first principles. These include:

* The [[König–Egerváry theorem]] (1931) ([[Dénes Kőnig]], [[Jenő Egerváry]])
* König's theorem&lt;ref&gt;The naming of this theorem is inconsistent in the literature. There is the result concerning matchings in bipartite graphs and its interpretation as a covering of (0,1)-matrices. {{harvtxt|Hall, Jr.|1986}} and {{harvtxt|van Lint|Wilson|1992}} refer to the matrix form as König's theorem, while {{harvtxt|Roberts|Tesman|2009}} refer to this version as the Kőnig-Egerváry theorem. The bipartite graph version is called Kőnig's theorem by {{harvtxt|Cameron|1994}} and {{harvtxt|Roberts|Tesman|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Menger's theorem]] (1927)
* The [[max-flow min-cut theorem]] (Ford–Fulkerson algorithm)
* The [[Birkhoff–Von Neumann theorem]] (1946)
* [[Dilworth's theorem]].

In particular,&lt;ref&gt;[http://robertborgersen.info/Presentations/GS-05R-1.pdf Equivalence of seven major theorems in combinatorics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reichmeider|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are simple proofs of the implications Dilworth's theorem ⇔ Hall's theorem ⇔ König–Egerváry theorem ⇔ König's theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30510">In [[graph theory]], coloring generally implies assignment of labels to vertices, edges or faces in a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The '''incidence coloring''' is a special [[graph labeling]] where in each incidence of an edge with a vertex is assigned a color under certain constraints.

==Definitions==

Let ''G = (V, E)'' be a simple graph with vertex set (non-empty) ''V(G)'' and edge set ''E(G)''. An [[incidence (graph)|incidence]] is defined as a pair ''(v, e)'' where ''v'' ϵ ''V(G)'' is an end point of ''e'' ϵ ''E(G)''. In simple words, one says that vertex ''v'' is incident to edge ''e''.

Consider a set of incidences, say, ''I(G)'' = {''(v,e)'' : ''v'' ϵ ''V(G)'' and ''e'' ϵ ''E(G)'' and ''v'' ϵ ''e''}.&lt;ref name='bm'&gt;Brualdi R. A.; Massey J. Q.(1993), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X93902863 Incidence and strong edge colorings of graphs]", Discrete Mathematics 122, pp. 51–58&lt;/ref&gt; The two incidences ''(v,e)'' and ''(u,f)'' are said to be adjacent if one of the given conditions holds:
* ''v'' = ''u'', ''e'' ≠ ''f''
* ''e'' = ''f'', ''v'' ≠ ''u''
* ''e'' = ''{v, u}'', ''f'' = ''{u, w}'' and ''v'' ≠ ''w''.

[[File:Neighborly Incidences.jpg|thumb|centre|upright=3|Examples of neighborly incidences. The * above the edge e closest to vertex v denotes incidence (v,e).]]

An '''incidence coloring''' of ''G'' can be defined as a function ''c'': ''I(G)'' → ''N'' such that ''c((v, e))'' ≠ ''c((u,f))'' for any incidences ''(v, e)'' and ''(u, f)'' that are adjacent. This implies that incidence coloring assigns distinct colors to neighborly incidences. [Generally, a simplified notation ''c(v, u)'' is used instead of ''c((v, e))''.]

The minimum number of colors needed for incidence coloring of a graph is known as '''incidence chromatic number''' or '''incidence coloring number''' of ''G'', represented by ''&lt;math&gt; \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)''. This notation was introduced by Jennifer J. Quinn Massey and [[Richard A. Brualdi]] in 1993.

[[File:Incidence coloring example.jpg|thumb|centre|upright=1.5|Incidence coloring of Petersen graph]]

Let ''A'' be a finite subset of ''N'', the set of natural numbers. ''A'' is an interval if and only if it contains all the numbers between minimum of ''A'' and maximum of ''A''. Consider ''c'' to be an incidence coloring of graph ''G''. Let ''&lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt;(v)'' = {''c(v,e)'' : ''v'' is an end point of edge ''e'' where ''e'' belongs to edge set ''E(G)''}. An '''interval incidence coloring''' of ''G'' is an incidence coloring ''c'' of graph ''G'' such that for each vertex ''v'' in ''V(G)'', the set ''&lt;math&gt;A_c&lt;/math&gt;(v)'' is an interval.&lt;ref&gt;Janczewski, R.; Malafiejska, A.; Malafiejski, M., "Interval Wavelength Assignment in All-optical Star Networks", Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics, 8th International Conference, PPAM 2009, Wtroclaw, Poland, September 13–16, 2009. Revised Selected Papers Part I (Springer), pp. 11–20, doi:10.1007/978-3-642-14390-8_2, {{ISBN|978-3-642-14389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''interval incidence coloring number''' of ''G'' is the minimum number of colors used for the interval incidence coloring of ''G''. It is denoted by ''IIC(G)''. If only ''IIC(G)'' colors are used for the interval incidence coloring, then it is said to be minimal.

==History==

The concept of incidence coloring was introduced by Brualdi and Massey in 1993. They bounded it in terms of ''Δ(G)'', the [[Degree (graph theory)|maximum degree]] of a graph ''G''. Initially, the incidence chromatic number of trees, complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs was found out. They also conjectured that all graphs can have an incidence coloring using ''Δ(G) + 2'' colors (Incidence coloring conjecture - ICC). This conjecture was disproved by Guiduli, who showed that incidence coloring concept is a directed star arboricity case,&lt;ref&gt;Algor I., Alon N. (1989); "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X89900733 The star arboricity of graphs]", Discrete Mathematics 75, pp. 11-22.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by Alon and Algor. His counter example showed that incidence chromatic number is at most ''Δ(G) + O(log Δ(G))''.&lt;ref name='gb'&gt;Guiduli B. (1997); "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9500342T On incidence coloring and star arboricity of graphs]", Discrete Mathematics 163, pp. 275-278&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen et al. found the incidence chromatic number of [[Path (graph theory)|paths]], fans, [[Cycle graph|cycles]], wheels, complete tripartite graph and adding edge wheels. Few years later, Shiu et al. showed that this conjecture is true for certain [[cubic graph]]s such as cubic Hamiltonian graphs. He showed that in case of outerplanar graph of maximum degree 4, the incidence chromatic number is not 5. The bounds for incidence chromatic number of various graph classes is found out now.

==Basic results==

Consider a graph ''G'' with maximum degree ''Δ(G)''. The trivial lower bound for ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' is given as: ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' ≥ ''Δ(G) + 1''.

'''Proof.''' Let ''v'' be the vertex with maximum degree ''Δ'' in ''G''. Let ''&lt;math&gt;e_1, e_2, e_3, ..., e_\Delta &lt;/math&gt;'' be the edges that are incident with the vertex ''v''. Consider ''&lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;'' = { ''v,w'' }. We can see that every pair of ''Δ + 1'' incidences, that is, ( ''v,&lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;'' ), ( ''v,&lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;'' ), ( ''v,&lt;math&gt;e_3&lt;/math&gt;'' ),......, ( ''v,&lt;math&gt;e_\Delta &lt;/math&gt;'' ), ( ''w,&lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;'' ) is neighborly. Therefore, these incidences have to be colored using distinct colors.

The bound is attained by trees and complete graphs.

The main results&lt;ref name='bm' /&gt; were determined and proved by Brualdi and Massey(1993). Shiu, Sun and Wu have proposed certain necessary conditions for graph to meet the quality ''&lt;math&gt; \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' = ''Δ(G) + 1''.
* ''&lt;math&gt; \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' = ''n'' when ''G'' = ''&lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;'' with ''n ≥ 2''.
* Let ''G'' be a tree of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|order]] ''n'' where ''n ≥ 2''. Then, ''&lt;math&gt; \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' = ''Δ(G) + 1''.
* For a [[complete bipartite graph]] ''&lt;math&gt;K_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt;'' with ''m ≥ n ≥ 2'', incidence chromatic number is ''m + 2''.
* For any graph ''G'', ''&lt;math&gt; \chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G) ≤ 2Δ(G)''.
* For cycle ''&lt;math&gt; C_n&lt;/math&gt;'', incidence chromatic number is at most 4. ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;C_{3n}&lt;/math&gt;)'' = 3.

==Incidence coloring of some graph classes==

===Meshes===

Several algorithms are introduced to provide incidence coloring of meshes&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C. I.; Wang, Y. L.; Chung, S. S. (2004), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122104004171 The Incidence Coloring Numbers of Meshes]", Computers and Mathematics with Applications 48, pp. 1643–1649&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Lattice graph|square meshes]], honeycomb meshes and hexagonal meshes. These algorithms are optimal. For each mesh, the incidence colors can be made in the linear time with the least number of colors. It is found out that ''Δ(G) + 1'' colors are required for incidence coloring of square meshes, honeycomb meshes and hexagonal meshes.
* The incidence chromatic number of a square mesh is 5.
* The incidence chromatic number of a hexagonal mesh is 7.
* The incidence chromatic number of a honeycomb mesh is 4.

===Halin graphs===

For a [[Halin graph]] ''G'' with maximum degree greater than 4, the incidence chromatic number is ''Δ(G) + 1''; which was proved by Chen, Wang and Pang. In case of Halin graphs with ''Δ(G)'' = 3 or 4, Jing-Zhe Qu determined that the incidence chromatic number to be 5 or 6 respectively. If Halin graph ''G'' contains a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] ''T'', then incidence chromatic number of ''&lt;math&gt;H^2&lt;/math&gt;'' is at most ''Δ(&lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;)'' + ''Δ(T)'' + 8.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, S. D.; Cheng, D. L.; Pang, S. C. (2002), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X01003028 The incidence coloring number of Halin graphs and outerplanar graphs]", Discrete Mathematics 256, pp. 397–405&lt;/ref&gt; Every cubic Halin graph other than [[complete graph]] on 4 vertices satisfies incidence coloring with ''Δ + 2'' colors (Result proved by Shiu and Sun).  Su, Meng and Guo extended this result and showed that all pseudo-Halin graphs satisfy incidence coloring conjecture. However, when the incidence coloring number of Halin graphs with low degree is ''Δ(G) + 1'' colors is still an unsolved problem.

===k-degenerated graphs===

D.L. Chen, P.C.B. Lam and W.C. Shiu had conjectured that the incidence chromatic number of a cubic graph ''G'' is at most ''∆(G)+2''. They even proved that it is true in case of certain cubic graphs such as class of Hamiltonian cubic graphs. Based on these results, M. H. Dolama, E. Sopena and X. Zhu (2004) studied the graph classes for which ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' is bounded by ''∆(G) + c'' where ''c'' is some fixed constant.&lt;ref name=dsz&gt;Hosseini Dolama, M.; Sopena, E.; Zhu, X. (2004), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X04001517 Incidence coloring of k-generated graphs]", Discrete Mathematics 283, pp. 121–128&lt;/ref&gt; A graph is said to be ''k''-generated if for every subgraph ''H'' of ''G'', the minimum degree of ''H'' is at most ''k''.
* Incidence chromatic number of ''k''-degenerated graphs ''G'' is at most ''∆(G) + 2k - 1''.
* Incidence chromatic number of ''k&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' minor free graphs ''G'' is at most ''∆(G) + 2'' and it form a tight bound.
* Incidence chromatic number of a planar graph ''G'' is at most ''∆(G) + 7''.

===Outerplanar graphs===

Consider an [[outerplanar graph]] ''G''. Let vertex ''v'' in ''G'' be a [[Biconnected component|cut vertex]] such that ''G – v'' is [[Graph operations|union]] of graphs ''&lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;''. Let graph ''&lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;'' be the [[Glossary of graph theory|induced subgraph]] on vertex ''v'' and vertices of ''&lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;''; and graph ''&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;'' be the induced subgraph on vertex ''v'' and vertices of ''&lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;''. Then incidence chromatic number of ''G'' is maximum among incidence chromatic number of ''&lt;math&gt;G_1, G_2&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''1 + &lt;math&gt;d_G&lt;/math&gt;(v)'' where ''&lt;math&gt;d_G&lt;/math&gt;(v)'' is the degree of vertex ''v'' in ''G''.

The incidence chromatic number of an outerplanar graph ''G'' is at most ''Δ(G) + 2'' where ''Δ(G)'' is maximum degree of ''G''. In case of outerplanar graphs with ''Δ(G)'' greater than 3, the incidence chromatic number is ''Δ(G) +1''.

Since outerplanar graphs are ''k&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''-minor-free graphs, they accept a ''(Δ + 2, 2)'' – incidence coloring.&lt;ref name=dsz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, S.; Xu, J.; Ma, F.; Xu, C. (2008), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002007108000610 The (Δ+2, 2)-incidence coloring of outerplanar graphs]", Progress in Natural Science 18, pp. 575–578.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution for incidence chromatic number of the outerplanar graph ''G'' having ''Δ(G) = 3'' and [[Connectivity (graph theory)|2-connected]] outerplanar graph is still an open question.

===Chordal rings===

Chordal rings are variations of ring networks. The use of chordal rings in communication is very extensive due to its advantages over the interconnection networks with ring topology and other analysed structures such as meshes, hypercubes, Cayley's graphs, etc. Arden and Lee&lt;ref&gt;Arden B.W., Lee H. (1981); "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1675777 Analysis of Chordal Ring Network]", IEEE Transactions on Computers 30, pp. 291-295.&lt;/ref&gt; first proposed the chordal ring of degree 3, that is, the ring structured network in which every node has an extra link known as chord, to some other node in the network. Distributed loop networks are chordal rings of degree 4 which is constructed by adding 2 extra chords at every vertex in a ring network.

Chordal rings, denoted by ''CR(N,d)'' is a graph with vertex set ''V(G)'' = { ''&lt;math&gt;v_0, v_1, v_2, ...., v_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;'' } and edge set ''E(G)'' = { '' &lt;math&gt;v_iv_j :[i-j]_N &lt;/math&gt; = 1 or d '' }, where ''&lt;math&gt;[x]_y&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes x modulo y, ''n'' is number of nodes and ''d'' is chord length. These graphs are studied due to its application in communication. Kung-Fu Ding, Kung-Jui Pai and Ro-Yu Wu studied the incidence coloring of chordal rings.&lt;ref&gt;Ding K.F., Pai K.J., Yu R. (1981); "[http://par.cse.nsysu.edu.tw/~algo/paper/paper15/A2_4.pdf Some Results on the Incidence Coloring Number of Chordal Rings*]", The 32nd Workshop on Combinatorial Mathematics and Computation Theory, pp. 89-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Several algorithms are formulated to find the incidence chromatic number of chordal rings. The major findings are:
* ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(CR(N,d))'' = 5 if ''N'' is multiple of 5 and ''d'' is 2 or 3.
* ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(CR(N,2))'' = 6 if ''N'' is not a multiple of 5
* ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(CR(N,3))'' = 6 if ''N'' ≡ 2 (mod 5)

===Powers of cycles===

Keaitsuda Nakprasit and Kittikorn Nakprasit studied the incidence coloring of powers of cycles. They have proved that ''&lt;math&gt;C_n^k&lt;/math&gt;'' except for certain cases, satisfies the ''(Δ + 2)'' conjecture where ''k'' is an integer. It was found out that ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i(C_n^k)&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''2k + 1'' = ''Δ(&lt;math&gt;{C_n}^k)&lt;/math&gt;  + 1'' when n is divisible by ''2k + 1'', else ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i(C_n^k)&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''2k + 2''.&lt;ref name='nk'&gt;Nakprasit , K.; Nakprasit, K. (2012), "[http://www.ijpam.eu/contents/2012-76-1/13/13.pdf Incidence colorings of the powers of cycles]", International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics 76(1), pp. 143–148&lt;/ref&gt; If ''n'' is divisible by 5, ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i(C_n^2)&lt;/math&gt;'' = 5. Otherwise, ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i(C_n^2)&lt;/math&gt;'' = 6.&lt;ref name='nk' /&gt; Apart from the powers of cycles, studies have been done on powers of other graphs too.

==Relation between incidence chromatic number and domination number of a graph==

Consider a simple connected graph ''G'' with order ''n'', size m and domination number ''&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;''.
Then, ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' ≥ ''&lt;math&gt; \frac{2m}{n - \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;''.&lt;ref name='sk'&gt;Sun, P. K. (2012), "[http://journal.taiwanmathsoc.org.tw/index.php/TJM/article/view/2642/1427 Incidence coloring of regular graphs and complement graphs]", Taiwanese Journal of Mathematics 16, No. 6, pp. 2289–2295&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof.''' Form a [[Directed graph|digraph]] ''D(G)'' from graph ''G'' by dividing each edge of ''G'' into 2 arcs in opposite directions. We can see that the total number of arcs in ''D(G)'' is ''2m''. According to Guiduli,&lt;ref name='gb' /&gt; the incidence coloring of ''G'' is equivalent to proper coloring of the digraph ''D(G)'', where 2 distinct arcs ''&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{u v}&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{x y}&lt;/math&gt;'' are adjacent if one of the following conditions holds: (i) ''u'' = ''x''; (ii) ''v'' = ''x'' or ''y'' = ''u''. By the definition of adjacency of arcs, an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of arcs in ''D(G)'' is a star forest. Therefore, a maximal independent set of arcs is a maximal star [[Tree (graph theory)|forest]]. This implies that at least ''&lt;math&gt; \frac{2m}{n - \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;'' color classes are required.&lt;ref name='sk' /&gt;

This relation has been widely used in the characterization of ''(r+1)''-incidence colorable ''r''-regular graphs. The major result on incidence coloring of ''r''-regular graphs is: If graph ''G'' is [[Regular graph|r-regular graph]], then ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{i}(G)&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{i}(G^2)&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''r + 1'' if and only if ''V (G)'' is a disjoint union of ''r + 1'' [[dominating set]]s.&lt;ref name='sk' /&gt;

==Interval incidence coloring==

The interval incidence coloring of graph ''G'' is an incidence coloring of ''G'' such that the set of colors given for the incidences adjoining the same vertex forms an interval.&lt;ref&gt;Janczewski, R.; Małafiejska, A.; Małafiejski, M. (2015), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X14001292 Interval incidence graph coloring]", Discrete Applied Mathematics 182, pp. 73–83&lt;/ref&gt; The interval incidence coloring number, denoted by ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;'' is the smallest number of colors needed for an interval incidence coloring of ''G''. It is clear that ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{i}&lt;/math&gt;(G) ≤ &lt;math&gt;\chi_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;(G)''.

The concept of interval incidence coloring was introduced by A. Malafiejska, R. Janczewski and M. Malafiejski. They proved that ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;(G) ≤ 2∆(G)'' for any bipartite graph ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;Janczewski, R.; Małafiejska, A.; Małafiejski, M. (2014), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X13004356 Interval incidence coloring of bipartite graphs]", Discrete Applied Mathematics 166, pp. 131–145&lt;/ref&gt; In case of regular bipartite graphs, this equality holds. Subcubic bipartite graphs admit an interval incidence coloring using four, five or six colors. They have also proved that in linear time, for every bipartite graph with ''∆(G) = 4'', deciding interval incidence 5-colorability can be performed.

==Fractional incidence coloring==

The fractional version of the incidence coloring was first introduced by Yang in 2007. A ''r''-tuple incidence ''k''-coloring of a graph ''G'' is the assignment of ''r'' colors to each incidence of graph ''G'' from a set of ''k'' colors such that the neighboring (adjacent) incidences are given disjoint sets of colors.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, D (2012), "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267173229_Fractional_incidence_coloring_and_star_arboricity_of_graphs Fractional incidence coloring and star arboricity of graphs]", Ars Combinatoria - Waterloo then Winnipeg 105, pp. 213–224&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, it is obvious that 1-tuple incidence ''k''-coloring is an incidence ''k''-coloring too.

The fractional incidence chromatic number of graph ''G'' is the infimum of the fractions ''&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{r}&lt;/math&gt;'' in such a way that ''G'' admits a ''r''-tuple incidence ''k''-coloring. Fractional incidence coloring has great applications in several fields of computer science. Based on incidence coloring results by Guiduli,&lt;ref name='gb' /&gt; Yang has proved that the fractional incidence chromatic number of any graph having maximum degree ''∆(G)'' is at most ''∆(G) + 20 log ∆(G) + 84''. He has also proved the existence of graphs with fractional incidence chromatic number at least ''∆(G) + Ω(log ∆(G))''.

==Nordhaus–Gaddum inequality==

The Nordhaus–Gaddum inequality has been developed for the incidence chromatic number ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' of graph ''G''. Consider a graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices such that ''G'' ≠ ''&lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;'' or ''&lt;math&gt;\overline{K_n}&lt;/math&gt;''. Let ''&lt;math&gt;\overline{G}&lt;/math&gt;'' represents the complement graph of ''G''.
Then, ''n +2 ≤ &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;(G)'' + ''&lt;math&gt;\chi_{i}(\overline{G})&lt;/math&gt; ≤ 2n − 1''.&lt;ref name='sk' /&gt; These bounds are sharp for all values of ''n''.

==Incidence coloring game==

[[Graph coloring game|Incidence coloring game]] was first introduced by S. D. Andres.&lt;ref name='an'&gt;Andres, S. D. (2009), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X07004866 The incidence game chromatic number]", Discrete Applied Mathematics 157, pp. 1980–1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is the incidence version of the vertex coloring game, in which the incidences of a graph are colored instead of vertices. Incidence game chromatic number is the new parameter defined as a game-theoretic analogous of the incidence chromatic number.

The game is that two players, Alice and Bob construct a proper incidence coloring. The rules are stated below:
* Alice and Bob color the incidences of a graph ''G'' with a set ''k'' of colors.
* They are taking turns to provide a proper coloring to an uncolored incidence. Generally, Alice begins).
* In case of an incidence cannot be colored properly, then Bob wins.
* If every incidences of graph is colored properly, Alice wins.

The incidence game chromatic number of a graph ''G'', denoted by ''&lt;math&gt;i_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;'', is the least number of colors required for Alice to win in incidence coloring game. It unifies the ideas of incidence chromatic number of a graph and game chromatic number in case of an undirected graph. Andres found out that the upper bound for ''&lt;math&gt;i_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;'' in case of ''k''-degenerate graphs with maximum degree ''Δ'' is ''2Δ + 4k - 2''. This bound was improved to ''2Δ + 3k - 1'' in case of graphs in which ''Δ'' is at least ''5k''. The incidence game chromatic number of stars, cycles, and sufficiently large wheels are also determined.&lt;ref name='an' /&gt; John Y. Kim (2011) has found out the exact incidence game chromatic number of large paths and has given a correct proof of a result stated by Andres concerning the exact incidence game chromatic number of large wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J. Y. (2011), "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X10000028 The incidence game chromatic number of paths and subgraphs of wheels]", Discrete Applied Mathematics 159, pp. 683–694&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indra's Pearls: The Vision of Felix Klein''''' is a [[geometry]] book written by [[David Mumford]], [[Caroline Series]] and David Wright, and published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2002 and 2015.

The book explores the patterns created by iterating [[conformal map]]s of the [[complex plane]] called [[Möbius transformation]]s, and their connections with [[symmetry]] and [[self-similarity|self-similar]]ity. These patterns were glimpsed by German [[mathematician]] [[Felix Klein]], but modern computer graphics allows them to be fully visualised and explored in detail.

==Title==
The book's title refers to [[Indra's net]], a metaphorical object described in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] text of the ''[[Flower Garland Sutra]]''. Indra's net consists of an infinite array of gossamer strands and pearls. The frontispiece to ''Indra's Pearls'' quotes the following description:

:''In the glistening surface of each pearl are reflected all the other pearls ... In each reflection, again are reflected all the infinitely many other pearls, so that by this process, reflections of reflections continue without end.''

The allusion to Felix Klein's "vision" is a reference to Klein's early investigations of [[Schottky group]]s and hand-drawn plots of their limit sets. It also refers to Klein's wider vision of the connections between [[group theory]], symmetry and geometry - see [[Erlangen program]].

==Contents==
The contents of ''Indra's Pearls'' are as follows:

[[File:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Apollonian gasket]], which appears in Chapter 7.]]
*Chapter 1. ''The language of symmetry'' – an introduction to the mathematical concept of symmetry and its relation to geometric groups.
*Chapter 2. ''A delightful fiction'' – an introduction to [[complex number]]s and mappings of the complex plane and the [[Riemann sphere]].
*Chapter 3. ''Double spirals and Möbius maps'' – Möbius transformations and their classification.
*Chapter 4. ''The Schottky dance'' – pairs of Möbius maps which generate Schottky groups; plotting their [[limit set]]s using [[breadth-first search]]es.
*Chapter 5. ''Fractal dust and infinite words'' – Schottky limit sets regarded as [[fractal]]s; computer generation of these fractals using [[depth-first search]]es and [[iterated function system]]s.
*Chapter 6. ''Indra's necklace'' – the continuous limit sets generated when pairs of generating circles touch.
*Chapter 7. ''The glowing gasket'' – the Schottky group whose limit set is the [[Apollonian gasket]]; links to the [[modular group]].
*Chapter 8. ''Playing with parameters'' – parameterising Schottky groups with [[Parabola|parabolic]] [[commutator]] using two complex parameters; using these parameters to explore the [[Teichmüller space]] of Schottky groups.
*Chapter 9. ''Accidents will happen'' – introducing [[Maskit's slice]], parameterised by a single complex parameter; exploring the boundary between discrete and non-discrete groups.
*Chapter 10. ''Between the cracks'' – further exploration of the Maskit boundary between discrete and non-discrete groups in another slice of parameter space; identification and exploration of degenerate groups.
*Chapter 11. ''Crossing boundaries'' – ideas for further exploration, such as adding a third generator.
*Chapter 12. ''Epilogue'' – concluding overview of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[Teichmüller theory]].

==Importance==

''Indra's Pearls '' is unusual because it aims to give the reader a sense of the development of a real-life mathematical investigation, rather than just a formal presentation of the final results. It covers a broad span of topics, showing interconnections among [[geometry]], [[number theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[computer graphics]].  It shows how computers are used by contemporary mathematicians. It uses computer graphics, diagrams and cartoons to enhance its written explanations. In the authors' own words:

:''Our dream is that this book will reveal to our readers that mathematics is not alien and remote but just a very human exploration of the patterns of the world, one which thrives on play and surprise and beauty'' - ''Indra's Pearls'' p ''viii''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">'''Interactive Theorem Proving''' ('''ITP''') is an annual international [[academic conference]] on the topic of [[automated theorem proving]], [[proof assistant]]s and related topics, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in [[program verification]], [[security]], and [[Implementation of mathematics in set theory|formalization of mathematics]].

ITP brings together the communities using many systems based on higher-order logic such as [[ACL2]], [[Coq]], [[Mizar system|Mizar]], [[HOL (proof assistant)|HOL]], [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle]], [[NuPRL]], [[Prototype Verification System|PVS]], and [[Twelf]]. Individual workshops or meetings devoted to individual systems are usually held concurrently with the conference.

Together with [[Conference on Automated Deduction|CADE]] and [[TABLEAUX]], ITP is usually one of the three main conferences of the [[International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning]] (IJCAR) whenever it convenes,

==History==
The inaugural meeting of ITP was held on 11–14 July 2010 in Edinburgh, Scotland, as part of the [[Federated Logic Conference]]. It is the extension of the '''Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics''' ('''TPHOLs''') conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until 2009.  

The first three were informal users' meetings for the [[HOL theorem prover|HOL]] system and were the only ones without published papers. Since 1990 TPHOLs has published formal peer-reviewed proceedings, published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]'s [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] series. It has also entertained an increasingly wide field of interest.

The '''International Congress of Mathematicians''' ('''ICM''') is the largest conference for the topic of [[mathematics]]. It meets once every four years, hosted by the [[International Mathematical Union]] (IMU).

The [[Fields Medal]]s, the [[Nevanlinna Prize]], the [[Carl Friedrich Gauss Prize|Gauss Prize]], and the [[Chern Medal]] are awarded during the congress's opening ceremony. Each congress is memorialized by a printed set of [[Proceedings]] recording academic papers based on invited talks intended to be relevant to current topics of general interest. Being [[Invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians|invited to talk at the ICM]] has been called "the equivalent [...] of an induction to a hall of fame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Castelvecchi, Davide|title=The biggest mystery in mathematics: Shinichi Mochizuki and the impenetrable proof|journal=Nature|date=7 October 2015|volume=526|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-biggest-mystery-in-mathematics-shinichi-mochizuki-and-the-impenetrable-proof-1.18509|doi=10.1038/526178a|pages=178–181|pmid=26450038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1900 congress in Paris, France, [[David Hilbert]] announced his famous list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved mathematical problems]], now termed [[Hilbert's problems]]. [[Moritz Cantor]] and [[Vito Volterra]] gave the two plenary lectures at the start of the congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott, Charlotte Angas|authorlink=Charlotte Angas Scott|title=The International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris|journal=Bull.

At the 1904 ICM [[Gyula Kőnig]] delivered a lecture where he claimed that Cantor's famous [[continuum hypothesis]] was false. An error in Kőnig's proof was discovered by [[Ernst Zermelo]] soon thereafter. Kőnig's announcement at the congress caused considerable uproar, and Klein had to personally explain to the [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke of Baden]] (who was a financial sponsor of the congress) what could cause such an unrest among mathematicians.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt;

During the 1912 congress in [[Cambridge]], England, [[Edmund Landau]] listed four basic problems about [[prime number]]s, now called [[Landau's problems]]. The 1924 congress in Toronto was organized by [[John Charles Fields]], initiator of the [[Fields Medal]]; it included a roundtrip railway excursion to Vancouver and ferry to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].  The first two Fields Medals were awarded at the 1936 ICM in Oslo.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt;

In the aftermath of World War I, at the insistence of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], the 1920 ICM in Strasbourg and the 1924 ICM in Toronto excluded mathematicians from the countries formerly part of the [[Central Powers]]. This resulted in a still unresolved controversy as to whether to count the Strasbourg and Toronto congresses as true ICMs. At the opening of the 1932 ICM in Zürich, [[Hermann Weyl]] said: "We attend here to an extraordinary improbable event. For the number of ''n'', corresponding to the just opened International Congress of Mathematicians, we have the inequality 7 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 9; unfortunately our axiomatic foundations are not sufficient to give a more precise statement”.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt; As a consequence of this controversy, from the 1932 Zürich congress onward, the ICMs are not numbered.&lt;ref name="curbera"&gt;G.

For the 1950 ICM in Cambridge, Massachusetts, [[Laurent Schwartz]], one of the Fields Medalists for that year, and [[Jacques Hadamard]],  both of whom were viewed by the U.S. authorities as communist sympathizers, were only able to obtain U.S. visas after the personal intervention of President [[Harry Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Maz'ya, Tatyana Shaposhnikova.

The first woman to give an ICM plenary lecture, at the 1932 congress in Zürich, was [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; The second ICM plenary talk by a woman was delivered 58 years later, at the 1990 ICM in Kyoto, by [[Karen Uhlenbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Wiegand.

The 1998 congress was attended by 3,346 participants. The [[American Mathematical Society]] reported that more than 4,500 participants attended the 2006 conference in Madrid, Spain.  The King of Spain presided over the 2006 conference opening ceremony. The 2010 Congress took place in [[Hyderabad, India]], on August 19–27, 2010.

===ICMs and the International Mathematical Union===

The organizing committees of the early ICMs were formed in large part on an ''ad hoc'' basis and there was no single body continuously overseeing the ICMs. 
Following the end of [[World War I]], the Allied Powers established in 1919 in Brussels the International Research Council (IRC). At the IRC's instructions, in 1920 the ''Union Mathematique Internationale'' (UMI) was created.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt; This was the immediate predecessor of the current [[International Mathematical Union]].  Under the IRC's pressure, UMI reassigned the 1920 congress from Stockholm to Strasbourg and insisted on the rule which excluded from the congress mathematicians representing the former [[Central Powers]]. The exclusion rule, which also applied to the 1924 ICM, turned out to be quite unpopular among mathematicians from the U.S. and Great Britain. The 1924 ICM was originally scheduled to be held in New York, but had to be moved to Toronto after the [[American Mathematical Society]] withdrew its invitation to host the congress, in protest against the exclusion rule.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt; As a result of the exclusion rule and the protests it generated, the 1920 and the 1924 ICMs were considerably smaller than the previous ones.  In the run-up to the 1928 ICM in Bologna, IRC and UMI still insisted on applying the exclusion rule. In the face of the protests against the exclusion rule and the possibility of a boycott of the congress by the American Mathematical Society and the [[London Mathematical Society]], the congress's organizers decided to hold the 1928 ICM under the auspices of the University of Bologna rather than of the UMI.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt; The 1928 congress and all the subsequent congresses have been open for participation by mathematicians of all countries. 
The statutes of the UMI expired in 1931 and at the 1932 ICM in Zurich a decision to dissolve the UMI was made, largely in opposition to IRC's pressure on the UMI.&lt;ref name="curbera"/&gt;

At the 1950 ICM the participants voted to reconstitute the International Mathematical Union (IMU), which was formally established in 1951. Starting with the 1954 congress in Amsterdam, the ICMs are held under the auspices of the IMU.

===Soviet participation===

The [[Soviet Union]] sent 27 participants to the 1928 ICM in Bologna and 10 participants to the 1932 ICM in Zurich.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Guillermo Curbera.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Auf1a9WZlAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mathematicians+of+the+World,+Unite!&amp;ei=AGsyS6_ELYTWNMubrK0B&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Mathematicians of the World, Unite!: The International Congress of Mathematicians: A Human Endeavor''] AK Peters,  2009. {{isbn|1-56881-330-9}}; pp. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; No Soviet mathematicians participated in the 1936 ICM, although a number of invitations were extended to them.  At the 1950 ICM there were again no participants from the Soviet Union, although quite a few were invited. Similarly, no representatives of other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, except for Yugoslavia, participated in the 1950 congress. [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] had been appointed to the Fields Medal selection committee for the 1950 congress, but did not participate in the committee's work. However, in a famous episode, a few days before the end of the 1950 ICM, the congress' organizers received a telegram from [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov|Sergei Vavilov]], President of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]. The telegram thanked the organizers for inviting Soviet mathematicians but said that they are unable to attend "being very much occupied with their regular work", and wished success to the congress's participants.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Guillermo Curbera.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Auf1a9WZlAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mathematicians+of+the+World,+Unite!&amp;ei=AGsyS6_ELYTWNMubrK0B&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Mathematicians of the World, Unite!: The International Congress of Mathematicians: A Human Endeavor''] AK Peters,  2009. {{isbn|1-56881-330-9}}; pp 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vavilov's message was seen as a hopeful sign for the future ICMs and the situation improved further after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953. The Soviet Union was represented by five mathematicians at the 1954 ICM in Amsterdam, and several other Eastern Bloc countries sent their representatives as well. In 1957 the USSR joined the [[International Mathematical Union]] and the participation in subsequent ICMs by the Soviet and other Eastern Bloc scientists has been mostly at normal levels.&lt;ref name="C2"/&gt;
However, even after 1957, tensions between ICM organizers and the Soviet side persisted. Soviet mathematicians invited to attend the ICMs routinely experienced difficulties with obtaining exit visas from the Soviet Union and were often unable to come. Thus of the 41 invited speakers from the USSR for the 1974 ICM in Vancouver, only 20 actually arrived.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt; [[Grigory Margulis]], who was awarded the Fields Medal at 1978 ICM in Helsinki, was not granted an exit visa and was unable to attend the 1978 congress.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L1"/&gt;  Another, related, point of contention was the jurisdiction over Fields Medals for Soviet mathematicians. After 1978 the Soviet Union put forward a demand that the USSR Academy of Sciences approve all Soviet candidates for the [[Fields Medal]], before it was awarded to them.&lt;ref name="coleman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;Olli Lehto.

'''Ivar Hjalmar Jacobson''' (born 1939) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[computer scientist]] and [[software engineer]], known as major contributor to [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Objectory]], [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP), [[aspect-oriented software development]] and Essence. 

== Biography ==
Ivar Jacobson was born in [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] on September 2nd, 1939. He received his [[Masters degree|Master]] of [[Electrical Engineering]] degree at [[Chalmers University of Technology|Chalmers Institute of Technology]] in [[Gothenburg]] in 1962. After his work at Ericsson, he formalized the language and method he had been working on in his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1985 on the thesis Language Constructs for Large Real Time Systems.

After his master's degree, Jacobson joined Ericsson and worked in R&amp;D on computerized switching systems AKE &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericssonhistory.com/products/the-switches/AKE---an-electronic-dead-end/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE]] including [[PLEX (programming language)|PLEX]]. After his PhD thesis in April 1987, he started Objective Systems with Ericsson as a major customer. A majority stake of the company was acquired by Ericsson in 1991, and the company was renamed [[Objectory AB]]. Jacobson developed the software method Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) published 1992,  which was a simplified version of the commercial software process Objectory (short for Object Factory).

In October, 1995, Ericsson divested Objectory to [[Rational Software]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbmsmag.com/9610d11.html DBMS Interview - October 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509100459/http://www.dbmsmag.com/9610d11.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacobson started working with [[Grady Booch]] and [[James Rumbaugh]], known collectively as the Three Amigos.

When [[IBM]] bought Rational in 2003, Jacobson decided to leave, after he stayed on until May 2004 as an executive technical consultant.

In mid-2003 Jacobson formed Ivar Jacobson International (IJI) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivarjacobson.com]&lt;/ref&gt; which operates across three continents with offices in the UK, the US, Sweden, Switzerland, China, and Singapore.

== Work ==

=== Ericsson ===
In 1967 at Ericsson, Jacobson proposed the use of [[software component]]s in the new generation of [[software]] controlled [[telephone switch]]es [[Ericsson]] was developing. In doing this he invented [[sequence diagram]]s, and developed collaboration diagrams. He also used state transition diagrams to describe the message flows between components.

Jacobson saw a need for ''blueprints'' for software development. He was one of the original developers of the [[Specification and Design Language]] (SDL). In 1975, SDL became a standard in the telecoms industry.

At Objectory he also invented [[use case]]s as a way to specify functional software requirements.

=== Rational Software ===
At Rational, Jacobson and his friends, [[Grady Booch]] and [[James Rumbaugh]], designed the [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and his Objectory Process evolved to become the [[Rational Unified Process]] under the leadership of Philippe Kruchten.

=== Essential Unified Process ===
In November 2005, Jacobson announced the [[Essential Unified Process]] or “EssUP” for short. EssUP was a new “Practice” centric software development process that stood on the shoulders of modern but established software development practices. It was a fresh new start, integrating successful practices sourced from the three leading process camps: the unified process camp, the [[agile software development]] camp and the process improvement camp. Each one of them contributed different capabilities: structure, agility and process improvement.

Ivar has  described EssUP as a "super light and agile" RUP, and IJI have integrated EssUP into [[Microsoft]] [[Visual Studio Team System]] and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].

=== EssWork ===
Standing on the experience of EssUP Ivar and his team, in particular Ian Spence and Pan Wei Ng, developed EssWok starting in 2006.  EssWork is a framework for working with methods.  It is based on a kernel of universal elements always prevalent in software development endeavors.  On top of the kernel some fifteen practices have been defined.  A team can create their own method by composing practices.

=== SEMAT ===
In November 2009, Jacobson, [[Bertrand Meyer]] and [[Richard Soley]] ("the Troika") started an initiative called [[SEMAT]] (Software Engineering Method and Theory) to seek to develop a rigorous, theoretically sound basis for software engineering practice, and its wide adoption by industry and academia.  SEMAT has been inspired by the work at IJI, but it is a fresh new start.  It has resulted in [[Essence (OMG standard)|Essence]], which at the time of this writing has been recommended as an OMG standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1271">'''Jerzy Kazimierz Baksalary''' was a Polish [[mathematician]] who specialized in [[mathematical statistics]] and [[linear algebra]]. In 1990 he was appointed professor of mathematical sciences. He authored over 160 academic papers published and won one of the [[Ministry of National Education awards]].&lt;ref name=autonazwa1&gt;[http://www.uz.zgora.pl/wydawnictwo/miesiecznik04-2005/04.pdf Biografia w „Głosie Uczelnianym Uniwersytetu Zielonogórskiego”]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a graduate of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at the [[University of Adam Mickiewicz]] in [[Poznan]] (1969). In the years 1969-1988 he was associated with the Department of Mathematics of the University of Agriculture in Poznań. 
From 1996, he was the dean of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Technology at the [[Military University of WSP]], and after the WSP joined the [[Zielona Góra University of Technology]] and the emergence of the [[University of Zielona Góra]], he headed the Linear Algebra and Mathematical Statistics group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">'''Sir Joseph Littledale''' (1767 &amp;ndash; 26 June 1842) was a British judge.

==Life==
He was eldest son of Henry Littledale of Eton House, Lancashire, who was of a Cumberland family. He entered [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[Cambridge University]] in 1783 and was [[senior wrangler]] and 1st [[Smith's Prize|Smith's prizeman]] in 1787. He graduated B.A. in 1787 and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1790.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Littledale, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|id=LTLL783J|name=Littledale, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Littledale was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1786 but moved to [[Gray's Inn]] in 1793. He was [[called to the bar]] in 1798, and became a bencher in 1821.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt;

Littledale joined the northern circuit, and attended the Chester sessions. In 1813 he was appointed counsel to the University of Cambridge. He enjoyed a good practice. On 30 April 1824 he was appointed, in succession to [[William Best, 1st Baron Wynford|Mr. Justice Best]], to a judgeship of the [[King's Bench Division]], though beyond being appointed [[John Hullock]]'s colleague in managing the government prosecutions in Scotland in 1822 he had had little official recognition to that point. He took his seat on the first day of Easter term, 5 May 1824, and was knighted on 9 June.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He also became [[Serjeant-at-law]] at this point.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt;

Littledale resigned because of failing health on 31 January 1841. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]], but died shortly after at his house in Bedford Square on 26 June 1842. He left £250,000. He edited [[John Skelton]]'s ''Magnyfycence, an Interlude'' for the [[Roxburghe Club]] in 1821.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
On 26 February 1821 Littledale married Hannah Timberlake.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt;

His only daughter, Elizabeth, married Thomas Coventry, barrister-at-law.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">This is a '''list of exceptional set concepts'''. In [[mathematics]], and in particular in [[mathematical analysis]], it is very useful to be able to characterise [[subset]]s of a given set ''X'' as 'small', in some definite sense, or 'large' if their [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] in ''X'' is small. There are numerous concepts that have been introduced to study 'small' or 'exceptional' subsets. In the case of sets of [[natural number]]s, it is possible to define more than one concept of 'density', for example. See also [[list of properties of sets of reals]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9134">In [[graph theory]], '''Mac Lane's planarity criterion''' is a characterisation of [[planar graph]]s in terms of their [[cycle space]]s, named after [[Saunders Mac Lane]], who published it in 1937. It states that a finite [[undirected graph]] is planar if and only if 
the cycle space of the graph (taken modulo 2) has a [[cycle basis]] in which each edge of the graph participates in at most two basis vectors.

==Statement==
For any cycle {{mvar|c}} in a graph {{mvar|G}}, one can form an {{mvar|m}}-dimensional 0-1 vector that has a 1 in the coordinate positions corresponding to edges in {{mvar|c}} and a 0 in the remaining coordinate positions. The cycle space {{math|''C''(''G'')}} of the graph is the vector space formed by all possible linear combinations of vectors formed in this way. In Mac Lane's characterization, {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is a vector space over the [[finite field]] {{math|GF(2)}} with two elements; that is, in this vector space, vectors are added coordinatewise modulo two. A ''2-basis'' of {{mvar|G}} is a basis of {{math|''C''(''G'')}} with the property that, for each edge {{mvar|e}} in {{mvar|G}}, at most two basis vectors have nonzero coordinates in the position corresponding to {{mvar|e}}. Then, stated more formally, Mac Lane's characterization is that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that have a 2-basis.

==Existence of a 2-basis for planar graphs==
One direction of the characterisation states that every planar graph has a 2-basis. Such a basis may be found as the collection of boundaries of the bounded faces of a planar embedding of the given graph {{mvar|G}}.

If an edge is a bridge of {{mvar|G}}, it appears twice on a single face boundary and therefore has a zero coordinate in the corresponding vector. Thus, the only edges that have nonzero coordinates are the ones that separate two different faces; these edges appear either once (if one of the faces is the unbounded one) or twice in the collection of boundaries of bounded faces. It remains to prove that these cycles form a basis. One way to prove this by induction. As a base case, {{mvar|G}} is a tree, then it has no bounded faces and {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is zero-dimensional and has an empty basis. Otherwise, removing an edge from the unbounded face of {{mvar|G}} reduces both the dimension of the cycle space and the number of bounded faces by one and the induction follows.

Alternatively, it is possible to use [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] to show that the number of cycles in this collection equals the [[circuit rank]] of {{mvar|G}}, which is the dimension of the cycle space. Each nonempty subset of cycles has a vector sum that represents the boundary of the union of the bounded faces in the subset, which cannot be empty (the union includes at least one bounded face and excludes the unbounded face, so there must be some edges separating them). Therefore, there is no subset of cycles whose vectors sum to zero, which means that all the cycles are [[linear independence|linearly independent]]. As a linearly independent set of the same size as the dimension of the space, this collection of cycles must form a basis.

==Necessity of planarity when a 2-basis exists==
{{harvtxt|O'Neil|1973}} provided the following simple argument for the other direction of the characterization, based on [[Wagner's theorem]] characterizing the planar graphs by [[forbidden minor]]s. As O'Neill observes, the property of having a 2-basis is preserved under [[graph minor]]s: if one contracts an edge, the same contraction may be performed in the basis vectors, if one removes an edge that has a nonzero coordinate in a single basis vector, then that vector may be removed from the basis, and if one removes an edge that has a nonzero coordinate in two basis vectors, then those two vectors may be replaced by their sum (modulo two). Additionally, if {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is a cycle basis for any graph, then it must cover some edges exactly once, for otherwise its sum would be zero (impossible for a basis), and so {{math|''C''(''G'')}} can be augmented by one more cycle consisting of these singly-covered edges while preserving the property that every edge is covered at most twice.
However, the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} has no 2-basis: {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is six-dimensional, each nontrivial vector in  {{math|''C''(''G'')}} has nonzero coordinates for at least three edges, and so any augmented basis would have at least 21 nonzeros, exceeding the 20 nonzeros that would be allowed if each of the ten edges were nonzero in at most two basis vectors. By similar reasoning, the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;}} has no 2-basis: {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is four-dimensional, and each nontrivial vector in  {{math|''C''(''G'')}} has nonzero coordinates for at least four edges, so any augmented basis would have at least 20 nonzeros, exceeding the 18 nonzeros that would be allowed if each of the nine edges were nonzero in at most two basis vectors. Since the property of having a 2-basis is minor-closed and is not true of the two minor-minimal nonplanar graphs {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, it is also not true of any other nonplanar graph.

{{harvtxt|Lefschetz|1965}} provided another proof, based on [[algebraic topology]]. He uses a slightly different formulation of the planarity criterion, according to which a graph is planar if and only if it has a set of (not necessarily simple) cycles covering every edge exactly twice, such that the only nontrivial relation among these cycles in {{math|''C''(''G'')}} is that their sum be zero. If this is the case, then leaving any one of the cycles out produces a basis satisfying Mac Lane's formulation of the criterion. If a planar graph is embedded on a sphere, its face cycles clearly satisfy Lefschetz's property. Conversely, as Lefschetz shows, whenever a graph ''G'' has a set of cycles with this property, they necessarily form the face cycles of an embedding of the graph onto the sphere.

==Application==
{{harvtxt|Ja'Ja'|Simon|1982}} used Mac Lane's planarity criterion as part of a [[parallel algorithm]] for testing graph planarity and finding planar embeddings. Their algorithm partitions the graph into [[SPQR tree|triconnected components]], after which there is a unique planar embedding (up to the choice of the outer face) and the cycles in a 2-basis can be assumed to be all the [[peripheral cycle]]s of the graph. Ja'Ja' and Simon start with a fundamental cycle basis of the graph (a cycle basis generated from a [[spanning tree]] by forming a cycle for each possible combination of a path in the tree and an edge outside the tree) and transform it into a 2-basis of peripheral cycles. These cycles form the faces of a planar embedding of the given graph.

Mac Lane's planarity criterion allows the number of bounded face cycles in a planar graph to be counted easily, as the [[circuit rank]] of the graph. This property is used in defining the [[meshedness coefficient]] of the graph, a normalized variant of the number of bounded face cycles that is computed by dividing the circuit rank by {{math|2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5}}, the maximum possible number of bounded faces of a planar graph with the same vertex set {{harv|Buhl|Gautrais|Sole|Kuntz|2004}}.

=== Yield burning scandal ===
{{See also|Yield burning}}

In 1994, Lissack exposed a major yield burning scandal on [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="accuser"/&gt;  The issue was eventually settled by a number of firms for over $200 million,&lt;ref name=update&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E6DC123CF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 UPDATE/MICHAEL R. LISSACK; Wall Street Expatriate], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 14th, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; to which Lissack was entitled to at least 15% per federal whistleblower laws. Lissack used some of these funds for charitable purposes including endowing a professorship in social responsibility and personal ethics at his alma mater, [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iberkshires.com/story/35532/Four-Professors-at-Williams-College-Receive-Named-Chairs.html | title=Four Professors at Williams College Receive Named Chairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, Lissack entered into a voluntary agreement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] whereby he was banned from the securities industry for five years and paid a $30,000 fine,&lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/34-39687.htm | title=Michael Lissack: Admin.

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2):\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\},\  x_1,x_2\in\{0,1\}^{n'},\  2n'=n&lt;/math&gt;

Player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; does not know the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2. 

In other words, the players know the other's variables, but not their own. The minimum number of bits that must be communicated by the players to compute ''f'' is the [[communication complexity]] of ''f'', denoted by&amp;nbsp;''κ''(''f'').

Because of this property, sometimes this model is called "numbers on the forehead" model, since if the players were seated around a round table, each wearing their own input on the forehead, then every player would see all the others' input, except their own.

The formal definition is as follows: ''k'' players: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; intend to compute a Boolean function 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n):\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;

On set ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} of variables there is a fixed partition ''A'' of ''k'' classes ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows every variable, ''except'' those in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,2,...,''k''. The players have unlimited computational power, and they  communicate with the help of a blackboard, viewed by all players.

The aim is to compute ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), such  that at the end of the computation, every player knows this value. The cost of the computation is the number of bits written onto the blackboard for the given input ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and partition ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The cost of a multiparty protocol is the maximum number of bits communicated for any ''x'' from the set {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the given partition ''A''. The ''k''-party communication complexity, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''), of a
function ''f'', with respect to partition ''A'', is the minimum of costs of those ''k''-party protocols which compute ''f''. The ''k''-party symmetric communication complexity of ''f'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)=\max_AC^{(k)}_A(f) &lt;/math&gt;

where the maximum is taken over all ''k''-partitions of set ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Upper and lower bounds ==

For a general upper bound both for two and more players, let us suppose that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the smallest classes  of the partition ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can compute any Boolean function of ''S'' with |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 bits of communication: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; writes down the |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| bits of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the blackboard, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; reads it, and computes and announces the value ''f''(''x''). So, we can write:

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)\leq\bigg\lfloor{n\over k}\bigg\rfloor+1.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Order theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which investigates the intuitive notion of order using [[binary relation]]s. It provides a formal framework for describing statements such as "this is less than that" or "this precedes that". This article introduces the field and provides basic definitions. A list of order-theoretic terms can be found in the [[order theory glossary]].

== Background and motivation ==
Orders are everywhere in mathematics and related fields like [[computer science]]. The first order often discussed in [[primary school]] is the standard order on the [[natural numbers]] e.g. "2 is less than 3", "10 is greater than 5", or "Does Tom have fewer cookies than Sally?". This intuitive concept can be extended to orders on other sets of [[number]]s, such as the [[integer]]s and the [[real number|reals]]. The idea of being greater than or less than another number is one of the basic intuitions of [[number systems]] (compare with [[numeral systems]]) in general (although one usually is also interested in the actual [[Subtraction|difference]] of two numbers, which is not given by the order). Other familiar examples of orderings are the [[alphabetical order]] of words in a dictionary and the [[genealogy|genealogical]] property of [[lineal descent]] within a group of people.

The notion of order is very general, extending beyond contexts that have an immediate, intuitive feel of sequence or relative quantity. In other contexts orders may capture notions of containment or specialization. Abstractly, this type of order amounts to the [[subset|subset relation]], e.g., "[[Pediatricians]] are [[physicians]]," and "[[Circles]] are merely special-case [[ellipse]]s."

Some orders, like "less-than" on the natural numbers and alphabetical order on words, have a special property: each element can be ''compared'' to any other element, i.e. it is smaller (earlier) than, larger (later) than, or identical to. However, many other orders do not. Consider for example the subset order on a collection of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]: though the set of birds and the set of dogs are both subsets of the set of animals, neither the birds nor the dogs constitutes a subset of the other. Those orders like the "subset-of" relation for which there exist ''incomparable'' elements are called ''[[partial order]]s''; orders for which every pair of elements is comparable are ''[[total order]]s''.

Order theory captures the intuition of orders that arises from such examples in a general setting. This is achieved by specifying properties that a relation ≤ must have to be a mathematical order. This more abstract approach makes much sense, because one can derive numerous theorems in the general setting, without focusing on the details of any particular order. These insights can then be readily transferred to many less abstract applications.

Driven by the wide practical usage of orders, numerous special kinds of ordered sets have been defined, some of which have grown into mathematical fields of their own. In addition, order theory does not restrict itself to the various classes of ordering relations, but also considers appropriate [[function (mathematics)|functions]] between them. A simple example of an order theoretic property for functions comes from [[Functional analysis|analysis]] where [[Monotonic function|monotone]] functions are frequently found.

== Basic definitions ==
This section introduces ordered sets by building upon the concepts of [[set theory]], [[arithmetic]], and [[binary relation]]s.

=== Partially ordered sets ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Indifference curve]] --&gt;
Orders are special binary relations. Suppose that ''P'' is a set and that ≤ is a relation on ''P''. Then ≤ is a '''partial order''' if it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]], i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:

:''a'' ≤ ''a'' (reflexivity)
: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' then ''a'' = ''b'' (antisymmetry)
: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''c'' then ''a'' ≤ ''c'' (transitivity).

A set with a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] on it is called a '''partially ordered set''', '''poset''', or just an '''ordered set''' if the intended meaning is clear. By checking these properties, one immediately sees that the well-known orders on [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s and [[real number|reals]] are all orders in the above sense. However, they have the additional property of being '''[[total order|total]]''', i.e., for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''P'', we have that:

:''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''b'' ≤ ''a'' ([[Connex relation|connex property]]).

These orders can also be called '''linear orders''' or '''chains'''. While many classical orders are linear, the [[subset]] order on sets provides an example where this is not the case. Another example is given by the divisibility (or "''is-a-[[divisor|factor]]-of''") relation "|". For two natural numbers ''n'' and ''m'', we write ''n''|''m'' if ''n'' [[division (mathematics)|divides]] ''m'' without remainder. One easily sees that this yields a partial order.
The identity relation = on any set is also a partial order in which every two distinct elements are incomparable. It is also the only relation that is both a partial order and an [[equivalence relation]]. Many advanced properties of posets are interesting mainly for non-linear orders.

=== Visualizing a poset ===
[[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the set of all divisors of 60, partially ordered by divisibility]]
[[Hasse diagram]]s can visually represent the elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are [[graph drawing]]s where the [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are the elements of the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the [[graph theory|edges]] and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element ''x'' is smaller than (precedes) ''y'' then there exists a path from ''x'' to ''y'' that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the ''[[Divisor|divides]]'' relation).

Even some infinite sets can be diagrammed by superimposing an [[ellipsis]] (...) on a finite sub-order. This works well for the natural numbers, but it fails for the reals, where there is no immediate successor above 0; however, quite often one can obtain an intuition related to diagrams of a similar kind{{vague|date=January 2017}}.

=== Special elements within an order ===
In a partially ordered set there may be some elements that play a special role. The most basic example is given by the '''least element''' of a [[poset]]. For example, 1 is the [[least element]] of the positive integers and the [[empty set]] is the least set under the subset order. Formally, an element ''m'' is a least element if:

:  ''m'' ≤ ''a'', for all elements ''a'' of the order.

The notation 0 is frequently found for the least element, even when no numbers are concerned. However, in orders on sets of numbers, this notation might be inappropriate or ambiguous, since the number 0 is not always least. An example is given by the above divisibility order |, where 1 is the least element since it divides all other numbers. In contrast, 0 is the number that is divided by all other numbers. Hence it is the '''greatest element''' of the order.  Other frequent terms for the least and greatest elements is '''bottom''' and '''top''' or '''zero''' and '''unit'''.

Least and [[greatest element]]s may fail to exist, as the example of the real numbers shows. But if they exist, they are always unique. In contrast, consider the divisibility relation | on the set {2,3,4,5,6}. Although this set has neither top nor bottom, the elements 2, 3, and 5 have no elements below them, while 4, 5 and 6 have none above. Such elements are called '''minimal''' and '''maximal''', respectively. Formally, an element ''m'' is [[minimal element|minimal]] if:

: ''a'' ≤ ''m'' implies ''a'' = ''m'', for all elements ''a'' of the order.

Exchanging ≤ with ≥ yields the definition of [[maximal element|maximality]]. As the example shows, there can be many maximal elements and some elements may be both maximal and minimal (e.g. 5 above). However, if there is a least element, then it is the only minimal element of the order. Again, in infinite posets maximal elements do not always exist - the set of all ''finite'' subsets of a given infinite set, ordered by subset inclusion, provides one of many counterexamples. An important tool to ensure the existence of maximal elements under certain conditions is '''[[Zorn's Lemma]]'''.

Subsets of partially ordered sets inherit the order. We already applied this by considering the subset {2,3,4,5,6} of the natural numbers with the induced divisibility ordering. Now there are also elements of a poset that are special with respect to some subset of the order. This leads to the definition of '''[[upper bound]]s'''. Given a subset ''S'' of some poset ''P'', an upper bound of ''S'' is an element ''b'' of ''P'' that is above all elements of ''S''. Formally, this means that

: ''s'' ≤ ''b'', for all ''s'' in ''S''.

Lower bounds again are defined by inverting the order. For example, -5 is a lower bound of the natural numbers as a subset of the integers. Given a set of sets, an upper bound for these sets under the subset ordering is given by their [[union (set theory)|union]]. In fact, this upper bound is quite special: it is the smallest set that contains all of the sets. Hence, we have found the '''[[least upper bound]]''' of a set of sets. This concept is also called '''supremum''' or '''join''', and for a set ''S'' one writes sup(''S'') or &lt;math&gt;\bigvee S&lt;/math&gt; for its least upper bound. Conversely, the '''[[greatest lower bound]]''' is known as '''[[infimum]]''' or '''meet''' and denoted inf(''S'') or &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge S&lt;/math&gt;. These concepts play an important role in many applications of order theory. For two elements ''x'' and ''y'', one also writes &lt;math&gt;x\vee y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\wedge y&lt;/math&gt; for sup({''x'',''y''}) and inf({''x'',''y''}), respectively.

For example, 1 is the infimum of the positive integers as a subset of integers.

For another example, consider again the relation | on natural numbers. The least upper bound of two numbers is the smallest number that is divided by both of them, i.e. the [[least common multiple]] of the numbers. Greatest lower bounds in turn are given by the [[greatest common divisor]].

=== Duality ===
In the previous definitions, we often noted that a concept can be defined by just inverting the ordering in a former definition. This is the case for "least" and "greatest", for "minimal" and "maximal", for "upper bound" and "lower bound", and so on. This is a general situation in order theory: A given order can be inverted by just exchanging its direction, pictorially flipping the Hasse diagram top-down. This yields the so-called '''dual''', '''inverse''', or '''opposite order'''.

Every order theoretic definition has its dual: it is the notion one obtains by applying the definition to the inverse order. Since all concepts are symmetric, this operation preserves the theorems of partial orders. For a given mathematical result, one can just invert the order and replace all definitions by their duals and one obtains another valid theorem. This is important and useful, since one obtains two theorems for the price of one. Some more details and examples can be found in the article on [[duality (order theory)|duality in order theory]].

=== Constructing new orders ===
There are many ways to construct orders out of given orders. The dual order is one example. Another important construction is the [[cartesian product]] of two partially ordered sets, taken together with the [[product order]] on pairs of elements. The ordering is defined by (''a'', ''x'') ≤ (''b'', ''y'') if (and only if) ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''x'' ≤ ''y''. (Notice carefully that there are three distinct meanings for the relation symbol ≤ in this definition.) The [[disjoint union]] of two posets is another typical example of order construction, where the order is just the (disjoint) union of the original orders.

Every partial order ≤ gives rise to a so-called [[strict order]] &lt;, by defining ''a'' &lt; ''b'' if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and not ''b'' ≤ ''a''. This transformation can be inverted by setting ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if ''a'' &lt; ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b''. The two concepts are equivalent although in some circumstances one can be more convenient to work with than the other.

== Functions between orders ==
It is reasonable to consider functions between partially ordered sets having certain additional properties that are related to the ordering relations of the two sets. The most fundamental condition that occurs in this context is [[monotonic function|monotonicity]]. A function ''f'' from a poset ''P'' to a poset ''Q'' is '''monotone''', or '''order-preserving''', if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' in ''P'' implies ''f''(''a'') ≤ ''f''(''b'') in ''Q'' (Noting that, strictly, the two relations here are different since they apply to different sets.). The converse of this implication leads to functions that are '''order-reflecting''', i.e. functions ''f'' as above for which ''f''(''a'') ≤ ''f''(''b'') implies ''a'' ≤ ''b''. On the other hand, a function may also be '''order-reversing''' or '''antitone''', if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''f''(''b'') ≤ ''f''(''a'').

An '''[[order-embedding]]''' is a function ''f'' between orders that is both order-preserving and order-reflecting. Examples for these definitions are found easily. For instance, the function that maps a natural number to its successor is clearly monotone with respect to the natural order. Any function from a discrete order, i.e. from a set ordered by the identity order "=", is also monotone. Mapping each natural number to the corresponding real number gives an example for an order embedding. The [[complement (set theory)|set complement]] on a [[powerset]] is an example of an antitone function.

An important question is when two orders are "essentially equal", i.e. when they are the same up to renaming of elements. '''[[Order isomorphism]]s''' are functions that define such a renaming. An order-isomorphism is a monotone [[bijective]] function that has a monotone inverse. This is equivalent to being a [[surjective]] order-embedding. Hence, the image ''f''(''P'') of an order-embedding is always isomorphic to ''P'', which justifies the term "embedding".

A more elaborate type of functions is given by so-called '''[[Galois connection]]s'''. Monotone Galois connections can be viewed as a generalization of order-isomorphisms, since they constitute of a pair of two functions in converse directions, which are "not quite" inverse to each other, but that still have close relationships.

Another special type of self-maps on a poset are '''[[closure operator#Closure operators on partially ordered sets|closure operator]]s''', which are not only monotonic, but also [[idempotent]], i.e. ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''f''(''x'')), and '''[[Closure operator|extensive]]''' (or ''inflationary''), i.e. ''x'' ≤ ''f''(''x''). These have many applications in all kinds of "closures" that appear in mathematics.

Besides being compatible with the mere order relations, functions between posets may also behave well with respect to special elements and constructions. For example, when talking about posets with least element, it may seem reasonable to consider only monotonic functions that preserve this element, i.e. which map least elements to least elements. If binary infima ∧ exist, then a reasonable property might be to require that ''f''(''x'' ∧ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') ∧ ''f''(''y''), for all ''x'' and ''y''. All of these properties, and indeed many more, may be compiled under the label of [[limit-preserving function (order theory)|limit-preserving functions]].

Finally, one can invert the view, switching from ''functions of orders'' to ''orders of functions''. Indeed, the functions between two posets ''P'' and ''Q'' can be ordered via the [[pointwise order]]. For two functions ''f'' and ''g'', we have ''f'' ≤ ''g'' if ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''g''(''x'') for all elements ''x'' of ''P''. This occurs for example in [[domain theory]], where [[function space]]s play an important role.

== Special types of orders ==
Many of the structures that are studied in order theory employ order relations with further properties. In fact, even some relations that are not partial orders are of special interest. Mainly the concept of a [[preorder]] has to be mentioned. A preorder is a relation that is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily antisymmetric. Each preorder induces an [[equivalence relation]] between elements, where ''a'' is equivalent to ''b'', if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a''. Preorders can be turned into orders by identifying all elements that are equivalent with respect to this relation.

Several types of orders can be defined from numerical data on the items of the order: a [[total order]] results from attaching distinct real numbers to each item and using the numerical comparisons to order the items; instead, if distinct items are allowed to have equal numerical scores, one obtains a [[strict weak ordering]]. Requiring two scores to be separated by a fixed threshold before they may be compared leads to the concept of a [[semiorder]], while allowing the threshold to vary on a per-item basis produces an [[interval order]].

An additional simple but useful property leads to so-called '''[[Well-founded relation|well-founded]]''', for which all non-empty subsets have a minimal element.  Generalizing well-orders from linear to partial orders, a set is '''[[well partial order|well partially ordered]]''' if all its non-empty subsets have a finite number of minimal elements.

Many other types of orders arise when the existence of [[infimum|infima]] and [[supremum|suprema]] of certain sets is guaranteed. Focusing on this aspect, usually referred to as [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] of orders, one obtains:

* [[Bounded poset]]s, i.e. posets with a [[least element|least]] and [[greatest element]] (which are just the supremum and infimum of the [[empty subset]]),
* [[lattice (order)|Lattices]], in which every non-empty finite set has a supremum and infimum,
* [[Complete lattice]]s, where every set has a supremum and infimum, and
* [[Directed complete partial order]]s (dcpos), that guarantee the existence of suprema of all [[directed set|directed subsets]] and that are studied in [[domain theory]].
* [[Partial orders with complements]], or ''poc sets'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Martin A. |last=Roller |title=Poc sets, median algebras and group actions. An extended study of Dunwoody's construction and Sageev's theorem |date=1998 |publisher=Southampton Preprint Archive |url=http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/gan/Roller.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; are posets ''S'' having a unique bottom element ''0∈S'', along with an order-reversing involution, such that &lt;math&gt;a\leq a^{*} \Rightarrow a=0&lt;/math&gt;.

However, one can go even further: if all finite non-empty infima exist, then ∧ can be viewed as a total binary operation in the sense of [[universal algebra]]. Hence, in a lattice, two operations ∧ and ∨ are available, and one can define new properties by giving identities, such as

: ''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''z'') &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; (''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''z''), for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.

This condition is called '''distributivity''' and gives rise to [[distributive lattice]]s. There are some other important distributivity laws which are discussed in the article on [[distributivity (order theory)|distributivity in order theory]]. Some additional order structures that are often specified via algebraic operations and defining identities are

* [[Heyting algebra]]s and
* [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s,

which both introduce a new operation ~ called '''negation'''. Both structures play a role in [[mathematical logic]] and especially Boolean algebras have major applications in [[computer science]].
Finally, various structures in mathematics combine orders with even more algebraic operations, as in the case of [[quantale]]s, that allow for the definition of an addition operation.

Many other important properties of posets exist. For example, a poset is '''locally finite''' if every closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'', ''b''] in it is [[finite set|finite]]. Locally finite posets give rise to [[incidence algebra]]s which in turn can be used to define the [[Euler characteristic#Generalizations|Euler characteristic]] of finite bounded posets.

== Subsets of ordered sets ==
In an ordered set, one can define many types of special subsets based on the given order. A simple example are '''upper sets'''; i.e. sets that contain all elements that are above them in the order. Formally, the '''upper closure''' of a set ''S'' in a poset ''P'' is given by the set {''x'' in ''P'' | there is some ''y'' in ''S'' with ''y'' ≤ ''x''}. A set that is equal to its upper closure is called an upper set. '''Lower sets''' are defined dually.

More complicated lower subsets are [[ideal (order theory)|ideals]], which have the additional property that each two of their elements have an upper bound within the ideal. Their duals are given by [[filter (mathematics)|filters]]. A related concept is that of a [[directed set|directed subset]], which like an ideal contains upper bounds of finite subsets, but does not have to be a lower set. Furthermore, it is often generalized to preordered sets.

A subset which is - as a sub-poset - linearly ordered, is called a [[total order#Chains|chain]]. The opposite notion, the [[antichain]], is a subset that contains no two comparable elements; i.e. that is a discrete order.

== Related mathematical areas ==
Although most mathematical areas ''use'' orders in one or the other way, there are also a few theories that have relationships which go far beyond mere application. Together with their major points of contact with order theory, some of these are to be presented below.

=== Universal algebra ===
As already mentioned, the methods and formalisms of [[universal algebra]] are an important tool for many order theoretic considerations. Beside formalizing orders in terms of algebraic structures that satisfy certain identities, one can also establish other connections to algebra. An example is given by the correspondence between [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and [[Boolean ring]]s. Other issues are concerned with the existence of free constructions, such as ''free lattices'' based on a given set of generators. Furthermore, closure operators are important in the study of universal algebra.

=== Topology ===
In [[topology]], orders play a very prominent role. In fact, the set of [[open set]]s provides a classical example of a complete lattice, more precisely a complete [[Heyting algebra]] (or "'''frame'''" or "'''locale'''"). [[filter (mathematics)|Filters]] and [[net (mathematics)|nets]] are notions closely related to order theory and the [[closed set|closure operator of sets]] can be used to define topology. Beyond these relations, topology can be looked at solely in terms of the open set lattices, which leads to the study of [[pointless topology]]. Furthermore, a natural preorder of elements of the underlying set of a topology is given by the so-called [[specialization order]], that is actually a partial order if the topology is [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].

Conversely, in order theory, one often makes use of topological results. There are various ways to define subsets of an order which can be considered as open sets of a topology. Considering topologies on a poset (''X'', ≤) that in turn induce ≤ as their specialization order, the ''finest'' such topology is the [[Alexandrov topology]], given by taking all upper sets as opens. Conversely, the ''coarsest'' topology that induces the specialization order is the [[upper topology]], having the complements of [[ideal (order theory)|principal ideals]] (i.e. sets of the form {''y'' in ''X'' | ''y'' ≤ ''x''} for some ''x'') as a [[subbase]]. Additionally, a topology with specialization order ≤ may be [[order consistent]], meaning that their open sets are "inaccessible by directed suprema" (with respect to ≤). The finest order consistent topology is the [[Scott topology]], which is coarser than the Alexandrov topology. A third important topology in this spirit is the [[Lawson topology]]. There are close connections between these topologies and the concepts of order theory. For example, a function preserves directed suprema [[iff]] it is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] with respect to the Scott topology (for this reason this order theoretic property is also called [[Scott-continuous|Scott-continuity]]).

=== Category theory ===
The visualization of orders with [[Hasse diagram]]s has a straightforward generalization: instead of displaying lesser elements ''below'' greater ones, the direction of the order can also be depicted by giving directions to the edges of a graph. In this way, each order is seen to be equivalent to a [[directed acyclic graph]], where the nodes are the elements of the poset and there is a directed path from ''a'' to ''b'' if and only if ''a'' ≤ ''b''. Dropping the requirement of being acyclic, one can also obtain all preorders.

When equipped with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special [[category theory|categories]], where elements are objects and each set of morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a [[product (category theory)|categorical product]]. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a [[limit (category theory)|categorical limit]] (or ''colimit'', respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur is the concept of a (monotone) [[Galois connection]], which is just the same as a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s.

But category theory also has its impact on order theory on a larger scale. Classes of posets with appropriate functions as discussed above form interesting categories. Often one can also state constructions of orders, like the [[product order]], in terms of categories. Further insights result when categories of orders are found [[equivalence of categories|categorically equivalent]] to other categories, for example of topological spaces. This line of research leads to various ''representation theorems'', often collected under the label of [[Stone duality]].

==History==
As explained before, orders are ubiquitous in mathematics. However, earliest explicit mentionings of partial orders are probably to be found not before the 19th century. In this context the works of [[George Boole]] are of great importance. Moreover, works of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Ernst Schröder]] also consider concepts of order theory. Certainly, there are others to be named in this context and surely there exists more detailed material on the history of order theory. &lt;!-- ''Please contribute if any further knowledge is available to you.'' --&gt;

The term ''poset'' as an abbreviation for partially ordered set was coined by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] in the second edition of his influential book ''Lattice Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;Birkhoff 1948, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/p.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Marine [[diatom]]s are among the many [[plankton]]ic organisms that paradoxically appear to flout the [[competitive exclusion principle]].]]

In [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic biology]], the '''paradox of the plankton''' describes the situation in which a limited range of resources supports an unexpectedly wide range of [[plankton]] species, apparently flouting the [[competitive exclusion principle]] which holds that when two species compete for the same resource, one will be driven to extinction.

==Ecological paradox==

The [[paradox]] of the plankton results from the clash between the observed [[biodiversity|diversity]] of plankton and the [[competitive exclusion principle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G. | title = The Competitive Exclusion Principle | doi = 10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 | journal = Science | volume = 131 | issue = 3409 | pages = 1292–1297 | year = 1960 | pmid =  14399717| pmc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Gause's law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gause | first=G.

[[Phytoplankton]] life is diverse at all [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] levels despite the limited range of resources (e.g. light, nitrate, phosphate, silicic acid, iron) for which they compete amongst themselves.

The paradox of the plankton was originally described in 1961 by [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], who proposed that the paradox could be resolved by factors such as [[water column|vertical gradients]] of light or turbulence, [[symbiosis]] or [[commensalism]], differential [[predation]], or constantly changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G.

The Venus flytrap is a [[carnivorous plant]] that catches its prey with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if a second contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.

The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;&lt;ref name="PRS"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter H.|last1=Raven|first2=Ray Franklin|last2= Evert |first3=Susan E.|last3=Eichhorn|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th |publisher= W.H.

In [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''Poncelet–Steiner theorem''' is one of several results concerning [[compass and straightedge]] constructions with additional restrictions. This result states that whatever can be constructed by [[straightedge]] and [[compass (drafting)|compass]] together can be constructed by straightedge alone, provided that a single [[circle]] and its centre are given. This should be contrasted with the [[Mohr–Mascheroni theorem]], which states  that any compass and straightedge construction can be performed with only a compass.

It is not possible to construct everything that can be constructed with straightedge and compass with straightedge alone. and furthermore, if the centre of the circle is not given, it cannot be obtained by a straightedge alone.  Also, the entire circle is not required. In 1904, [[Francesco Severi]] proved that any small arc together with the centre will suffice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Retz|Keihn|1989|loc=p. 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the tenth century, the Persian mathematician [[Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani]] (940−998) considered geometric constructions using a straightedge and a compass with a fixed opening, a so-called ''rusty compass''. Constructions of this type appeared to have some practical significance as they were used by artists [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]] in Europe in the late fifteenth century. A new viewpoint developed in the mid sixteenth century when the size of the opening was considered fixed but arbitrary and the question of how many of Euclid's constructions could be obtained was paramount.&lt;ref name=Eves205&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance]] mathematician [[Lodovico Ferrari]], a student of [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in a "mathematical challenge" against [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] was able to show that "all of Euclid" (that is, the straightedge and compass constructions in the first six books of [[Euclid's Elements]]) could be accomplished with a straightedge and rusty compass. Within ten years additional sets of solutions were obtained by Cardano, Tartaglia and Tartaglia's student Benedetti. During the next century these solutions were generally forgotten until, in 1673, [[Georg Mohr]] published (anonymously and in Dutch) ''Euclidis Curiosi'' containing his own solutions. Mohr had only heard about the existence of the earlier results and this led him to work on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Retz|Keihn|1989|loc=p.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Showing that "all of Euclid" could be performed with straightedge and rusty compass is not the same as proving that ''all'' straightedge and compass constructions could be done with a straightedge and just a rusty compass. Such a proof would require the formalization of what a straightedge and compass could construct. This groundwork was provided by [[Jean Victor Poncelet]] in 1822. He also conjectured and suggested a possible proof that a straightedge and rusty compass would be equivalent to a straightedge and compass, and moreover, the rusty compass need only be used once! The result that a straightedge and single circle with given centre is equivalent to a straightedge and compass was proved by [[Jakob Steiner]] in 1833.&lt;ref name="Steiner1833"&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''proof without words''' is a [[mathematical proof|proof]] of an identity or mathematical statement which can be demonstrated as [[self-evident]] by a diagram without any accompanying explanatory text. Such proofs can be considered more elegant than more formal and [[rigour|mathematically rigorous]] proofs due to their self-evident nature.&lt;ref name="dunham120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunham|1994|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the diagram demonstrates a particular case of a general statement, to be a proof, it must be generalisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|title=Proof without Words|urlname=ProofwithoutWords}} Retrieved on 2008-6-20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Sum of odd numbers===
[[Image:Proofwithoutwords.svg|thumb|right|150px|A proof without words for the sum of odd numbers theorem.]]
The statement that the sum of all [[positive number|positive]] [[parity (mathematics)|odd numbers]] up to 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is a [[square number|perfect square]]&amp;mdash;more specifically, the perfect square ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mdash;can be demonstrated by a proof without words, as shown on the right.&lt;ref name="dunham121"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunham|1994|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first square is formed by 1 block; 1 is the first square. The next strip, made of white squares, shows how adding 3 more blocks makes another square: four. The next strip, made of black squares, shows how adding 5 more blocks makes the next square. This process can be continued indefinitely.

===Pythagorean theorem===
[[Image:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A proof without words for the Pythagorean theorem derived in [[Zhoubi Suanjing]].]]
The [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be proven without words as shown in the second diagram on left. The two different methods for determining the area of the large square give the relation 
: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;
between the sides. This proof is more subtle than the above, but still can be considered a proof without words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelsen|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jensen's inequality===
[[Image:Jensen graph.png|thumb|right|150px|A graphical proof of Jensen's inequality.]]
[[Jensen's inequality]] can also be proven graphically, as illustrated on the third diagram. The dashed curve along the ''X'' axis is the hypothetical distribution of ''X'', while the dashed curve along the ''Y'' axis is the corresponding distribution of ''Y'' values. Note that the convex mapping ''Y''(''X'') increasingly "stretches" the distribution for increasing values of ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jensen's Inequality|periodical=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=43|issue=8|year=1937|publisher=American Mathematical Society|page=527|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1937-06588-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''rCOS'''  stands for refinement of  [[Object (philosophy)|object]] and [[Software component|component]] systems. It is a [[formal method]] providing [[component-based]] [[model-driven software]] development.

==Overview==
rCOS was originally developed by [[He Jifeng]], [[Zhiming Liu (computer scientist)|Zhiming Liu]] and Xiaoshan Li at [[UNU-IIST]] in [[Macau]], and consists of a unified multi-view modeling notation with a theory of relational semantic and graph-based [[operational semantics]], a [[refinement calculus]] and tool support for model construction, model analysis and verification, and [[model transformation]]s. Model transformations automate refinement rules and design patterns and generate conditions as proof obligations.  rCOS support multiple dimensional modeling: models at different levels of abstraction related by refinement relations, hierarchy of compositions of components, and models of different views of the system ([[interaction protocol]]s of components, reactive behaviors of components, data functionality, and class structures and data types). Components are composed and integrated based on their models of interfaces to support third party composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |title=rCOS |work=[[UNU-IIST]] |publisher=[[Archive.org]] |date=2013 |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113133741/http://rcos.iist.unu.edu/ |archivedate=November 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA)''' is a semi-analytical method in [[computational electromagnetics]] that is most typically applied to solve scattering from periodic dielectric structures.  It is a Fourier-space method so devices and fields are represented as a sum of spatial harmonics.  

==Floquet's theorem==
The method is based on [[Floquet's theorem]] that the solutions of periodic differential equations can be expanded with Floquet functions (or sometimes referred as [[Bloch wave]], especially in [[solid-state physics]] community).  A device is divided into layers that are each uniform in the z direction.  A staircase approximation is needed for curved devices with properties such as dielectric permittivity graded along the z-direction.  The electromagnetic modes in each layer are calculated and analytically propagated through the layers.  The overall problem is solved by matching boundary conditions at each of the interfaces between the layers using a technique like scattering matrices.  To solve for the electromagnetic modes, which are decided by the wave vector of the incident plane wave, in periodic dielectric medium, the [[Maxwell's equations]] (in partial differential form) as well as the boundary conditions are expanded by the Floquet functions and turned into infinitely large algebraic equations. With the cutting off of higher order Floquet functions, depending on the accuracy and convergence speed one needs, the infinitely large algebraic equations become finite and thus solvable by computers.

==Fourier factorization==
Being a Fourier-space method it suffers several drawbacks.  [[Gibbs phenomenon]] is particularly severe for devices with high dielectric contrast.  Truncating the number of spatial harmonics can also slow convergence and techniques like fast Fourier factorization (FFF) should be used.  FFF is straightforward to implement for 1D gratings, but the community is still working on a straightforward approach for crossed grating devices.  The difficulty with FFF in crossed grating devices is that the field must be decomposed into parallel and perpendicular components at all of the interfaces.  This is not a straightforward calculation for arbitrarily shaped devices.

==Boundary conditions==
Boundary conditions must be enforced at the interfaces between all the layers.  When many layers are used, this becomes too large to solve simultaneously.  Instead, we borrow from network theory and calculate scattering matrices.  This lets us solve the boundary conditions one layer at a time.  Almost without exception, however, the scattering matrices implemented for RCWA are inefficient and do not follow long standing conventions in terms of how S11, S12, S21, and S22 are defined.  &lt;ref&gt;A paper was recently published that identified this problem and presented a correct and efficient formulation of scattering matrices for both RCWA and the method of lines.  See [http://www.jpier.org/PIERB/pierb35/13.11083107.pdf S-matrices]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other methods exist like the enhanced transmittance matrices (ETM), R matrices, H matrices, and probably more.  ETM, for example, is considerably faster but less memory efficient.

== Applications==
RCWA analysis applied to a polarized broadband reflectometry measurement is used within the [[Power semiconductor device|semiconductor power device]] industry as a measurement technique to obtain detailed profile information of periodic trench structures. This technique has been used to provide trench depth and critical dimension (CD) results comparable to cross-section SEM, while having the added benefit of being both high-throughput and non-destructive.

In order to extract critical dimensions of a trench structure (depth, CD, and sidewall angle), the measured polarized reflectance data must have a sufficiently large wavelength range and analyzed with a physically valid model (for example: RCWA in combination with the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials#Example 5: Complex Trench Structure|Forouhi-Bloomer Dispersion relations for ''n'' and ''k'']]). Studies have shown that the limited wavelength range of a standard reflectometer (375 - 750&amp;nbsp;nm) does not provide the sensitivity to accurately measure trench structures with small CD values (less than 200&amp;nbsp;nm). However, by using a reflectometer with the wavelength range extended from 190 - 1000&amp;nbsp;nm, it is possible to accurately measure these smaller structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=F.|last2=Roberts|first2=J.|last3=Huang|first3=J.|last4=Lam|first4=J.|last5=Forouhi|first5=A.R.|title=Effects of measured spectral range on accuracy and repeatability of OCD analysis|journal=Solid State Technology|date=July 2013|volume=56|issue=5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RCWA is also used to improve diffractive structures for high efficiency [[Solar cell|solar cells]]. For the simulation of the whole solar cell or [[Solar panel|solar module]], RCWA can be efficiently combined with the [[OPTOS formalism]].

'''Ron Eglash''' (born December 25, 1958 in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]) is an American who works in [[cybernetics]], professor of [[science and technology studies]] at the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and author widely known for his work in the field of [[ethnomathematics]], which aims to study the diverse relationships between mathematics and culture.

His research includes the use of [[fractal]] patterns in [[Architecture of Africa|African architecture]], [[African art|art]], and [[Religion in Africa|religion]], and the relationships between [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures and modern technology, such as that between [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultural and spiritual practices and [[cybernetics]].  He holds a bachelor's degree in [[cybernetics]] and a master's in [[systems engineering]] both at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and a Ph.D. in [[history of consciousness]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].  A [[Fulbright program|Fulbright fellowship]] enabled his postdoctoral field research on African ethnomathematics, which was later published in the book ''African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design''.

Dr. Eglash has also conducted studies in teaching children math and computing through simulations of indigenous and vernacular cultural practices. He explains that the simulations do not impose math externally, but rather translate the mathematical ideas already present in the cultural practices to their equivalent form in school-taught math.  Examples include transformational geometry in [[cornrow]] braiding, spiral arcs in graffiti, least common multiples in percussion rhythms, and analytic geometry in Native American beadwork.  His approach is one of many attempts to draw the inspiration to learn out of students' own cultural backgrounds.

He also studies social justice issues as they manifest in the practice of science and technology, ranging from the ethnic identity of “[[nerd]]s” to the so-called appropriation of science and technology by groups disempowered on the basis of race, class, gender.  Another branch of this research explores how the “bottom-up” egalitarian principles found in many indigenous cultures could be applied to modern society in fields from economics to political science.

He has served as a senior lecturer in comparative studies at [[Ohio State University]], and is currently a professor at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]].

However, as the participation of underrepresented minorities in science and technology emerges, the identity of the nerd is being redesigned so Black/Asian nerds are not viewed as making efforts to cultivate a White identity.

''''' SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[mathematics journal]] published quarterly by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM). The journal includes articles on pure and applied [[discrete mathematics]]. It was established in 1988, along with the ''[[SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications]]'', to replace the ''[[SIAM Journal on Algebraic and Discrete Methods]]''. The journal is indexed by ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. Its 2009 [[Mathematical Citation Quotient|MCQ]] was 0.57. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 0.755.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2017 |chapter=SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics |title=2016 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its official ISO abbreviation is ''SIAM J. Discrete Math.'', its publisher and contributors frequently use the shorter abbreviation ''SIDMA''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">In [[domain theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''Scott information system''' is a primitive kind of logical [[deductive system]] often used as an alternative way of presenting [[Scott domain]]s.

==Definition==
A '''Scott information system''', ''A'', is an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;(T, Con, \vdash) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T \mbox{ is a set of tokens (the basic units of information)} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con \subseteq \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mbox{ the finite subsets of T}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\vdash \subseteq (Con \setminus \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace)\times T&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } a \in X \in Con\mbox{ then }X \vdash a&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } X \vdash Y \mbox{ and }Y \vdash a \mbox{, then }X \vdash a&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \vdash a \mbox{ then } X \cup \{ a \} \in Con&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in T : \{ a\} \in Con&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \in Con \mbox{ and } X^\prime\, \subseteq X \mbox{ then }X^\prime \in Con.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;X \vdash Y&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in Y, X \vdash a.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
===Natural numbers===
The return value of a [[μ-recursive function|partial recursive function]], which either returns a natural number or goes into an infinite recursion, can be expressed as a simple Scott information system as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;T := \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ \empty \} \cup \{ \{ n \} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash a\mbox{ iff }a \in X.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the result can either be a natural number, represented by the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{n\}&lt;/math&gt;, or "infinite recursion," represented by &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;.

Of course, the same construction can be carried out with any other set instead of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Propositional calculus===
The [[propositional calculus]] gives us a very simple Scott information system as follows:

* &lt;math&gt;T := \{ \phi \mid \phi \mbox{ is satisfiable} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ X \in \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mid X \mbox{ is consistent} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash a\mbox{ iff }X \vdash a \mbox{ in the propositional calculus}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scott domains===
Let ''D'' be a [[Scott domain]]. Then we may define an information system as follows

* &lt;math&gt;T := D^0 &lt;/math&gt; the set of [[compact element]]s of D
* &lt;math&gt;Con := \{ X \in \mathcal{P}_f(T) \mid X \mbox{ has an upper bound} \}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;X \vdash d\mbox{ iff }d \sqsubseteq \bigsqcup X.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; be the mapping that takes us from a Scott domain, ''D'', to the information system defined above.

==Information systems and Scott domains==
Given an information system, &lt;math&gt;A = (T, Con, \vdash) &lt;/math&gt;, we can build a [[Scott domain]] as follows. 

* Definition: &lt;math&gt;x \subseteq T&lt;/math&gt; is a point iff
** &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \subseteq_f x \mbox{ then } X \in Con&lt;/math&gt;
** &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If }X \vdash a \mbox{ and } X \subseteq_f x \mbox{ then } a \in x.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of points of A with the subset ordering. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(A)&lt;/math&gt; will be a countably based Scott domain when T is countable. In general, for any Scott domain D and information system A
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{I}(D)) \cong D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{D}(A)) \cong A&lt;/math&gt;
where the second congruence is given by [[approximable mapping]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23940">The '''simply typed lambda calculus''' (&lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt;), a form
of [[type theory]], is a [[typed lambda calculus|typed interpretation]] of the [[lambda calculus]] with only one [[type constructor]]: &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; that builds [[function type]]s. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus.  The simply typed lambda calculus was originally introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1940 as an attempt to avoid paradoxical uses of the [[untyped lambda calculus]], and it exhibits many desirable and interesting properties.

The term ''simple type'' is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as [[cartesian product|products]], [[coproduct]]s or [[natural number]]s ([[Dialectica interpretation|System T]]) or even full [[recursion]] (like [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]]). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (like [[System F]]) or [[dependent type]]s (like the [[LF (logical framework)|Logical Framework]]) are not considered ''simply typed''.  The former, except full recursion, are still considered  ''simple'' because the [[Church encoding]]s of such structures can be done using only &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.

== Syntax ==

In this article, we use &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; to range over types. Informally, the ''function type'' &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; refers to the type of functions that, given an input of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, produce an output of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
By convention, &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; associates to the right: we read &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau\to\rho&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to(\tau\to\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

To define the types, we begin by fixing a set of ''base types'', &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. These are sometimes called ''atomic types'' or ''type constants''. With this fixed, the syntax of types is:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau ::= \tau \to \tau \mid T \quad \mathrm{where} \quad T \in B&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;B = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, generates an infinite set of types starting with &lt;math&gt;a,b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;a \to b,b\to b,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;b\to a,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; a \to (a \to a),\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;(b\to a) \to (a\to b), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

We also fix a set of ''term constants'' for the base types. For example, we might assume a base type &lt;tt&gt;nat&lt;/tt&gt;, and the term constants could be the natural numbers. In the original presentation, Church used only two base types: &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of propositions" and &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; for "the type of individuals". The type &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; has no term constants, whereas &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has one term constant. Frequently the calculus with only one base type, usually &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt;, is considered.

The syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus is essentially that of the lambda calculus itself.  We write &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; to denote that the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The term syntax, in BNF, is then:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.e \mid e \, e \mid c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a term constant.

That is, ''variable reference'', ''abstractions'', ''application'', and ''constant''.  A variable reference &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''bound'' if it is inside of an abstraction binding &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  A term is ''closed'' if there are no unbound variables.

Compare this to the syntax of untyped lambda calculus:

:&lt;math&gt;e ::= x \mid \lambda x.e \mid e \, e&lt;/math&gt;

We see that in typed lambda calculus every function (''abstraction'') must specify the type of its argument.

== Typing rules ==

To define the set of well typed lambda terms of a given type, we will define a typing relation between terms and types.  First, we introduce ''typing contexts'' or ''[[typing environment]]s'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,\Delta,\dots&lt;/math&gt;, which are sets of typing assumptions.  A ''typing assumption'' has the form &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, meaning &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''typing relation'' &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''well-typed'' (having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;).  Instances of the typing relation are called ''typing judgements''.  The validity of a typing judgement is shown by providing a ''typing derivation'', constructed using [[type rules|typing rules]] (wherein the premises above the line allow us to derive the conclusion below the line).  Simply-typed lambda calculus uses these rules:

{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x\mathbin{:}\sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; (1)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c\mathbin{:}T}}&lt;/math&gt; (2)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\mathbin{:}\tau}{\Gamma\vdash (\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e)\mathbin{:}(\sigma \to \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\mathbin{:}\sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\mathbin{:}\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2\mathbin{:}\tau}}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
|}

In words,
# If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the context, we know that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.
# Term constants have the appropriate base types.
# If, in a certain context with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; having type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then, in the same context without &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If, in a certain context, &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of closed terms, ''i.e.'' terms typable in the empty context, are:
*For every type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; (identity function/I-combinator),
*For types &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\tau&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau.x\mathbin{:}\sigma \to \tau \to \sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the K-combinator), and
*For types &lt;math&gt;\tau,\tau',\tau''&lt;/math&gt;, a term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'\to\tau''.\lambda y\mathbin{:}\tau\to\tau'.\lambda z\mathbin{:}\tau.x z (y z) : (\tau\to\tau'\to\tau'')\to(\tau\to\tau')\to\tau\to\tau''&lt;/math&gt; (the S-combinator).
These are the typed lambda calculus representations of the basic combinators of [[combinatory logic]].

Each type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is assigned an order, a number &lt;math&gt;o(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. For base types, &lt;math&gt;o(T)=0&lt;/math&gt;; for function types, &lt;math&gt;o(\sigma\to\tau)=\mbox{max}(o(\sigma)+1,o(\tau))&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, the order of a type measures the depth of the most left-nested arrow. Hence:

: &lt;math&gt;o(\iota \to \iota \to \iota) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;o((\iota \to \iota) \to \iota) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

== Semantics ==

=== Intrinsic vs. extrinsic interpretations ===

Broadly speaking, there are two different ways of assigning meaning to the simply typed lambda calculus, as to typed languages more generally, sometimes called ''intrinsic'' vs. ''extrinsic'', or ''[[Alonzo Church|Church]]-style'' vs. ''[[Haskell Curry|Curry]]-style''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| first = John | last = Reynolds | author-link=John_C._Reynolds
| publisher = Cambridge University Press
| location = Cambridge, England
| title=Theories of Programming Languages
| year=1998
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An intrinsic/Church-style semantics only assigns meaning to well-typed terms, or more precisely, assigns meaning directly to typing derivations.  This has the effect that terms differing only by type annotations can nonetheless be assigned different meanings.  For example, the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on integers and the identity term &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; on booleans may mean different things.  (The classic intended interpretations
are the identity function on integers and the identity function on boolean values.)
In contrast, an extrinsic/Curry-style semantics assigns meaning to terms regardless of typing, as they would be interpreted in an untyped language.  In this view, &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{int}.~x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\mathtt{bool}.~x&lt;/math&gt; mean the same thing (''i.e.'', the same thing as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;).

The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic semantics is sometimes associated with the presence or absence of annotations on lambda abstractions, but strictly speaking this usage is imprecise.  It is possible to define a Curry-style semantics on annotated terms simply by ignoring the types (''i.e.'', through [[type erasure]]), as it is possible to give a Church-style semantics on unannotated terms when the types can be deduced from context (''i.e.'', through [[type inference]]).  The essential difference between intrinsic and extrinsic approaches is just whether the typing rules are viewed as defining the language, or as a formalism for verifying properties of a more primitive underlying language.  Most of the different semantic interpretations discussed below can be seen through either a Church or Curry perspective.

=== Equational theory ===

The simply typed lambda calculus has the same [[equational theory]] of βη-equivalence as [[Untyped lambda calculus#Reduction|untyped lambda calculus]], but subject to type restrictions.  The equation for [[beta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t)\,u =_{\beta} t[x:=u]&lt;/math&gt;
holds in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma \vdash t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash u\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, while the equation for [[eta reduction]]
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda x\mathbin{:}\sigma.~t\,x =_\eta t&lt;/math&gt;
holds whenever &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t\!:\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not appear free in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Operational semantics ===

Likewise, the [[operational semantics]] of simply typed lambda calculus can be fixed as for the untyped lambda calculus, using [[call by name]], [[call by value]], or other [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]].  As for any typed language, [[type safety]] is a fundamental property of all of these evaluation strategies.  Additionally, the [[strong normalization]] property [[Simply typed lambda calculus#Important results|described below]] implies that any evaluation strategy will terminate on all simply typed terms.

=== Categorical semantics ===
The simply typed lambda calculus (with  &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence) is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs), as was first observed by [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]].  Given any specific CCC, the basic types of the corresponding lambda calculus are just the [[object (category theory)|objects]], and the terms are the [[morphism]]s. Conversely, every simply typed lambda calculus gives a CCC whose objects are the types, and morphisms are equivalence classes of terms.

To make the correspondence clear, a [[type constructor]] for the [[Cartesian product]] is typically added to the above.  To preserve the [[product (category theory)|categoricity of the Cartesian product]], one adds [[type rule]]s for ''pairing'', ''projection'', and a ''unit term''. Given two terms &lt;math&gt;s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the term &lt;math&gt;(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Likewise, if one has a term &lt;math&gt;u\mathbin{:}\tau_1\times\tau_2&lt;/math&gt;, then there are terms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(u)\mathbin{:}\tau_2&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\pi_i&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the projections of the Cartesian product. The ''unit term'', of type 1, is written as &lt;math&gt;()&lt;/math&gt; and vocalized as 'nil', is the [[final object]].  The equational theory is extended likewise, so that one has
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = s\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_2(s\mathbin{:}\sigma,t\mathbin{:}\tau) = t\mathbin{:}\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\pi_1(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau) , \pi_2(u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau)) =u\mathbin{:}\sigma\times\tau&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;t\mathbin{:}1 = ()&lt;/math&gt;
This last is read as "''if t has type 1, then it reduces to nil''".

The above can then be turned into a category by taking the types as the [[object (category theory)|objects]]. The [[morphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt; are [[equivalence class]]es of pairs &lt;math&gt;(x\mathbin{:}\sigma, t\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' is a variable (of type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;) and ''t'' is a term (of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;), having no free variables in it, except for (optionally) ''x''. Closure is obtained from [[currying]] and [[apply|application]], as usual.

More precisely, there exist [[functor]]s between the category of Cartesian closed categories, and the category of simply-typed lambda theories.

It is common to extend this case to [[closed monoidal category|closed symmetric monoidal categories]] by using a [[linear type system]]. The reason for this is that the CCC is a special case of the closed symmetric monoidal category, which is typically taken to be the [[category of sets]].  This is fine for laying the foundations of [[set theory]], but the more general [[topos]] seems to provide a superior foundation.

=== Proof-theoretic semantics ===

The simply typed lambda calculus is closely related to the implicational fragment of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e., [[minimal logic]], via the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]: terms correspond precisely to proofs in [[natural deduction]], and [[Type inhabitation|inhabited types]] are exactly the [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of minimal logic.

== Alternative syntaxes ==

The presentation given above is not the only way of defining the syntax of the simply typed lambda calculus.  One alternative is to remove type annotations entirely (so that the syntax is identical to the untyped lambda calculus), while ensuring that terms are well-typed via [[Hindley–Milner type inference]].  The inference algorithm is terminating, sound, and complete: whenever a term is typable, the algorithm computes its type.  More precisely, it computes the term's [[principal type]], since often an unannotated term (such as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~x&lt;/math&gt;) may have more than one type (&lt;math&gt;\mathtt{int} \to \mathtt{int}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{bool} \to \mathtt{bool}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., which are all instances of the principal type &lt;math&gt;\alpha \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

Another alternative presentation of simply typed lambda calculus is based on '''bidirectional type checking''', which requires more type annotations than Hindley–Milner inference but is easier to describe.  The [[type system]] is divided into two judgments, representing both ''checking'' and ''synthesis'', written &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; respectively.  Operationally, the three components &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are all ''inputs'' to the checking judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the synthesis judgment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash e \Rightarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; only takes &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; as inputs, producing the type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; as output.  These judgments are derived via the following rules:
{| align="center" cellpadding="9"
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{x\mathbin{:}\sigma \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x \Rightarrow \sigma} }&lt;/math&gt; [1]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{c \text{ is a constant of type } T}{\Gamma\vdash c \Rightarrow T}}&lt;/math&gt; [2]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma,x\mathbin{:}\sigma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash \lambda x.~e \Leftarrow \sigma \to \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [3]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e_1\Rightarrow \sigma\to\tau\quad\Gamma\vdash e_2\Leftarrow\sigma}{\Gamma\vdash e_1~e_2 \Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [4]
|-
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Rightarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash e\Leftarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [5]
| align="center" | &lt;math&gt;{\frac{\Gamma\vdash e \Leftarrow \tau}{\Gamma\vdash (e\mathbin{:}\tau)\Rightarrow \tau}}&lt;/math&gt; [6]
|}
Observe that rules [1]–[4] are nearly identical to rules (1)–(4) above, except for the careful choice of checking or synthesis judgments.  These choices can be explained like so:
# If &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is in the context, we can synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
# The types of term constants are fixed and can be synthesized.
# To check that &lt;math&gt;\lambda x.~e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; in some context, we extend the context with &lt;math&gt;x\mathbin{:}\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\sigma \to \tau&lt;/math&gt; (in some context), and &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (in the same context), then &lt;math&gt;e_1~e_2&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
Observe that the rules for synthesis are read top-to-bottom, whereas the rules for checking are read bottom-to-top.  Note in particular that we do '''not''' need any annotation on the lambda abstraction in rule [3], because the type of the bound variable can be deduced from the type at which we check the function. Finally, we explain rules [5] and [6] as follows:
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to synthesize type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; checks against type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, then the explicitly annotated term &lt;math&gt;(e\mathbin{:}\tau)&lt;/math&gt; synthesizes &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Because of these last two rules coercing between synthesis and checking, it is easy to see that any well-typed but unannotated term can be checked in the bidirectional system, so long as we insert "enough" type annotations.  And in fact, annotations are needed only at β-redexes.

== General observations ==

Given the standard semantics, the simply typed lambda calculus is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]: that is, well-typed terms always reduce to a value, i.e., a &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; abstraction.  This is because recursion is not allowed by the typing rules: it is impossible to find types for [[fixed-point combinator]]s and the looping term &lt;math&gt;\Omega = (\lambda x.~x~x) (\lambda x.~x~x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recursion can be added to the language by either having a special operator &lt;math&gt;\mathtt{fix}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;of type &lt;math&gt;(\alpha \to \alpha) \to \alpha&lt;/math&gt; or adding general [[recursive type]]s, though both eliminate strong normalization.

Since it is strongly normalising, it is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] whether or not a simply typed lambda calculus program halts: in fact, it ''always'' halts. We can therefore conclude that the language is ''not'' [[Turing complete]].

== Important results ==

* Tait showed in 1967 that &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-reduction is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. As a corollary &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]]. Statman showed in 1977 that the normalisation problem is not [[elementary recursive]], a proof which was later simplified by Mairson (1992). A purely semantic normalisation proof (see [[normalisation by evaluation]]) was given by Berger and Schwichtenberg in 1991.
* The [[unification (computing)|unification]] problem for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is undecidable. Huet showed in 1973 that 3rd order unification is undecidable and this was improved upon by Baxter in 1978 then by Goldfarb in 1981 by showing that 2nd order unification is already undecidable. A proof that higher order matching (unification where only one term contains existential variables) is decidable was announced by Colin Stirling in 2006, and a full proof was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stirling|first1=Colin|title=Decidability of higher-order matching|journal=Logical Methods in Computer Science|date=22 July 2009|volume=5|issue=3|pages=1–52|doi=10.2168/LMCS-5(3:2)2009|arxiv=0907.3804|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* We can encode [[natural number]]s by terms of the type &lt;math&gt;(o\to o)\to(o \to o)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Church numeral]]s). Schwichtenberg showed in 1976 that in &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; exactly the extended [[polynomial]]s are representable as functions over Church numerals; these are roughly the polynomials closed up under a conditional operator. 
* A ''full model'' of &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\to&lt;/math&gt; is given by interpreting base types as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and function types by the set-theoretic [[function space]]. Friedman showed in 1975 that this interpretation is [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] for &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence, if the base types are interpreted by infinite sets. Statman showed in 1983 that &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence is the maximal equivalence which is ''typically ambiguous'', i.e. closed under type substitutions (''Statman's Typical Ambiguity Theorem''). A corollary of this is that the ''finite model property'' holds, i.e. finite sets are sufficient to distinguish terms which are not identified by &lt;math&gt;\beta\eta&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence.
* Plotkin introduced logical relations in 1973 to characterize the elements of a model which are definable by lambda terms. In 1993 Jung and Tiuryn showed that a general form of logical relation (Kripke logical relations with varying arity) exactly characterizes lambda definability. Plotkin and Statman conjectured that it is decidable whether a given element of a model generated from finite sets is definable by a lambda term (''Plotkin–Statman conjecture''). The conjecture was shown to be false by Loader in 1993.

[[Image:SlashedZeros.svg|250px|thumb|right|Display of zero in three typefaces, from top to bottom: slashed zero, dotted zero, plain or open zero]]
The '''slashed zero''' is a representation of the number '[[0 (number)|0]]' (zero), with a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] through it. The slashed zero glyph is often used to distinguish the digit "zero" ("0") from the [[Latin script]] letter "[[O]]" anywhere that the distinction needs emphasis, particularly in [[encoding]] systems, scientific and engineering applications, [[computer programming]] (such as [[software development]]), and telecommunications. It thus helps to differentiate characters that would otherwise be [[homoglyph]]s. It was commonly used during the [[punched card]] era, when programs were typically written out by hand, to avoid ambiguity when the character was later typed on a [[card punch]].

Unlike in the [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] [[vowel]] '[[Ø]]' and the "[[empty set]]" symbol '[[∅]]', the slash of a slashed zero usually does not extend past the ellipse in most typographic designs. However, the slashed zero is sometimes [[typographic approximation|approximated]] by overlaying zero and slash characters, producing the character "&lt;span style="font-family:Code2000" class="Unicode"&gt;&lt;big&gt;0̸&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;". Some fonts make slashed zero look like "0/"

In [[character encoding]] terms, it has no explicit code point, but it is an alternate [[glyph]] (in addition to the open zero glyph) for the zero [[character (computing)|character]].

==Origins==
The slashed zero long predates computers, and is known to have been used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1928}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in many [[Baudot code|Baudot]] [[teleprinter]] applications, specifically the keytop and typepallet that combines "P" and slashed zero.&lt;ref&gt;"Teletype Printing Telegraph Systems, Keytops, and Typepallets", Bulletin 1164B, April 1958: 1-6, Teletype part number 99564(keytop)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the slashed zero is used in many [[ASCII]] graphic sets descended from the default typewheel on the [[Teletype Model 33]].&lt;ref&gt;Teletype Parts Bulletin 1184B pages 27 - 29 figure 29 - 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The slashed zero is used in a number of fields in order to avoid confusion with the letter 'O'. It is used by [[computer programmer]]s, in recording [[amateur radio]] call signs and in military radio, as logs of such contacts tend to contain both letters and numerals.

The slashed zero, sometimes called communications zero, was used on teleprinter circuits for weather applications.&lt;ref&gt;"Reference Data For Radio Engineers, Fifth Edition, Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc., 1970: 30-38 Table 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The slashed zero can be used in [[stoichiometry]] to avoid confusion with the symbol for [[oxygen]] (capital O).

Along with the [[Westminster (typeface)|Westminster]], [[MICR]], and [[OCR-A font]]s, the slashed zero became one of the things associated with [[hacker culture]] in the 1980s. Some cartoons depicted computer users talking in [[binary code]] with 1s and 0s using a ''slashed zero'' for the 0.

To generate a slashed zero on typewriters, typists would type a normal "O" or zero, backspace, and then hit the slash key to mark the zero.

The use of the slashed zero by many computer systems of the 1970s and 1980s inspired the 1980s [[space rock]] band [[Underground Zerø]] to use a [[heavy metal umlaut]] [[Scandinavian language|Scandinavian]] [[vowel]] ''[[ø]]'' in the band's name and as the band logo on all their album covers (see link below).

Slashed zeroes have been used in the [[Adobe Flash|Flash-based]] artwork of [[Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries]], notably in their 2003 work, Operation Nukorea. The reason for their use is unknown, but has been conjectured to be related to themes of 'negation, erasure, and absence'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metafilter.com/25220/That-gentle-piano-is-the-peace-of-the-grave#476182 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413043945/http://www.metafilter.com/25220/That-gentle-piano-is-the-peace-of-the-grave |date=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slashed zeroes can also be used on cheques in order to prevent fraud, for example: changing a 0 to an 8.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Representation in Unicode and HTML==
{{SpecialChars}}
The treatment of slashed zero as a [[glyph]] is supported by any font whose designer chose the option. Successful display on any local system depends on having the font available there, either via the system's font files or via [[font embedding]].

[[Unicode]] supports explicit slashed zero, but only via a pair of [[combining character]]s, not as a distinct single character (or ''[[code point]]'', in Unicode parlance). It is treated literally as "a zero that is slashed", and it is [[character encoding|coded]] as two characters: the commonplace zero and then the "combining long solidus overlay" &lt;code&gt;(U+0338)&lt;/code&gt;. These combining characters overlay the preceding character, creating a composite glyph.&lt;!-- BUT: That will make a mess if the zero is already slashed in the font. There is no way to specify an unslashed zero that can always be safely overprinted. Laying a slash over letter O also risks wrong appearance. --&gt;

When used in [[HTML]], use of such combining characters is valid but not yet supported by all current web browsers. They may be coded as &lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0&amp;amp;#x0338;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt; giving &lt;span style="font-family:Code2000" class="Unicode"&gt;&lt;big&gt;0&amp;#x0338;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

[[Unicode 9.0]] introduced another method to create a short diagonal stroked form of zero by utilizing the [[Variation Selector]] 1 (VS1) in the sequence U+0030 U+FE00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221025841/http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.txt |archivedate=21 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar symbols==
The ''slashed zero'' has the disadvantage that it can be confused with several other symbols:

==Variations==

===Dotted zero===
The zero with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on [[IBM 3270]] display controllers. The dotted zero may appear similar to the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[theta]] (particularly capital theta, Θ), but the two have different [[glyphs]]. In [[Raster graphics|raster]] fonts, the theta usually has a horizontal line connecting, or nearly touching, the sides of an O; while the dotted zero simply has a dot in the middle. However, on a low-definition display, such a form can be confused with a numeral 8. In some fonts the IPA letter for a bilabial click (ʘ) looks similar to the dotted zero.

Alternatively, the dot can become a vertical trace, for example by adding a "combining short vertical line overlay" &lt;code&gt;(U+20D3)&lt;/code&gt;. It may be coded as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0&amp;amp;#x20D3;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; giving &lt;span style="font-family:Code2000" class="Unicode"&gt;0⃓&lt;/span&gt;.

===Slashed 'O'===
[[IBM]] (and a few other early mainframe makers) used a convention in which the letter O had a slash and the digit 0 did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_Oct64.pdf "BASIC"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118030822/http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dartmouth/BASIC_Oct64.pdf |date=18 January 2016 }} 1964 document with many examples of this in the code.&lt;/ref&gt; This is even more problematic for [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Faroese people|Faroese]], and [[Norwegian people|Norwegians]] because it means two of their letters—the '''O''' and slashed O ('''[[Ø]]''')—are visually similar.

This was later flipped and most mainframe chain or band printers used the opposite convention (letter O printed as is, and digit zero printed with a slash '''[[Ø]]'''). This was the de facto standard from 70's to 90's. However current use of network laser printers that use PC style fonts  caused the demise of the slashed zero in most companies  - only a few configured laser printers to use '''[[Ø]].'''

===Short slash===
Use of the "combining short solidus overlay" &lt;code&gt;(U+0337)&lt;/code&gt; produces a result where the slash is contained within the zero. This may be coded as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;0&amp;amp;#x0337;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to yield 0&amp;#x0337;.

===Reversed slash===
Some [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]]/[[Unisys]] equipment displays a zero with a ''reversed'' slash, similar to the [[no symbol]], &lt;span class="Unicode"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8416;&lt;/span&gt;.

===Other===
[[Image:Deutsches Kfz-Kennzeichen für Behördenfahrzeuge (Nummernbereich 3).jpg|German license plate depicting diagonal gap|thumb|right]]
Yet another convention common on early line [[computer printer|printer]]s left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted [[Q]] (like U+213A [[℺]]) or [[cursive]] capital letter-O (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal O&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Bemer_1967"/&gt;

In the [[Fixedsys]] typeface, the numeral 0 has two internal barbs along the lines of the slash. This appears much like a white "S" within the black borders of the zero.

In the [[FE-Schrift]] typeface, used on [[vehicle registration plates of Germany|German car license plates]] because it is harder to alter, the zero is rectangular and has an "insinuated" slash: a diagonal crack just beneath the top right curve.

==Typefaces==

[[Typeface]]s commonly found on [[personal computers]] that use the slashed zero include:

* [[Terminal (typeface)|Terminal]] in [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows]] line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17619">In [[mathematics]], the '''Sturm sequence''' of a [[univariate polynomial]] {{mvar|p}} is a sequence of polynomials associated with {{mvar|p}} and its derivative by a variant of [[Euclid's algorithm for polynomials]]. '''Sturm's theorem''' expresses the number of distinct [[real number|real]] [[Root of a function|root]]s of {{mvar|p}} located in an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] in terms of the number of changes of signs of the values of the Sturm sequence at the bounds of the interval. Applied to the interval of all the real numbers, it gives the total number of real roots of {{mvar|p}}.&lt;ref name=bpr&gt;{{harv|Basu|Pollack|Roy|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] readily yields the overall number of [[complex number|complex]] roots, counted with [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]], it does not provide a procedure for calculating them. Sturm's theorem counts the number of distinct real roots and locates them in intervals. By subdividing the intervals containing some roots, it can isolate the roots into arbitrary small intervals, each containing exactly one root. This yields an arbitrary-precision numeric [[root-finding algorithm]] for univariate polynomials.

For computing over the [[real number|reals]], Sturm's theorem is less efficient than other methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]]. However, it works on every [[real closed field]], and, therefore, remains fundamental for the theoretical study of the [[computational complexity]] of [[decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers|decidability]] and [[quantifier elimination]] in the [[first order theory]] of real numbers.

The Sturm sequence and Sturm's theorem are named after [[Jacques Charles François Sturm]], who discovered the theorem in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Sturm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theorem==
The '''Sturm chain''' or '''Sturm sequence''' of a [[univariate polynomial]] {{math|''P''(''x'')}} with real coefficients is the sequence of polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_0, P_1, \ldots,&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_0&amp;=P,\\
P_1&amp;=P',\\
P_{i+1}&amp;=-\operatorname{rem}(P_{i-1},P_i),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|''i'' ≥ 1}}, where {{math|''P'{{void}}''}} is the [[derivative]] of {{mvar|P}}, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rem}(P_{i-1},P_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of the [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] of &lt;math&gt;P_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;P_i.&lt;/math&gt; The length of the Sturm sequence is at most the degree of {{mvar|P}}.

The number of [[sign variation]]s at {{mvar|ξ}} of the Sturm sequence of {{mvar|P}} is the number of sign changes–ignoring zeros—in the sequence of real numbers
:&lt;math&gt;P_0(\xi), P_1(\xi),P_2(\xi),\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;
This number of sign variations is denoted here {{math|''V''(''ξ'')}}. 

Sturm's theorem states that, if {{mvar|P}} is a [[square-free polynomial]],  the number of distinct real roots of {{mvar|P}} in the [[half-open interval]] {{math|(''a'', ''b'']}} is {{math|''V''(''a'') − ''V''(''b'')}} (here, {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers such that {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}).&lt;ref name="bpr" /&gt;

The theorem extends to unbounded intervals by defining the sign at {{math|+∞}} of a polynomial as the sign of its [[leading coefficient]] (that is, the coefficient of the term of highest degree). At {{math|–∞}} the sign of a polynomial is the sign of its leading coefficient for a polynomial of even degree, and the opposite sign for a polynomial of odd degree.

In the case of a non-square-free polynomial, if neither {{mvar|a}} nor {{mvar|b}} is a multiple root of {{mvar|p}}, then {{math|''V''(''a'') − ''V''(''b'')}} is the number of ''distinct'' real roots of {{mvar|P}}.

The proof of the theorem is as follows: when the value of {{mvar|x}} increases from {{mvar|a}} to {{mvar|b}}, it may pass through a zero of some &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; ({{math|''i'' &gt; 0}}); when this occurs, the number of sign variations of &lt;math&gt;(P_{i-1}, P_i, P_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt; does not changes. When {{mvar|x}} passes through a root of &lt;math&gt;P_0=P,&lt;/math&gt; the number of sign variations of &lt;math&gt;(P_0, P_1)&lt;/math&gt; decreases from 1 to 0. These are the only values of {{mvar|x}} where some sign may change.

==Example==
Suppose we wish to find the number of roots in some range for the polynomial &lt;math&gt;p(x)=x^4+x^3-x-1&lt;/math&gt;. So

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} p_0(x) &amp;=p(x)=x^4+x^3-x-1 \\
p_1(x)&amp;=p'(x)=4x^3+3x^2-1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{3}{16}x^2-\tfrac{3}{4}x-\tfrac{15}{16};&lt;/math&gt; multiplying it by {{math|−1}} we obtain 
:&lt;math&gt;p_2(x)=\tfrac{3}{16}x^2+\tfrac{3}{4}x+\tfrac{15}{16}&lt;/math&gt;.  
Next dividing {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and multiplying the remainder by {{math|−1}}, we obtain 
:&lt;math&gt;p_3(x)=-32x-64&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now dividing {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} by {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and multiplying the remainder by {{math|−1}}, we obtain 
:&lt;math&gt;p_4(x)=-\tfrac{3}{16}&lt;/math&gt;.
As this is a constant, this finishes the computation of the Sturm sequence.

To find the number of real roots between of &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; one has to evaluate the sequences of the signs of these polynomials at {{math|−∞}} and {{math|∞}}, which are respectively {{math|(+, −, +, +, −)}} and {{math|(+, +, +, −, −)}}. Thus
:&lt;math&gt;V(-\infty)-V(+\infty) = 3-1=2,&lt;/math&gt;
which shows that {{mvar|p}} has two real roots.

This can be verified by noting that {{math|''p''(''x'')}} can be factored as {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 1)}}, where the first factor  has the roots {{math|−1}} and {{math|1}}, and second factor has no real roots. This last assertion results from the [[quadratic formula]], and also from Sturm's theorem, which gives the sign sequences {{math|(+, –, –)}} at {{math|−∞}} and {{math|(+, +, –)}} at {{math|+∞}}.

==Generalization==
Sturm sequences have been generalized in two directions. To define each polynomial in the sequence, Sturm used the negative of the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] of the two preceding ones. The theorem remains true if one replaces the negative of the remainder by its product or quotient by a positive constant or the square of a polynomial. It is also useful (see below) to consider sequences where the second polynomial is not the derivative of the first one.

A ''generalized Sturm sequence'' is a finite sequence of polynomials with real coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;P_0, P_1, \dots, P_m&lt;/math&gt;
such that
* the degrees are decreasing after the first one: &lt;math&gt;\deg P_{i} &lt;\deg P_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; for {{math|1=''i'' = 2, ..., m}};
* &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; does not have any real root or does not changes of sign near its real roots.
* if {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''ξ'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|0 &lt; ''i'' &lt; ''m''}} and {{mvar|ξ}} a real number, then {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' −1 &lt;/sub&gt;(''ξ'') ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;(''ξ'') &lt; 0}}.

The last condition implies that two consecutive polynomials do not have any common real root. In particular
the original Sturm sequence is a generalized Sturm sequence, if (and only if) the polynomial has no multiple real root (if a polynomial has a multiple root, the two first polynomials of its Sturm sequence have a common toot). 

When computing the original Sturm sequence by Euclidean division, it may happen that one encounters a polynomial that has a factor that is never negative, such a &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x^2+1&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, if one continues the computation with the polynomial replaced by its quotient by the nonnegative factor, one gets a generalized Sturm sequence, which may also be used for computing the number of real roots, since the proof of Sturm's theorem still applies (because of the third condition). This may sometimes simplify the computation, although it is generally difficult to find such nonnegative factors, except for even powers of {{mvar|x}}.

==Use of pseudo-remainder sequences==
In [[computer algebra]], the polynomials that are considered have integer coefficients or may be transformed to have integer coefficients. The Sturm sequence of a polynomial with integer coefficients generally contains polynomials whose coefficients are not integers (see above example). 

To avoid computation with [[rational number]]s, a common method is to replace [[Euclidean division of polynomials|Euclidean division]] by [[pseudo-remainder|pseudo-division]] for computing [[polynomial greatest common divisor]]s. This amounts to replacing the remainder sequence of the [[Euclidean algorithm for polynomials|Euclidean algorithm]] by a [[pseudo-remainder sequence]], a pseudo remainder sequence being a sequence &lt;math&gt;p_0, \ldots, p_k&lt;/math&gt; of polynomials such that there are constants &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b_ip_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the remainder of the Euclidean division of &lt;math&gt;p_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p_i.&lt;/math&gt; For example, the remainder sequence of the Euclidean algorithm is a pseudo-remainder sequence with &lt;math&gt;a_i=b_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}}, and the Sturm sequence of a polynomial is a pseudo-remainder sequence with &lt;math&gt;a_i=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; for every {{mvar|i}}.

Various pseudo-remainder sequences have been designed for computing greatest common divisors of polynomials with integer coefficients without introducing denominators (see [[Pseudo-remainder sequence]]). They can all be made generalized Sturm sequences by choosing the sign of the &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the opposite of the sign of the &lt;math&gt;a_i.&lt;/math&gt; This allows the use of Sturm's theorem with pseudo-remainder sequences.

==Root isolation==

For a polynomial with real coefficients, ''root isolation'' consists of finding, for each real root, an interval that contains this root, and no other roots. 

This is useful for [[root-finding algorithm|root finding]], allowing the selection of the root to be found and providing a good starting point for fast numerical algorithms such as [[Newton's method]]; it is also useful for certifying the result, as if Newton's method converge outside the interval one may immediately deduce that it converges to the wrong root.

Root isolation is also useful for computing with [[algebraic numbers]]. For computing with algebraic numbers, a common method is to represent them as a pair of a polynomial to which the algebraic number is a root, and an isolation interval. For example &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; may be unambiguously represented by &lt;math&gt;(x^2-2, [0,2]).&lt;/math&gt;

Sturm's theorem provides a way for isolating real roots that is less efficient (for polynomials with integer coefficients) than other methods involving [[Descartes' rule of signs]]. However, it remains useful in some circumstances, mainly for theoretical purposes, for example for algorithms of [[real algebraic geometry]] that involve [[infinitesimal]]s.

For isolating the real roots, one starts from an interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b]&lt;/math&gt; containing all the real roots, or the roots of interest (often, typically in physical problems, only positive roots are interesting), and one computes &lt;math&gt;V(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V(b).&lt;/math&gt; For defining this starting interval, one may use bounds on the size of the roots (see {{slink|Properties of polynomial roots|Bounds on (complex) polynomial roots}}). Then, one divides this interval in two, by choosing {{mvar|c}} in the middle of &lt;math&gt;(a,b].&lt;/math&gt; The computation of &lt;math&gt;V(c)&lt;/math&gt; provides the number of real roots in &lt;math&gt;(a,c]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c,b],&lt;/math&gt; and one may repeat the same operation on each subinterval. When one encounters, during this process an interval that does not contain any root, it may be suppressed from the list of intervals to consider. When one encounters an interval containing exactly one root, one may stop dividing it, as it is an isolation interval. The process stops eventually, when only isolating intervals remain. 

This isolating process may be used with any method for computing the number of real roots in an interval. Theoretical [[complexity analysis]] and practical experiences show that methods based on [[Descartes' rule of signs]] are more efficient. It follows that, nowadays, Sturm sequences are rarely used for root isolation.

==Application==
Generalized Sturm sequences allow counting the roots of a polynomial where another polynomial is positive (or negative), without computing these root explicitly. If one knows an isolating interval for a root of the first polynomial, this allows also finding the sign of the second polynomial at this particular root of the first polynomial, without computing a better approximation of the root.

Let {{math|''P''(''x'')}} and {{math|''Q''(''x'')}} be two polynomials with real coefficients such that {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} have no common root and {{mvar|P}} has no multiple roots. In other words, {{mvar|P}} and {{math|''P'{{space|hair}}Q''}} are [[coprime|coprime polynomials]]. This restriction does not really affect the generality of what follows as [[polynomial greatest common divisor|GCD]] computations allows reducing the general case to this case, and the cost of the computation of a Sturm sequence is the same as that of a GCD. 

Let {{math|''W''(''a'')}} denote the number of sign variations at {{mvar|a}} of a generalized Sturm sequence starting from {{mvar|P}} and {{math|''P'{{space|hair}}Q''}}. If {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}} are two real numbers, then {{math|''W''(''a'') – ''W''(''b'')}} is the number of roots of {{mvar|P}} in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|''Q''(''a'') &gt; 0}} minus the number of roots in the same interval such that {{math|''Q''(''a'') &lt; 0}}. Combined with the total number of roots of {{mvar|P}} in the same interval given by Sturm's theorem, this gives the number of roots of {{mvar|P}} such that {{math|''Q''(''a'') &gt; 0}} and the number of roots of {{mvar|P}} such that {{math|''Q''(''a'') &lt; 0}}.&lt;ref name="bpr" /&gt;

'''''Synopsis of Pure Mathematics''''' is a book by [[G. S. Carr]], written in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics'' by G. S. Carr|journal=Science|date=25 May 1888|volume=XI|issue=277|page=251|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31822020652350;view=1up;seq=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book attempted to summarize the state of most of the basic mathematics known at the time.

The book is noteworthy because it was a major source of information for the legendary and self-taught mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] who managed to obtain a library loaned copy from a friend in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;''A to Z of mathematicians'' by Tucker McElroy 2005 {{isbn|0-8160-5338-3}} page 221&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening the genius of Ramanujan.&lt;ref name=papers &gt;''Collected papers of Srinivasa Ramanujan'' Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar, Godfrey Harold Hardy, P. Veṅkatesvara Seshu Aiyar 2000 {{isbn|0-8218-2076-1}} page xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr acknowledged the main sources of his book in its preface:

{{blockquote|... In the Algebra, Theory of Equations, and Trigonometry sections, I am largely indebted to [[Isaac Todhunter|Todhunter]]'s well-known treatises ...

In the section entitled Elementary Geometry, I have added to simpler propositions a selection of theorems from Townsend's Modern Geometry and [[George Salmon|Salmon]]'s Conic Sections.

In Geometric Conics, the line of demonstration followed agrees, in the main, with that adopted in Drew's treatise on the subject. ...

The account of the C. G. S. system given in the preliminary section, has been compiled from a valuable contribution on the subject by [[Joseph David Everett|Professor Everett]], of Belfast, published by the Physical Society of London. ...

In addition to the authors already named, the following treatises have been consulted—Algebras, by Wood, Bourdon, and Lefebvre de Fourey; Snowball's Trigonometry; Salmon's Higher Algebra; the geometrical exercises in Pott's Euclid; and Geometrical Conics by Taylor, Jackson, and Renshaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carr, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">In [[mathematics]], the '''van der Corput inequality''' is a [[corollary]] of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] that is useful in the study of [[correlation]]s among vectors, and hence [[random variable]]s.  It is also useful in the study of [[equidistributed sequence]]s, for example in the [[Weyl equidistribution estimate]].  Loosely stated, the van der Corput inequality asserts that if a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in an [[inner product space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is strongly correlated with many unit vectors &lt;math&gt;u_{1}, \dots, u_{n} \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then many of the pairs &lt;math&gt;u_{i}, u_{j}&lt;/math&gt; must be strongly correlated with each other.  Here, the notion of correlation is made precise by the [[inner product]] of the space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;:  when the [[absolute value]] of &lt;math&gt;\langle u, v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are considered to be strongly correlated.  (More generally, if the vectors involved are not unit vectors, then strong correlation means that &lt;math&gt;| \langle u, v \rangle | \approx \| u \| \| v \|&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Statement of the inequality==

Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a real or complex inner product space with inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and induced [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose that &lt;math&gt;v, u_1, \dots, u_n \in V&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\| v \| = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Then
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n} | \langle v, u_{i} \rangle | \right)^{2} \leq \sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} | \langle u_{i}, u_{j} \rangle | .&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the correlation heuristic mentioned above, if &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is strongly correlated with many unit vectors &lt;math&gt;u_1, \dots, u_n \in V&lt;/math&gt;, then the left-hand side of the inequality will be large, which then forces a significant proportion of the vectors &lt;math&gt;u_{i}&lt;/math&gt; to be strongly correlated with one another.

===Proof of the inequality===

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \langle v, u_{i} \rangle \right|^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left| \left\langle v, \sum_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i} \right\rangle \right|^{2}&lt;/math&gt; since the inner product is [[bilinear map|bilinear]]
:&lt;math&gt;\leq \| v \|^{2} \left\| \sum_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i} \right\|^{2}&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]
:&lt;math&gt;= \| v \|^{2} \left\langle \sum_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i}, \sum_{j = 1}^{n} u_{j} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; by the definition of the induced norm
:&lt;math&gt;= 1 \cdot \sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} \langle u_{i}, u_{j} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector, and the inner product is bilinear
:&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{i, j = 1}^{n} | \langle u_{i}, u_{j} \rangle | .&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9530">In [[abstract algebra]], an [[element (mathematics)|element]] {{math|''a''}} of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] {{math|''R''}} is called a '''left zero divisor''' if there exists a nonzero {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= [[N. Bourbaki]] |title=Algebra I, Chapters 1–3 |page=98 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or equivalently if the map from {{math|''R''}} to {{math|''R''}} that sends {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''ax''}} is not injective.{{efn|1=Since the map is not injective, we have {{math|1=''ax'' = ''ay''}}, in which {{math|''x''}} differs from {{math|''y''}}, and thus {{math|1=''a''(''x'' − ''y'') = 0}}.}}  Similarly, an [[element (mathematics)|element]] {{math|''a''}} of a ring is called a '''right zero divisor''' if there exists a nonzero {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|1=''ya'' = 0}}.  This is a partial case of [[divisibility (ring theory)|divisibility]] in rings.  An element that is a left or a right zero divisor is simply called a '''zero divisor'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Charles Lanski |year=2005 |title=Concepts in Abstract Algebra |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |page=342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An element&amp;nbsp;{{math|''a''}} that is both a left and a right zero divisor is called a '''two-sided zero divisor''' (the nonzero {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}} may be different from the nonzero {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|1=''ya'' = 0}}). If the [[commutative ring|ring is commutative]], then the left and right zero divisors are the same.

An element of a ring that is not a zero divisor is called '''regular''', or a '''non-zero-divisor'''.  A zero divisor that is nonzero is called a '''nonzero zero divisor''' or a '''nontrivial zero divisor'''. If there are no nontrivial zero divisors in {{math|''R''}}, then {{math|''R''}} is a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]].

== Examples ==
&lt;!-- It was valid, but nobody uses specifically Z×Z as a ring and hence, nobody cares about its zero divisors. In any way, generalized with the direct product example below. --&gt;
* In the [[modular arithmetic|ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;]], the residue class &lt;math&gt;\overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a zero divisor since &lt;math&gt;\overline{2} \times \overline{2}=\overline{4}=\overline{0}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The only zero divisor of the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of [[integer]]s is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A [[nilpotent]] element of a nonzero ring is always a two-sided zero divisor.
* An [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] &lt;math&gt;e\ne 1&lt;/math&gt; of a ring is always a two-sided zero divisor, since &lt;math&gt;e(1-e)=0=(1-e)e&lt;/math&gt;.
* Examples of zero divisors in the [[matrix ring|ring of &lt;math&gt;2\times 2&lt;/math&gt; matrices]] (over any [[zero ring|nonzero ring]]) are shown here:
*:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\2&amp;2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\-1&amp;-1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-2&amp;1\\-2&amp;1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1\\2&amp;2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;
*:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;0\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
*A [[product of rings|direct product]] of two or more [[zero ring|nonzero rings]] always has nonzero zero divisors.  For example, in &lt;math&gt;R_1 \times R_2&lt;/math&gt; with each &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; nonzero, &lt;math&gt;(1,0)(0,1) = (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; is a zero divisor.

===One-sided zero-divisor===
*Consider the ring of (formal) matrices &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x&amp;y\\0&amp;z\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x,z\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x&amp;y\\0&amp;z\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\0&amp;c\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}xa&amp;xb+yc\\0&amp;zc\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\0&amp;c\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x&amp;y\\0&amp;z\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}xa&amp;ya+zb\\0&amp;zc\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x\ne0\ne z&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x&amp;y\\0&amp;z\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a left zero divisor [[iff]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is even, since &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x&amp;y\\0&amp;z\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;1\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;x\\0&amp;0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;; and it is a right zero divisor iff &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is even for similar reasons. If either of &lt;math&gt;x,z&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then it is a two-sided zero-divisor.
*Here is another example of a ring with an element that is a zero divisor on one side only.  Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of integers &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)&lt;/math&gt;.  Take for the ring all [[additive map]]s from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, with [[pointwise]] addition and [[function composition|composition]] as the ring operations. (That is, our ring is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(S)&lt;/math&gt;, the '''[[endomorphism ring]]''' of the additive group &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.) Three examples of elements of this ring are the '''right shift''' &lt;math&gt;R(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(0,a_1,a_2,...)&lt;/math&gt;, the '''left shift''' &lt;math&gt;L(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(a_2,a_3,a_4,...)&lt;/math&gt;, and the '''projection map''' onto the first factor &lt;math&gt;P(a_1,a_2,a_3,...)=(a_1,0,0,...)&lt;/math&gt;.  All three of these [[additive map]]s are not zero, and the composites &lt;math&gt;LP&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;PR&lt;/math&gt; are both zero, so &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a left zero divisor and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a right zero divisor in the ring of additive maps from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  However, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is not a right zero divisor and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not a left zero divisor: the composite &lt;math&gt;LR&lt;/math&gt; is the identity. Note also that &lt;math&gt;RL&lt;/math&gt; is a two-sided zero-divisor since &lt;math&gt;RLP=0=PRL&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;LR=1&lt;/math&gt; is not in any direction.

== Non-examples ==

* The ring of integers [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] a [[prime number]] has no zero divisors other than 0.  Since every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], this ring is a [[finite field]].
* More generally, a [[division ring]] has no zero divisors except 0.
* A [[zero ring|nonzero]] [[commutative ring]] whose only zero divisor is 0 is called an [[integral domain]].

== Properties ==

* In the ring of {{mvar|n}}-by-{{mvar|n}} matrices over a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the left and right zero divisors coincide; they are precisely the [[singular matrix|singular matrices]]. In the ring of {{mvar|n}}-by-{{mvar|n}} matrices over an [[integral domain]], the zero divisors are precisely the matrices with [[determinant]] [[0 (number)|zero]].
* Left or right zero divisors can never be [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s, because if {{mvar|a}} is invertible and {{math|1=''ax'' = 0}}, then {{math|1=0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;0 = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''ax'' = ''x''}}, whereas {{math|''x''}} must be nonzero.

==Zero as a zero divisor==

There is no need for a separate convention regarding the case {{math|1=''a'' = 0}}, because the definition applies also in this case: 
* If {{math|''R''}} is a ring other than the [[zero ring]], then {{math|0}} is a (two-sided) zero divisor, because {{math|1=0 · 1 = 0}} and {{math|1=1 · 0 = 0}}.
* If {{math|''R''}} is the [[zero ring]], in which {{math|1=0 = 1}}, then {{math|0}} is not a zero divisor, because there is no ''nonzero'' element that when multiplied by {{math|0}} yields {{math|0}}.

Such properties are needed in order to make the following general statements true:
* In a nonzero commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, the set of non-zero-divisors is a [[multiplicative set]] in {{mvar|R}}.  (This, in turn, is important for the definition of the [[total quotient ring]].)  The same is true of the set of non-left-zero-divisors and the set of non-right-zero-divisors in an arbitrary ring, commutative or not.
* In a commutative Noetherian ring {{math|''R''}}, the set of zero divisors is the union of the [[associated prime|associated prime ideals]] of {{math|''R''}}.

Some references choose to exclude {{math|0}} as a zero divisor by convention, but then they must introduce exceptions in the two general statements just made.

==Zero divisor on a module==
Let {{mvar|R}} be a commutative ring, let {{mvar|M}} be an {{mvar|R}}-module, and let {{mvar|a}} be an element of {{mvar|R}}.  One says that {{mvar|a}} is '''{{mvar|M}}-regular''' if the multiplication by {{mvar|a}} map &lt;math&gt;M \stackrel{a}\to M&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and that {{mvar|a}} is a '''zero divisor on {{mvar|M}}''' otherwise.&lt;ref name=Matsumura-p12&gt;{{citation |author=[[Hideyuki Matsumura]] |year=1980 |title=Commutative algebra, 2nd edition |publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The set of {{mvar|M}}-regular elements is a [[multiplicative set]] in {{mvar|R}}.&lt;ref name=Matsumura-p12/&gt;

Specializing the definitions of "{{mvar|M}}-regular" and "zero divisor on {{mvar|M}}" to the case {{math|1=''M'' = ''R''}} recovers the definitions of "regular" and "zero divisor" given earlier in this article.
