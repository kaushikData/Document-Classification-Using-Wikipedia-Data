'''''Abracadabra''''' is an [[incantation]] used as a [[magic word]] in [[stage magic]] tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an [[amulet]].&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} - citation provided below --&gt;

==History==
[[File:Abracadabra triangle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Abracadabra written in a triangular form as represented in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'']] 
The first known mention of the word was in the third century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus]],&lt;ref name="Vollmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sammonicus|first=Quintus Serenus |authorlink=Serenus Sammonicus|title=Quinti Sereni Samonici De medicina praecepta salvberrima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y5FOAAAAYAAJ|year=1786|publisher=In bibliopolio I.G. Mülleriano|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physician]] to the [[Roman emperor]] [[Caracalla]], who in chapter 51 prescribed that [[malaria]] sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shah |first1=Sonia |title=The Tenacious Buzz of Malaria |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704111704575354911834340450 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html Bartleby] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135703/http://www.bartleby.com/61/21/A0022100.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power of the amulet, he explained, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Geta (emperor)|Geta]] and [[Severus Alexander]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.&lt;ref name="Vollmer" /&gt;

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] of the [[Basilideans|sect of Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found on [[Abraxas]] stones, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe. [https://archive.org/stream/journalofplagu00defo#page/38/mode/2up ''A Journal of the Plague Year'']. London, Dent, 1911 (1722)&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Aleister Crowley]] regarded it as possessing great power; he said its true form is [[abrahadabra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

'''Africana studies''', '''black studies''', '''African-American studies''' or '''Africology''',&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Africology/ Africology and You]", University of Milwaukee&lt;/ref&gt; in [[US education]], is the multidisciplinary study of the histories, politics and cultures of peoples of African origin in both [[Africa]] and the [[African diaspora]].

It is to be distinguished from [[African studies]], as its focus combines Africa and the [[African diaspora]] into a concept of an "African experience" with a [[Pan-African]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley, Claudine Michel, "Introduction," The Black Studies Reader. NY: Rutledge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, Africana studies and black studies are interchangeable terms stressing black studies in a global and comparative sense, whereas [[African-American studies]] frequently emphasizes the U.S. African-American experience. Programs of study range from interdepartmental programs to autonomous departments, and are offered from the undergraduate through the doctoral levels.  In many institutions, Africana studies research and study takes place in departments combining African and African-American studies.

Africana studies departments at many major universities grew out of the black studies programs and departments formed in the late 1960s in the context of the US [[Civil Rights Movement]], as black studies programs were reformed and renamed "Africana studies," with an aim to encompass the continent of Africa and all of the African diaspora using terminology rooted in geography and history rather than race. The first "Africana" studies department was formed after the [[History of Cornell University#Willard Straight Hall Takeover|Willard Straight Hall takeover]] at Cornell University, an Ivy League School located in Ithaca, New York.

The African-American historian and emeritus professor from this department, Robert L. Harris, offers a useful definition of the field in Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley and Claudine Michel's anthology ''The Black Studies Reader'':  "Africana Studies is the multidisciplinary analysis of the lives and thought of people of African ancestry on the African continent and throughout the world. It embraces Africa, Afro-America, and the Caribbean, but does not confine itself to those three geographical areas. Africana studies examines people of African ancestry wherever they may be found—for example, in Central and South America, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its primary means of organization are racial and cultural. Many of the themes of Africana studies are derived from the historical position of African peoples in relation to Western societies and in the dynamics of slavery, oppression, colonization, imperialism, emancipation, self-determination, liberation, and socioeconomic and political development."  
Thus, it can be described{{by whom|date=September 2011}} as a "scholarship of compromise and acquiescence", contrasting with the historical black studies which were motivated by the struggle for civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Delores P. Aldridge, Carlene Young, ''Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies'', Lexington Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7391-0547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Robert l. Harris Jr, "The Intellectual and Institutional Development of Africana Studies", in Jacqueline Bobo, Cynthia Hudley, Claudine Michel, ''The Black Studies Reader'', p. 15. {{ISBN|0-415-94554-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A specific aim and objective of this interdisciplinary field of study is to help students broaden their knowledge of the worldwide human experience by presenting an aspect of that experience—the Black Experience—which has traditionally been neglected or distorted by educational institutions. Additionally, this course of study strives to introduce an Afro-centric perspective including phenomena related to the culture.
According to Robert Harris Jr, an emeritus professor of history at the Africana Studies Research Center at Cornell,  there have been four stages in the development of Africana studies: from the 1890s until the Second World War numerous organizations developed to analyze the culture and history of [[African peoples]] ([[African studies]]). In the second stage the focus turned to [[African American]]s ([[Afro-American studies]]). In the third stage a bevy of newly conceived academic programs were established as Black studies.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;

Unlike the other stages, Black studies grew out of mass rebellions of black college students and faculty in search of a scholarship of change. The fourth stage, the new name "Africana studies" involved a theoretical elaboration of the discipline of black studies according to African cultural reclamation and disparate tenets in the historical and cultural issues of Africanity within a professorial interpretation of the interactions between these fields and college administrations.&lt;ref name="harris"/&gt;

Thus Africana studies reflected the mellowing and institutionalization of the black studies movement in the course of its integration into the mainstream academic curriculum. Black studies and Africana studies differ primarily in that Africana studies focuses on Africanity and the historical and cultural issues of Africa and its descendants while Black studies was designed to deal with the uplift and development of the black (African-American)community in relationship to education and its "relevance" to the black community. The adaptation of the term "Africana studies" appears to have derived from the encyclopedia work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Carter G. Woodson. [[James Turner (academic)|James Turner]], who was recruited from graduate school at Northwestern on the heels of the student rebellions of 1969, first used the term to describe a global approach to Black studies and name the "Africana Studies and Research Center" at Cornell, where he acted as the founding director.&lt;ref name="fenderson"&gt;Jonathan Fenderson, "The Black Studies Tradition and the Mappings of Our Common Intellectual Project", in ''Western Journal of Black Studies'', Volume 33, No. 1 (2009), pp. 46-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Studia Africana'', subtitled "An International Journal of Africana Studies" was published by the Department for African American Studies at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in a single issue in 1977 (an unrelated journal called ''Studia Africana'' is published by the Centro de Estudios Africanos, [[Barcelona]], since 1990).
The ''[[International Journal of Africana Studies]]'' (ISSN 1056-8689) has been appearing since 1992, published by the [[National Council for Black Studies]].

The '''''America House''''' (Amerika Haus, plural: Amerika Häuser) is an institution developed following the end of the [[Second World War]] to provide an opportunity for German and Austrian citizens to learn more about American culture and politics, and engage in discussion and debate on the transatlantic relationship. Run by the American government until 2006, Amerika Häuser were located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Berlin]], [[Heidelberg]], [[Munich]], [[Vienna]] and other cities. During the [[Vietnam War]], German student protests in Berlin often took place in front of the America Haus.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Dorothée Schmid, [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/geschichte/Amerikahaus;art15504,2560833 "Es war einmal im Amerikahaus"] ''Der Tagesspiegel'' (September 29, 2008) {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aristeia''' or '''aristia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ᵻ|ˈ|s|t|iː|ə}}; {{lang-grc|ἀριστεία}} {{IPA-el|aristěːaː|}}, ''"excellence"'') is a scene in the dramatic conventions of epic poetry as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', where a [[hero]] in battle has his finest moments (''aristos'' = "best"). An aristeia can result in the death of the hero at the aristeia's end.

==Examples==
One of the most prototypical examples of ''aristeia'' is in ''Book 21'' of the Iliad when [[Achilles]] almost single-handedly routs the [[Troy|Trojan]] army. This  includes his chase of [[Hector]] around [[Troy]]; Achilles eventually succeeds in killing him and dragging his corpse around the city.&lt;ref name=Iliad&gt;{{cite book|last=Homer|title=The Iliad|year=800 BC|page=Book XXI|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.21.xxi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of this phenomenon in the ''Iliad'' are found in [[Diomedes]]' performance in battle while empowered by [[Athena]] (''Book V''), [[Hector]]'s leading of the Trojan assault on the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaian]] camp in ''Book VIII'' (with the help of [[Zeus]]), [[Agamemnon]]'s aristeia in Book XI where he's on such a rampage that Zeus himself has to warn Hector against meeting him in battle, as well as [[Patroclus]]' aristeia in ''Book XVI'', which ultimately leads to his demise at the hands of [[Hector]]. In ''Book XXII'' of the [[Odyssey]], Greek hero [[Odysseus]] slaughters all of the suitors in his palace in another homeric display of martial excellence.
It is also seen, to some extent, in the [[Aeneid]], when [[Nisus and Euryalus]] leave the Trojan defenses to slaughter the Latin captains while they sleep. It also features in ''Book X'', when [[Mezentius]] takes the place of [[Turnus]] and strikes down all in his path: it draws upon homeric models, using a [[simile]].

'''Australia traditional storytelling''', handed down from generation to generation, has always been part of the landscape. Since the beginning of time (the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]) storytelling played a vital role in Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] culture, one of the world's oldest cultures. Aboriginal children were told stories from a very early age; stories that helped them understand the air, the land, the universe, their people, their culture and their history. Elders told stories of their journeys and their accomplishments. As the children grew into adults they took on the responsibility of passing on the stories. These stories are as much a cultural necessity as they are entertainment and are still passed on orally though many are now recorded in print, audio and video

==Aboriginal Australian storytelling==
The [[Songlines]], also called Dreaming tracks, were a form of Indigenous storytelling that brought about understanding of the landscape. They told stories about the path of a creator-spirit during the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]]. There is a large collection of stories from the [[Dreamtime|Aboriginal Dreamtime]] that form a large part of Australian storytelling history. These include stories about the [[Bunyip]].

==New stories==
These [[European Australian|Europeans]] who came to the continent in the form of [[convicts]], soldiers and [[settlers]] brought their own stories which were passed around Britain's new [[penal colony]] orally. For the 150 000 convicts who were transported to Australia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries stories were essential. They had been harshly, and often unjustly, treated and [[exiled]] with no hope of returning to the land of their birth. It is through stories that we create culture. The convicts, most of whom were from the labouring classes of England, [[Wales]] and Ireland, needed to recreate their culture in an alien environment. While the stories they brought with them offered comfort during the desperate loneliness of isolation they also needed to forget the country that had forsaken them. So by the 1820s the songs and stories the convicts brought from the British Isles had begun to merge with the stories of their new land as they went about recreating their lives and their culture. 
 
An anti-authoritarian attitude emerged in their new culture which was often reflected in their stories. Some of the pain of abandonment was eased through the sharing of stories about [[bushrangers]] who dared to rob the rich and flout authority. One such bushranger was [[Ned Kelly]] who became a hero of the people and a legend in life and death. His is still one of the best known Australian stories.

Later, the [[prospectors]] who flooded Australian [[gold mining|goldfields]] during the 1800s brought with them the stories they heard on the American goldfields. These stories soon took on an Australian flavour and became part of the country's [[folklore]]. Other stories, uniquely Australian, also sprang from the goldfields. One such story is the story of the [[Eureka Stockade]]—a miners' uprising on the [[Ballarat]] goldfields in 1854—said to be the start of democracy in Australia. New developments brought new stories; stories of [[Settler|pioneers]] who survived harsh conditions, stories of [[Exploration|explorers]] such as [[Burke and Wills]] and stories of tragic [[shipwrecks]]. Events reported in newspapers were shared orally, and no doubt embellished.

==20th-century stories==
The [[Great Depression|Depression]] years of the 1930s brought the [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] storyteller;the [[swagmen]] who carried the stories across the vast [[continent]] as they walked from town to town looking for work. Many of the swaggies became practised oral storytellers as, night after night, they camped on riverbanks and yarned by the fire. Well-known Australian storyteller Nell Bell remembers "my grandfather telling me about his mates, fencing contractors in northwest [[NSW]], and my grandmother as she churned, telling me tales of [[leprechauns]] and willy willies. There were the Chinese market gardens at the top of the street with tales of emperors and peacocks; the tramp who lived under the bridge and told me tale after tale and the metho [methylated spirits] drinker with tales of [[United States|America]] and the [[Outback]]. These were real folks, a purely Australian tradition." 

One of the itinerant storytellers from the depression years was [[Henry Lawson]], who was born on the goldfields—the son of a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] seaman. He roamed the bush with the [[swagmen]]. Fame, though not fortune, came to him through his poems and short stories and when he died in 1922 he was honoured with a state funeral.

Many Australian stories, such as Lawson's "The Drover's Wife", developed in the distant and harsh conditions of the Australian bush where men and women would "wonder and fear". Sharing stories helped ease loneliness and homesickness, brought back memories of comfortable times and places and generated a feeling of togetherness against the wild unknown. The stories were told around the fire while the billy boiled; the fire and the stories combining to offer a feeling of security.

The war years (1914–18 and 1939–45) added another dimension to Australian [[Folklore|folktales]]. New heroes began to emerge. From the [[First World War]] emerged the [[Anzacs]] and the story of [[Simpson and his donkey]], and Sister [[Vivian Bullwinkel]] to name just a few. 

After [[World War II]] the [[Jewish]] refugees from Eastern Europe and many other different ethnic groups have each added rich dimensions to Australian [[storytelling]]. Post-war affluence brought new mediums of entertainment and new ways of telling stories and the oral tradition was overlooked for many years.

==Storytelling Guilds==
However, in the 1970s [[oral storytelling]] was given new life with the formation of storytelling guilds in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] and later in [[New South Wales]] and other states. In Australia today there are active guilds in [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], Victoria, [[New South Wales]] and [[South Australia]]. These guilds have close ties with storytelling guilds in [[New Zealand]]. The biennial 'Weaving Stories Together' – Sydney International Storytelling Conference draws participants and presenters from the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Australasia.

==Storytellers==
With the importance of oral literacy now being acknowledged by many Australian educators, oral storytellers have become a valuable resource for teachers. Many Australian storytellers, such as [[JB Rowley]], Gael Cresp, Jackie Kerin and others, are also successful authors. Another Australian storyteller, [[Louisa John-Krol]], uses stories as a basis for her music.

Larry Brandy is an Aboriginal storyteller who specialises in involving his audience, using artefacts.

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group. Together, these findings support a critical role for DeltaFosB expression in the NAc in the reinforcing effects of sexual behavior and sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance.&amp;nbsp;... both drug addiction and sexual addiction represent pathological forms of neuroplasticity along with the emergence of aberrant behaviors involving a cascade of neurochemical changes mainly in the brain's rewarding circuitry.|vauthors=Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychiatric and medical classifications==
Diagnostic models do not currently include the criteria necessary to identify behaviors as addictions in a clinical setting. Behavioral addictions has been proposed as a new class in [[DSM-5]], but the only category included is gambling addiction. Internet gaming addiction is included in the appendix as a condition for further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuss|first1=Daria|title=Internet gaming addiction: current perspectives|journal=Psychological Research and Behavior Management  |issue=6 |pages=125–137 |doi=10.2147/PRBM.S39476  |year=2013 |pmc=3832462 |pmid=24255603 |volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shenfield|first1=Tali|title=Is your child a gaming addict?|url=http://www.psy-ed.com/wpblog/child-gaming-addiction/|website=Advanced Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral addictions, which are sometimes referred to as impulse control disorders, are increasingly recognized as treatable forms of addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jon: Impulse Control Disorders: A Clinician's Guide to Understanding and Treating Behavioral Addictions&lt;/ref&gt;
The type of excessive behaviors identified as being addictive include [[Problem gambling|gambling]], [[eating disorder|food]], [[sexual addiction|sexual intercourse]], use of [[pornography addiction|pornography]], use of [[computer addiction|computers]], playing [[Video game addiction|video games]], use of the [[Internet addiction disorder|internet]], [[Physical exercise#Excessive exercise|exercise]], and [[Compulsive buying disorder|shopping]].

Researching [[Food Addicts in Recovery Anonymous|addiction to food]], for example, a 2009 Scripps Research Institute study found evidence that the same molecular mechanisms correlated with human drug addiction also exist in compulsive overeating in obese rats. The dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor studied is associated with vulnerability to drug addiction in humans. It was found downregulated in obese rats exposed to a high fat diet, and further reductions of the receptor increased compulsive eating. The D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor responds to dopamine, a central neurotransmitter released in anticipation of rewarding, satiating experiences such as those involving food, sex or psychoactive drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2519 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100328170243.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=29 March 2010 |title=Dopamine D2 receptors in addiction-like reward dysfunction and compulsive eating in obese rats |year=2010 |last1=Johnson |first1=Paul M |last2=Kenny |first2=Paul J |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=635–41 |pmid=20348917 |pmc=2947358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] (ASAM) issued a public statement defining all addiction in terms of brain changes. "Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry."&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Addiction Medicine. Public Policy Statement: Definition of Addiction. https://www.asam.org/resources/definition-of-addiction&lt;/ref&gt;

The following excerpts are taken from the organization's FAQs: &lt;blockquote&gt;The new ASAM definition makes a departure from equating addiction with just [[substance dependence]], by describing how addiction is also related to behaviors that are rewarding. This is the first time that ASAM has taken an official position that addiction is not solely "substance dependence." This definition says that addiction is about functioning and brain circuitry and how the structure and function of the brains of persons with addiction differ from the structure and function of the brains of persons who do not have addiction. It talks about reward circuitry in the brain and related circuitry, but the emphasis is not on the external rewards that act on the reward system. Food and sexual behaviors and gambling behaviors can be associated with the "pathological pursuit of rewards" described in this new definition of addiction. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We all have the brain reward circuitry that makes food and sex rewarding. In fact, this is a survival mechanism. In a healthy brain, these rewards have feedback mechanisms for satiety or 'enough.' In someone with addiction, the circuitry becomes dysfunctional such that the message to the individual becomes ‘more’, which leads to the pathological pursuit of rewards and/or relief through the use of substances and behaviors. So, anyone who has addiction is vulnerable to food and sex addiction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since ASAM released its statement, and shortly before its release, additional new studies have come out on Internet addiction. They reveal the same fundamental brain changes seen in other addicts of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030253 |title=Abnormal White Matter Integrity in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder: A Tract-Based Spatial Statistics Study |year=2012 |editor1-last=Frasch |editor1-first=Martin Gerbert |last1=Lin |first1=Fuchun |last2=Zhou |first2=Yan |last3=Du |first3=Yasong |last4=Qin |first4=Lindi |last5=Zhao |first5=Zhimin |last6=Xu |first6=Jianrong |last7=Lei |first7=Hao |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |pages=e30253 |pmid=22253926 |issue=1 |pmc=3256221|bibcode=2012PLoSO...730253L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.06.017 |title=Enhanced reward sensitivity and decreased loss sensitivity in Internet addicts: An fMRI study during a guessing task |year=2011 |last1=Dong |first1=Guangheng |last2=Huang |first2=Jie |last3=Du |first3=Xiaoxia |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=1525–9 |pmid=21764067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2011.05.047 |title=Male Internet addicts show impaired executive control ability: Evidence from a color-word Stroop task |year=2011 |last1=Dong |first1=Guangheng |last2=Zhou |first2=Hui |last3=Zhao |first3=Xuan |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=499 |issue=2 |pages=114–8 |pmid=21645588|bibcode=2006NeuL..400..197D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |title=Microstructure Abnormalities in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder |year=2011 |editor1-last=Yang |editor1-first=Shaolin |last1=Yuan |first1=Kai |last2=Qin |first2=Wei |last3=Wang |first3=Guihong |last4=Zeng |first4=Fang |last5=Zhao |first5=Liyan |last6=Yang |first6=Xuejuan |last7=Liu |first7=Peng |last8=Liu |first8=Jixin |last9=Sun |first9=Jinbo |last10=von Deneen |first10=K.

Eighteen percent of study participants were considered to be pathological Internet users, whose excessive use of the Internet was causing academic, social, and interpersonal problems. Excessive Internet use may create a heightened level of psychological arousal, resulting in little sleep, failure to eat for long periods, and limited physical activity, possibly leading to the user experiencing physical and mental health problems such as depression, OCD, low family relationships and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22091309 |year=2011 |last1=Alavi |first1=SS |last2=Maracy |first2=MR |last3=Jannatifard |first3=F |last4=Eslami |first4=M |title=The effect of psychiatric symptoms on the internet addiction disorder in Isfahan's University students |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=793–800 |pmc=3214398 |journal=Journal of Research in Medical Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Treatment==

Behavioral addiction is a treatable condition. Treatment options include [[psychotherapy]] and [[psychopharmacology|psychopharmacotherapy]] (i.e., medications) or a combination of both. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is the most common form of psychotherapy used in treating behavioral addictions; it focuses on identifying patterns that trigger [[compulsive behavior]] and making lifestyle changes to promote healthier behaviors. Currently, there are no medications approved for treatment of behavioral addictions in general, but some medications used for treatment of drug addiction may also be beneficial with specific behavioral addictions.&lt;ref name="Behavioral addictions"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grant JE, Potenza MN, Weinstein A, Gorelick DA | title = Introduction to behavioral addictions | journal = Am.

Another growing area is social media addiction. Psychology researchers surveyed 253 undergraduate students at the University of Albany and found that not only is social media (particularly Facebook) itself potentially addictive, those who use it may also be at greater risk for substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/news/56604.php |title=Craving Facebook?

Besides increased ΔFosB expression in the nucleus accumbens, there are many other correlations in the neurobiology of behavioral addictions with drug addictions.

One of the most important discoveries of addictions has been the drug based reinforcement and, even more important, reward based learning processes. Several structures of the brain are important in the conditioning process of behavioral addiction; these subcortical structures form the brain regions known as the [[reward system]]. One of the major areas of study is the [[amygdala]], a brain structure which involves emotional significance and associated learning. Research shows that dopaminergic projections from the [[ventral tegmental area]] facilitate a motivational or learned association to a specific behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewer|first1=Judson A.|last2=Potenza|first2=Marc N.|year=2008|title=The neurobiology and genetics of impulse control disorders: Relationships to drug addictions|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=63–75|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.06.043|pmc=2222549|pmid=17719013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dopamine neurons take a role in the learning and sustaining of many acquired behaviors. Research specific to Parkinson's disease has led to identifying the intracellular signaling pathways that underlie the immediate actions of dopamine. The most common mechanism of dopamine is to create addictive properties along with certain behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Girault|first1=Jean-Antoine|last2=Greengard|first2=P|year=2004|title=The Neurobiology of Dopamine Signaling|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=61|issue=5|pages=641–4|doi=10.1001/archneur.61.5.641|pmid=15148138}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three stages to the dopamine reward system: bursts of dopamine, triggering of behavior, and further impact to the behavior. Once electronically signaled, possibly through the behavior, dopamine neurons let out a ‘burst-fire’ of elements to stimulate areas along fast transmitting pathways. The behavior response then perpetuates the striated neurons to further send stimuli. The fast firing of dopamine neurons can be monitored over time by evaluating the amount of extracellular concentrations of dopamine through micro dialysis and brain imaging. This monitoring can lead to a model in which one can see the multiplicity of triggering over a period of time.&lt;ref name="dichiara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dichiara|first1=G|last2=Bassareo|first2=V|year=2007|title=Reward system and addiction: What dopamine does and doesn't do|journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/j.coph.2006.11.003|pmid=17174602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the behavior is triggered, it is hard to work away from the dopamine reward system.

Behaviors like gambling have been linked to the new found idea of the brain's capacity to anticipate rewards. The reward system can be triggered by early detectors of the behavior, and trigger dopamine neurons to begin stimulating behaviors. But in some cases, it can lead to many issues due to error, or reward-prediction errors. These errors can act as teaching signals to create a complex behavior task over time.&lt;ref name="dichiara" /&gt;

In [[heraldry]], a '''compartment''' is a design placed under the [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]], usually rocks, a grassy mount (''mount vert''), or some sort of other landscape upon which the [[supporters]] are depicted as standing.{{sfn|Woodcock|Robinson|1990|p=106}} Care must be taken to distinguish true compartments from items upon which supporters are merely resting one or more feet, or, sometimes, mere heraldic badges or pure decoration under the shield, and, conversely, care must also be taken in very unusual cases such as the [[coat of arms of Belize]], in which what may be taken to be a crest, the mahogany tree rising above the shield, is really part of the compartment.  It is sometimes said to represent the land held by the bearer.  As an official part of the blazon it is a comparatively late feature of heraldry, often derived from the need to have different supporters for different families or entities, although sometimes the compartment is treated in the [[blazon]] separately from the supporters.

==Background==
If the compartment is mentioned in the blazon it forms part of the grant and is an integral part of the arms e.g. the current [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] are required to have a compartment with plant badges.{{sfn|Fox-Davies|1909|p=444}} If no compartment is specified in the blazon then whether to draw one is at the discretion of the artist.{{sfn|Fox-Davies|1909|p=441}} The current arms of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] are usually depicted on a compartment of a wreath of [[Acacia pycnantha|wattle]], the national flower. It would be acceptable to omit the wattle or substitute something else as it does not form part of the grant.

The decorative flourish which was often placed by [[heraldic art]]ists under the feet, hooves or paws of supporters, chiefly in the 19th century, was disparagingly known by some as the "gas bracket," although this term never had any official currency; the only case in which something similar was ever actually mentioned in the blazon was the "arabesque" vert on which the [[whale]] supporters of [[Zaanstad]], [[Noord Holland]], the [[Netherlands]], balance.  The compartment of the coat of arms of [[Michigan]] is similar.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.onecle.com/michigan/2-state/mcl-2-22.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique instance in which the supporters stand on the motto scroll is in the arms of [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usheraldicregistry.com/pmwiki.php?n=Registrations.20060825F|title=U.S. Heraldic Registry » Registrations/New Jersey, The State of, United States of America|website=usheraldicregistry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coat of arms of the Netherlands]], likewise, features the two lion supporters standing on the motto scroll.

Usually when arms are augmented by supporters, a compartment will be added too.  In rare cases, a compartment might be granted as an [[augmentation (heraldry)|augmentation]].  A compartment without supporters is possible but practically unknown, with the exception of the [[Coat of Arms of South Australia]].

A compartment is usually some kind of landscape (in the case of Scottish chiefs it is generally a "mount vert" - ''grassy mount'' covered with the clan's flower) or seascape, and these can be quite elaborate. These elaborate designs particularly feature in more recent [[Canada|Canadian]] grants, such as the compartment of the [[University of Northern British Columbia]], in which the [[female]] [[Kermode bear]] and [[woodland caribou]] buck stand on a [[forest]], [[mountain]] peaks and ears of [[wheat]], all rising out of the conventionalised heraldic representation of water, which is itself charged with an [[orca]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1739 University Of Northern British Columbia]. online Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges. Vol. II, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartments can have a specific piece of geography; [[Kenya]]'s compartment is [[Mount Kenya]] and the compartment of [[Arbeláez]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], Colombia is a globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/co-cunar.html|title=Fotw.net|website=www.fotw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some unusual compartments.  The compartment of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada is a quadrangle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=382 Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada]. Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges. Vol. IV, p. 376&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms of the former [[Cumberland County Council, England|Cumberland County Council]] have a wall as a compartment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/cumberland.html Civil Heraldry] - The arms of the Cumberland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Canadian Academy of Engineering]] has a bridge spanning water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.nlc-bnc.ca/100/200/301/ic/can_digital_collections/governor/heraldry/CanAcadEngine.html Archives of Canada] - Academy of Engineering coat of arms&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief of [[Clan Robertson|Clan Donnachaidh]] has a man in chains as a compartment, while that of Dundas of that Ilk is "a salamander in flames of fire". 

Recent compartments can also feature indigenous non-European features. The arms of [[Gisborne, New Zealand]] contain another unique compartment, a Māori [[waka (canoe)|waka]] (canoe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Gisborne|title=Gisborne - Coat of arms (crest) of Gisborne|website=www.ngw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Conception (1999–2004)===
Couchsurfing was conceived by computer programmer and [[New Hampshire]] native Casey Fenton in 1999, when he was 21 years old.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220724 | title=How CouchSurfing Got its Start, and Landed VC Millions | work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]] | date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea arose after Fenton found a cheap flight from [[Boston]] to [[Iceland]] but did not have lodging. Fenton hacked into a database of the [[University of Iceland]] and randomly e-mailed 1,500 students asking for a homestay. He received between 50 and 100 offers and chose to stay at the home of an Icelandic [[rhythm and blues]] singer.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; On the return flight to Boston, he came up with the idea to create the website. He registered the couchsurfing.com [[domain name]] on 12 June 1999.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whois.domaintools.com/couchsurfing.com | title=Whois Record for CouchSurfing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Couchsurfing International Inc. was formed on 2 April 2003 as a [[New Hampshire]] [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name=newhampshire&gt;{{cite web | url=https://quickstart.sos.nh.gov/online/BusinessInquire/BusinessInformation?businessID=126502 | title=Business Information: COUCHSURFING INTERNATIONAL INC. | publisher=New Hampshire Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was launched on June 12, 2004&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; with the cooperation of Dan Hoffer, Sebastien Le Tuan, and Leonardo Silveira.&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

=== Development of the website by volunteers (2006–2011) ===
From 2006 until the company raised financing in 2011, development of the website occurred mostly at events called "Couchsurfing Collectives", in which members came together to voluntarily improve the website.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt; Collectives took place in [[Montreal]], [[Vienna]], [[New Zealand]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Samara]], [[Alaska]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fCfrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Networks | first=George A. | last=Barnett | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the collectively-coded website, which was full of [[software bug]]s, could not handle the rapid increases in traffic and [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] were common. Many members believed that the website needed to be redesigned from scratch.&lt;ref name=friendster&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gigaom.com/2015/01/10/how-couchsurfing-became-the-friendster-of-the-sharing-economy/ | title=How Couchsurfing became the Friendster of the sharing economy | work=[[GigaOm]] | last=DeAmicis | first=Carmel | date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, problems with the website [[database]] resulted in much of it being irrevocably lost.&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQx4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295 | title=Handbook of Research on Global Hospitality and Tourism Management | first=Angelo A. | last=Camillo | publisher=IGI Global | date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunchdelete&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/06/29/couchsurfing-deletes-itself-shuts-down/ | title=CouchSurfing Deletes Itself, Shuts Down | work=[[TechCrunch]] | last=Arrington | first=Michael | date=29 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt; Founder Casey Fenton posted online asking for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://forums.mysql.com/read.php?28,99328,99328#msg-99328 | first=Casey | last=Fenton | title=Help! - Innodb and MyISAM accidental DROP DATABASE – 112 tables gone forever? | website=forums.mysql.com | date=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Couchsurfing Collective was underway in Montreal at the time and those in attendance raised $8,000 in donations and committed to recreate the website.&lt;ref name=handbook/&gt;

=== Change to a for-profit corporation and financing (2011) ===
The company applied for status as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] in November 2007 but was rejected by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] in early 2011.&lt;ref name=inc&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html | title=Couchsurfing Dilemma: Going for Profit | work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]] | first=Issie | last=Lapowesky | date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallbusiness/&gt; Hoffer, in charge of strategic development, then believed that non-profit status was an obstacle to innovation due to the [[audit]] and regulatory requirements and that a [[for-profit corporation]] was the best structure for the company.&lt;ref name=smallbusiness/&gt;

The New Hampshire entity Couchsurfing International Inc. was dissolved on 4 November 2011.&lt;ref name=newhampshire/&gt; Its assets were sold to a for-profit [[Delaware]] corporation, also called Couchsurfing International, Inc., which was formed on 3 May 2011.&lt;ref name=decorp&gt;{{cite web | url=https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx | title=State of Delaware corporate entity search – enter "couchsurfing"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bizapedia&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bizapedia.com/de/couchsurfing-international-inc.html | title=Bizapedia: Couchsurfing International Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunchraises15/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicoleperlroth/2011/08/24/non-profit-couchsurfing-raises-millions-in-funding/ | title=Non-Profit CouchSurfing Raises Millions In Funding | work=[[Forbes]] | first=Nicole | last=Perlroth | date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the company was a certified [[B Corporation]];&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/money/couchsurfing-ceo-daniel-hoffer-on-become-a-b-corporation/ | title=CouchSurfing CEO Daniel Hoffer on Becoming a B Corporation | work=[[Intuit]] | first=Vanessa | last=Richardson}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is no longer listed as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bcorporation.net/ | title=B Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, in conjunction with the reorganization to a for-profit corporation, the company raised $7.6 million in a first-round financing led by [[Benchmark Capital]] and [[Omidyar Network]].&lt;ref name=raises&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110825005488/en/CouchSurfing-Raises-7.6-Million-Series-Benchmark-Capital | title=CouchSurfing Raises $7.6 Million in Series A From Benchmark Capital and Omidyar Network to Expand Services and Fuel Growth in Cultural Exchange Network | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tnooz.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/08/24/benchmark-couchsurfing/ | title=Benchmark plops down $7.6M to make Couchsurfing into a for-profit | first=Dylan | last=Tweney | work=[[VentureBeat]] | date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/couchsurfing-just-closed-a-76-million-round-of-funding-2011-8 | title=CouchSurfing Just Closed A $7.6 Million Round Of Funding | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Couchsurfing received an additional $15 million in funding from an investor group led by [[General Catalyst Partners]], with participation by [[Menlo Ventures]], as well as existing investors [[Benchmark Capital]] and [[Omidyar Network]]. The additional funding brought the company’s total funding raised to $22.6 million.&lt;ref name=techcrunchraises15&gt;{{cite web | title=CouchSurfing Raises $15 Million Series B From General Catalyst Partners, Menlo Ventures, Others | url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/22/couchsurfing-raises-15-million-series-b-from-general-catalyst-partners-others/ | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has a [[burn rate]] of $2-3 million per year.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt; However, it has been as high as $800,000 per month.&lt;ref name=tony/&gt;

==== Criticism from members of the conversion to a for-profit corporation ====
The conversion to a for-profit corporation was objected to by many members.&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt;&lt;ref name=revolt&gt;{{cite news | url=https://gigaom.com/2011/09/01/after-going-for-profit-couchsurfing-faces-user-revolt/ | title=After going for-profit, CouchSurfing faces user revolt | work=[[GigaOm]] | date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://techpresident.com/news/24498/couchsurfing2 | title=How to Lose Funds and Infuriate Users: Couchsurfing, a Cautionary Tale From the Sharing Economy | work=[[techPresident]] | last=Roudman | first=Sam | date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Casey Fenton said he received 1,500 emails in the days after announcing the conversion.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt; Even though the founders did not receive any cash from the financing,&lt;ref name=mythsandfacts&gt;{{cite web | title=Myths and Facts: Couchsurfing’s conversion to a B Corp | url=https://blog.couchsurfing.com/myths-and-facts-couchsurfings-conversion-to-a-b-corp/ | work=Couchsurfing | date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; members were opposed to the founders having a valuable ownership interest in an organization that was financed by donations and built using volunteer work.&lt;ref name=friendster/&gt;&lt;ref name=tnooz.com/&gt; The company spent more than $10,000 on a [[public relations]] firm to educate its directors on how to respond to the press about the conversion to a for-profit entity. A 3-page letter was sent to over 1,000 volunteers.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;

=== Launch and development of mobile apps ===
In 2012, the company launched mobile apps for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Couchsurfing your way to a free place to stay | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/talkingtech/2013/10/12/talking-tech-couchsurfing/2959867/ | last=Graham | first=Jefferson | work=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company added a feature called "hangouts" that enables members to quickly meet with other nearby members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blog.couchsurfing.com/product-update-make-a-new-friend-with-couchsurfing-hangouts/ | title=Product Update: Make a new friend with Couchsurfing Hangouts! | work=Couchsurfing | date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=A little-known travel app that is Airbnb-meets-Tinder helped me have the wildest night in Tokyo partying until sunrise | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-use-couchsurfing-app-to-meet-locals-traveling-2018-1/ | last=Jacobs | first=Harrison | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dean drive''' was a device created and promoted by inventor Norman Lorimer Dean (1902–1972) that he claimed to be a [[reactionless drive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deanspacedrive.org/?page_id=14|title=Arcturas Project|publisher=deanspacedrive.org|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean claimed that his device was able to generate a uni-directional force in [[Vacuum|free space]], in violation of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] from [[classical physics]]. His claims generated notoriety because, if true, such a device would have had enormous applications, completely changing human transport, engineering, space travel and more.&lt;ref name=EngineWings&gt;{{cite journal |date=Sep 1961 |journal=Popular Mechanics |title=Engine With Built-in Wings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean made several controlled private demonstrations of a number of different devices, however no working models were ever demonstrated publicly or subjected to independent analysis and Dean never presented any rigorous theoretical basis for their operation. Analysts conclude that the motion seen in Dean's device demonstrations was likely reliant on asymmetrical frictional resistance between the device and the surface on which the device was set, resulting in the device moving in one direction when in operation, driven by the vibrations of the apparatus.&lt;ref name=Phasers&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 1976 |journal=Analog |title=Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arfken1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Arfken|title=University Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PfadZy35Wh0C&amp;pg=PA182|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=1 January 1984|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-323-14202-1|pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goswami2000&gt;{{cite book |title=The Physicists' View of Nature |first=Amit|last=Goswami |year=2000 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gwPHgcHK4sgC&amp;pg=PA60 |publisher=Springer |pages=60 |isbn=0-306-46450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early publicity==
The Dean drive obtained a good deal of publicity in the 1950s and 1960s via the columns and conference presentations of [[John W. Campbell]], the longtime editor of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine. At that time, Campbell believed that his magazine had to change society by helping breakthrough research that was rejected by "mainstream" science, and he promoted a series of far-reaching ideas that had dubious scientific bases, like [[Dianetics]], [[dowsing]], the [[Hieronymus machine]], and the Dean Drive.&lt;ref name="Westfahl1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Gary Westfahl]]|title=The Mechanics of Wonder: The Creation of the Idea of Science Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wX5mp-KSV4sC&amp;pg=PA278|accessdate=28 May 2013|year=1998|publisher=[[Liverpool University Press]]|isbn=978-0-85323-563-7|pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Camp2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[L.

Cramer |title=Antigravity Sightings |journal= Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact |year=1997 |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[weight]] reading on the scale appeared to decrease when the device was activated. He subsequently published photographs of the scale with the drive stopped and running. The June&amp;nbsp;1960 cover of ''Astounding'' magazine featured a painting of a [[United States]] [[submarine]] near Mars, supposedly propelled there by a Dean drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dean, who was trying to find potential buyers for his technology, was secretive about the details of how it was supposed to work, but it was said to contain asymmetrical rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Dean and Campbell claimed that Newton’s laws of motion were only an approximation, and that Dean had discovered a fourth law of motion. This has been described as a nonlinear correction to one of Newton’s laws, which, if correct, would allegedly have rendered a reactionless drive feasible after all.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

One result of the initial articles in Campbell's magazine was that two other researchers, William O. Davis and [[G. Harry Stine]], visited Dean and witnessed a demonstration.  Results of this visit were published in the May&amp;nbsp;1962 and June&amp;nbsp;1976 issues of the magazine, the name of which had been changed by Campbell from ''Astounding'' to ''Analog''. Davis witnessed a demonstration by Dean, and wrote: "It was the conclusion of both Harry Stine and myself that we had witnessed a real anomaly and that the possibility of fraud in the demonstration was slim."&lt;ref name=Phasers/&gt; Sci-fi writer [[Jerry Pournelle]] pointed out that Stine was well qualified to make a judgment on the device, but that he was more gullible than other persons.&lt;ref name=Pournelle/&gt;

Davis's 1962 article was titled, "The Fourth Law of Motion", and described a hypothesis in which Dean's device (and others) could conserve momentum invisibly via "gravitational-inertial radiation".  One detail of Davis's hypothesis involved the forces of [[action and reaction]] — physical bodies can respond to those forces nonsimultaneously, or "out of phase" with each other.

"Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives", a 1976 article by Davis, reported his tests with Stine, an engineer who built devices to test that aspect of the hypothesis. Stine said they were able to reliably create and reproduce a 3-degree phase angle in a linear system, which was not possible according to ordinary physics. But then they failed to reproduce the effect in a pendulum system, using a rocket-powered [[ballistic pendulum]]. The pendulum test would have proved beyond doubt that the Drive worked, but Dean refused to subject the original Dean Drive to a pendulum test. Campbell reported that he had seen the Drive subjected to a pendulum test, but Davis and Stine suspect that he only reported what Dean had told him and had never seen the actual test. Davis says the question can't be settled until the pendulum test is made. Their research was terminated in 1965 when the national economy took a downturn, and was never resumed.&lt;ref name=Phasers/&gt;  The 1976 article was an attempt to get research restarted, but apparently failed.

In 1984, physicist Amit Goswami wrote that "Dean's machine made such a splash with readers of [[science fiction]] that it is now customary in SF circles to refer to a reactionless drive as a Dean drive."&lt;ref name="GoswamiGoswami1985"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Amit |last1=Goswami|first2=Maggie |last2=Goswami|title=The cosmic dancers: exploring the science of science fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3YnWAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=July 1985|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|isbn=978-0-07-023867-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported weight loss ==
Dean made a demonstration for a representative of the magazine ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' of one of his "Dean drive" devices. The witness reported that "While suspended above the ground, was able to pull a load to itself without itself being pulled toward the load".&lt;ref name=EngineWings/&gt;  Another version of the machine was reported to be "able to apply a force to a hand, without moving—yet when the machine was turned off an equivalent force applied by the hand easily moved the machine".&lt;ref name=Phasers/&gt;  William O. Davis, who witnessed the latter demonstration, wrote in his notebook about Dean's explanation of how the device worked, "... does not strike me as valid ...  For this reason I have decided to undertake a theoretical study of dynamic systems to see if a concept can be evolved which will describe a world in which Dean's Drive can exist and yet where other known facts are not contradicted."&lt;ref name=Phasers/&gt;  Davis produced a hypothesis and it was published in ''Analog'' in 1962.&lt;ref name=FourthLaw&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 1962 |journal=Analog |title=The Fourth Law of Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later analysis has revealed that the interactions of vibration, friction, and resonance with the springs of the scale are likely the root cause of the apparent weight loss reported by Campbell and others of apparent "anti-gravity" and "reactionless thruster" effects.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mills |first=Marc G. |title=Responding to Mechanical Antigravity |conference=42nd Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit |author2=Thomas, Nicholas E. |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[NASA]]  |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030093616/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2006/TM-2006-214390.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AltViews/&gt;

==Interested parties==
In the 1950s [[Jerry Pournelle]], working for an aerospace company, contacted Dean to investigate purchasing the device. Dean refused to demonstrate the device without pre-payment and promise of a [[Nobel prize]]. Pournelle's company were unwilling to pay for the right to examine the device and never saw the purported model. [[3M]] sent representatives about the same time, and obtained similar results. Pournelle eventually was convinced that Dean's device never worked.&lt;ref name=Pournelle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerrypournelle.com/science/dean.html |title=The Dean Drive and other Reactionless Drives |last=Pournelle |first=Jerry |date=May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patents==
Dean was granted two U.S. patents on mechanical devices presumably related to his Dean drive claims. His first patent for a "System for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion" was granted on May 9, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2886976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patent for a "Variable oscillator system" was granted on May 11, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3182517}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two patent designs were the only ones where Dean revealed the design details with an explanation for operation. However, the details were incomplete, and it is not possible to build a Dean Drive just from the explanations in the patent.&lt;ref name=Phasers /&gt; Dean's patents, as well as patents for many other similar devices, have been analyzed and it has been determined that none can produce net directional thrust in free space or violate Newton's Third Law.&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt; Dean also demonstrated other mechanical devices that were clearly different from his patent designs but apparently never sought patents for them nor otherwise revealed their design details or theory of operation.&lt;ref name=Phasers /&gt;&lt;ref name=NASA /&gt;

In 1978 physicist Russell Adams wrote an article in ''Analog''. Searching in the US patent office he had found at least 50 patents of similar reactionless drives. After studying the mechanisms, he concluded that they all relied in friction against the floor they were placed on, and they would be useless in space, where there isn't friction against any surface.&lt;ref name=Goswami2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams1978&gt;Russell E. Adams, Jr, "The Bootstrap Effect", ''Analog'', April 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean's patented devices, and his explanation of how his Drive was supposed to work, were later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton's third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AltViews/&gt;

==Further developments==
After Dean's death, neither the demonstration devices nor any working devices were found among his experiments. The demonstration devices were clearly different from the devices patented by Dean, and no diagrams were ever found for them. Consequently, it is impossible to test Dean's reported designs or devices to see if they worked as he claimed.&lt;ref name=Pournelle/&gt;

In 1997 physicist [[John G. Cramer]] mentioned the Dean Drive in ''Analog'' in his column "Alternate View". He said that the demonstration made to Campbell was faulty, and the drive had turned out to be bogus, like many other claims of antigravity devices.&lt;ref name=AltViews/&gt;

In 2006 a [[NASA]] technical memorandum presented the Dean Drive as the most famous example of an "oscillation thruster" and examined its theoretical basis and feasibility as a space drive. It said that "Regrettably, such devices are not breakthroughs, since they still require a connection to the ground to create net motion. The ground is the reaction mass and the frictional connection to the ground is a necessary component to its operation." NASA regularly receives proposals of similar devices, and the memo recommended that future reviews of said proposals "should require that submitters meet minimal thresholds of proof before engaging in further correspondence."&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

In 2012 a researcher attempting to characterize the [[Woodward effect]], another proposed reactionless drive effect, has stated that she carefully  designed her experiments to specifically exclude any "Dean drive" effects: the unintended interaction with the environment in, around or touching the apparatus. She considered these effects "spurious noise".&lt;ref name="WoodwardSpurious2013"&gt;

[[File:DM Diagonal method.svg|thumb|180px|right|Diagonal method of a 3:2 image]]
The '''diagonal method''' ('''DM''') is a [[rule of thumb]] in [[photography]], [[painting]] and [[drawing]]. Dutch photographer and lecturer Edwin Westhoff discovered the method when, after having long taught the [[rule of thirds]] in photography courses, he conducted visual experiments to investigate why this rule of thirds only loosely prescribes that points of interest should be placed more or less near the intersection of lines, rather than being rigid and demanding placement to be precisely on these intersections. Having studied many photographs, paintings and etchings, he discovered that details of interest were often placed precisely on the [[diagonals]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]], instead of any "strong points" that the rule of thirds or the photographic adaptation of the [[golden ratio]] suggests. A photograph is usually a rectangular shape with a ratio of 4:3 or 3:2, in which case one should look at the [[bisection]] of each corner. Manually placing certain elements of interest on these lines results in a more pleasing photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Hartel, M. (2008). Urban expression. Digital Photographer, 74 (September), 30–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
[[image:Diagonal_on_Girl_with_Pearl_Earring.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Example using [[Vermeer]]'s [[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]. The yellow diagonal line intersects two main points of interest: the girl's left eye and the pearl earring.]]
Diagonals, the middle [[perpendiculars]], the [[Centre (geometry)|center]] and the corners of a square are said to comprise the force lines in a square, and are regarded by some as more powerful than other parts in a square.&lt;ref&gt;Arnheim, R. (1954). Art and visual perception: A psychology of the creative eye. Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DM, details that are of interest (to the artist and the viewer) are placed on one or more diagonals of 45 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] from the four corners of the image. Contrary to other [[rules of thumb]] involving composition, such as the rule of thirds and the golden ratio, the DM is not ascribing value to the [[Line-line intersection|intersections]] of its lines. Rather, a detail of interest can be located on any point of the four bisections, to which the viewer’s attention will be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Westhoff, E. (2009). De diagonaal-methode. (The Diagonal Method.) Zoom.nl Digitale Fotografie &amp; Video, 2009(10), 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the DM is very strict about placing details exactly ''on'' the bisection, allowing for a maximum deviation of one millimeter on an A4-sized picture.{{cn|date=September 2014}} Another difference with other rules of thumb is that the DM is not being used for improving a composition.{{clarify|date=September 2014}}

== Application ==
The diagonal method was derived from an analysis of how artists intuitively locate details within a composition, and can be used for such analyses. Westhoff discovered that by drawing lines with an angle of 45 degrees from the corners of an image, one can find out which details the artist (deliberately or unconsciously) intended to emphasize. Artists and photographers intuitively place areas of interest within a composition. The DM can assist in determining which details the artist wishes to emphasize. Research by Westhoff has resulted in the finding that important details on paintings and on etchings of [[Rembrandt]], such as eyes, hands or utilities, were placed exactly on the diagonals.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

It is very difficult to consciously place points of attention precisely on the diagonals during the making of photos or artworks, yet it is possible to do this in post-production using guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Westhoff, E. (2007). De Diagonaal Methode. (The Diagonal Method.) FocusXtra 2007(Februari), 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the DM can be applied to move the subject of a picture further into a corner.&lt;ref&gt;Elzenga, J. W. (2009). Digitale fotografie natuur: Tips en technieken voor het fotograferen van landschap en dieren. (Digital photography in nature: Tips and techniques for photographing landscapes and animals.) Amsterdam: Pearson Education. Pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DM can only be applied on images where certain details are supposed to be emphasized or exaggerated, such as a [[portrait]] in which a specific body part deserves extra attention by the viewer, or a photograph for advertising a product. Photographs of landscapes and architecture usually rely on the composition as a whole, or have lines other than the bisections to determine the composition, such as the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Elzenga, J. W. (2009). Digitale fotografie natuur: Tips en technieken voor het fotograferen van landschap en dieren. (Digital photography in nature: Tips and techniques for photographing landscapes and animals.) Amsterdam: Pearson Education. P. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Only if the picture includes details such as persons, (standalone) trees, or buildings is the DM applicable.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

"'''Elementary School Musical'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] of the animated series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 180th episode of the series overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1213/|title=South Park Episode Guide – 1213 |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on November 12, 2008. In the episode, a new boy at school helps set off an impromptu-singing-and-dancing craze that the boys vow to never go along with, dragging them down into the dregs of unpopularity.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode is a parody of the [[High School Musical (film series)|''High School Musical'']] film series.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;

==Plot==
[[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] realize that, apart from them, everyone at school has bought into the newest [[fad]], the ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' film series. The four boys repeatedly witness the rest of South Park Elementary collectively break into song, in the spirit of the musical films. Unaware of what ''High School Musical'' is, the boys watch one of the films, but dislike it, and vow never to become a part of this fad. Cartman decides to commit suicide by inducing [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] while sleeping under his mother's car (with the engine turned on) but it fails since [[hybrid cars]] do not "do the trick anymore".

Stan fears that [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Wendy Testaburger|Wendy]] is becoming close with a popular third-grader named Bridon Gueermo (voiced by Parker), because they tend to share lead roles in the musical routines. Stan talks to Bridon in hopes of directing him away from Wendy, and finds out Bridon would prefer to play basketball instead of singing. It is revealed that the reason that Bridon made up the fad because of his theater-crazed, flamboyant metrosexual father (also voiced by Parker) forces him to do it. Stan pressures him to try out with the basketball team anyway. Although Mr. Gueermo is shown to be abusive to his family (though only capable of light, effeminate slaps) Bridon eventually stands up for himself (punching his father in the face), and joins the team.

Meanwhile, unhappy at becoming an outcast in school, Stan decides to join the trend and studies the ''High School Musical'' series intensively, despite having vowed against it. He convinces Kyle, Cartman and Kenny that the world has changed, and they cannot go against the tide anymore. The next day at school, the four boys perform a song along with an equally elaborate dance routine about the importance of following one's dreams. However, upon learning that Bridon has joined the basketball team, everyone else is uninterested and leaves during the boys' performance to watch Bridon play basketball instead. The four kids learn that the rest of the school just liked Bridon for his looks and charisma and not the fad itself.

==Production==

"Elementary School Musical" was one of dozens of ''South Park'' episodes developed the Thursday before broadcast during a writer's meeting.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; ''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]'' had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a national hot topic; the team had previously mentioned the series as a target for satire. The initial idea the episode was based on was that everyone in South Park is singing ''High School Musical''-style numbers, except for the four main boys.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] joked during the meeting that his objective for the next week would be to write a full-blown [[musical film|musical]].&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; The writers returned to the idea not long afterward, and the episode was put into production.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt;

Parker and Stone watched the ''High School Musical'' movies during the development of the show. The previous episode of the series, "[[About Last Night... (South Park)|About Last Night...]]", had required the duo to view the ''[[Oceans Eleven]]'' series in preparation, which they later remarked was an easier, more enjoyable task.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2009 |title=South Park: The Complete Twelfth Season: "Elementary School Musical"|format=Audio commentary |medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the realization that the songs in the ''High School Musical'' series appear disconnected from the plot, Parker found it easier to write fodder songs in one week.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; Stone commented that the episode's story structure is unique in that characters are set up to make a decision, but the audience does not see that decision being made, and the story rather cuts to the aftermath of the decision.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; This is particularly evident in the episode's final moments, in which the audience never sees the boys preparing their musical number, but are surprised with it at the end. Parker and Stone noted that this structure was further explored in the next episode of the season, [[The Ungroundable]].&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Stone, Matt| date=March 2009 |title=South Park: The Complete Twelfth Season: "Elementary School Musical" |format=Audio commentary |medium=Blu-ray Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone noted that the children depicted in South Park are fourth graders, the target audience for the Disney films.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; He spoke in the episode's DVD commentary on how kids at that age tend to watch television in which characters are older and often adolescents.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; Parker and Stone both admitted their favorite part of the episode were scenes in which Bridon Gueermo's father commands the lead, as they found his character, with his slapping abuse, very amusing.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;

==Cultural references==
The episode is a satire of the ''[[High School Musical]]'' series; when the boys watch the film in an attempt to understand the phenomenon, a song from the original film "Stick to the Status Quo," is heard.&lt;ref name="Parker" /&gt; When asked where the boys have been to have been unaware of the ''High School Musical'' craze, Craig responds "[[Peru]]"; this is a reference to episodes from earlier in season, "[[Pandemic (South Park)|Pandemic]]" and "[[Pandemic 2: The Startling]]," in which the boys travel to the country of Peru.&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;

During Bridon's basketball game, his father is swayed by the "[[Jock Jams|jock jam]]" music played over the loud speakers, which includes the music of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Gary Glitter]].&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt; When Stan is pressured to sing a song in the episode, he turns to the only songs he knows: the standards "[[I've Been Working on the Railroad|Someone's In The Kitchen With Dinah]]" and "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]".&lt;ref name="AVClub" /&gt;

==Reception==
Travis Fickett of [[IGN]] commented that the episode "doesn't make as much of the idea as it could" and rated the episode at 7.5 out of 10.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |title=IGN: "Elementary School Musical" Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/930/930071p1.html |author=Fickett, Travis |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 411mania's DC Perry rated it at 7.4 out of 10 compared it favorably to other episodes of the season, but wrote that "[b]eing one of the best episodes of this season isn't really an accomplishment ... It just feels like they're running out of ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/movies/dvd_reviews/90287/South-Park-11.12.08:-Elementary-School-Musical.htm |title=South Park 11.12.08: Elementary School Musical |accessdate=2008-11-16 |author=Perry, DC |date=November 12, 2008 |work=411mania.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718061426/http://www.411mania.com/movies/dvd_reviews/90287/South-Park-11.12.08%3A-Elementary-School-Musical.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean O'Neal of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a 'B+' rating, describing it as a "silly-smart episode that nevertheless ranks as one of the standouts from what's proven to be a very hit-or-miss season".&lt;ref name="AVClub"&gt;{{Cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=Elementary School Musical|publisher=[[The A.V.

==Home release==
"Elementary School Musical", along with the thirteen other episodes from ''South Park'''s twelfth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]] set in the United States on March 10, 2009. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and two special mini-features, ''The Making of 'Major Boobage'' and ''Six Days to South Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Twelfth Season Blu-ray Review |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Liebman |first=Martin |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/South-Park-The-Complete-Twelfth-Season-Blu-ray/3434/ |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Enchanted''''' is a 2007 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[romantic comedy]] film, produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and Sonnenfeld and Josephson Entertainment. Written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]] and directed by [[Kevin Lima]], the film stars [[Amy Adams]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[James Marsden]], [[Timothy Spall]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Rachel Covey]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The plot focuses on Giselle, an archetypal [[Disney Princess]], who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City. ''Enchanted'' was the first Disney film to be distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], instead of [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]].

The film is both an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to, and a self-[[Parody film|parody]] of, [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney's animated features]], making numerous references to Disney's past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, [[traditional animation]], and [[computer-generated imagery]]. It marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], who had written songs for previous Disney films, produced the songs of ''Enchanted'', with Menken also composing its score.

The animation sequences were produced at [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation in Pasadena. Filming of the live action segments took place around New York City. It premiered on October 20, 2007, at the [[London Film Festival]] before its [[wide release]] on November 21, 2007, in the United States. ''Enchanted'' was well-received critically, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office.&lt;ref name="BOMojo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=enchanted.htm |title=Enchanted |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |work=Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won three [[Saturn Awards]],  including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Adams. ''Enchanted'' also received two nominations at the [[65th Golden Globe Awards]] and three [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] nominations at the [[80th Academy Awards]]. A [[sequel]], titled ''Disenchanted'', is in development.

==Plot==
In the [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[fairy tale]] kingdom of Andalasia, the evil Queen Narissa schemes to protect her claim to the throne, which she will lose once her stepson, Prince Edward, finds his [[Chivalric romance|true love]] and marries her. She enlists her loyal henchman Nathaniel to keep Edward distracted. Giselle, a young woman, dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a "[[happy ending|happy ever after]]." Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel sets free a captured [[troll]] to kill Giselle, but Edward rescues her in time. When they meet, they instantly fall in love and plan to get married the following day.

Disguised as an old hag, Narissa intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding and pushes her into a well, where she is magically transformed into a 3D live-action version of herself and transported to a [[manhole]] in New York City's [[Times Square]]. Giselle quickly becomes lost. Meanwhile, Robert, a divorce lawyer, prepares to propose to his longtime girlfriend Nancy, much to the dismay of his daughter Morgan. Robert and Morgan encounter Giselle on their way home, and Robert begrudgingly allows Giselle to stay the night at their apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who trusts Giselle.

Pip, Giselle's best [[chipmunk]] friend from Andalasia, had witnessed Giselle's exile and alerted Edward thereafter, and both embark on a rescue mission to the city, where they too are turned into 3D live-action versions, but Pip is instead in the form of a real chipmunk – therefore losing the ability to speak. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow and impede Edward. In a restaurant, Narissa appears to Nathaniel in a soup pot and gives him three poisoned apples to murder Giselle. Pip eavesdrops but is unable to communicate with Edward, as animals cannot speak outside of Andalasia. Nathaniel keeps Pip silenced by detaining him in various containers. Meanwhile, after Giselle summons [[vermin]] to clean Robert's apartment, Nancy arrives to take Morgan to school. She meets Giselle and leaves assuming Robert was unfaithful. Robert is initially upset but spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending Nancy an invitation to the "King and Queen's Costume Ball" at the [[Woolworth Building]].

Edward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. While Edward is eager to take Giselle home to Andalasia and finally marry, she suggests that they should first go on a date to get to know each other better, still conflicted about her feelings. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after ending their date at the ball, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa, who has been spying from Andalasia, decides to follow and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel failed to poison her twice. Robert and Giselle share a dance with each other and look into each other's eyes, romantically. Giselle and Edward then prepare to leave, but Giselle feels sorrow at leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising "sweet dreams and happy endings." Giselle takes a bite and is rendered unconscious.

Narissa attempts to escape with Giselle's body but is stopped by Edward. Nathaniel, realizing Narissa was using him and never loved him, reveals her plot. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's spell. After Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, he prompts Robert to do so instead. When Robert kisses her just as the clock strikes twelve, Giselle awakens and the whole crowd cheers. Narissa furiously transforms into a giant blue [[dragon]] and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building. Pip, who was freed by Edward, helps Giselle send Narissa falling to her death.

A happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy marrying in Andalasia; Giselle running a successful fashion business and forming a happy family with Robert and Morgan; while Nathaniel and Pip each become successful authors about their personal experiences in the real world.

==Cast==

He initially does Narissa's bidding, but ultimately realizes her true nature and rebels against her. He has a penchant for disguises. This is the first of two Disney films Timothy Spall has been in, the other was Tim Burton's ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' in 2010 where he was the voice of Bayard the Bloodhound.
* [[Idina Menzel]] as Nancy Tremaine &lt;br&gt; Robert's fiancée. Once Giselle falls in love with Robert, she falls for Edward and leaves with him. Menzel, who is well known for her Broadway musical roles in ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (whose composer, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], wrote the lyrics to the film's songs) and ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', was offered the role of Nancy Tremaine.&lt;ref name="SFWire-2007nov13"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Cindy|last=White|title=No Songs For Enchanted Star|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=45452|work=Sci Fi Wire|date=November 13, 2007|accessdate=November 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514025901/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=45452|archivedate = May 14, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an interview that "it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Idina Menzel Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13514.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222020952/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13514.html |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy is a fashion designer and Robert's girlfriend.

* [[Rachel Covey]] as Morgan &lt;br&gt; She is Robert's six-year-old daughter. Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise, she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists.
* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Queen Narissa &lt;br&gt; She is Edward's evil stepmother, a sorceress, and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power. Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima's involvement as director.

* [[Jeff Bennett]] and [[Kevin Lima]] as Pip &lt;br&gt; Bennett provided the voice for the hand drawn animated Pip in the animated segment while Lima provided the voice for the computer-generated Pip in the live-action segment. Pip, a [[chipmunk]] friend of Giselle who has no trouble expressing himself through speech in Andalasia, loses his ability to speak in the real world and must communicate by acting.
* [[Jon McLaughlin]] as himself &lt;br&gt; He sings "[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]" at the ball while Robert and Giselle dance together as do Edward and Nancy.
* [[Fred Tatasciore]] as the Troll &lt;br&gt; He is a creature from Andalasia who tries to eat Giselle.
* [[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]] as Mr. Banks&lt;br&gt; A male client during a divorce case. Isiah later appeared in the 2016 remake of ''[[Pete's Dragon (2016 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'' as Sheriff Dentler.
Several actresses/actors who have played characters in Disney films have [[cameo appearance|cameos]]:
* [[Paige O'Hara]] as Angela &lt;br&gt; A soap opera character. O'Hara provided the speaking and singing voice of [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] in ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.
* [[Jodi Benson]] as Sam &lt;br&gt; Robert's secretary. Benson provided the speaking and singing voice of [[Ariel (Disney character)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''; she also voiced the various [[Barbie]] dolls in ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.
* [[Judy Kuhn]] as Pregnant Woman with Kids &lt;br&gt; Kuhn provided the singing voice of the [[Pocahontas (character)|title character]] in ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and its [[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World|sequel]].
* [[Julie Andrews]] as the Narrator &lt;br&gt; Andrews played the [[Mary Poppins (character)|title character]] in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' as well as appearing in ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'' series as Queen Clarisse Renaldi.

==Production==

===Development===
The initial script of ''Enchanted'', written by [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]], was bought by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Barry Sonnenfeld|Sonnenfeld]]/[[Barry Josephson|Josephson]] Productions for a reported sum of $450,000 in September 1997.&lt;ref name="EW-2007sep11"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steve |last=Daly |title=Inside ''Enchanted'' |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20055844,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 11, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was written for three years, but it was thought to be unsuitable for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] because it was "a racier R-rated movie",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |title=''Enchanted'' Amy Adams falls under Disney spell |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-02-enchanted-inside_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=May 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the adult-risque comedy movies in the 1980s and 1990s such as ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' and [[American Pie (film)|''American Pie'']].

On May 25, 2005, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Kevin Lima]] had been hired as director and Bill Kelly had returned to the project to write a new version of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Claude |last=Brodesser |author2=David S.

He created visual storyboard printouts that covered the story of ''Enchanted'' from beginning to end, which filled an entire floor of a production building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Delfin |last=Vigil |title=Fairy tale unfolds in the gritty city |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/18/PKB8TAUV2.DTL&amp;type=movies |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Lima showed them to [[Dick Cook]], the chairman of the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]], he received the green light for the project and a budget of $85 million.&lt;ref name="BW-2007jul05"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Stacy |last=Perman |title=A Movie Studio Grows in Brooklyn |url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2007/sb2007075_855928.htm |work=BusinessWeek |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201155649/http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2007/sb2007075_855928.htm |archivedate=February 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AICN-2007dec14"/&gt; Lima began designing the world of Andalasia and storyboarding the movie before a cast was chosen to play the characters. After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt;

===Filming===
''Enchanted'' is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in ''Roger Rabbit''; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]s; it begins in 2.35:1 when the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo and ''Enchanted'' storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the cartoon sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the logo and opening credits) was shown in the [[pillarbox]]ed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt; ''Enchanted'' took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt;

====Animation====
Out of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to "cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in [[Traditional animation|traditional cel animation]] (in contrast to computer-generated [[3-D animation]]) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', and ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt; It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]'' (2005). This film, although quite different in terms of plot from any previous Disney film, also contained obvious homages to other Disney films of the distant past, such as ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'', ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', ''[[Bon Voyage! (1962 film)|Bon Voyage!]]'', and ''[[Savage Sam]]''. As most of Disney's cel animation artists were laid off after the [[CG artwork|computer graphics]] boom of the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Company News; Disney to Close Animation Studio in Orlando |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E1D91230F930A25752C0A9629C8B63 |work=The New York Times |date=January 13, 2004 |accessdate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 13 minutes of animation were not done in-house but by the independent [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]-based company [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]] Animation, which was started by noted lead [[animator]] [[James Baxter (animator)|James Baxter]]. Baxter had previously worked for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], bringing to life many memorable Disney animated characters like [[List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters#Jessica Rabbit|Jessica Rabbit]] (''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''), [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), [[List of The Lion King characters#Rafiki|Rafiki]] (''[[The Lion King]]''), and [[Quasimodo]] (''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'').&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007nov14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Borys |last=Kit |author2=Carolyn Giardina |title=''Enchanted'' brings back old familiar feelings |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7a59816873ebe91a592908fbde36af88 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123114924/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7a59816873ebe91a592908fbde36af88 |archivedate=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lima wanted the animation to be [[nostalgia|nostalgic]], he wanted ''Enchanted'' to have a style of its own. Baxter's team decided to use [[Art Nouveau]] as a starting point. For Giselle, the hand-drawn animated character had to be "a cross between [[Amy Adams]] and a classic [[Disney Princess|Disney princess]]. And not a caricature." Seeing Giselle as "a forest girl, an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair" and "a bit of a hippie", the animators wanted her to be "flowing, with her hair and clothes. Delicate."&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007may02-cast"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Susan |last=Wloszczyna |title=Meet the ''Enchanted'' cast |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-02-enchanted-chart_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=May 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Prince Edward, Baxter's team "worked the hardest on him to make him look like the actor" because princes "in these kinds of movies are usually so bland."&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007may02-cast"/&gt; Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter's team wanted her face to "look like [[Susan Sarandon]]. And the costumes had to align closely to the live-action design."&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007may02-cast"/&gt;

To maintain continuity between the two media, Lima brought in costume designer Mona May during the early stages of the film's production so the costumes would be aligned in both the animated and live-action worlds. He also shot some live-action footage of Amy Adams as Giselle for the animators to use as reference, which also allowed the physical movement of the character to match in both worlds. Test scenes completed by the animators were shown to the actors, allowing them to see how their animated selves would move.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt;

====Live-action====

However, shooting in New York became problematic as it was in a "constant state of new stores, scaffolding and renovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Rob |last=Carnevale |title=Film interview: Enchanted – Barry Josephson and Christopher Chase |url=http://www.orange.co.uk/entertainment/film/enchanted/30532.htm |work=Orange |accessdate=January 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scene in New York, which features Giselle emerging from a manhole in the middle of [[Times Square]], was filmed on location in the center of the square. Because of the difficulties in controlling the crowd while filming in [[Times Square]], general pedestrians were featured in the scene with hired extras placed in the immediate foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Addie |last=Morfoot |title=Big Apple, wide range |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117978519.html |work=BusinessWeek |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a crowd gathered to watch as [[James Marsden]] and [[Timothy Spall]] filmed their scenes in [[Times Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Elizabeth |last=Tai |title=Humorous turn |url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/12/3/movies/19579998&amp;sec=movies |work=The Star |date=December 3, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scene Lima found the most challenging to shoot was the musical number, "[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]", in [[Central Park]]. The five-minute scene took 17 days to finish due to the changing weather, which allowed only seven sunny days for the scene to be filmed.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt; The filming was also hampered at times by [[Patrick Dempsey]]'s fans.&lt;ref name="AICN-2007dec14"/&gt; The scene was choreographed by John O'Connell, who had worked on ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' beforehand, and included 300 extras and 150 dancers.&lt;ref name="THR-2007nov14"/&gt;

Many scenes were filmed at [[Steiner Studios]], which provided the three large stages that ''Enchanted'' needed at the same facility.&lt;ref name="BW-2007jul05"/&gt; Other outdoor locations included the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and [[The Paterno]], an [[apartment building]] with a curved, heavily embellished, ivory-colored façade located on the corner of [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] and [[116th Street (Manhattan)|116th Street]], which is the residence of the film's characters Robert and Morgan.

===Costume design===

All the costumes in the film were designed by Mona May, who had previously worked on ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[The Wedding Singer]],'' and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]''. To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City.&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Julie E. |last=Washington |title=Fairy tale to real woman plot challenged Enchanted's costume designer Mona May |url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1195810501231580.xml&amp;coll=2 |work=The Plain Dealer |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071125125629/http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-0/1195810501231580.xml&amp;coll=2 |archivedate=November 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She became involved in the project during the time when the animators were designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to "translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion".&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Susan |last=King |title=Costumes fit for a Disney princess |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/1120enchantedcostumes1120.html |work=The Arizona Republic |date=November 20, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her goal was to keep the designs "Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new".&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"/&gt; However, May admitted this was difficult "because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in the psyche of the viewing audience for so long".&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nadine |last=Kam |title=Pouf!

For the character of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale–like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress at the beginning of the film directly contrasts her modern [[gown]] at the end of the film.&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"/&gt; The [[wedding dress]] served to provide a "humongous contrast to the flat drawings" and to accentuate the image of a [[Disney Princess]].&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"/&gt; In order to make the waist look small, the [[sleeve]]s are designed to be "extremely pouffy" and the [[skirt]] to be as big as possible, which included a metal [[hoop skirt|hoop]] that holds up 20 layers of petticoats and ruffles.&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"/&gt; Altogether, eleven versions of the dress are made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"/&gt; On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as "grueling" since "the entire weight was on her [[hip]]s, so occasionally it felt like she was in traction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Murray |title=Amy Adams Transforms Into a Princess for Enchanted |url=http://movies.about.com/od/enchanted/a/enchanted111507.htm |work=About.com |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130080936/http://movies.about.com/od/enchanted/a/enchanted111507.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Giselle, Prince Edward does not adapt to the real world and [[James Marsden]], who plays Edward, had only one costume designed for him. May's aim was to try "not to lose Marsden in the craziness of the outfit... where he still looks handsome".&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"/&gt; The costume also included padding in the chest, [[buttocks]], and crotch, which gave Marsden the "same exaggerated proportions as an animated character"&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"/&gt; and "posture – his back is straight, the sleeves are up and never collapse".&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"/&gt;

May was delighted that Lima "went for something more fashion-forward" with [[Susan Sarandon]]'s Queen Narissa.&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"/&gt; She decided to make her look like a "runway lady",&lt;ref name="TAR-2007nov20"/&gt; wearing something that is "still Disney" but also "high fashion, like something [[John Galliano]] or [[Thierry Mugler]] might design".&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"/&gt; Since Narissa appears in three media: [[traditional animation|hand drawn animation]], live-action, and [[computer animation]], May had to make sure that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of "color, [[shape]], and texture".&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"/&gt; The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked "reptilian", as well as a [[cape]].&lt;ref name="HSB-2007nov15"/&gt; Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the [[dragon]]'s form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like [[wing]]s, the [[wikt:layer|layers]] of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] that would turn into [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.&lt;ref name="ThePlainDealer-2007nov23"/&gt;

===Music===
{{See also|Enchanted (soundtrack)}}
The film's score was written by accomplished songwriter and composer [[Alan Menken]], who has worked on a number of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] films previously. Fellow composer [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] wrote the lyrics for six songs, also composed by Menken. Menken and Schwartz previously worked together on the songs for ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.

Menken became involved with the film in the early stages of the film's development and invited Schwartz to resume their collaboration.&lt;ref name="MO-music"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Stephen Schwartz &amp; Alan Menken Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13489.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224045624/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13489.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began the songwriting process by searching for the right moments in the story in which a song moment was allowed. Schwartz found that it was easier to justify situations in which the characters would burst into songs in ''Enchanted'' than in other live-action musicals as its concept "allowed the characters to sing in a way that was completely integral to the plot of the story."&lt;ref name="MO-music"/&gt; The three songs Giselle sings contain references to earlier Disney films. The first song played in the film, "True Love's Kiss", was written to be "a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features", namely, "I'm Wishing" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'') and "[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved.&lt;ref name="Playbill-2007nov18"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=Menken &amp; Schwartz Are "Enchanted"; Plus Bosco, Chenoweth, "Hairspray" |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |work=Playbill |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108225856/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113379.html |archivedate=January 8, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It posed a challenge for Menken and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] because of the "many preconceptions with that number"; it had to be reflective of the era of ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref name="MO-music"/&gt; Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sheila |last=Roberts |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |work=MoviesOnline |accessdate=2015-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both "[[Happy Working Song]]" and "[[That's How You Know (musical number)|That's How You Know]]" also pay tributes to past Disney songs. "Happy Working Song" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as "[[Whistle While You Work]]" (''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), "The Work Song" (''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''), "[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]" (''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'') and "Making Christmas" (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''), and a musical homage to the [[Sherman Brothers]] (with a self-parodic "Alan Menken style" middle eight). "That's How You Know" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as "[[Under the Sea]]" (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') and "[[Be Our Guest]]" (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'').&lt;ref name="Playbill-2007nov18"/&gt; To achieve this, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Schwartz]] admitted he had to "push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics" while maintaining "the classic Walt Disney sensibility".&lt;ref name="MO-music"/&gt; However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been "a little tongue-in-cheek".&lt;ref name="MO-music"/&gt; As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad "[[So Close (Jon McLaughlin song)|So Close]]" and the country/pop number "Ever Ever After" (sung by [[Carrie Underwood]] as a voice-over).&lt;ref name="Playbill-2007nov18"/&gt;

Out of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film. The title song, "Enchanted," a duet featuring [[Idina Menzel]] and [[James Marsden]], was the only song of Menken's and Schwartz's authorship and composition that was deleted from the movie.&lt;ref name="SFWire-2007nov13"/&gt;

===Effects===
The majority of the visual effects shots in ''Enchanted'' were done by [[Tippett Studio]] in Berkeley, California, who contributed a total of 320 shots. These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the "Happy Working Song" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with [[wire removal]]s and composites. [[Reel FX Creative Studios]] did four visual effects shots involving the pop-up book page-turn transitions while [[Weta Digital]] did two.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld-2007nov21"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=319b255d&amp;atype=articles&amp;id=3458&amp;page=1 |title=Enchanted: Conjuring Fairytale VFX |accessdate=January 3, 2008 |last=Wolff |first=Ellen |date=November 21, 2007 |work=VFXWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all the animals that appear in the "[[Happy Working Song]]" sequence, the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons. The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CG rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes. On the other hand, all the cockroaches were CG characters.&lt;ref name="TCGSociety-2007dec4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=4351 |title=Sweet Enchanted Satire |access-date=January 3, 2008 |last=Robertson |first=Barbara |date=December 4, 2007 |work=The Computer Graphics Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pip, a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from "every conceivable angle", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and Furrocious.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld-2007nov21"/&gt; When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage.&lt;ref name="LAT-2007dec02"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ron |last=Magid |title=A new wrinkle in the face of evil |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-enchanted2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 2, 2007 |access-date=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have.&lt;ref name="TCGSociety-2007dec4"/&gt; During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld-2007nov21"/&gt;

Unlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld-2007nov21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT-2007dec02"/&gt; The CG dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch.&lt;ref name="LAT-2007dec02"/&gt; When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the [[Woolworth Building]] while clutching Robert in her claws, a [[greenscreen]] rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a "puppeteering" approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.&lt;ref name="VFXWorld-2007nov21"/&gt;

=== Merchandising ===
Disney had originally planned to add Giselle to the [[Disney Princess]] line-up, as was shown at a 2007 Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with Disney Princess status, but decided against it when they realized they would have to pay for lifelong rights to [[Amy Adams]]' image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Merissa |last=Marr |title=Disney Reaches to the Crib To Extend Princess Magic |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119543097711697381.html |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the Disney Princesses, ''Enchanted'' merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise.

[[File:Amy Adams (actress).jpg|alt=Casual head shot of blue-eyed young woman with long reddish-blond hair pulled back.|thumb|right|200px|Amy Adams received praise for her role as Giselle.]]
Positive reviews praised the film's take on a classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers as well as the performance of its lead actress, [[Amy Adams]]. [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" and one that "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Enchanted |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071120/REVIEWS/711200302/1023 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[LA Weekly]]'' remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. ''LA Weekly'' described the film as "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'') but hasn't managed to get right until now"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Movie Reviews: Enchanted, August Rush, Hitman, Holly |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film-reviews/movie-reviews-enchanted-august-rush-hitman-holly/17754/ |work=LA Weekly |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=December 24, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212055515/http://www.laweekly.com/film%2Btv/film-reviews/movie-reviews-enchanted-august-rush-hitman-holly/17754/ |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Todd McCarthy of ''Variety'' commented, "More than Disney's strictly animated product, ''Enchanted'', in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat."&lt;ref name="Variety-2007nov18"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Todd |last=McCarthy |title=Enchanted |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935452.html |work=Variety |date=November 18, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Enchanted'' was the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]]'s choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' named it the 4th best film of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml |title=Metacritic: 2007 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |accessdate=January 5, 2008 |work=Metacritic |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080102102034/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2007/toptens.shtml |archivedate = January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' all gave the film three out of four,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peter |last=Travers |authorlink=Peter Travers |title=Enchanted |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14580510/review/17335318/enchanted |work=Rolling Stone |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419081342/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14580510/review/17335318/enchanted |archivedate = April 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ryan |last=Stewart |title=Enchanted |url=http://www.premiere.com/Review/Movies/Enchanted |work=Premiere |date=November 26, 2007 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007nov20-rev"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Claudia |last=Puig |title=Disney's ''Enchanted'' lives up to its name |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2007-11-20-enchanted_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=November 20, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe-2007nov21"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Wesley |last=Morris |title=Enchanted: A movie princess is born |url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&amp;id=8923 |work=The Boston Globe |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' gave the film a B grade.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun-2007nov21"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Sragow |authorlink=Michael Sragow |title=''Enchanted'' and star Amy Adams charm |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/bal-to.enchanted21nov21,0,3991218.story |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102022445/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/bal-to.enchanted21nov21,0,3991218.story |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 2, 2013 |work=Baltimore Sun |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited that although the story is relatively predictable, the way in which the predictability of the film is part of the story, the amazingly extravagant musical numbers, along with the way in which Disney pokes fun at its traditional line of animated movies outweighs any squabbles about storyline or being unsure of what age bracket the film is made for. Michael Sragow of ''Baltimore Sun'' remarked that the film's "piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie-making and uncertain tone",&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun-2007nov21"/&gt; while Claudia Puig of ''USA Today'' stated that "though it's a fairly predictable fish-out-of-water tale (actually a princess-out-of-storybook saga), the casting is so perfect that it takes what could have been a ho-hum idea and renders it magical."&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007nov20-rev"/&gt;

Amy Adams herself garnered many favorable reviews. Reviewers praised her singing ability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/enchanted/fr/enchant112107.htm|title=Enchanted Movie Review|author=Rebecca Murray|work=About.com|accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |title=Amy Adams Interview, Enchanted |author=Sheila Roberts |work=MoviesOnline.ca |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212716/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_13467.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that her performance, which was compared by some to her [[Academy Award]]-nominated performance in ''[[Junebug (film)|Junebug]]'', has made Adams a movie star, likening it to [[Mary Poppins (film)|''Mary Poppins'']]{{'}} effect on [[Julie Andrews]]' career.&lt;ref name="Variety-2007nov18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe-2007nov21"/&gt; Similarly, film critics [[Richard Roeper]] and [[Michael Phillips (theatre critic)|Michael Phillips]], who gave the film positive reviews on ''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper]]'', emphasized the effect of Adams' performance on the film with remarks like "Amy Adams is this movie" and "Amy Adams shows how to make a comic cliché work like magic." However, both agreed that the final sequence involving the computer-generated dragon "bogged down" the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=5526 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071125181711/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=5526 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-11-25 |title=Ebert &amp; Roeper: Review of ''Enchanted'' |accessdate=January 4, 2008 |last=Roeper |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Roeper |author2=Michael Phillips |authorlink2=Michael Phillips (critic)  |date=November 2007 |work=At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' stated that the film was targeted at children but agreed with other reviewers that the "extremely game cast" was the film's best asset. It gave the film three out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Olly |last=Richards |title=Reviews: ''Enchanted'' |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=11163 |work=Empire |year=2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''TIME'' gave the film a C-, stating that the film "cannibalizes Walt's vault for jokes" and "fails to find a happy ending that doesn't feel two-dimensional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Downtime: ''Enchanted'' |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1623143_1687170_1687164,00.html |work=Time |date=November 23, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Peter Bradshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that the film "assumes a beady-eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality" and that Adams' performance was the "only decent thing in this overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness". Bradshaw gave the film two out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw |title=Enchanted |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,2227039,00.html |work=The Guardian |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disney references==
{{main|List of Disney references in Enchanted}}
&lt;!-- Add references at the main article, not here. --&gt;
According to director Kevin Lima, "thousands" of references are made to past and future works of Disney in ''Enchanted'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Peter |last=Sciretta |title=The Enchanted Visual Guide |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/03/14/the-enchanted-visual-guide/ |work=SlashFilm.com |date=March 14, 2008 |accessdate=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serve as both a parody of and a "giant love letter to Disney classics".&lt;ref name="TNYT-2007nov25"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Brooks |last=Barnes |title=The Line Between Homage and Parody |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/business/media/25steal.html |work=The New York Times |date=November 25, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took almost eight years for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Studios]] to greenlight the production of the film because it "was always quite nervous about the tone in particular".&lt;ref name="TNYT-2007nov25"/&gt; As Lima worked with [[Bill Kelly (writer)|Bill Kelly]], the writer, to inject Disney references to the plot, it became "an obsession"; he derived the name of every character as well as anything that needed a name from past Disney films to bring in more Disney references.&lt;ref name="SFW-2007nov20"/&gt;

While Disney animators have occasionally inserted a Disney character into background shots – for example, [[Donald Duck]] appears in a crowd in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' – they have avoided "mingling characters" from other Disney films for fear of weakening their individual mythologies.&lt;ref name="TNYT-2007nov25"/&gt; In ''Enchanted'', characters from past Disney films are openly seen, such as the appearances of [[Thumper (Bambi)|Thumper]] and [[Flower (Bambi)|Flower]] from ''[[Bambi]]'' in the 2D animation portion of the film.&lt;ref name="TNYT-2007nov25"/&gt; Disney references are also made through camera work, [[Set construction|sets]], [[costume]]s, music and dialogue. Obvious examples include the use of poisoned apples from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and True Love's Kiss from ''Snow White'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''.&lt;ref name="USAToday-2007nov22-New"/&gt; [[Dick Cook]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, admitted that part of the goal of ''Enchanted'' was to create a new franchise (through the character of Giselle) and to revive the older ones.&lt;ref name="TNYT-2007nov25"/&gt;&lt;!-- Add references at the main article, not here. --&gt;

==Sequel==
In February 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] planned to film a sequel with [[Barry Josephson]] and [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] producing again. Jessie Nelson was attached to write the screenplay and [[Anne Fletcher]] to direct. Disney hoped the cast members from the first film would return and for a release as early as 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118014677.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2248 | title='Enchanted' to see second chapter | last=Graser | first=Marc | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | date=February 3, 2010 | accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2011, composer [[Alan Menken]] was asked about the sequel in an interview. His reply was, "I've heard things but there's nothing yet. I don't know much about what's happening with that. Honestly, I don't know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. I love doing that, I really do. But I'm not frustrated that it isn't one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I'm busy enough with that, so I really don't need more on my plate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/rapunzel/a/Alan-Menken-Interview.htm |title=Exclusive Alan Menken Interview - Tangled, Musical Comedy TV Series, Enchanted 2 and Snow Queen |publisher=Movies.about.com |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120180232/http://movies.about.com/od/rapunzel/a/Alan-Menken-Interview.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2011, in an interview for his latest film, ''[[Hop (film)|Hop]]'', [[James Marsden]] was asked about the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=75545 |title=Exclusive: James Marsden on Hop |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=2011-03-28 |accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I don't know. I think that the clock is ticking on that one. [[Amy Adams]] and I are both saying, "If there's going to be a sequel, we're not getting any younger." Since we play sort of ageless animated characters. Hopefully we do. That was something really special and I'd love to come back and do another. I've heard the same things you've heard.

'''Faroese art''' is art by artists living in the [[Faroe Islands]] and art by Faroese nationals living abroad. In the Faroe Islands, art is an important part of everyday life and in the public debate. It may be the special light in the Faroes which causes so many to express themselves in painting.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The ever-changing Faroese weather and light provide opportunities for endless nuances, something which has fascinated both foreign and local artists over the years. However, the history of [[Faroese people|Faroese]] art is short, and can only be dated a couple of hundred years back. Lack of time, light and materiel may have caused the late appearance of painting. But despite this, the islands have a very active art scene. A great many of the Faroese artists of today resent being reminded that Faroese art is a comparatively recent phenomenon. They find such an observation annoying as regards their artistic work, and they claim that such a statement has no bearing whatsoever on them as artists as their frame of reference is both local and global.&lt;ref name="bryggenart1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bryggenart.com/en/art_faroese.php|title=bryggenart.com at Directnic|website=www.BryggenArt.com|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the first Faroese painters the [[landscape]] became a national icon and it has remained the central topic in Faroese visual art. The grip that Faroese art, motifically speaking, takes on the Faroese landscape might seem to be a rather old-fashioned approach to visual art. The interest in installations, minimalism and conceptual art, has so far not affected Faroese art much. The village by the ocean is probably the motif which has been repeated the most. [[Danish people|Danish]] art critic Ole Nørlyng concludes that nature, the wild landscape, is the driving force behind Faroese artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://samvit.info/index.php/arts/faroese-art&lt;/ref&gt; but except for a close affinity with the landscape and culture of the islands, there has always been great diversity in Faroese art.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Pioneers ==
[[File:Didrikur a skarvanesi1.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Díðrikur á Skarvanesi]] (1802–1865). This is one of the oldest preserved works in Faroese art. This painting together with four others by the same artist represent the beginning of the history of Faroese visuel art]]
The first paintings art historians are familiar with are those by Díðrikur í Kárastovu. He was a farmer who commonly was known as [[Díðrikur á Skarvanesi]] (1802–1865). Díðrikur was settled in a small village, [[Skarvanes]], on the island [[Sandoy]]. His subjects were real and imaginary birds in vivid colours. Although not in perfect condition, five of his paintings have been preserved. They are a feature in the permanent exhibition at the national Faroese [[art museum]], [[Listasavn Føroya]]. One of his better paintings is entitled ''Moon Doves''.

[[Niels Kruse]] (1871–1951) was the first Faroese landscape painter, a theme which was to become a most common motif in Faroese art. Kruse lived in the village [[Eiði]] on the island [[Eysturoy]]. Kruse was almost completely self-taught. He was fortunate enough to receive some help and advice from an American explorer, [[Elizabeth Taylor (painter)|Elizabeth Taylor]], who stayed in the Faroes in 1895. In 1924 one of his works was accepted by a gallery in [[Denmark]]. This marked a turning point in Faroese art history, as this was the first time ever a painter had succeeded outside of the Islands. Kruse even managed to make a living from his painting, again something which earlier had been unheard of.

There were some other painters from this early generation. Both [[Kristin í Geil]] and [[Jógvan Waagstein]] are worth mentioning. Both of them were well settled in [[Tórshavn]]. And again, these two were self-taught landscape painters. As was the case with Kruse, Waagstein received knowledge and advice from Elizabeth Taylor. Later on í Geil received some schooling from Kruse. These two latter, however, never made their living exclusively from painting.

These painters were all pioneers in the field of visual art in the Faroes, and they helped to make their fellow countrymen aware of the art of painting. The late 19th century marks the beginning of a Faroese art tradition slowly developing for the first time. There are several reasons for this being so. The arrival of Elizabeth Taylor with her knowledge of art helped to inspired several to start painting. And most importantly the late 19th century sparked the beginning of the national movement. The national revival brought with it the love of the landscape - a brand new theme which was to become a national icon, more so than anywhere in visual art. The theme came to dominate all through the 20th century.

With the first painters, the love and affection of the homeland was obvious, and still in the 21st Century the theme is being treated by a new generation of artists. However, several painters contributed to Faroese artists developing a passion for many different styles and subjects.

== Mothers and fathers of Faroese art ==
The real history of Faroese art starts in 1927, when three young artists held an exhibition in [[Tórshavn]]. Two of these were [[Sámal Joensen-Mikines]] (1906–1979) and [[William Heinesen]] (1900–1990).

The first, Mikines, came to be known as the father of Faroese art and the first Faroese artist to become internationally recognised. More importantly he was the very first Faroese artist to acquire an artistic degree. Mikines began his education at the Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in 1928 with Aksel Jørgensen and Ejnar Nielsen as his teachers. Mikines was artistically highly inspired by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] artist [[Edvard Munch]], and had a great admiration for [[El Greco]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]. His early paintings are [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]], but later he became an expressive figurative painter. He was very original in his choice of colour and design. Mikines demonstrated a new approach to substance and form in painting which had a profound influence on Faroese art. He painted funerals, steep mountains and landscapes. His paintings of [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|pilot whaling]] became important to future artists. He introduced the possibility of allowing the landscape to mirror the painter´s inner life.

William Heinesen was a very different type of artist. Literature was his vocation. Although he considered himself an amateur in visual art, he created some very important works in Faroese art. His imagery doesn't evolve around the landscape. Folktale, satire and everyday life are Heinesen's subjects.

[[File:Kaededans.jpg|thumb|300px|''Chain Dance'' 1939 by [[Janus Kamban]]. Kamban was a Faroese sculptor and a representative of the "first generation" of professional artists in the Faroe Islands. Photo: Ole Wich]]

===After World War II===
During this period a new era had begun in Faroese visual art. Mikines wasn't the only one from his generation who received his formal training in Copenhagen. Faroese art experienced a virtual blossoming after World War II, when several talented and productive artists returned to the Faroe Islands after finishing their studies in Denmark. The range of motifs and styles were greatly expanded.

A new generation of artists, who had acquired artistic degrees didn't want to use their art for the sole purpose of expressing their love for their country. The ones who followed included the classical modernist [[Janus Kamban]] (1913–2009), the colourist [[Ruth Smith (artist)|Ruth Smith]] (1913–1958), the graphical artist [[Elinborg Lützen]] (1915–1995) and the great abstract painter [[Ingálvur av Reyni]] (1920–2005). Together with Mikines and Heinesen, these are the mothers and fathers of Faroese art.
* Kamban was the first Faroese [[sculptor]]. In style he ranges from the strictly naturalistic to the classically simple. His subjects are usually people, and he uses clay, bronze and basaltic rock for his sculptures. As a graphic artist, Kamban mostly portrays the Faroese landscape.
* Smith was one of the most talented Faroese artists. Her subjects were scenery and faces. She worked very consciously with colour. Over a period of twenty years she painted numerous self-portraits, one has been held as one of the finest portraits in Scandinavian art.
* Lützen´s work is full of creatures from the world of myth, legend and folktale.  With Lützen the graphic arts became an independent art form which enriched the artistic milieu through her all-absorbing interest in the technique of linocut, and the result of her artistic work is of high quality and intensity measured by any standard.&lt;ref name="bryggenart1"/&gt;
* Av Reyni has been the most influential of them all. The dynamic lines and the temperamental pastose brushwork has become a vital part the Faroese painting tradition. Av Reyni introduced cubism, abstract expressionism and suprematism to the Faroes. His early works were rather naturalistic landscapes, but in the early 1960s he dissolved the romantic and impressionist landscape, when he started to paint more and more abstract. His paintings usually contain a figurative core, which is described by the title of his paintings. As a black-and-white artist, he has drawn many portraits as well as landscapes. He is ranked as one of the great modernists in [[Scandinavia]].

== Landscape expressionists ==

[[File:Inside Norðoyatunnilin 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Light art inside deep-sea tunnel ''Norðoyatunnilin'' by [[Tróndur Patursson]], who is well known both as a painter and as a sculptor. Above all, he is widely known for his glass paintings.]]

The common denomination “landscape expressionist” comprises a group of diverse artists, solely because the nature and landscape are central themes in their work. [[Zacharias Heinesen]] (1936), Thomas Arge (1942–1978), [[Tróndur Patursson]] (1943), Torbjørn Olsen (1956), Barður Jákupsson (1943) and Amariel Norðoy (1945) all belong to this group, as do many others.
This large generation of painters from the 1930´s to 1960´s has been able to find common stylistic expressions.
They exploit the full spectrum of the formal possibilities painting has to offer. They work with the unified whole and detail. Sometimes the subject matter almost disappears in the pure abstraction of the colours and forms, but rarely completely. A reminiscence of the landscape always remains. Not as a true-to-life reproduction, but as a landscape experience which is communicated via a variety of temperaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lauritz.com/Article/Article.aspx?LanguageId=2&amp;article=1720|title=Lauritz.com - Faroese art history|website=www.Lauritz.com|access-date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So great has their contribution to Faroese art been that for a long time a genuine Faroese painting should preferably be a highly colouristic, expressive and semi abstract landscape, filled with North-Atlantic drama. It is not an unusual criticism that Faroese art relies too heavily on nature as a motif. But when the variety of expression is taken into account, the criticism doesn't seem fair{{to whom|date=September 2013}}.
* Zacharias Heinesen has in his paintings explored the light and colours of the landscape and tried to render the ephemeral moment.
* In Thomas Arge´s paintings we get a glimpse of the inner structures, shapes and colours of the landscape.
* Bárður Jákupsson has found shapes and colours that others probably do not notice in Faroese Nature.
* In Tróndur Patursson´s work it is the sense of immensity of nature that gains significance.
* The village by the ocean is probably the motif which has been repeated the most in Faroese art. In Countless paintings Amariel Norðoy has repeated the motif and shown it contains unlimited possibilities.

But despite the light and distinct colours of nature and scenery, Faroese art is not exclusively landscape.

== Contemporary Faroese art ==
The landscape has been the national theme of Faroese painting, arguably as a collectively chosen shell around the core of modern painting. In recent years, however, other subjects have emerged and appear to be edging out the landscape. The common denominator for the younger generation of Faroese artists is that they all have managed to outline new directions for Faroese art, while at the same time, relating with insight to the Faroese landscape tradition. The interest in the human mind, existential or philosophical questions or the internal landscapes seems to rise. The [[postmodern]] interest in contemporary philosophy, mass media and politics has begun to appear in Faroese art, and has emerged concomitantly with its appearance in other countries. One of the artist working in this field is [[Ole Wich]] (1953), who has worked with cross media art on the internet connected to present political and culturel issues in the faroese society, as well as conceptuel pieces places between visual expression and science.

The Faroese visual art has hardly ever been as manifold as it is today, although the genre remains traditional painting. There is a lot of pessimism among the artists themselves. They are doubtful of the future of Faroese art and they fear that the small-scaled nature and isolation of Faroese art may prove to be insurmountable handicaps.  In the long run, they say 50,000 people and a couple of dozen artists will not be able to sustain a living artistic culture.  Naturally, there is a danger that it might stagnate and die from lack of nourishment.  At the same time, it is difficult to see how things could go so wrong while the need is so great.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thearctic.is/articles/cases/art%20in%20the%20north/enska/kafli_003.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many young artists who are currently identifying new paths for Faroese art. The younger generation of Faroese artists has mainly chosen to reside abroad as has Hansina Iversen, who is based in Copenhagen and Hanni Bjartalíð in Helsinki.
* [[Hansina Iversen]] (1966) ostensibly distances herself from nature as a motif. Her pictures are non-figurative and pure, seemingly purified of motif. The smooth fluency of her works are an exploration of the absolute and, thus, nature. Iversen has created a new philosophical approach to the Faroese Landscape tradition.
* [[Hanni Bjartalíð]] (1968) uses [[humour]] to describe man´s relation to nature. His imagery is primarily of the modern world. Modern man´s alienation from nature is a natural theme in his art. Bjartalíð demonstrates great freedom regarding Faroese and Nordic art landscape traditions, which are associated with romantic conception of a unique Nordic soul characterised by a close relation to nature.
* [[Edward Fuglø]] (1965) avoids landscapes; his symbolism concerns people. He creates surreal-comic and [[ironic]] paintings. Fuglø observes and mocks people – mostly men – in their absurd activities. The images are always pointed at political or perhaps art-political commentary. His imagery is in many ways innovative in the Faroese tradition. Fuglø is also one of the best illustrators in the Faroes.

== Art galleries ==
In the Faroe Islands there is a great interest in buying Faroese art to decorate your home with. This appreciation means that it is easy to find art galleries round about the islands.  Some galleries are dedicated to local artists, while others have regular exhibitions. But the number of art galleries is highest in [[Tórshavn]].

[[File:Listasavn Føroya.jpg|thumb|220px| The largest collection af Faroese art is on display at [[Listasavn Føroya]], the art museum in Tórshavn]]
* In Tórshavn you will find the national [[art museum]] [[Listasavn Føroya]]. The Art Museum was founded in 1989. The present gallery was opened in 1993. The exhibition building is faced with black tarred wood, and has elements of traditional Faroese building. It is surrounded by trees, as it is situated next to a park. The permanent collection displays some of the best works by William Heinesen, Ingálvur av Reyni and Sámal Mikines. Each year two exhibitions take place that focus exclusively on Faroese artists. The first one is the spring exhibition in May; the second is the annual [[Saint Olav]]'s Day exhibition in late July. Whereas the first one exclusively features professional artists, the latter one mainly features [[amateurs]].
* Listahøllin is situated in a green concrete building at Tórshavn Shipyard.
* In [[Vágur]] located in the island [[Suðuroy]] the southernmost island, there is a [[Ruth Smith (artist)|Ruth Smith]] [[Art Museum]]. The art museum has artworks (paintings and drawings) made by Ruth Smith.
* In [[Sandur, Faroe Islands|Sandur]], the main village on [[Sandoy]], there is an art museum "Listasavnið á Sandi" with artworks (paintings, sculptures etc.) by various Faroese artists. The art collection and the museum building was donated to the village in 2005 by a Sofus Olsen, who grew up in Sandur, but lived in Tórshavn for many years. The museum opened on his 92nd birthday.

== Art on stamps ==
Several paintings by Faroese artists have been featured on stamps. All Faroese stamp editions are about items relating to the Faroes and most of them are designed by Faroese artists. Faroese art is among the main motifs, both in reproductions of important paintings and in involving the artists in drawing stamps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28141">[[Fashion]] in [[Nigeria]] has always been diverse, reflecting its many ethnic groups, religions, and cultures. Recently, the Nigerian [[fashion industry]] has developed more participants, exposure, structure, presence, earnings, and training. Many now work in the industry as [[clothing designer]]s, [[fashion models]], clothing stylists, [[Fashion photography|fashion photographers]], [[Make-up artist|makeup artists]], [[hair stylists]], [[cosmetologists]], and [[Fashion journalism|fashion journalists]]. Magazines devoted to '''fashion in Nigeria''' are now common. Nigeria's New Fashion Week has grown in attendance, with long streets dedicated to fashion retailers in the major cities of Nigeria.&lt;ref name=stylehousefiles&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stylehousefiles.com/50-years-of-fashion-in-nigeria-the-journey-so-far/|title=50 Years of Fashion in Nigeria – The Journey so Far…. – Style House Files|website=www.stylehousefiles.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional clothing vs. Western clothing ==
Recognition for Nigerian fashion has been slow in the global fashion industry, which is mostly based in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. Many assume that Africans only wear [[Folk costume|traditional garb]] or using clothing solely functionally (to cover the body and protect it from environmental factors).&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://africanheritage.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/nigerian-fashion-through-the-years/|title=Nigerian Fashion: Through the Years|date=2007-01-12|website=African Heritage|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in many African countries, clothes have historically been decorative as well as scarring, painting, [[tattoo]]ing, or [[Jewellery|jewelry]].&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

There are definite distinctions between traditional Nigerian clothing and [[Western wear|Western clothing]] in Nigeria. Traditional clothing signifies which ethnic group one belongs to, and can indicate one's [[gender]], class, [[religion]], and [[region]]. For instance, city and rural dwellers in Nigeria can easily distinguish [[Eastern Nigeria]]n ways of dressing from [[Northern Nigeria]]n or [[Western Nigeria]]n ways. This is because the different lifestyles call for different clothing styles.

== History ==

===Pre-colonial fashion===
Nigerian traditional clothing has reflected the cultures of Nigeria's hundreds of ethnic groups. In pre-colonial times, Nigerians wore their traditional garb all of the time. In modern times, many Nigerians only wear traditional clothing for special occasions, or to work on Fridays, and also for religious gatherings e.g. in the church or the mosque.

==== Edo nation ====

Women on the other hand wear a "Buba" and "[[Iro (garment)|Iro]]" and tie a "[[Head tie|Gele]]" over their heads and "[[Ipele (garment)|Ipele]]" over the shoulders. The Gele and Ipele must match. "Buba" is like a shirt for men and a low round neck top for women.&lt;ref name=nairaland/&gt;

==== Igbo Nation ====
[[File:Ude_Oko_Chukwu.jpg|thumb|235x235px|An Igbo man]]

The [[Igbo people|Igbo People—]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;an umbrella term for groups such as [[Mbaise]], Ika, Aniocha, [[Ikwerre people|Ikwerre]](disputed), and Orlu—occupy South Eastern and parts of South-Southern Nigeria, living in such states as [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Delta State|Delta]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]].

Some Igbo groups tie a white wrapper across their shoulders.&lt;ref name=nairaland/&gt;

==== Hausa/Kanuri/Fulani Nation ====

[[File:Ibibio in traditional attire.jpg|thumb|Ibibio couple in trad]]

==== Efik/Ibibio/Annang/Oron/Eket Nation ====
The [[Efik people]] and [[Ibibio people]] occupy [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa-Ibom]] and [[Cross River State|Cross-River States]] in South-Southern Nigeria, migrants from Cameroon in pre-colonial times, according to oral tradition. Their dress resembles that of the Igbo people, with some major differences.&lt;ref name=nairaland/&gt;

==== Ijaw Nation ====
The [[Ijaw people]] occupy [[Bayelsa State|Bayelsa]], Rivers, Delta, Akwa-Ibom and Ondo States. They make up the fourth largest ethnic group in Nigeria. They have cultural similarities with the neighbouring Itsekiri and Urhobo/Isoko people and dress like them.&lt;ref name=nairaland/&gt;

==== Itsekiri Nation ====
The [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiris]] are a minority ethnic group whose people occupy Delta South. Itsekiris live in [[Warri North]], [[Warri South]], [[Warri South West]], and [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]]. The Itsekiris were originally Yoruba people, but migrated and mixed with the Edo, Urhobo, and Ijaw people as well as the Portuguese. Itsekiris dress like the Urhobos and Ijaws. Their royalty put on white with a colored girdle depending on the occasion.&lt;ref name=nairaland/&gt;

=== Colonial and post-colonial fashion ===
During colonialism and into the modern period, Nigerians slowly began to wear more and more Western clothes, including blouses, skirts, dress pants, and wigs, especially in schools and government jobs. Fashion in the rural areas has not changed much over this period, however.

In his 1971 song, "Gentleman," [[Fela Kuti]] made fun of businessmen who rejected their native garb when they made became mildly successful, and only wore English suits, acting as though they were better than everyone else. He proudly declares, "I no be gentleman at all-o, I be Africa man, original" in his commentary on those who had inferiority complexes about their non-Western cultures and lost their roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/music-is-the-weapon-the-10-rarest-fela-kuti-records/|title=Music Is The Weapon: The 10 essential Fela Kuti records - The Vinyl Factory|website=www.thevinylfactory.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Nigerian fashion began to mirror its status as an independence nation. People began to wear their traditionally Nigerian outfits in urban areas and to work, church, and so on. Today, it is fairly uncommon for businessmen in Nigeria to wear English suits.

== Textiles and weaving ==
Weaving in Nigeria is traced to Eastern Nigeria. Archaeological evidence of early textiles supposedly woven from brass and leaf fibers has been discovered and they date over a thousand years. But whether strips were woven simultaneously or individually is difficult to say, as no further evidence was available to corroborate this.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

Kano cloths is the 1590s, was said to be used as currency. Researchers such as Barth (1851) observed that dyed and woven cotton were the main products of Kano. He described over 20 different kinds of cloth made in Kano and all its environs.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

During the later part of 1800s, locally woven fabrics were exported to other parts of Nigeria and other countries. This was sadly reduced by the large imports of printed cloth from England, which could be purchased more cheaply than hand-woven fabrics. Still, the hand woven cloth remains treasured for important ceremonies and events. This was bolstered by the nationalism generated by the independence in 1960.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;
[[File:Ankara_monostrap_dress.jpg|thumb|302x302px|Example of an ankara dress]]
There are two primary types of weaving done on two different types of looms, in Nigeria, especially in the Western region. While men and youth use a narrow, horizontal loom with meddles and treadles to weave strips of cloth infinite yardage, the women are primarily responsible for growing and processing the fibre for weaving. In towns like Oyo and Ilorin, the people plant, cultivate and harvest cotton fibres. They also spin and dye.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

Ankara fabric, not referring to the capital of Turkey of the same name, is a 100% cotton fabric filled with vibrant patterns and African motifs. It is commonly referred to as Dutch wax or Holland wax, African print, or African wax prints.&lt;ref name=Ankara&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allthingsankara.com/2014/09/wax-print-what-is-ankara-what-is-ankara-fabric.html|title=Wax Print: What is Ankara? ... What is Ankara Fabric?|date=2014-09-19|newspaper=All Things Ankara|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara print Fabrics are  made through an Indonesian wax-resist dyeing technique called Batik.In this technique, methods are used to "resist" the dye from reaching all the cloth, thereby creating a pattern. The lack of divergence in color intensity helps with the determination of the (front) right and (back) wrong side of the fabric. Ankara print fabrics are most often sold in 12 yards as "full piece" or 6 yards as "half piece". The fabric company/producer, The type of fabric/product and registration number is printed on the selvage of the fabric, to notify people of the quality and to protect the designs from imitators.&lt;ref name=Ankara/&gt;

The wax fabric can be sorted into categories of quality due to the processes of manufacturing. The colors comply with the local preferences of the costumers.  Some wax prints can be named after personalities, cities, building, sayings or occasions.&lt;ref name=Ankara/&gt; The Nigerian textile industry is very strong, and nearly all the cloth produced in Nigeria goes to clothing the large Nigerian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmKMUM7|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankara Print fabrics can be worn for both regular outings, and some people wear it as "aso ebi" for special occasions such as birthday celebrations, weddings, balls, etc. Aso ebi is a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word and means "clothes of the family". Family members, relatives and close friends usually dress up in the same print for a special occasion.&lt;ref name=Ankara/&gt;

There has also been a reawakening of Nigerians to fashionably embrace local fabrics like aso-oke,&lt;ref&gt;Agbadudu, A.B. and Ogunrin, F.O. (2006) ‘Aso‐oke: A Nigerian classic style and fashion fabric’, ''Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal'', 10(1), pp. 97–113. doi: 10.1108/13612020610651150.&lt;/ref&gt; adire, and Nigerian wax. Some designers, like [[Ituen Basi]], opt to only use Nigerian wax in their designs; she has even designed a line of ankara footwear, jewelry, bags, and accessories. This print craze recently caught on with the Western fashion world and this time, Africa, specifically Nigeria, has become a major muse.&lt;ref name=stylehousefiles/&gt;

== Embroidery ==
Embroidery is like a stamp of African aesthetic on an outfit. Modern designs are given exotic embroidery patterns in order to marry western and African imprints. The history of embroidery in Nigeria dates back to centuries, and it has become integral part of Nigerian dressing. Among the Nupe and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] research has proved that embroidery has been a long tradition and it is used on many types of garments, from Hausa farmers cloths to riding robes and ceremonial apparels.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

The embroidery done on men's clothes is traditionally made with dark stitches with asymmetrical and non-representational designs. Gorgeously, voluminous robes, intricately embroidered are a symbol of prestige and rank for men in Nupe and Hausa communities. Designs of the Nupe embroiders are well known and prized by Nupe and Hausa people. Three types of stitches are primarily used. They are the chain stitch, the buttonhole stitch and couching. The stitching is done with either imported or silk thread on either imported or hand-woven cloth. Often, silk thread in its own creamy color called Tsmia in Hausa is used for the most prestigious Rigona robes on hand-woven narrow band cloth which is most times, creamy in color.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

There are still other types of embroidery designs in the country. These embroidered cloths are used as bedspread, tablecloth or wall hangings. Some artists say the colorful and cheerful cloths are the examples of "folk art". But the Hausa call it "Hausa bridal sheets". What is note worthy in these cloths is that the embroidery designs and traditional house decorations have similar motifs.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

Embroidery was not also natural to the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] but surface designs for body paintings were easily converted to embroidery designs for table linens in the Igbo town of [[Arochukwu]]. [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] men have also used some embroidery on clothing, round the neck of their traditional [[agbada]].&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

== Headgear ==
There was time in Nigeria when headgear popularly called "gele" (another [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word) was almost compulsory for Nigerian women. In the 1950s and 1960s, gele was for the fashion diva of that time, the ultimate headgear. The women proudly wore gele to the admiration of other women from other climes.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

The glory of gele was however, highest in 1960, the year of Independence. Lagos was agog that year and to reflect the festive mood, Nigerian women wasted no time in upgrading the fashion to catch the euphoria of the moment. Different headgears also came in with the euphoria one of which was Onilegororo. This was one of the sky-scrapping head gears and it marked a new level of sophistication and the status symbol for society women. Today the members of the wealthy elite are easily identifiable by their fancy clothing and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ma-Ni/Nigeria.html#ixzz4RSmxlPtQ|title=Culture of Nigeria - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onilegororo, after the independence, was quickly replaced by Flora Azikiwe, the style, in honour of late First Lady and wife of the president of the new republic. From then, it became the vogue to name headgears after public edifices and personalities, from [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] to [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], [[Yakubu Gowon|Yakubu Gown]], [[Eko Bridge]] and [[National Electric Power Authority in Nigeria|National Electric Power Authority]] (NEPA). NEPA, patterned after the statute of [[Sango, The God-King|Sango]], god of thunder and lightning, which is the logo for NEPA, came into being in the 70s as a mark of recognition of the once mighty corporation. In appreciation of the beauty and architectural excellence of the National Theatre, a replica was fashioned by the lists which became known is National Theatre headgear.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

But after the euphoria of independence warned, the love for headgear waned too. By the 1980s, following the ban on importation, the inflow of headgears reduced dramatically and with it, the imagination of the ingenious stylists whose fort it was to come up will names and styles. The [[Structural Adjustment Programme]] (SAP) played a significant role in demise of the gele. The fall of the national currency, the [[Nigerian naira|naira]], forced the prices of gele out of the reach of the average Nigerian woman. The urge then was to satisfy the stomach. This out weighed the desire to spend some time for fashion, as it also required expensive accessory. Gele, to many people, became an occasional wear for Sundays, parties, weddings and other special occasions.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

The changing circumstances in the affairs of the gele gave way to a deeper westernization of the average Nigerian teenager's dressing that very rarely do young women wear gele or traditional attire show in their wardrobe. So, while the gele is for grand occasions like the Christmas and special events, the vogue for her is the hat, the ultimate headpiece. The anger against this is not the appreciation of western dressing but the total rejection for what is African. This danger has perhaps, made some fashion hat designers create a modern version of the gele.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

Further researches and studies in the art of hat making have led to the introduction of relevant and constant invitations. The innovations have made hats come to stay as part of modern Nigerian fashion, leading to introduction of "group hats", uniform hats. Hats are made of different materials such as cynamay, a soft material dyed into a variety of colors and shades. Cynamay can be moved, twisted and cut into different shapes. It is light and suitable for the African weather.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

There are also straw hats, the knotted style and the pail boxes. Some are designed with feathers and flowers such as roses and ornament, like sequins. About 80 per cent of the materials are imported. But the preferred hat colors, many people say, are silver, gold and platinum. But hat the colors in vogue are hot pink, lemon and orange.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt;

== Fashion designers and houses ==
Nigerian publications such as ''Flair West Africa'' (formerly called ''True Love'' Magazine), ''Genevieve'', ''TW'' and ''Arise''; websites like Stylehousefiles.com, Bellanaija.com, Ladybrille.com, Fashionafrica.com, Shopliquorice.blogspot.com, showcase and promote Nigerian fashion.&lt;ref name=stylehousefiles/&gt; Nigerian fashion has created female entrepreneurs and has improved the Nigerian economy by creating jobs and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madichie|first=Nnamdi|year=2009|title=Breaking the Glass Ceiling in Nigeria: A Review of Women's Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15228910802701361?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of African Business|volume=10|pages=51–66|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nigerian fashion industry according to designer Maki-Oh suffers from, "Mediocrity, electricity [problems] and quality control." There are no bodies regulating the fashion industry and there are no government incentives to support new comers.  There are issues of finishing which nearly every designer suffers from as most of them rely on self-taught tailors. The result is an expensive price tag for less than perfect products.&lt;ref name=stylehousefiles/&gt;

Helen Jennings notes, "the success of the new generation of designers, models and fashion scenes around Africa is a reflection of Africa's success as a whole. The continent is gradually emerging as a global power thanks to increased trade and investment between Africa and the rest of the world and improved political stability and economic growth in burgeoning democracies such as Nigeria."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.randomhouse.de/leseprobe/New-African-Fashion-(US-Version)/leseprobe_9783791345796.pdf|title=New African Fashion|last=Jennings|first=Helen|date=|website=Random House|publisher=Prestel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria (FADAN) is the recognized body for the Fashion Designers Profession and was duly incorporated in 1989 by the then Federal Ministry of Trade and Corporate Affairs. The formidable association of fashion designers now has state chapters all over the country.

The patterns and colors of his designs, which are sold to concept stores like Ikram in Chicago and Biffi in Milan, seem intrinsically African, but they are often European.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/fashion/my-lagos-duro-olowus-home-town.html|title=My Lagos: Duro Olowu's Home Town|last=Menkes|first=Suzy|date=2012-11-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feminist theory''' is the extension of [[feminism]] into theoretical, fictional, or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discourse. It aims to understand the nature of [[gender inequality]].  It examines women's and men's [[Gender role|social roles]], experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], [[communication]], [[media studies]], [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;Chodorow, Nancy J., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Ul15oJ-WcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory]'' (Yale University Press: 1989, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; [[home economics]], [[Feminist literary criticism|literature]], [[education]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Brabeck&amp;Brown"&gt;Brabeck, M. and Brown, L.

Feminist theory focuses on analyzing [[gender inequality]]. Themes explored in feminism include [[discrimination]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], [[patriarchy]],&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;Gilligan, Carol, 'In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and Morality' in ''Harvard Educational Review'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerman1990"&gt;Lerman, Hannah, ''Feminist Ethics in Psychotherapy'' (Springer Publishing Company, 1990) {{ISBN|978-0-8261-6290-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stereotyping]], [[art history]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda.

== History ==

Feminist theories first emerged as early as 1794 in publications such as ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], "The Changing Woman",&lt;ref&gt;"The Changing Woman" (Navajo Origin Myth). Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Ain't I a Woman?|Ain't I a Woman]]",&lt;ref&gt;Truth, Sojourner. "Ain't I a Woman". Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; "Speech after Arrest for Illegal Voting",&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Susan B. "Speech After Arrest for Illegal Voting". Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 91-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.  "The Changing Woman" is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Myth that gave credit to a woman who, in the end, populated the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Changing_Woman-Navajo.html|title=Native American Indian Legends - Changing Woman - Navajo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, [[Sojourner Truth]] addressed women's rights issues through her publication, "Ain't I a Woman". Sojourner Truth addressed the issue of women having limited rights due to men's flawed perception of women. Truth argued that if a woman of color can perform tasks that were supposedly limited to men, then any woman of any color could perform those same tasks.  After her arrest for illegally voting, [[Susan B. Anthony]] gave a speech within court in which she addressed the issues of language within the constitution documented in her publication, "Speech after Arrest for Illegal voting" in 1872.  Anthony questioned the authoritative principles of the constitution and its male gendered language.  She raised the question of why women are accountable to be punished under law but they cannot use the law for their own protection (women could not vote, own property, nor themselves in marriage).  She also critiqued the constitution for its male gendered language and questioned why women should have to abide by laws that do not specify women.

[[Nancy Cott]] makes a distinction between ''modern feminism'' and its antecedents, particularly the [[Suffragette|struggle for suffrage]]. In the [[United States]] she places the turning point in the decades before and after women obtained the vote in 1920 (1910–1930). She argues that the prior ''woman movement'' was primarily about woman as a ''[[universalism|universal]]'' entity, whereas over this 20-year period it transformed itself into one primarily concerned with [[Differentiation (sociology)|social differentiation]], attentive to ''[[individuality]]'' and diversity. New issues dealt more with woman's condition as a [[social construct]], [[gender identity]], and relationships within and between genders. Politically this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Nancy F. The Grounding of Modern Feminism. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Kingsley Kent says that Freudian patriarchy was responsible for the diminished profile of feminism in the inter-war years,&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Susan Kingsley. Making Peace: The Reconstruction of Gender in Interwar Britain. Princeton, N.J. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; others such as [[Juliet Mitchell]] consider this to be
overly simplistic since [[Freudian theory]] is not wholly incompatible with feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Juliet. Psychoanalysis and Feminism: Freud, Reich, Laing, and Women. New York 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist scholarship shifted away from the need to establish the origins of [[family]], and towards analyzing the process of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. Jr. After Tylor: British Social Anthropology, 1888–1951. Madison, Wisconsin 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate postwar period, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] stood in opposition to an image of "the woman in the home". De Beauvoir provided an [[existentialist]] dimension to feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' ([[The Second Sex]]) in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/index.htm|title=Le Deuxième Sexe (online edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the title implies, the starting point is the implicit inferiority of women, and the first question de Beauvoir asks is "what is a woman"?.&lt;ref&gt;Moi, Toril. What is a Woman? And Other Essays. Oxford 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Woman she realizes is always perceived of as the "other", "''she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her''". In this book and her essay, "''Woman: Myth &amp; Reality''", de Beauvoir anticipates [[Betty Friedan]] in seeking to demythologise the male concept of woman. "''A myth invented by men to confine women to their oppressed state. For women it is not a question of asserting themselves as women, but of becoming full-scale human beings''." "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman", or as [[Toril Moi]] puts it "a woman defines herself through the way she lives her embodied situation in the world, or in other words, through the way in which she makes something of what the world makes of her". Therefore, woman must regain subject, to escape her defined role as "other", as a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian]] point of departure.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra B. The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir: Gendered Phenomenologies, Erotic Generosities. SUNY 1996 {{ISBN|0-7914-3151-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In her examination of myth, she appears as one who does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir herself from out of the shadow of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to fully appreciate her.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Shannon. The work of Simone de Beauvoir: Introduction Journal of Speculative Philosophy 2000 14(2):v&lt;/ref&gt; While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one of the ''Mouvement de Libération des Femmes'' manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of concerns for the earth and spirituality, and [[environmentalism]]. This in turn created an atmosphere conducive to reigniting the study of and debate on matricentricity,
as a rejection of [[Biological determinism|determinism]], such as [[Adrienne Rich]]&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution New York 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Marilyn French]]&lt;ref&gt;French, Marilyn. Beyond Power: On Women, Men, and Morals. New York 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
while for [[socialist feminists]] like [[Evelyn Reed]],&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Evelyn. Woman's Evolution: From Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal Family. New York, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
patriarchy held the properties of capitalism. Feminist psychologists, such as [[Jean Baker Miller]], sought to bring a feminist analysis to previous psychological theories, proving that "there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them".&lt;ref name="harvardsquarelibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/cfs/jean_baker_miller.php Jean Baker Miller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720194207/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/cfs/jean_baker_miller.php |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having a number of phases. The first she calls "feminist critique" – where the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls [[Gynocriticism|"Gynocritics"]] – where the "woman is producer of textual meaning" including "the [[psychodynamics]] of female creativity; [[linguistics]] and the problem of a female language; the trajectory of the individual or collective female literary career and [[literary history]]". The last phase she calls "gender theory" – where the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the [[sex/gender distinction|sex/gender system]]" are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;Showalter, Elaine. '[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/180283/ Toward a Feminist Poetics: Women's Writing and Writing About Women]' in ''The New Feminist Criticism: Essays on Women, Literature and Theory'' (Random House, 1988), {{ISBN|978-0-394-72647-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been criticized by [[Toril Moi]] who sees it as an [[essentialism|essentialist]] and [[determinism|deterministic]] model for female subjectivity. She also criticized it for not taking account of the situation for women outside the west.&lt;ref name=Moi&gt;Moi, Toril, ''Sexual/Textual Politics'' (Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-415-28012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical ideas that have been arising in the field of [[French feminism]] have gained a decisive influence on feminist theory. Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the phallic hypotheses regarding the Unconscious. [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luce Irigaray]] developed specific notions concerning unconscious sexual difference, the feminine and motherhood, with wide implications for film and literature analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam (eds.), ''Laughing with Medusa'' (Oxford, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-199-27438-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplines ==

There are a number of distinct feminist disciplines, in which experts in other areas apply feminist techniques and principles to their own fields.  Additionally, these are also debates which shape feminist theory and they can be applied interchangeably in the arguments of feminist theorists.

===Bodies===
In [[Western thought|western thought]], the body has been historically associated solely with women, whereas men have been associated with the mind. [[Susan Bordo]], a modern feminist philosopher, in her writings elaborates the [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[Hegel]] and [[Descartes]], revealing how such distinguishing [[binaries]] such as spirit/matter and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body [[dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Unbearable Weight, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
The notion of the body (but not the mind) being associated with women has served as a justification to deem women as property, objects, and exchangeable commodities (among men).  For example, women's bodies have been objectified throughout history through the changing ideologies of fashion, diet, exercise programs, cosmetic surgery, childbearing, etc. This contrasts to men's role as a moral agent, responsible for working or fighting in bloody wars.
The race and class of a woman can determine whether her body will be treated as decoration and protected, which is associated with middle or upper-class women's bodies.  On the other hand, the other body is recognized for its use in labor and exploitation which is generally associated with women's bodies in the working-class or with women of color.
Second-wave feminist activism has argued for reproductive rights and choice, women's health (movement), and lesbian rights (movement) which are also associated with this Bodies debate.

=== The standard and contemporary sex and gender system ===

The standard sex determination and gender model consists of evidence based on the determined sex and gender of every individual and serve as norms for societal life. The model claims that the sex-determination of a person exist within a male/female dichotomy giving importance to genitals and how they are formed via chromosomes, and DNA-binding proteins (such as the sex-determining region Y genes), which are responsible for sending sex-determined initialization and completion signals to and from the biological sex-determination system in fetuses. Occasionally, mutations occur during the sex-determining process. When this happens, the fetus becomes a hermaphrodite. The standard model defines gender as a social understanding/ideology that defines what behaviors, actions, and appearances are normal for males and females. Studies into biological sex-determining systems also have began working towards connecting certain gender conducts such as behaviors, actions, and desires with sex-determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Mittwoch U (October 1988). "The race to be male". ''[[New Scientist]]''. '''120''' (1635): 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socially-biasing children sex and gender system'''
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}
The socially-biasing children sex and gender model broadens the horizons of the sex and gender ideologies. It revises the ideology of sex to be a social construct which is not limited to either male or female. The [[Intersex Society of North America]] which explains that, "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of '[[intersex]]' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex".&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993–2008&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sex is not a biological/natural construct but a social one instead since, society and doctors decide on what it means to be male, female, or intersex in terms of sex chromosomes and genitals, in addition to their personal judgment on who or how one passes as a specific sex. The ideology of gender remains a social construct but is not as strict and fixed. Instead, gender is easily malleable, and is forever changing. One example of where the standard definition of gender alters with time happens to be depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]'s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, "abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England".&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this quote shows what it meant growing up into the roles of a female (gender/roles) changed from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, the contemporary sex gender model is accurate because both sex and gender are rightly seen as social constructs inclusive of the wide spectrum of sexes and genders and in which nature and nurture are interconnected.

===Epistemologies===
The generation and production of knowledge has been an important part of feminist theory and is at the centre of discussions on [[feminist epistemology]].  This debate proposes such questions as "Are there 'women's ways of knowing' and 'women's knowledge'?"  And "How does the knowledge women produce about themselves differ from that produced by patriarchy?"&lt;ref name="Feminist theory : a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartkowski|first1=[compiled by] Wendy K. Kolmar, Frances|title=Feminist theory : a reader|date=1999|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co|location=Mountain View, Calif [u. a.]|isbn=978-1559349253|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist theorists have also proposed the "feminist standpoint knowledge" which attempts to replace the "[[view from nowhere]]" with the model of knowing that expels the "view from women's lives".&lt;ref name="Feminist theory : a reader"/&gt; A feminist approach to epistemology seeks to establish knowledge production from a woman's perspective. It theorizes that from personal experience comes knowledge which helps each individual look at things from a different insight.

Central to feminism is that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women "mutilated" and "[[immanent]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition"'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"mutilated... immanent...''", ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"… women are systematically subordinated… de Beauvoir labels women "mutilated" and "immanent"…  women succumb to 'bad faith' and surrender their agency…", Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersectionality===
{{Main article|Intersectionality}}
Intersectionality is the examination of various ways in which people are oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.

===Language===
{{see also|Feminist language reform|Gender-neutral language|Category:Feminist terminology}}
In this debate, women writers have addressed the issues of masculinized writing through male gendered language that may not serve to accommodate the literary understanding of women's lives. Such masculinized language that feminist theorists address is the use of, for example, "God the Father" which is looked upon as a way of designating the sacred as solely men (or, in other words, biblical language glorifies men through all of the masculine pronouns like "he" and "him" and addressing God as a "He").  Feminist theorists attempt to reclaim and redefine women through re-structuring language.  For example, feminist theorists have used the term "[[womyn]]" instead of "women".  Some feminist theorists find solace in changing titles of unisex jobs (for example, police officer versus policeman or mail carrier versus mailman). Some feminist theorists have [[Reappropriation|reclaimed]] and redefined such words as "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]" and "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" and others have invested redefining knowledge into feminist dictionaries.

===Psychology===
[[Feminist psychology]] is a form of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm.&lt;ref name="Crawford, M. 2000"&gt;Crawford, M. &amp; Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist psychology is oriented on the values and principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. [[Ethel Dench Puffer Howes]] was one of the first women to enter the field of psychology. She was the Executive Secretary of the [[National College Equal Suffrage League]] in 1914.

One major psychological theory, ''[[Relational-cultural therapy|relational-cultural theory]]'', is based on the work of [[Jean Baker Miller]], whose book ''Toward a New Psychology of Women'' proposes that "growth-fostering relationships are a central human necessity and that disconnections are the source of psychological problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_225.html|title=Biography of Dr. Jean Baker Miller|work=Changing the Face of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Betty Friedan's ''[[The Feminine Mystique|Feminine Mystique]]'', and other feminist classics from the 1960s, relational-cultural theory proposes that "isolation is one of the most damaging human experiences and is best treated by reconnecting with other people", and that a therapist should "foster an atmosphere of empathy and acceptance for the patient, even at the cost of the therapist's neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/us/08miller.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeremy | last=Pearce | title=Jean Baker Miller, 78, Psychiatrist, Is Dead | date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on clinical observations and sought to prove that "there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them".&lt;ref name="harvardsquarelibrary.org"/&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
{{see also|Psychoanalysis|Feminism and the Oedipus complex}}
Psychoanalytic feminism and [[Psychoanalysis|feminist psychoanalysis]] are based on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theories]], but they also supply an important critique of it. It maintains that [[gender]] is not biological but is based on the psycho-sexual development of the individual, but also that sexual difference and gender are different notions. Psychoanalytical feminists believe that [[gender inequality]] comes from early childhood experiences, which lead men to believe themselves to be [[Masculinity|masculine]], and women to believe themselves [[Femininity|feminine]]. It is further maintained that gender leads to a [[social structure|social system]] that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development. As a solution it was suggested by some to avoid the gender-specific structuring of the society [[coeducation]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lerman1990/&gt; From the last 30 years of the 20th century, the contemporary French psychoanalytical theories concerning the feminine, that refer to sexual difference rather than to gender, with psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]],&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia, Toril Moi (Ed.), 'The Kristeva Reader'.

===Literary theory===
{{main article|Feminist literary criticism}}
{{see also|Gynocriticism}}
Feminist literary criticism is [[literary criticism]] informed by feminist theories or politics. Its history has been varied, from classic works of female authors such as [[George Eliot]], [[Virginia Woolf]],&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''. Rutgers University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8135-3266-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margaret Fuller]] to recent theoretical work in [[women's studies]] and [[gender studies]] by "[[third-wave feminism|third-wave]]" authors.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;Barry, Peter, 'Feminist Literary Criticism' in ''Beginning theory'' (Manchester University Press: 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most general, feminist literary criticism before the 1970s was concerned with the politics of women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature.&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt; Since the arrival of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity, feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes. It has considered gender in the terms of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[psychoanalysis]], as part of the [[deconstruction]] of existing power relations.&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt;

=== Film theory ===
{{main article|Feminist film theory}}
Many feminist film critics, such as [[Laura Mulvey]], have pointed to the "[[male gaze]]" that predominates in classical Hollywood film making. Through the use of various [[film technique]]s, such as [[shot reverse shot]], the viewers are led to align themselves with the point of view of a male protagonist.

===History===
{{main article|Feminist history}}
Feminist history refers to the re-reading and re-interpretation of history from a feminist [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. It is not the same as the [[history of feminism]], which outlines the origins and evolution of the [[feminist movement]]. It also differs from [[women's history]], which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past.&lt;ref name=Cain1994&gt;Cain, William E., ed.

===Geography===
{{main article|Feminist geography}}
Feminist geography is often considered part of a broader [[postmodern]] approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities. In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and [[social studies]], arguing that academic traditions are delineated by [[patriarchy]], and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;Rose, Gillian, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/216079 Feminism and Geography: The Limits of Geographical Knowledge]'' (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;Moss, Pamela, ''Feminisms in Geography: Rethinking Space, Place, and Knowledges'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welchman, John C., Rethinking Borders. Macmillan, 1996 {{ISBN|0-333-56580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{main article|Feminist philosophy}}
The Feminist philosophy refers to a philosophy approached from a feminist perspective. Feminist philosophy involves attempts to use methods of philosophy to further the cause of the feminist movements, it also tries to criticize and/or reevaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy from within a feminist view. This critique stems from the [[dichotomy]] [[Western philosophy]] has conjectured with the [[mind and body]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Rée|first=Jonathan|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-64177-4|pages=143–145|edition=3rd|author2=Urmson, J.O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific school for feminist philosophy like there has been in regard to other theories.  This means that Feminist philosophers can be found in the analytic and continental traditions, and the different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues with those traditions.  Feminist philosophers also have many different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues within those traditions. Feminist philosophers who are feminists can belong to many different varieties of feminism. The writings of [[Judith Butler]], [[Rosi Braidotti]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Avital Ronell]] are the most significant psychoanalytically informed influences on contemporary feminist philosophy.

===Sexology===
{{main article|Feminist sexology}}
Feminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of sex and gender in relation to the sexual lives of women. Feminist sexology shares many principles with the wider field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. Looking at sexuality from a feminist point of view creates connections between the different aspects of a person's sexual life.

From feminists' perspectives, sexology, which is the study of human sexuality and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.

===Monosexual paradigm===
{{main article|Monosexuality}}
Monosexual Paradigm is a term coined by Blasingame, a self-identified African American, bisexual female. Blasingame used this term to address the lesbian and gay communities who turned a blind eye to the dichotomy that oppressed bisexuals from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. This oppression negatively affects the gay and lesbian communities more so than the heterosexual community due to its contradictory exclusiveness of bisexuals. 
Blasingame argued that in reality dichotomies are inaccurate to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that biphobia is the central message of two roots; internalized heterosexism and racism. Internalized heterosexism is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized heterosexism by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism as an act of horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation.

===Politics===
{{main article|Feminist political theory}}
Feminist political theory is a recently emerging field in [[political science]] focusing on gender and feminist themes within the state, institutions and policies. It questions the "modern political theory, dominated by universalistic liberalist thought, which claims indifference to gender or other identity differences and has therefore taken its time to open up to such concerns".&lt;ref name="fpt"&gt;Véronique Mottier, ''[http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/publications/eps/onlineissues/spring2004/research/mottier.htm Feminist analyses of the state] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827202958/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/publications/eps/onlineissues/spring2004/research/mottier.htm |date=2007-08-27 }}'', Feminist political theory, [[University of Essex]]. Retrieved on 1-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist perspectives entered [[international relations]] in late 1980s, at about the same time as the end of the [[Cold War]]. This time was not a coincidence because the last forty years the conflict between [[US]] and [[USSR]] had been the dominant agenda of international politics. After the Cold War, there was continuing relative peace between the main powers. Soon, many new issues appeared on international relation's agenda. More attention was also paid to social movements. Indeed, in those times feminist approaches also used to depict the world politics. Feminists started to emphasize that while women have always been players in international system, their participation has frequently been associated with in non-governmental settings such as social movements. However, they could also participate in inter-state decision making process as men did. In fact, today, women also participate in iternational politics as the wives of diplomats, nannies who go abroad to find work and support their family, or sex workers trafficked across international boundaries. Women's contributions has not been seen in the areas where hard power plays significant role such as military. In contrast, women are profoundly impacted by decisions the statepersons make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=John Baylis, Patricia Owens and Steve Smith|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|location=|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
{{main article|Feminist economics}}
Feminist economics broadly refers to a developing branch of [[economics]] that applies feminist insights and critiques to economics. Research under this heading is often interdisciplinary, critical, or [[heterodox]]. It encompasses debates about the relationship between feminism and economics on many levels: from applying mainstream economic methods to under-researched "women's" areas, to questioning how [[mainstream economics]] values the reproductive sector, to deeply philosophical critiques of economic [[epistemology]] and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Drucilla K. and Edith Kuiper, eds. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A36CAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Toward a Feminist Philosophy of Economics]''. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent issue that feminist economists investigate is how the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) does not adequately measure [[feminist economics#Unpaid work|unpaid labor]] predominantly performed by women, such as housework, childcare, and eldercare.&lt;ref&gt;Radical Feminism: A Documentary Reader,  By Barbara A. Crow, Housework: Slavery or a Labor of Love, p 530, NYU Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waring, Marilyn, ''[http://www.roiw.org/1992/237.pdf If Women Counted: A New Feminist Economics],''San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist economists have also challenged and exposed the rhetorical approach of mainstream economics.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Julie A., "[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/gender-metaphor-and-the-definition-of-economics/AE1C0123F6E8FD395FAE1CF9FFDD1B08 Gender, Metaphor, and the Definition of Economics]," ''Economics and Philosophy'' 8(1), 1992; McCloskey, D.

J.A. Nelson and M.A. Ferber, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993. See also [[McCloskey critique]].&lt;/ref&gt; They have made critiques of many basic assumptions of mainstream economics, including the ''[[Homo economicus]]'' model.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFg6lK48EX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics],'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993. Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Houseworker's Handbook'' Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the reproduction and domestic labor of women form the foundation of economic survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP.&lt;ref name="ncdsv.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/BH_Modest-Herstory-of-Besty-Warrior_8-2013.pdf|title="A Modest Herstory" of Betsy Warrior }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Warrior: "Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women's labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother's milk and which nurtures every new "consumer/laborer"); secondly, women's labor composed of cleaning, cooking, negotiating social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity." Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures.&lt;ref name="ncdsv.org"/&gt; Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, only a tiny fraction of the pimp's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp's clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, "A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/us/in-depth-report-details-economics-of-sex-trade.html|title=In-Depth Report Details Economics of Sex Trade|first=Annie|last=Lowrey|date=12 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of this theory have been instrumental in creating alternative models, such as the [[capability approach]] and incorporating gender into the analysis of economic data to affect policy. Marilyn Power suggests that feminist economic methodology can be broken down into five categories.&lt;ref&gt;Power, Marilyn.

===Legal theory===
{{main article|Feminist legal theory}}
Feminist legal theory is based on the feminist view that law's treatment of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.&lt;ref name=Dalton1&gt;Dalton, Claire, 'Where We Stand: Observations on the Situation of Feminist Legal Thought' in ''Feminist Legal Theory: Foundations'' ed. by D. Kelly Weisberg (Temple University Press, 1993), {{ISBN|978-1-56639-028-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalton2&gt;Dalton, Claire, 'Deconstructing Contract Doctrine' in ''Feminist Legal Theory: Readings in Law and Gender'' ed. by
Katharine T. Bartlett and Rosanne Kennedy (Harper Collins, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartlett1992&gt;''Feminist Legal Theory: Readings in Law and Gender'' ed. by Katharine T. Bartlett and Rosanne Kennedy (Harper Collins, 1992), {{ISBN|978-0-8133-1248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist legal theory stems from the inadequacy of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics''. ''DeGraffenreid v General Motors'' is an example of such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not "a special class to be protected from discrimination".&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crenshaw|first1=Kimberlé|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics|date=1991|publisher=Westview Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8133-1247-7|pages=57–80|url=http://politicalscience.tamu.edu/documents/faculty/Crenshaw-Demarginalizing.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206030330/http://politicalscience.tamu.edu/documents/faculty/Crenshaw-Demarginalizing.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in ''DeGraffenreid'' against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality's role in discrimination.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Moore v Hughes Helicopters, Inc.'' is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of ''Moore'', the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to ''DeGraffenreid''.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could "adequately represent white female employees".&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Payne v Travenol'' serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in ''Payne'', two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both Black men and women on the grounds the pharmaceutical plant practiced racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males, however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Moore'' contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, ''Payne'' suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and ''DeGraffenreid'' argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. While the cases of ''DeGraffenreid'' (1976), ''Moore'' (1983), and ''Payne'' (1976) are not recent accounts; they provide proof of the courts inconsistency in procedures and rulings on the basis of sex and race, which serves to reinforce the need for Feminist legal theory to not only be further developed, but also applied.

===Communication theory===
Feminist communication theory has evolved over time and branches out in many directions.  Early theories focused on the way that gender influenced communication and many argued that language was "man made". This view of communication promoted a "[[Information deficit model|deficiency model]]" asserting that characteristics of speech associated with women were negative and that men "set the standard for competent interpersonal communication", which influences the type of language used by men and women. These early theories also suggested that ethnicity, cultural and economic backgrounds also needed to be addressed. They looked at how gender intersects with other identity constructs, such as class, race, and sexuality.   Feminist theorists, especially those considered to be liberal feminists, began looking at issues of equality in education and employment.  Other theorists addressed political oratory and public discourse.  The recovery project brought to light many women orators who had been "erased or ignored as significant contributors".  Feminist communication theorists also addressed how women were represented in the media and how the media "communicated ideology about women, gender, and feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Dow, B. (2009). Feminist approaches to communication. In W. Eadie (Ed.), 21st century communication: A reference handbook. (pp. 82-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Griffin |first=C. |title=Feminist Communication Theories |editor-last1=Littlejohn |editor-first1=Stephen W. |editor-last2=Foss |editor-first2=Karen A. |work=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8Kf0N0XALIC&amp;pg=PA391 |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7 |pages=391–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist communication theory also encompasses access to the public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, and the ways in which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by [[Andrea Lunsford]], Professor of [[English studies|English]] and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at [[Stanford University]] and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as [[Aspasia]], [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], and [[Christine de Pisan]], who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"/&gt;

Feminist communication theorists are also concerned with a recovery effort in attempting to explain the methods used by those with power to prohibit women like [[Maria W. Stewart]], [[Sarah Moore Grimké]], and [[Angelina Grimké]], and more recently, [[Ella Baker]] and [[Anita Hill]], from achieving a voice in political discourse and consequently being driven from the public sphere. Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women and others like them to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"/&gt;

Feminist theorist also evaluate communication expectations for students and women in the work place, in particular how the performance of feminine versus masculine styles of communicating are constructed. [[Judith Butler]], who coined the term "[[Social construction of gender|gender performativity]]" further suggests that, "theories of communication must explain the ways individuals negotiate, resist, and transcend their identities in a highly gendered society". This focus also includes the ways women are constrained or "disciplined" in the discipline of communication in itself, in terms of biases in research styles and the "silencing" of feminist scholarship and theory.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt;

Who is responsible for deciding what is considered important public discourse is also put into question by feminist theorists in communication scholarship. This lens of feminist communication theory is labeled as [[revalorist theory]] which honors the historical perspective of women in communication in an attempt to recover voices that have been historically neglected.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt; There have been many attempts to explain the lack of representative voices in the public sphere for women including, the notion that, "the public sphere is built on [[Essentialism|essentialist]] principles that prevent women from being seen as legitimate communicators in that sphere", and [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|theories of subalternity]]", which, "under extreme conditions of oppression...prevent those in positions of power from even hearing their communicative attempts".&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt;

===Design===
Technical writers{{who|date=July 2018}} have concluded that visual language can convey facts and ideas clearer than almost any other means of communication.&lt;ref name="Bosley"&gt;Bosley, Deborah. Gender and Visual Communication: Toward a Feminist Theory of Design. IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Vol. 35, No. 4, December 1992, pp. 222-228&lt;/ref&gt; According to the feminist theory, "gender may be a factor in how human beings represent reality."&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt;

Men and women will construct different types of structures about the self, and, consequently, their thought processes may diverge in content and form. This division depends on the self-concept, which is an "important regulator of thoughts, feelings and actions" that "governs one's perception of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Markus, Hazel, Oyserman, Daphna. Gender and Thought: The Role of Self Concept. Gender and Thought: Psychological Perspectives, 1989, pp. 100-127&lt;/ref&gt;

With that being said, the self-concept has a significant effect on how men and women represent reality in different ways.

Recently, "technical communicators'{{who|date=July 2018}} terms such as 'visual rhetoric,' 'visual language,' and 'document design' indicate a new awareness of the importance of visual design".&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt;

Deborah S. Bosley explores this new concept of the "feminist theory of design"&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt; by conducting a study on a collection of undergraduate males and females who were asked to illustrate a visual, on paper, given to them in a text. Based on this study, she creates a "feminist theory of design" and connects it to technical communicators.

In the results of the study, males used more angular illustrations, such as squares, rectangles and arrows, which are interpreted as a "direction" moving away from or a moving toward, thus suggesting more aggressive positions than rounded shapes, showing masculinity.

Females, on the other hand, used more curved visuals, such as circles, rounded containers and bending pipes. Bosley takes into account that feminist theory offers insight into the relationship between females and circles or rounded objects. According to Bosley, studies of women and leadership indicate a preference for nonhierarchical work patterns (preferring a communication "web" rather than a communication "ladder"). Bosley explains that circles and other rounded shapes, which women chose to draw, are nonhierarchical and often used to represent inclusive, communal relationships, confirming her results that women's visual designs do have an effect on their means of communications.{{undue inline|reason=pseudoscience|date=July 2018}}

Based on these conclusions, this "feminist theory of design" can go on to say that gender does play a role in how humans represent reality.

===Black feminist criminology===
{{fringe|section|date=July 2018}}
Black feminist criminology theory  is a concept created by Hillary Potter in the 1990s and a bridge that integrates Feminist theory with criminology. It is based on the integration of Black feminist theory and [[critical race theory]].

For years, Black women were historically overlooked and disregarded in the study of crime and criminology; however, with a new focus on Black feminism that sparked in the 1980s, Black feminists began to contextualize their unique experiences and examine why the general status of Black women in the criminal justice system was lacking in female specific approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gabbidon|first=Shaun L.|authorlink=Shaun L. Gabbidon|title=Criminological Perspectives on Race and Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCGMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16049-4|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter explains that because Black women usually have "limited access to adequate education and employment as consequences of racism, sexism, and classism", they are often disadvantaged. This disadvantage materializes into "poor responses by social service professionals and crime-processing agents to Black women's interpersonal victimization".{{sfnp|Gabbidon|2010|page=224}} Most crime studies focused on White males/females and Black males. Any results or conclusions targeted to Black males were usually assumed to be the same situation for Black females. This was very problematic since Black males and Black females differ in what they experience. For instance, economic deprivation, status equality between the sexes, distinctive socialization patterns, racism, and sexism should all be taken into account between Black males and Black females. The two will experience all of these factors differently; therefore, it was crucial to resolve this dilemma.

Black feminist criminology is the solution to this problem. It takes four factors into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture. Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.

====Criticisms====

It has been said{{by whom|date=June 2017}} that Black feminist criminology is still in its "infancy stage"; therefore, there is little discussion or studies that disprove it as an effective feminist perspective. In addition to its age, Black feminist criminology has not actively accounted for the role of religion and spirituality in Black women's "experience with abuse".{{sfnp|Gabbidon|2010|pages=224–225}}

===Feminist science and technology studies===
{{main article|Feminist technoscience}}
Feminist science and technology studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field of research on the ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture.  The practice emerged from feminist critique on the masculine-coded uses of technology in the fields of natural, medical, and technical sciences, and its entanglement in gender and identity.&lt;ref name="Aberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Åsberg|first1=Cecilia|last2=Lykke|first2=Nina|title=Feminist technoscience studies|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|date=5 November 2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=299–305|doi=10.1177/1350506810377692}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of feminist technoscience theory explains science and technologies to be linked and should be held accountable for the social and cultural developments resulting from both fields.&lt;ref name="Aberg"/&gt;

Some key issues feminist technoscience studies address include:

# The use of feminist analysis when applied to scientific ideas and practices.
# Intersections between race, class, gender, science, and technology.
# The implications of situated knowledges.
#Politics of gender on how to understand agency, body, rationality, and the boundaries between nature and culture.&lt;ref name="Aberg"/&gt;

== The Eurodistrict ==
The General Council has a policy of cooperation with the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], the [[Province of Girona]] and the [[Andorra]] to create a [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Eurodistrict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cg66.fr/economie/coop_transfront/demarche.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426042532/http://www.cg66.fr/economie/coop_transfront/demarche.html |archive-date=2009-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of Catalan ==
A study in 1997 found that 55% of the population understand, 39% can read and 34% can speak Catalan. It found a higher percantage of speakers in villages and lower in the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.cat/gc/digitalAssets/8342_SituacioCatalaFranca.pdf  Institut d'Estudis Catalans]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Catalan has no official status it was first recognised in 1951 when it was introduced into the school curriculum. The Region of Languedoc-Roussillon created an agency for the promotion of the two regional languages, Catalan and [[Occitan]].

== The Charter for Catalan ==
At the session of 10 December 2007, the General Council approved the "Charter for Catalan" in which the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] is committed to ensure the promotion, development and dissemination of the [[Catalan language]] and the Catalan culture.
It says in the Preamble: "Catalan, is born more than a thousand years, is one of the pillars of our identity, heritage and richness of the department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] ([[Northern Catalonia]]).
The term [[Northern Catalonia]] gets its first official recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207072824/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/patrimoine_catalanite/catalanite/charte.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automatic defibrillators ==
[[Image:Photos-0042.jpg|thumb|[[Defibrillator]] of [[General councils of France|General Council]] on the city hall of [[Collioure]]]]
The Pyrénées-Orientales is conducting a pilot study of installation of [[Defibrillation|automatic defibrillators]]. On April 2, 2007, the General Council first decided to purchase defibrillators for 22 municipalities located more than 20 minutes from emergency medical services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cg66.fr/institution/session/2007/session_070730/deliberation/annexe_dlb11.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2008, when a defibrillator was installed in [[Mosset]], 141 municipalities have them, the objective being to equip all 226 municipalities and the 22 General Council buildings. Certain municipalities have also decided to install additional defibrillators at highly frequented locations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindependant.com/articles/2009/03/23/ Perpignan-20090323-A-Medical-DEFIBRILLATOR-automates-the-park-of-sports.php5&lt;/ref&gt;

After a presentation to the French Council of Mayors,&lt;ref&gt;http://salons.groupemoniteur.fr/salon_des_maires_et_des_collectivites_locales&lt;/ref&gt; other French [[Departments of France|departments]] and [[Regions of France|regions]] are also considering the installation of automatic defibrillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326070849/http://www/ |archivedate=2006-03-26 |df= }}. lindependant.com/articles/2009/03/31/20090331-INDEPENDANT-Les-PO-departement-pilote.php5&lt;/ref&gt;

The devices require a telephone line and an [[ADSL]] connection, and their [[ground support equipment]] makes use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. Thus their installation also helps to reduce the [[digital divide]] in formerly poorly connected villages.

'''Insects''' have appeared '''in literature''' from classical times to the present day, an aspect of their [[insects in culture|role in culture]] more generally. Insects represent both positive qualities like cooperation and hard work, and negative ones like greed.

Among the positive qualities, [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s represent industry and cooperation from the [[Book of Proverbs]] and Aesop's fables to tales by [[Beatrix Potter]]. Insects including the [[dragonfly]] have symbolised harmony with nature, while the [[butterfly]] has represented happiness in springtime in Japanese [[Haiku]], as well as the soul of a person who has died.

Insects have equally been used for their strangeness and alien qualities, with giant [[wasp]]s and intelligent ants threatening human society in [[science fiction]] stories. [[Locust]]s have represented greed, and more literally plague and destruction, while the [[fly]] has been used to indicate death and decay, and the [[grasshopper]] has indicated improvidence. The [[horsefly]] has been used from classical times to portray torment, appearing in a play by [[Aeschylus]] and again in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''; the [[mosquito]] has a similar reputation.

==Overview==

Insects play important roles in around one hundred novels and a hundred short stories in English literature. They are used to portray both positive and negative qualities, more usually negative, including entrapment, stinging, being rapacious, and swarming. They are common in fantasy and especially in science fiction, often as the earthly or alien villains. Detective novels sometimes use insects as unexpected murder weapons. A fly on the wall is used as a voyeur to tell erotic stories in R. Chopping's ''The Fly'', and the anonymous ''Autobiography of a Flea''. [[Franz Kafka]] made use of the strangeness of insect metamorphosis in his novella ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' ({{lang-de |Die Verwandlung}}), as have several authors since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hogue |first1=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology  |date=1987  |volume=32  |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html  |accessdate=4 April 2016  |publisher=Insects.org |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive qualities==

===Industriousness and cooperation===
[[File:The Ant and the Grasshopper - Project Gutenberg etext 19994.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aesop]]'s ants: picture by [[Milo Winter]], 1888–1956]]

[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphised]] [[ant]]s have often been used in fables, children's stories, and religious texts to represent industriousness and cooperative effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari |chapter=Vol 4, Book 54, Number 536 |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818092520/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html |archivedate=2000-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Proverbs]], ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. [[Aesop]] did the same in his fable "[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|27|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mawil Y.

H. White]] in his fantasy novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''.

[[Beatrix Potter]]'s illustrated 1910 children's book ''[[The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse]]'' features the busy [[bumblebee]] Babbity Bumble and her brood.

===Harmony with nature===

The poet [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote ''[[The Lake Isle of Innisfree]]'' (1888) with the [[honey bee]] couplet "Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, / And live alone in the bee loud glade", while he was living in [[Bedford Park, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deering |first1=Chris |title=Yeats in Bedford Park |url=http://www.chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&amp;page=conyeats.htm |publisher=ChiswickW4.com |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]] wrote in his 1901 book ''A Japanese Miscellany''  that Japanese poets had created [[dragonfly]] ''haiku'' "almost as numerous as are the dragonflies themselves in the early autumn."&lt;ref name="Waldbauer2009"/&gt; The poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–1694) wrote ''haiku'' such as "Crimson pepper pod / add two pairs of wings, and look / darting dragonfly", relating the autumn season to the dragonfly.&lt;ref name="MitchellLasswell2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Forrest Lee |last2=Lasswell |first2=James |title=A Dazzle Of Dragonflies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6g_0ibafjcC&amp;pg=PA36 |year=2005 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |isbn=978-1-58544-459-5 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hori Bakusui]] (1718–1783) similarly wrote "Dyed he is with the / Colour of autumnal days, / O red dragonfly."&lt;ref name="Waldbauer2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waldbauer |first1=Gilbert |last2=Waldbauer |first2=Gilbert |title=A Walk around the Pond: insects in and over the water |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3vFM3-52i0C&amp;pg=PA247 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04477-7 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] described a dragonfly splitting its old skin and emerging shining metallic blue like "[[sapphire]] [[chain mail|mail]]" in his 1842 poem "The Two Voices", with the lines "An inner impulse rent the veil / Of his old husk: from head to tail / Came out clear plates of sapphire mail."&lt;ref name="Tennyson2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=Alfred, Lord |authorlink=Alfred, Lord Tennyson |title=Delphi Complete Works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson (Illustrated) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWcbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT545 |date=17 November 2013 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=978-1-909496-24-8 |pages=544–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[H. E.

Lafcadio Hearn's essay ''Butterflies'' analyses the treatment of the butterfly in [[Japanese literature]], both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower. Among the brief 17-syllable Japanese [[Haiku]] poems about butterflies, of which he translates 22, one by the Haiku master [[Matsuo Bashō]] is said to suggest happiness in springtime: "Wake up! Wake up!—I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping butterfly." Another compares the butterfly's shape to a Japanese silk upper-dress, the ''[[haori]]'', "being taken off". A third says they look to be girls of "about seventeen or eighteen years old." Hearn retells, too, the old story of a man who dies after 50 years alone, having mourned his sweetheart Akiko daily all that time. As he dies, "a very large white butterfly entered the room, and perched upon the sick man's pillow." The man smiles in death. "Then it must have been Akiko!", says an old woman who knew him.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, 2015. Pages 1–18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative qualities==

===Strange and alien beings===
[[File:Alice 05a-1116x1492.jpg|thumb|upright|Alice meets the [[caterpillar]]. Illustration by Sir [[John Tenniel]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', c. 1865]]

Insects have repeatedly been used in literature as strange or alien beings. Sir [[John Tenniel]] drew a famous illustration of Alice meeting a [[caterpillar]] for [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', c. 1865. The caterpillar is seated on a [[toadstool]] and is smoking a [[hookah]] pipe; the image can be read as showing either the forelegs of the [[larva]], or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin.&lt;ref name=BugsBritannica/&gt; [[H.G.

When he came to measure the thing, he found it was twenty-seven and a half inches across its open wings, and its sting was three inches long. ... The day after, a cyclist riding, feet up, down the hill between Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, very narrowly missed running over a second of these giants that was crawling across the roadway.&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;}}

In 1917 the [[ghost story]] author [[Algernon Blackwood]] wrote ''An Egyptian Hornet'', about a beast at once alarming and beautiful: "From a distance he examined this intrusion of the devil. It was calm and very still. It was wonderfully made, both before and behind. Its wings were folded upon its terrible body. Long, sinuous things, pointed like temptation, barbed as well, stuck out of it. There was poison, and yet grace, in its exquisite presentment." The story contrasts the reactions to the threat of the churchman, the Reverend James Milligan, and the "depraved" Mr. Mullins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blackwood |first1=Algernon |title=An Egyptian Hornet |url=http://www.sff.net/people/DoyleMacdonald/l_hornet.htm |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[science fiction]] writer [[Eric Frank Russell]]'s  1957 ''[[Wasp (novel)|Wasp]]'' has its protagonist, James Mowry, as a "wasp" terrorist, a small but deadly Terran (human) force in the Sirian Empire's midst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Russell, Eric Frank | title=Wasp| publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] | date=1957 | isbn=0-575-07095-1 | authorlink=Eric Frank Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greed===

Devouring plagues of [[locust]]s are mentioned in literature throughout history. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC, and a devastating plague is mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]] in the Bible, as taking place in Egypt around 1300 BC.&lt;ref name=Krall453&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krall, S.|author2=Peveling, R.|author3= Diallo,B.D. |title=New Strategies in Locust Control |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ndBQiTiRAC&amp;pg=PA453 |year=1997 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-7643-5442-8 |pages=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Exodus|pages=10: 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plagues of locusts are also mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=Showler&gt;{{cite book |editor=John L.

Ringe, ''A Linguistic History of English: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic'' (Oxford: Oxford, 2003), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-importance===

''[[The Impertinent Insect]]'' is a group of five fables, sometimes ascribed to Aesop, concerning an insect which may be a fly, gnat, or flea, and which puffs itself up to seem important.

===Death and decay===
[[File:Musca et mula-Ulm-1476 338516.jpg|thumb|A woodprint of ''The fly and the mule'' from the 1464 Ulm edition of Steinhöwel's collection of [[Aesop's Fables]]. It is one of five versions of ''[[The Impertinent Insect]]''.]]
{{further|Fly|Housefly}}

In the Biblical [[Plagues of Egypt|fourth plague of Egypt]], [[fly|flies]] represent death and decay. [[Myiagros]] was a god in Greek mythology who chased away flies during the sacrifices to [[Zeus]] and [[Athena]]; Zeus sent a fly to bite [[Pegasus]], causing [[Bellerophon]] to fall back to Earth when he attempted to ride the winged steed to [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]].

[[Emily Dickinson]]'s 1855 [[poem]] "I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died" refers to flies in the context of death. In [[William Golding]]'s 1954 novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', the fly is a symbol of the children involved.

===Improvidence===

One of Aesop's Fables, the tale of ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''. The ant works hard all summer, while the grasshopper plays. In winter, the ant is ready but the improvident grasshopper starves. [[Somerset Maugham]]'s short story "The Ant and the Grasshopper" explores the fable's symbolism via complex framing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sopher |first1=H. |title=Somerset Maugham's "The Ant and the Grasshopper": The Literary Implications of Its Multilayered Structure |journal=Studies in Short Fiction |date=1994 |volume=31 |issue=1 (Winter 1994) |pages=109- |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-15356444/somerset-maugham-s-the-ant-and-the-grasshopper |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torment===
The [[Ancient Greek]] playwright [[Aeschylus]] has a [[horse-fly|gadfly]] pursue and torment [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a maiden associated with the moon, watched constantly by the eyes of the herdsman Argus, associated with all the stars: "Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed." [[William Shakespeare]], inspired by Aeschylus, has [[Tom o'Bedlam]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', "Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire", driven mad by the constant pursuit.&lt;ref name="Stagman2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stagman |first=Myron |title=Shakespeare's Greek Drama Secret |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=encnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 |date=11 August 2010 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-4438-2466-8 |pages=205–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', Shakespeare likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the [[Battle of Actium|Actium battlefield]] to that of a cow chased by a gadfly: "The breeze [gadfly] upon her, like a cow in June / hoists sail and flies", where "June" may allude not only to the month but also to the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] who torments Io; and the cow in turn may allude to Io, who is changed into a cow in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref name="Walker2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=John Lewis |title=Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961–1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q3Voi0Dk_HwC&amp;pg=PA363 |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8240-6697-0 |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keling''' ({{IPA-may|kəliŋ|pron}}) or '''Kling''' is a word used in parts of [[Southeast Asia]] to denote a person of [[South Asia]]n origin, especially from [[India]] but to a lesser extent [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=Minerva&gt;{{cite book| title=Minerva English-Malay Malay-English Dictionary |author=Yang Kassim |year=1991 |location=Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes both those from India and [[overseas Indian]]s. In modern colloquial usage it is commonly not capitalised. The term is used in the [[Malay Archipelago]] — specifically [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] — but cognates exist in neighbouring countries as well. Although the early definition was neutral and linked to the historical [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga kingdom]] of Eastern India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = KBBI - Keling | work = Kamus Besar bahasa Indonesia | url = http://kbbi.web.id/Keling}}&lt;/ref&gt; its use in later history came to be perceived as a [[derogatory]] term to refer to people of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = ‘Keling’ and proud of it | author = M. Veera Pandiyan | work = The Star online | date = 10 August 2016 | url = http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/along-the-watchtower/2016/08/10/keling-and-proud-of-it-the-k-word-deemed-to-be-derogatory-and-offensive-to-the-indian-community-sinc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Keling'' derives from the ancient [[India]]n kingdom of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]. While this was apparently sometimes localized as ''Kalingga'' (as in the Indonesian [[Kalingga Kingdom]]), the terminal schwa sound was dropped in common usage to form Keling. Though ostensibly denoting the Kalinga kingdom, the term Keling in ancient Southeast Asia came to be a more general term for [[India]] and its people. The [[Khmer language|Khmer]] word Kleng (ក្លិង្គ) and the [[Thai language|Thai]] word ''Khaek'' (แขก) derived from the same root. Prior to the introduction of the English word "India", Keling and [[Jambudvipa|Jambu Dwipa]] were used to refer to the country in the [[Malaysian language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language]], while ''Benua Keling'' referred to the Indian Subcontinent.

== Usage ==
The earliest known occurrence of the word ''Keling'' appears in the in ''[[Sejarah Melayu]]'' (Malay Annals).&lt;ref name="sabrizain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/keling.htm|title=A historical perspective on the word 'Keling'|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend mentions Raja Shulan as the king of Keling who sets out to conquer China with his descendant Raja Chulan. Scholars identify Raja Chulan with the [[Rajendra Chola I|Chola king]] of India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;pg=PA147 |title= Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300–1800 |author=John N. Miksic |page=147 |publisher=NUS Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-9971-69-574-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from whom the term ''Chulia'' derives, as in Penang's Chulia Street. Later parts of the Sejarah Melayu mention the voyages of [[Hang Nadim]] and [[Hang Tuah]] to ''Benua Keling'' (India). However Keling must not be misunderstood as a specific territory, rather it refers to people of Indian origin and not only the inhabitants of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]].&lt;ref name="sabrizain"/&gt; For example, a colonial-era Indonesian tradition refers to the [[Ramayana]] epic as ''Rama Keling'' meaning "Rama the Indian".&lt;ref name=Ramayana&gt;{{cite book| title=The Ramayana Tradition in Southeast Asia| author=Singaravelu Sachithanantham| publisher=University of Malaya Press| year=2004| location=Kuala Lumpur| isbn=983-100-234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the introduction of Islam, Keling sometimes referred specifically to [[Tamils]] or [[Telugu people]] while [[Gujarat]]is and [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] from Pakistan were often confused with ''Parsi'' or Persians.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Malay-English Dictionary |author=Abdul Rahman bin Yusop |year=1964 |location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch used the words "Clings" and "Klingers" to refer to the Indian inhabitants of Malacca. The British colonial writings also use the word "Kling" to describe the immigrants from [[Madras Presidency]] and [[Coromandel coast]].&lt;ref name="sabrizain"/&gt; [[John Crawfurd]] (1856) mentioned that the term "Kling" was used by the Malays and the Javanese as "a general term for all the people of Hindustan ([[North India]]), and for the country [[List of regions of India|India]] itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[John Crawfurd]] | title = A descriptive dictionary of the Indian islands &amp; adjacent countries | publisher = Bradbury &amp; Evans | year = 1856 | page = 198 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3lZXGVuni0MC&amp;pg=PA198 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century Portuguese traveller Castanheda wrote of the Keling community in Melaka in the period between 1528-1538:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y09XAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Castanheda%20rich&amp;dq=Castanheda%20rich&amp;lr=|title=Foreign Notices of South India: From Megasthenes to Ma Huan|first=Kallidaikurichi Aiyah Nilakanta|last=Sastri|date=1 January 1939|publisher=University of Madras|accessdate=24 April 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:In the northern part [of the city of Malacca] live merchants known as Quelins [Klings — a name applied to South Indians]; in this part the town is much larger than at any other. There are at Malacca, many foreign merchants&amp;nbsp;...

In its early usage Keling was a neutral term for people of Indian origin,&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/555/ |title = Malaysian Indians |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1923 |accessdate = 30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was perceived negatively beginning in the 20th century due to various socio-political factors. From the mid-1900s, words denoting ethnic origin were used derogatively in Malay to imply immigrant status.  Consequently more neutral language was chosen for political correctness. This can be observed in the 1960 publication ''Cherita Jenaka'' in which the term ''orang Keling'' (Keling people) was changed to ''orang India'' (Indian people) in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/CJen_bib.html|title=MCP . Cerita Jenaka . bibliography|first=Malay Concordance Project, Australian National|last=University|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malay===
The word ''Keling'' has been used variously within the Malay community to mean Indian, Tamil, or south Indian. The title "Kapitan Keling" was used for a representative of an Indian community, similar to the "[[Kapitan Cina]]" of a Chinese community. In early [[Penang]] of the 1790s the ''Kapitan Keling'' was [[Cauder Mohideen]] who, together with the Kapitan Cina [[Koh Lay Huan]] and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/8/3/lifefocus/1613963&amp;sec=lifefocus|title=Recipe for rebellion: THE THIRD SPACE By NEIL KHOR and KHALDUN MALIK, The Sunday Star Sunday 3 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is preserved is the name of the [[Kapitan Keling Mosque]], a prominent Penang landmark.

In many modern cases ''Keling'' is used as a derogatory term.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; It was used in 2005 by [[Parliament of Malaysia|Members of Parliament in Malaysia]] because of misconception about Indian ethnics, which resulted in an uproar accusing the MPs of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/10/keling-apim-lodges-police-report.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101055602/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/10/keling-apim-lodges-police-report.htm |archivedate=1 November 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Javanese===
Traditionally in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]], Keling is linked with India while Kalingga refers to the 6th century [[Kalingga Kingdom]], which ultimately derived from the Indian [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] kingdom. It can possibly have other meanings, such as "ship". [[Rivet]]s used to connect metals are called ''paku keling'' or "blunt nail".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title='Keling' | publisher=Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI) | url=http://kbbi.web.id/Keling | language=Indonesian | accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in modern [[Indonesian language#Colloquial Indonesian|colloquial Indonesian]], it is sometimes used to refer to any dark-skinned person, a stereotype of southern Indians,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Definisi 'keling' | publisher=Arti Kata | url=http://artikata.com/arti-333898-keling.html | language=Indonesian | accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this usage is considered offensive.

===Cambodian===
In Cambodia, the slang term for Indian people is ''Kleng'' (ក្លិង្គ),&lt;ref&gt;Headley, RK et al, [http://www.sealang.net/khmer/dictionary.htm "SEALang Library Khmer"], ''SEALang Library'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; also derived from the kingdom of Kalinga and cognate with the Malay Keling or Kling. It may also be used as a nickname for people who have stereotypically Indian features such as big eyes and dark skin.&lt;ref&gt;Vorng Vanny, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DZhNDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT269&amp;lpg=PT269&amp;dq=cambodia+kleng+indian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDTcXlz5ZR&amp;sig=3wQoxaSWDi2scUsKcUxXwOsFwpk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixmuzxz8XdAhXF34MKHcdlDBo4FBDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cambodia%20kleng%20indian&amp;f=false ''Heartbreaking: A Survival Memoir''], New York, Page Publishing, Inc, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thai===
The equivalent of Keling in the [[Thai language]] is ''Khaek'' (แขก). It is a generic term referring to any [[South Asia]]ns, particularly those from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The term generally has no negative connotation and is used even in polite or formal communication. However, outside influence and confusion with Mughals and Indian Muslims has broadened the meaning in modern times to include certain predominantly Muslims communities, particularly Persians and Arabs. This extended meaning is considered inaccurate and at times rejected as derogatory, especially by Thai Muslims, but has become increasingly widespread.

===Chinese===
The phrases ''Keling-a'' ([[Hokkien]]; 吉寧仔; [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Kiet-lêng-á''), ''Keling-yan'' ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]; 吉寧人; [[Yale romanization of Cantonese|Yale]]: ''gat-lìhng-yan''), and ''Keling-kia'' ([[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) are frequently used within the Chinese community in Malaysia and Singapore. As with the Malay word these were not originally offensive today may be used in either a derogatory or non-derogatory manner: e.g., in [[Penang Hokkien]], which is spoken by some Indians in [[Penang]], ''Keling-a'' is the only word that exists to refer to ethnic Indians.

The Hokkien and Teochew suffixes ''-a'' and ''-kia'' are diminutives that are generally used to refer to non-Chinese ethnic groups, while "-yan" mean human.

==Names of places==
Various place names in Malaysia contain the word Keling for historical reasons, e.g. Tanjong Keling.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1177834|title=The Malay-Tamil Cultural Contacts with Special Reference to the Festival of "Mandi Safar"|first=S.|last=Singaravelu|date=1 January 1986|publisher=|volume=45|issue=1|pages=67–78|accessdate=|doi=10.2307/1177834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kampong Keling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7483|title=Archnet|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929132105/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7483|archivedate=29 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bukit Keling, etc.

In Penang, the [[Kapitan Keling Mosque]], situated on the corner of Buckingham Street and Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling (Pitt Street), is one of the oldest mosques in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]. Various other Penang Hokkien street names contain the word ''Keling'', e.g. Kiet-leng-a Ban-san (Chowrasta Road), Kiet-leng-a Ke (King Street/Market Street).

In [[Singapore]], there is a road in Jurong Industrial Estate called Tanjong Kling Road which is probably derived from the word 'Keling'.

In [[Jepara Regency]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia, there is a subdistrict called [[Keling (subdistrict)|Keling]]. Locals link the location with the 6th century [[Kalingga Kingdom]]. In [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], Indonesia, there is a place called Pacar Keling meaning "Keling lover".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6191">A number of countries maintain laws requiring the presentation of information concerning actions of the government of Germany regarding Jews in its territory during the period of that government's control by the National Socialist ([[Nazi Party|Nazi]]) German Worker's Party from 1933 to 1945, commonly referred to as the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. In the United States, laws of this kind are maintained by individual states and typically specify curriculum content and the ages of the pupils to which various portions of the curricula are to be presented.

Many of the particulars of conformance with these laws are specified or influenced by policies and pronouncements of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Holocaust Remembrance, and [[Holocaust Research]]. A country's membership in this organization, however, does not necessarily imply any legal mandate within said country regarding Holocaust education.

[[Laws against Holocaust denial|Laws prohibiting]] "[[Holocaust denial]]" are maintained by many—but not all—of the same jurisdictions that have these laws.  These laws apply to individuals and involve criminal punishment and therefore they are in all cases separate statutes.

==Nations and U.S. states==
As of November 2013, laws mandating education about the Holocaust were on the books in Austria, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as in the American states of California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In Pennsylvania, 2014 Act 70, while not yet imposing a mandate, states that schools "may offer instruction in the Holocaust, genocide and human rights violations to students". The [[Pennsylvania Department of Education|Pennsylvania State Board of Education]] will conduct a study to determine, after the 2016–2017 school year, the number of schools offering instruction over the Holocaust, genocide and human rights violations. If less than ninety percent of schools offer such instruction, the Act states that a regulation will be adopted to require such instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=2014 Act 70 – Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights Violations Instruction|type=Act |number=70 |date=June 26, 2014 |article= |articletype= |page= |url= http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/uconsCheck.cfm?yr=2014&amp;sessInd=0&amp;act=70|accessdate=November 22, 2016 |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''Leave the gate as you found it''' (or '''leave all gates as found''') is an important rule of [[courtesy]] in rural areas throughout the world. If a [[gate]] is found open, it should be left open, and if it is closed, it should be left closed. If a closed gate absolutely must be traversed, it should be closed again afterwards. It applies to visitors travelling onto or across [[farm]]s, [[ranch]]es, and [[Station (Australian agriculture)|stations]].

In low-rainfall areas, closing gates can cut [[livestock]] off from water supplies. For example, most of the land used for grazing in [[Australia]] has no natural water supplies, so drinking water for the stock must be supplied by the farmer or landowner, often by using a [[windmill]] to pump [[groundwater]]. Even visitors who know how a stock water system works may be unaware of breakdowns. During hot weather, [[cattle]] require large quantities of water to drink and can die in less than a day if they don't get it. [[Sheep]] need less water and can survive longer without it, but will die if cut off from water for several hot days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myhorse.com/training/western/an_open_and_shut_gate_on_horseback.aspx#top |title=Open and Shut a Gate Horseback |publisher=MyHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all agricultural areas, farmers need to keep groups of livestock separate, for reasons including [[Selective breeding|breeding]] for disease resistance and increased production, pest control, and controlling when ewes [[lambing|deliver their lambs]]. Unwanted mingling of flocks or herds can deprive a farmer of significant income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beginnercampingtips.com/articles/hiking-and-camping-uk.html |title=Camping Information |publisher=Beginnercampingtips.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original versions of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[The Country Code|Country Code]] advised visitors to always close gates. The revised Countryside Code now suggests that gates should be left as found.

This is a '''list of nicknames and pseudonyms of Nazis'''.  Common nicknames (as translated into English) include variations of "Beast", "Butcher" and "Angel of Death".  Most high-ranking Nazis did not have a nickname.  Most of the notable Nazis who did have nicknames were concentration camp personnel.

The common nickname of [[Sepp (given name)|Sepp]] in German for Josef, for such Nazis as [[Josef Dietrich]] and [[Josef Oberhauser]], is excluded from this list.  The definite article "the" has been removed from the nicknames for the purposes of sorting properly.

'''''Man with a Movie Camera'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as ''A Man with a Movie Camera'', ''The Man with the Movie Camera'', ''The Man with a Camera'', ''The Man with the Kinocamera'', or ''Living Russia''. See [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019760/releaseinfo#akas IMDB's list of alternate titles for ''Man with a Movie Camera''].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ru|Человек с кино-аппаратом|translit=Chelovek s kino-apparatom}}) is an experimental 1929 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[silent film|silent]] [[documentary film]], directed by [[Dziga Vertov]] and edited by his wife [[Elizaveta Svilova]].

Vertov's feature film, produced by the film studio [[All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration (VUFKU)|VUFKU]], presents urban life in the Soviet cities of [[Kiev]], [[Kharkov]], [[Moscow]] and [[Odessa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A07E7D71F30E33ABC4F52DFBF668382639EDE "Movie Review Devushka s Korobkoy (1927) THE SCREEN"], 17 September 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; It has no actors.&lt;ref&gt;Dziga Vertov. On Kinopravda. 1924, and The Man with the Movie Camera. 1928, in Annette Michelson ed. Kevin O'Brien tr. Kino-Eye : The Writings of Dziga Vertov, University of California Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have "characters," they are the cameramen of the title, the film editor, and the modern Soviet Union they discover and present in the film.

''Man with a Movie Camera'' is famous for the range of [[cinematic techniques]] Vertov invented, deployed or developed, such as [[Multiple exposure#Multiple exposure techniques|multiple exposure]], [[Time-lapse|fast motion]], [[slow motion]], [[Freeze frame shot|freeze frames]], [[match cut]]s, [[jump cut]]s, [[Split screen (film)|split screens]], [[Dutch angle]]s, extreme [[close-up]]s, [[tracking shot]]s, reversed footage, [[stop motion|stop motion animations]] and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).

''Man with a Movie Camera'' was largely dismissed upon its initial release; the work's [[Fast cutting|quick-cut editing]], [[Metafiction|self-reflexivity]], and emphasis on [[Form and content|form over content]] were all subjects of criticism. In the British Film Institute's 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll, however, film critics voted it the [[List of films considered the best|eighth greatest film ever made]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sight &amp; Sound Revises Best-Films-Ever Lists|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2012/08/sight-sound-revises-best-films-ever-lists/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=studiodaily|date=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work was later named the best documentary of all time in the same magazine.&lt;ref name="BBC-doc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28602506 |title=Silent film tops documentary poll |accessdate=1 August 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Man With A Movie Camera (Dziga Vertov, 1929).webm|The complete 68-minute film|thumb|right]]
The film has an unabashedly [[avant-garde]] style, and emphasizes that film can go ''anywhere''. For instance, the film uses such scenes as superimposing a shot of a cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, superimposing a cameraman inside a beer glass, filming a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed, even filming a woman giving birth, and the baby being taken away to be bathed.

Vertov's message about the prevalence and unobtrusiveness of filming was not yet true – cameras might have been able to go anywhere, but not without being noticed; they were too large to be hidden easily, and too noisy to remain hidden anyway.  To get footage using a hidden camera, Vertov and his brother [[Mikhail Kaufman]] (the film's co-author) had to distract the subject with something else even louder than the camera filming them{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

The film also features a few obvious stagings such as the scene of a woman getting out of bed and getting dressed and the shot of chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). The film was criticized for both the stagings and the stark experimentation, possibly as a result of its director's frequent assailing of fiction film as a new "opiate of the masses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psi416.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Screen-1977-Crofts-9-60.pdf|title=An Essay Towards Man with a Movie Camera|last=Crofts|first=Stephen|date=|website=http://psi416.cankaya.edu.tr/uploads/files/Screen-1977-Crofts-9-60.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertov's intentions==
[[Image:Mikhail kaufman on train.jpg|thumb|In this shot, Mikhail Kaufman acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot]]
Vertov – born David Abelevich Kaufman – was an early pioneer in documentary film-making during the late 1920s. He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the [[kinoks]], or kino-oki (kino-[[eye]]s). Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making. This radical approach to movie making led to a slight dismantling of film industry: the very field in which they were working. Most of Vertov's films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers of the time. Vertov's crowning achievement, ''Man with a Movie Camera'', was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, ''[[A Sixth Part of the World]]''. Critics had declared that Vertov's overuse of "[[intertitle]]s" was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the 'kinoks' subscribed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Working within that context, Vertov dealt with much fear in anticipation of the film's release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central [[Communist]] newspaper, ''[[Pravda]]'', which spoke directly of the film's experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Upon the official release of ''Man with a Movie Camera'', Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The film ''Man with a Movie Camera'' represents&lt;br /&gt;
AN EXPERIMENTATION IN THE CINEMATIC COMMUNICATION&lt;br /&gt;
Of visual phenomena&lt;br /&gt;
WITHOUT THE USE OF INTERTITLES&lt;br /&gt;
(a film without intertitles)&lt;br /&gt;
WITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCENARIO&lt;br /&gt;
(a film without a scenario)&lt;br /&gt;
WITHOUT THE HELP OF THEATRE&lt;br /&gt;
(a film without actors, without sets, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
This new experimentation work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This manifesto echoes an earlier one that Vertov wrote in 1922, in which he disavowed popular films he felt were indebted to literature and theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/reviews/vertov.htm|title=Images - Man With a Movie Camera by Grant Tracey'']|author=|date=|work=imagesjournal.com|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylistic aspects==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Man with a Movie Camera poster 2.jpg|thumb|Poster by [[Stenberg brothers]] (1929)]] --&gt;
Working within a [[Marxist]] ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city’s purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino’s aesthetic shined through in his portrayal of electrification, [[industrialization]], and the achievements of workers through hard labour. This could also be viewed as early [[modernism]] in film.

Some have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from [[Walter Ruttmann]]'s ''[[Berlin: Symphony of a Great City]]'' (1927), which predates ''Man with a Movie Camera'' by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Dziga Vertov. Letter from Berlin page 101, in Annette Michelson ed. Kevin O'Brien tr. Kino-Eye : The Writings of Dziga Vertov, University of California Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries for the last ten years, all of which predate ''Berlin''. Vertov's pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na'ou (1905–1940) whose ''The Man Who Has a Camera '' (1933), pays explicit homage to Vertov's ''The Man With a Movie Camera''.&lt;ref&gt;Rhythmic movement, the city symphony and transcultural transmediality: Liu Na'ou and The Man Who Has a Camera (1933)  Ling Zhang a Department of Cinema and Media Studies, The University of Chicago, Classics 305, 1010 E. 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA Journal of Chinese Cinemas Volume 9, Issue 1, 2015, pages 42- 61 Published online: 11 March 2015 DOI: 10.1080/17508061.2015.1010303&lt;/ref&gt;

On a technical note, ''Man with a Movie Camera'''s usage of double exposure and seemingly 'hidden' cameras made the movie come across as a very surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, which change size or appear underneath other objects ([[Multiple exposure#Double exposure|double exposure]]). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities, which could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film's lack of 'actors' and 'sets' makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is "[separated] from the language of theatre and literature."

==Production==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
''Man with a Movie Camera'', depicting the daily life of a Soviet city, was actually filmed over a period of about 3 years. Four Soviet cities – [[Kharkiv]], [[Kiev]], [[Moscow]] and [[Odessa]] – were the shooting locations.&lt;ref name="Aitken2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Aitken|title=The Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ay5rIWCXlLsC&amp;pg=PA602|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=4 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-51206-3|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Initial===
''Man with a Movie Camera'' was not always a highly regarded work. Vertov's Soviet contemporaries criticized its focus on form over content, with [[Sergei Eisenstein]] even deriding the film as "pointless camera hooliganism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/64140%7C0/Man-With-a-Movie-Camera.html|title=Man With a Movie Camera|last=Feaster|first=Felicia|publisher=Turner Classic Movies, Inc.|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was largely dismissed in the West as well.&lt;ref name="BFI Best Docs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-sound-magazine/greatest-docs|title=Critics’ 50 Greatest Documentaries of All Time|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentary filmmaker [[Paul Rotha]] said that in Britain, Vertov was "regarded really as rather a joke, you know. All this cutting, and one camera photographing another camera – it was all trickery, and we didn't take it seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AcfvcuHC4IIC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Man With the Movie Camera: The Film Companion|page=99|last=Roberts|first=Graham|publisher=I.B. Tauris|date=2000|isbn=1860643949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of the film's editing – more than four times faster than a typical 1929 feature, with approximately 1,775 separate shots – also perturbed some viewers, including ''[[The New York Times]]''' reviewer [[Mordaunt Hall]]:
:"The producer, Dziga Vertov, does not take into consideration the fact that the human eye fixes for a certain space of time that which holds the attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090701/REVIEWS08/907019993/-1/rss|title=Man With a Movie Camera|author=Roger Ebert|date=1 July 2009|work=suntimes.com|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of doubts before screening, and great anticipation from Vertov's pre-screening statements, the film gained great interest before even being shown{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. Once the film was finally screened, the public either embraced or dismissed Vertov's stylistic choices.

===Reevaluation===
''Man with a Movie Camera'' is now regarded by many as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]], having ranked eighth in the 2012 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll of the world's best films. In 2009, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "It made explicit and poetic the astonishing gift the cinema made possible, of arranging what we see, ordering it, imposing a rhythm and language on it, and transcending it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6a21d217|title=Man with a Movie Camera (1929)|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
''Man with a Movie Camera'' has been interpreted as an [[optimism|optimistic]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/man-with-a-movie-camera-review-power-to-the-people-1.2302290|title=Man with a Movie Camera review: power to The People|last=Brady|first=Tara|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Romney has called it "an exuberant manifesto that celebrates the infinite possibilities of what cinema can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/02/man-with-a-movie-camera-review-pure-cinema-unparalleled|title=Man With a Movie Camera review – pure cinema, still unparalleled|last=Romney|first=Jonathan|newspaper=The Observer|date=2 August 2015|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bradshaw of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the work "is visibly excited about the new medium’s possibility, dense with ideas, packed with energy: it echoes ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'', anticipates [[Jean Vigo|Vigo]]'s ''[[À propos de Nice]]'' and the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] generally, and even [[Leni Riefenstahl|Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/30/man-with-a-movie-camera-review|title=Man With a Movie Camera review – visionary, transformative 1929 experimental film|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">A '''moral victory''' occurs when a person, team, army or other group loses a confrontation, and yet achieves some other [[morality|moral]] gain. This gain might be unrelated to the confrontation in question, and the gain is often considerably less than what would have been accomplished if an actual victory had been achieved. 

For example, a sports team that is a heavy [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] and loses narrowly to a superior opponent might claim a moral victory, acquitting themselves well even in defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE2DF103FF930A35751C0A96E9C8B63|title= Giants Hope a Moral Victory Can Lead to a Real One|publisher=''New York Times''|date=2008-02-03|author=Lapointe, Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team that plays fairly and loses to a cheating team might also claim a moral victory in spite of the loss. 

Another  moral victory can be seen in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]]'', where the character  [[Giles Corey]] was pressed to death by large stones because he remained silent, neither denying nor confirming the accusations of witchcraft. Because "witches" had all their land and property taken from them, his silence allowed his children to inherit his land when they could not have otherwise.

From a sporting context, a moral victory could be seen in Peter Maxey's 3-0 loss to Alex Lowery, in Michael Page Finance's final day prior to an office move. Sure, the history books will show a 3-0 victory for Alex, but it is commonly agreed amongst fellow players, pundits and historians that Maxey's style of play, aggressive shots, entertaining play and showmanship scored the moral victory. Other examples include [[University of South Carolina Gamecocks vs Clemson University Tigers (2018 Palmetto Bowl: 56 CU - 35 Scar; 3 Touchdown Defeat)]]. This marked the fifth straight defeat in the lopsided rivalry, however the Gamecock faithful found relief in the loss compared to the previous four humiliating meetings.

Others may include scenarios in which a force loses a struggle, but inflicts great losses upon their opponents (the opposite of a [[Pyrrhic victory]]. Examples include the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]).

The '''National Academy of Medicine''' ('''NAM'''), formerly called the '''Institute of Medicine''' ('''IoM'''), is an [[United States|American]] [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[NGO|non-governmental organization]]. The National Academy of Medicine is a part of the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]], along with the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS), [[National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE), and the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] (NRC). 

The National Academy of Medicine provides national and international advice on issues relating to health, medicine, health policy, and biomedical science. It aims to provide unbiased, evidence-based, and authoritative information and advice concerning health and science policy to policy-makers, professionals, leaders in every sector of society, and the public at large.

Operating outside the framework of the U.S. federal government, it relies on a volunteer workforce of scientists and other experts, operating under a formal [[Peer review|peer-review]] system.  As a [[national academy]], new members of the organization are elected annually by current members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in a relevant field as well as for their willingness to participate actively.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1970, under the congressional charter of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] as the Institute of Medicine.&lt;ref name="About the NAM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://nam.edu/about-the-nam/|title = About the NAM|publisher = National Academy of Medicine|accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2015, NAS membership voted in favor of reconstituting the membership of the IOM as a new National Academy of Medicine and establishing a new division on health and medicine within the NRC that has the program activities of the IOM at its core. These changes took effect on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/IOM-to-become-NAM-Press-Release.aspx|title = Institute of Medicine to Become National Academy of Medicine|publisher=The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine|accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our Study Process|url = http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Study-Process.aspx|publisher = National Academy of Medicine|accessdate = 2015-11-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091016094950/http://www.iom.edu/About-IOM/Study-Process.aspx|archivedate = 2009-10-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is conducted by committees of volunteer scientists—leading national and international experts—who serve without compensation. Committees are composed in an attempt to assure the requisite expertise and to avoid bias or conflict of interest. Every report produced by committee undergoes extensive review and evaluation by a group of external experts who are anonymous to the committee, and whose names are revealed only once the study is published. [[Victor Dzau]] is President and Chairman of the Council. His six-year term began on July 1, 2014. The Leonard D. Schaeffer Executive Officer is [[J. Michael McGinnis]].

The majority of studies and other activities are requested and funded by the federal government. Private industry, foundations, and state and local governments also initiate studies, as does the academy itself. Reports are made available online for free by the publishing arm of the United States National Academies, the [[National Academies Press]], in multiple formats.

The academy is both an honorific membership organization and a policy research organization. Its members, elected on the basis of their professional achievement and commitment to service, serve without compensation in the conduct of studies and other activities on matters of significance to health. Election to active membership is both an honor and a commitment to serve in Institute affairs. The bylaws specify that no more than 80 new members shall be elected annually, including 10 from outside the United States. The announcement of newly elected members occurs at the Annual Meeting in October. As of October 20, 2015, the number of regular members plus international and emeritus members is 2,012.&lt;ref name="About the NAM"/&gt; An unusual diversity of talent among NAM members is assured by the charter stipulation that at least one-quarter be selected from outside the health professions, from such fields as the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, as well as law, administration, engineering, and the humanities.

''[[The New York Times]]'' called the NAM (then called the IOM) the United States' "most esteemed and authoritative adviser on issues of health and medicine, and its reports can transform medical thinking around the world."&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner Harris (August 25, 2011). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/health/26vaccine.html Vaccine Cleared Again as Autism Culprit]" ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The [[Sarnat Prize|Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health]] (Sarnat Prize) was established in 1992 and is awarded annually by the Academy to recognize individuals, groups, or organizations for outstanding achievement in improving mental health. It is accompanied by a medal and $20,000. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://nam.edu/about-the-nam/the-rhoda-and-bernard-sarnat-international-prize-in-mental-health/|title=The Rhoda and Bernard Sarnat International Prize in Mental Health|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate= 7 November 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neomodernism''' is a term that has at times been used to describe a philosophical position based on [[modernism]] but addressing the critique of modernism by [[postmodernism]]. It is currently associated with the works of [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Victor Grauer]] and [[Carlos Escudé]] and it is strongly rooted in the criticisms which [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] has leveled at [[postmodern philosophy]], namely that [[Moral universalism|universalism]] and critical thinking are the two essential elements of [[human rights]] and that human rights create a superiority of some cultures over others. That is, that equality and relativism are "mutually contradictory".{{citequote|date=March 2009}}&lt;!--On 17 March 2009, editor Apoc 2400 removed a bad reference to Icon Group International, noting that it "publishes computer-generated books, often from Wikipedia articles".--&gt;

== History ==
Soon after the [[Modernism|modern movement]], reactions were formed based in the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The reaction took on the name of [[existentialism]], and was characterized by the phrase "[[existence precedes essence]]". Existentialism was followed by [[postmodernism]], which embraced Nietzsche's critique of the will to truth, which is the standing characteristic of modernism. Neomodernists maintain that truth still exists in a universal form and directly refute existentialist and postmodern viewpoints that the essence of an existent is formed in the observer's bias. Neomodernists stand against the discrediting of the concept of [[authorial intent]] in postmodern hermeneutics. Instead, they state that a text written in simple terms can only have the meaning that the author intended, rather than finding that even the most straightforward text can have multiple interpretations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Associated individuals ==

=== Ágnes Heller ===
Ágnes Heller's work is associated with [[Moral Anthropology]] and "probing modernity's destiny for a non-predatory humanism that combines the existential wisdom of ancient theory with modern values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chall|first=Leo P.|title=Sociological Abstracts: User's Reference Manual|publisher=Sociological Abstracts|year=1952|page=2040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neomodernism accepts some aspects of postmodernism's critique of modernism, notably that modernism elevated the world view of dominant groups to the status of objective fact, thereby failing to express the viewpoint of "[[subaltern]] groups," such as women and ethnic minorities. However, in her view, neomodernism rejects postmodernism as:

* Unscientific: the ability of science to generate useful knowledge cannot be waved away as "[[scientism]]".
* Journalism: as not giving any explanation as to how or why things happen.
* Local: as being unable to recognise patterns that occur across time or location.
* Unverified: as lacking any validation process, and therefore proceeding by fad and hierarchy.

=== Victor Grauer ===
In 1982, Victor Grauer attacked "the cult of the new," and proposed that there had arisen a "neo-modern" movement in the arts which was based on deep formal rigor, rather than on "the explosion of pluralism."&lt;ref name="doktorgee.worldzonepro"&gt;''Downtown Review'', Vol. 3 Nos. 1&amp;2, Fall/ Winter/ Spring 1981/82. Available at http://doktorgee.worldzonepro.com/MODERN.htm. Retrieved 4 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His argument was that [[post-modernism]] was exclusively a negative attack on modernism, and had no future separate from modernism proper, a point of view which is held by many scholars of modernism.&lt;ref name="doktorgee.worldzonepro" /&gt;

=== Carlos Escudé ===

In "Natural Law at War", a review essay published on 31 May 2002 in ''The Times Literary Supplement'' (London, TLS No. 5174), Carlos Escudé wrote: “Postmodern humanity faces a major challenge. It must solve a dilemma it does not want to face. If all cultures are morally equivalent, then all human individuals are not endowed with the same human rights, because some cultures award some men more rights than are allotted to other men and women. If, on the other hand, all men and women are endowed with the same human rights, then all cultures are not morally equivalent, because cultures that acknowledge that ‘all men are created equal’ are to be regarded as ‘superior,’ or ‘more advanced’ in terms of their civil ethics than those that do not.” Escudé's brand of neomodernism contends with “politically-correct intellectuals who prefer to opt for the easy way out, asserting both that we all have the same human rights and that all cultures are equal.”

===Andre Durand and Armando Alemdar===
Published their own Neomodernist Manifesto in 2001. The Neomodern Manifesto posits criteria for a revitalised approach to works of art founded on history, traditional artistic disciplines, theology and philosophy. Durand's and Alemdar's Neomodernism views art as an act of expression of the sublime; in Neomodern painting as a representation of the visual appearance of things with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, truth, and good. Neomodern works of art via mimesis interpret and present the universe and man’s existence, in line with the belief that the reality we live is but a mirror of another universe that can only be accessed through inspiration and imagination.

===Gabriel Omowaye===
Gabriel Lolu Omowaye, in his speech 'A new challenging time' to a group of college students in Nigeria, in 2005, took a different approach to neomodernism. He viewed neomodernism as a political philosophy that became more prominent in the early 21st century. To him, it involves common goal and joint global effort - universalism - to address arising global challenges such as population growth, natural resources, climate change and environmental factors, natural causes and effects, and health issues. Omowaye posited that political will is the major driver of economic necessities. As a result, he added that neomodernism involves limited government-regulated liberalism along with high drive innovation and entrepreneurship, high literacy rate, progressive taxation for social equity, philanthropism, technological advancement, economic development and individual growth. He perceived the quest for equal representation of men and women in the neomodern era as a strong signal for advent of postmodernism. So also, the quest for youths engagement in resourceful and rewarding ways especially in governance, peace building and self-productivity has not taken a formidable shape than it is at this time. As far as he was concerned, he believed most of these challenges were not adequately tackled in preceding eras and the arising challenges thus stated were not prepared for and that cause for change in mentality and thinking which the neomodern era is providing for solutions to the era's challenges, with a prospective view to global stability and social inclusion. His philosophical thought premised on a fact that new times require new approaches from new reasonings, even if some applicable ideas or methologies could be borrowed from the past, an acute form of paradigm-shift.

Omowaye believed in idealism as guiding realism and in turn, realism as defining idealism. Moral concepts cannot be wished away from social norms, but evolving social trends dissipate morality in form of religion and logical standards and adheres to current norms in form of 'what should be'. Consequently, the manner at which 'what should be' is driven at in the modern and postmodern eras, being widely accepted became 'what is'. The manner at which the damage of the new 'what is' is hampering development process in the form of higher mortality rate and decadence of cultural good, calls to question the ideology behind the norms that are less beneficial to a wider society in form of globalization. The world as a whole through technological advancement became a global community particularly, in the 21st century. Former Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan then stated that the "suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere". Champions of neomodern age such as Bill Gates and Richard Branson in the field of philanthropy expounded their vision to encompass the global community in social good such as alleviating poverty, eradicating diseases, enhancing literacy rates and addressing climate changes.

Technological advancement of the neomodern era however has its downturns in that it added to the decadence in cultural good such that people everywhere, especially high number of youths follow the trends in the new 'what is', which include social celebrities in the form of dressing, sexual activities, extravagancies, and less interest in learning and even, working but more interest in making money. Money became a value-determinant than utility. This brought about frauds in various sectors. This latter aspect is not limited to youths but even company executives, and politicians of many societies. Technological advancement has made privacy less safer for intrusion and people more safer for protection. The supposedly good of technological advancement in the neomodern era has included whistle blow such as Wikileaks' Julian Assange. The more good has been in the level of innovations and innovators it has sprung up such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and easier business models and broader social connectivity. This latter part has lessened more amity in immediate environment and many people tend to live more in the virtual world neomodern technological advancements have created.

Neomodernism checks more into the current relative way of living of people and the society to correct necessary abnormalities and to encourage virtues and values within the global community in the 21st century.

In furtherance, Gabriel Omowaye's view of neomodernism was that knowledge comes from learning and experience, and wisdom primarily from intuition. Knowledge is a variable of set occurrences of that which happens to a man and that which a man seeks to know. Knowledge is vital and good for discretion but a minor part of discernment wherein what is known might not be applicable. Intuition is a function of the mind and the mind, not seen, and yet unknown to the carrier, is a function of what put the thoughts, ideas and discretion in it. Wisdom without knowledge is vague, and knowledge without wisdom, unworthy. Wisdom perfects knowledge, and in the absence of either, the sole is delusory.

Neomodernism has been cited in law as applying to an approach which grants economic rights to indigenous peoples, but without restricting them to their traditional economic activities. Neomodernism recognizes the importance of the human side of organizations. People and their needs are put at the center and, with the recognition that the values and beliefs of people both shape and are shaped by their experiences of organizational life, comes an interest in areas such as organizational culture, leadership and management.

[[File:Octan logo.svg|thumb|Octan logo, unchanged since 1992.]]

'''Octan''' is a fictional [[oil company]] that has appeared in multiple [[Lego]] sets since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sets with "Octan" in the title|url=http://brickset.com/sets?query=Octan|website=Brickset: LEGO Guide and Database|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sets tagged with "Octan"|url=https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Octan|website=Brickset: LEGO Guide and Database|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Before that time, logos of the real-world oil companies [[Esso]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] and [[Exxon]] were used on sets. The Shell logo continued to be used on promotional sets after that time. In 2014, Lego announced it would not renew its marketing agreement with Shell, under pressure from the environmental group [[Greenpeace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lego ends Shell partnership following Greenpeace campaign|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/09/lego-ends-shell-partnership-following-greenpeace-campaign|website=The Guardian|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Octan'' (or ''oktan'') is the Danish word for [[octane]], the chemical compound that gives [[gasoline]] its resistance to detonation.

Octan has appeared in a number of [[List of Lego video games|Lego video games]]. ''[[Lego Island]]'' for example features an Octan gas station and the company sponsors the race track. 

In ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', Octan is the base company of the main antagonist Lord Business.  His company is the producer of almost all of the commodities in his dominion.

In the Lego set 7747 Wind Turbine Transport, the Octan logo had a new part in it which said Energy, which implies that it now produces [[renewable energy]], not just oil products. Then, in the set 60016 Tanker Truck, the Energy part of it is larger suggesting that Octan is now going green.

In a number of Town and City sets it is shown that Octan has a racing team that competes in at least Formula One, GT racing and rallying.

An unpublished manuscript entitled "Ordenanzas del Baratillo de México"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|first=Pedro Anselmo
|last=Chreslos Jache
|url=http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/biblioteca/Ordenanzas%20del%20baratillo%20de%20M%C3%A9xico%20dadas%20por%20v%C3%ADa%20de%20exortaci%C3%B3n%20o%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20consejo%20a%20sus%20doctores%20%20%20/qls/Chreslos%20Jache,%20Pedro%20Anselmo/qls/bdh0000044721;
|title=
Ordenanzas del baratillo de México dadas por vía de exortación o consejo a sus doctores compuestas por don Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache
|publisher=Biblioteca Nacional de España}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Decrees of the Baratillo of Mexico) was signed and dated in 1754 by Pedro Anselmo Chreslos Jache, likely a pseudonym for an educated Spaniard.  It is a satirical piece of eighteenth-century colonial literature written in [[New Spain]] (modern day Mexico), which sought to offer an alternative view of life in colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Julie Greer|title=Satire in Colonial America: Turning the New World Upside Down|year=1993|publisher=University of Texas|location=Austin|isbn=978-0-292-72980-3|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The Baratillo was an infamous market in [[Mexico City]] known for the sale of used items, many of which had been stolen and were cheaply priced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Sandra|title=La Plaza Mayor, tres siglos de dominación española|url=http://www.guiadelcentrohistorico.mx/kmcero/1-el-centro-fondo/la-plaza-mayor-tres-siglos-de-dominaci-n-espa-ola|publisher=Nueva Guia del Centro Histórico de México|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a place for the poor and lower class of Mexico, usually racially mixed people, to mingle and purchase items for subsistence.

Ordenanzas, or official decrees, were established to regulate New Spanish society in general. The author’s 377 ordenanzas mimicked the official statutes, but would completely reverse the power system based on the [[Casta|sistema de castas]]. In effect, Chreslos Jache mocks the [[limpieza de sangre]] by creating a separate system of classification for Spaniards. For example, “medio Españoles” (half-Spanish) and “cuartilla de Español” (one-quarter Spanish) were parodies of terms to identify persons of mixed race, like “[[mestizo]]”, “[[castiza]]”, “[[Zambo|lobo]]”, and countless others.

The purpose of this manuscript was to show a chaotic view of life in Mexico in which the castas used a variety of strategies to substantiate their control over society and that the casta system itself is self-regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona Katzew|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10971-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chreslos Jache pokes fun at this idea of self-regulation by making up ridiculous names that are impossible to adequately translate for the terminology of the sistema de castas. The manuscript states that the sistema de castas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruffin II|first=Herbert G.|title=Blackpast.org: Remembered and Reclaimed.|publisher=Blackpast.org|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also mocked by the formation of the Baratillo “brotherhood” which was composed exclusively of non-whites, mainly [[mulatto]]s. This brotherhood banned membership to Spaniards and their descendants, and instead made them targets of the brotherhood’s scams. By using the Baratillo brotherhood, Chreslos Jache inverts the traditional racial attitude of the time where Spaniards and [[Criollo people|creole]]s dominated the system.

==Impact==

The manuscript reinforced race as a category of power differentiation within New Spain because it was a text that circulated among the educated elite in a time when primarily upper class people were literate. The significance of this satirical manuscript in relation to [[Casta]] paintings is that, much like the manuscript, the paintings reflect racial debate and also contribute to the interpretation of racial culture during the second half of the eighteenth-century in New Spain.

The '''''Pasyón''''' ({{lang-es|Pasión}}) is a [[Literature of the Philippines|Philippine]] [[epic poem|epic]] narrative of the life of [[Jesus Christ]], focused on his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], [[Death of Jesus|Death]], and [[Resurrection]]. In stanzas of five lines of eight syllables each, the standard elements of epic poetry are interwoven with a colourful, dramatic theme. 

The uninterrupted recitation or ''Pabasa'' of the whole epic is a popular [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Filipino Catholic]] devotion during the [[Lenten]] season, and particularly during [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]].

In 2011, the performing art was cited by the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/pdf_file/domain2/019_Pasion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The text is an adaptation of the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Hispanic]] Filipino art of chanting epic poems as a part of [[oral tradition]]. After [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] was [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|introduced by the Spaniards]], the Passion cycle was adapted into this native narrative form. 

The indigenous form of the ''Pasyón'' was first written down by [[Gaspar Aquino de Belén]] in "''Ang Mahal na Pasión ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola''" ("The Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that is a Poem"), written in 1703 and approved in 1704.

An 1852 erudition by Aniceto de Merced, ''El libro de la vida'' ("The Book of the Life [of Jesus]") did not prove popular with the masses.

===''Pasyóng Genesís''===
The most popular [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] version of the ''Pasyón'' is the "''Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa''" ("The Story of the Passion of Jesus Christ, Our Lord, which Rightly Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth"). 

This version is also known as the ''Pasyóng Genesís'' as the [[Genesis creation narrative]] precedes the sections concerning the Virgin Mary and Christ. Another name for the text is ''Pasyóng Pilapil'', after the foreword by a certain Dr Mariano Pilapil found in the 1814 printing. The book's [[title page]] describes it as being commissioned by former [[Archbishop of Manila]] José Seguí, O.S.A., and former [[Order of Saint Augustine#Philippines|Augustinian]] [[Provincial superior|provincial]] Manuel Grijalvo, O.S.A., with corrections to the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] phrases done by a certain Fr Amador W. Cruz. 

A widely circulated version of the ''Pasyóng Genesís'' is the 1949 printing by Ignacio Luna and Sons, Co. The edition's title begins with ''Awit at Salaysay...'' ("Song and Narrative") instead of ''
≠{{Reflist}}&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aysayan''.

== Devotional use ==
[[File:Pasyon.pdf|thumb|left|220px|Sample text from the 1949 ''Pasyóng Genesís'', showing the opening prayers invoking [[God the Father]] and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Saint Mary]]. These are followed by the Creation narrative, beginning with a [[catechesis]] on the nature of the [[Blessed Trinity|Triune]] [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].]]
The ''Pasyón'' is normally heard during [[Holy Week in the Philippines]], where its recitation is known as the ''[[Pabasa (ritual)|Pabása]]'' ("Reading"). The rite can span several days, extending no later than [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]], but it is often ended on [[Good Friday]] at noon or before 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] ([[GMT+8]]) – the traditional hour of Jesus' death on the cross. 

Readers chant the ''Pasyón'' from beginning to end without pause; this non-stop recitation is facilitated by devotees chanting in shifts. The chanters usually perform the rite as a ''panatà'' ("vow"), or votive offering in request or thanksgiving. Devotees are frequently older women and some men, but in recent years younger Filipinos have shown an increased interest in the custom. 

The ''Pasyón'' is almost always chanted while facing an altar with religious icons, particularly those related to the suffering and death of Christ. Temporary altars are often erected within the home or inside an outdoor booth decorated with palm leaves. The ''Pabasa'' may also be performed at a local ''visita''/''kapilya'' ([[chapel of ease]]) or some other communal area.

As per Filipino etiquette, the host of the ''Pabasa'' (often the master or mistress of the house) is responsible for feeding the shifts of chanters as well as other guests.

=== Musical setting ===
There are various traditional settings or ''tono'' for the ''Pasyón'' that have been passed down through the centuries. Recent innovations include setting the epic to modern ballads, pop music, and contemporary hymns, in some places a rap or hip hop variant is used. Instrumental accompaniment to the ''Pabasa'' is not uniform in practise; the guitar and keyboard are commonly employed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">The '''Pedlar of Swaffham''' is an [[English folklore|English folktale]] from [[Swaffham]], [[Norfolk]]. The following text is taken from ''English fairy and other folk tales'', 1906, which in turn refers to the ''Diary of Abraham dela Pryme'', 1699:

==Sources==
[[File:The Town Sign, Swaffham, 02-03-2009 (1).JPG|thumb|The Pedlar of Swaffham on a [[Swaffham]] town sign]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''The Pedlar of Swaffham'''&lt;br /&gt;
Tradition says that there lived in former times in Soffham (Swaffham), alias Sopham, in [[Norfolk]], a certain pedlar, who dreamed that if he went to [[London Bridge]], and stood there, he should hear very joyfull news, which he at first slighted, but afterwards, his dream being doubled 
and trebled upon him, he resolved to try the issue of it, and accordingly went to London, and stood on the bridge there two or three days, looking about him, but heard nothing that might yield him any comfort. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;At last it happened that a shopkeeper there, hard by, having noted his fruitless standing, seeing that he neither sold any wares nor asked any almes, went to him and most earnestly begged to know what he wanted there, or what his business was; to which the pedlar honestly answered that he had dreamed that if he came to London and stood there upon the bridge he should hear good newse; at which the shop-keeper laught heartily, asking him if he was such a fool as to take a journey on such a silly errand, adding: "I'll tell thee, country fellow, last night I dreamed that I was at Sopham, in Norfolk, a place utterly unknown to me, where methought behind a pedlar's house in a certain orchard, and under a great oak tree, if I dug I should find a vast treasure! Now think you," says he, "that I am such a fool to take such a long journey upon me upon the instigation of a silly dream? No, no, I'm wiser. Therefore, good fellow, learn wit from me, and get you home, and mind your business." 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The pedlar observing his words, what he had say'd he dream'd, and knowing they concentred in him, glad of such joyfull newse, went speedily home, and digged and found a prodigious great treasure, with which he grew exceeding rich ; and Soffham (Church) being for the most part fallen down, he set on workmen and rectified it most sumptuously, at his own charges ; and to this day there is his statue therein, but in stone, with his pack at his back and his dogg at his heels ; and his memory is also preserved by the same form or picture in most of the old glass windows, taverns, and alehouses of that town unto this day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/englishfairyothe00hartiala English fairy and other folk tales]; p.76-77; by Hartland, Edwin Sidney, 1848-1927; Publisher: London : W.

Similar legends can be found throughout Europe and the Middle-East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1645.html www.pitt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest version is one of the  poems of the [[Masnavi|Mathanawi]] titled ''"In Baghdad, Dreaming of Cairo: In Cairo, Dreaming of Baghdad"'', by 13th century Persian poet [[Jalal al-Din Rumi]].&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Rumi, transl. Coleman Barks, New York: HarperCollins, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This poem was turned into a story in the tale from The [[One Thousand and One Nights]]: ''The man who became rich through a dream'';&lt;ref&gt;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, ([http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1645.html#richdream The Man Who Became Rich through a Dream]) translated by Richard F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21306">'''Proto-Berber''' is the reconstructed [[proto-language]] from which the modern [[Berber languages]] stem. Proto-Berber was an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language, and as such, its descendant [[Berber languages]] are cousins to the [[Egyptian language]],  [[Cushitic languages]], [[Semitic languages]], [[Chadic languages]], and the [[Omotic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Allati|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Proto-Berber shows features that clearly distinguish it from all other branches of Afroasiatic, but modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous. Whereas the split from the other known Afroasiatic branches was very ancient, on the order of 10,000~9,000 years ago, according to [[glottochronological]] studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Militarev|first=A.|chapter=Sovremennoe sravnitel'no-istoricheskoe afrazijskoe jazykoznanie: chto ono mozhet dat' istoricheskoj nauke?|title=Lingvisticheskaja rekonstrukcija i drevnejshaja istorija Vostoka|volume=3|pages=3–26, 44–50|place=Moscow|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proto-Berber might be as recent as 3,000 years ago. Louali &amp; Philippson (2003) propose, on the basis of the lexical reconstruction of livestock-herding, a Proto-Berber 1 (PB1) stage around 7,000 years ago and a Proto-Berber 2 (PB2) stage as the direct ancestor of contemporary Berber languages.&lt;ref&gt;Louali &amp; Philippson 2003, "''Les Protoméditerranéens Capsiens sont-ils des protoberbères ? Interrogations de linguiste.''", GALF (Groupement des Anthropologues de Langue Française), Marrakech, 22-25 septembre 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third millennium BC, proto-Berber speakers spread across the area from [[Morocco]] to [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]]. In the last millennium BC, another Berber expansion created the Berber peoples noted in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] records. The final spread occurred in the first millennium BC, when the Tuareg, now possessing camels, moved into the central [[Sahara]];&lt;ref&gt;Heine 2000, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; in the past, the northern parts of the Sahara were much more inhabitable than they are now.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 2005, pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that there are reconstructions for all major species of domestic [[ruminant]] except for the [[camel]] in Proto-Berber implies that its speakers produced livestock and were pastoralists.&lt;ref&gt;Blench 2006, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another dating system is based on examining the differences that characterize ancient stages of Semitic and Egyptian in the third millennium BC. Many researchers&lt;ref&gt;Bomhard, A.R &amp; Kerns, J.C., 1994, The Nostratic Macrofamily. A study in Distant Linguistic Relationship, Berlin, New York, Mouton)&lt;/ref&gt; have estimated the differences to have taken 4,000 years to evolve, resulting in breaking this language family in six distinct groups (Semitic, Egyptian, Berber, Cushitic, Chadic and Omotic) in the eighth millennium BC. Proto-Afroasiatic is thus from the tenth millennium since it took at least 2,000 years before it reached the stage where these different branches of this language family evolved.

From that perspective, Proto-Berber was the first Berber stage to depart from Proto-Afrosiatic in the eighth millennium. It was restructured several times during the almost 10,000 years that separated it from its modern shape, which has preserved few relics.&lt;ref&gt;Allati, A. 2002. Diachronie tamazight ou berbère, Tanger, Publications de l’Université Abdelmalek Essaâdi; 2011c. "De l’ergativité dans le berbère moderne" in Studi Africanistici, Quaderna di Studi berberi e Libico-berberi, I, Napoli, 13-25.  2013. La réorganisation de l’ergativité proto-berbère : de l’état à l’état/procès, in Sounds and Words through the Ages: Afroasiatic Studies from Turin, ed. by Mengozzi, A et Tausco, M., Alessandria, Edizioni dell’Orsa, 177-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Blench]] (2018)&lt;ref name="Blench2018"&gt;Blench, Roger. 2018. [https://www.academia.edu/36664366/Reconciling_archaeological_and_linguistic_evidence_for_Berber_prehistory Reconciling archaeological and linguistic evidence for Berber prehistory].&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Proto-Berber speakers experienced intense language leveling about 2,000 years ago as the [[Roman Empire]] was expanding in North Africa. Hence, although Berber had split off from Afroasiatic several thousand years ago, Proto-Berber itself can only be reconstructed to a period as late as 200 A.D. Blench (2018) notes that Berber is considerably different from other Afroasiatic branches, but modern-day Berber languages displays low internal diversity. The presence of [[Punic language|Punic]] borrowings in Proto-Berber points to the diversification of modern Berber language varieties subsequent to the fall of [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] in 146 B.C.; only [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] lacks Punic loanwords.&lt;ref name="Blench2018"/&gt; Additionally, [[Latin language|Latin]] loanwords in Proto-Berber point to the breakup of Proto-Berber between 0-200 A.D. During this time period, Roman innovations including the ox-plough, camel, and orchard management were adopted by Berber communities along the ''[[limes]]'', or borders of the Roman Empire. This resulted in a new trading culture involving the use of a [[lingua franca]] which became Proto-Berber.&lt;ref name="Blench2018"/&gt;

==Reconstructions==
Reconstructions of the ancient stages of this language are based on comparisons with other Afro-Asiatic languages in various stages and on the comparisons between the varieties of modern Berber languages&lt;ref&gt;Galand, L. 1988, "Le berbère" in Les langues dans le monde ancien et moderne, III, les langues chamito-sémitiques, ed. by Jean Pierrot &amp; David Cohen, Paris, éditions CNRS, 207-242.&lt;/ref&gt; or with Touareg, considered by some authors like Prasse&lt;ref&gt;Prasse, Karl-G. 1973-74. Manuel de grammaire touarègue (tahaggart). Copenhague: Akademisk forlag&lt;/ref&gt; to be the variety that best preserved proto-Berber. Some authors{{who|date=July 2018}} have criticised the reconstructed Proto-Berber phonological systems as being too close to those of modern Berber varieties because the common elements derived from the comparisons project modern phonology onto the Proto-Berber stage.

==Phonology==
Some earlier attempts to derive the phonemic inventory of Proto-Berber were heavily influenced by Tuareg because of its perception of being particularly archaic.&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1999"&gt;Kossmann, M.G. (1999): [http://www.koeppe.de/titel_details.php?id=239 "Essai sur la phonologie du proto-berbère", Rüdiger Köppe Verlag] {{ISBN|978-3-89645-035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Karl G. Prasse and Maarten Kossmann reconstruct three short vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ and four long vowels /aa/, /ii/, /uu/ and /ee/.&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prasse 1990"&gt;K.-G. Prasse (1990), New Light on the Origin of the Tuareg Vowels E and O, in: H. G. Mukarovsky (ed), Proceedings of the Fifth International Hamito-Semitic Congress, Vienna, I 163-170. In earlier publications, Prasse had argued that /e/ and /o/ did not go back to Proto-Berber.&lt;/ref&gt; Their main reflexes in modern Berber languages are shown in the following table:

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|+ Reflexes of PB vowels in modern Berber languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kossmann|2001a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
! *PB !! [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] !! [[Tuareg language|Tuareg]] /&lt;br /&gt;[[Ghadamès language|Ghadames]] !! [[Figuig]] &lt;br/&gt;and others
|-

|-
! *ii

|-
! *ee

|-
! *uu

| u
|}

Tuareg and Ghadames also have /o/, which seems to have evolved from /u/ by vowel harmony in Tuareg&lt;ref name="Prasse 1990"/&gt; and from *aʔ in Ghadames.&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Kossmann|2001b"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kossmann|2001b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The influence of the Semitic vocalic system (three short vowels /i/, /u/, /a/ and three corresponding long vowels (/i:/, /u:/, /a:/) is evident in the proposed reconstruction model.

Allati has reconstructed a Proto-Berber vocalic system made of six vowels: i, u, e,  o, a&lt;ref&gt;Allati, 2002, 2011, Histoire du berbère, I. Phonologie, Tanger, PUAEFL.&lt;/ref&gt;                                                            
Without the long vowels that are not Proto-Afroasiatic (cf. Diakonoff, 1965 : 31, 40 ; Bomhard et Kerns, 1994 : 107, among others) and that evolved in some modern Berber varieties (Toureg, Ghadames, ...), the system is preserved in the southeastern Berber varieties including [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]]. It is equally close to the proposed Proto-Afroasiatic vocalic system (Diakonoff, 1965, 1988).

[[Alexander Militarev]] reconstructs the vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ in his proto-forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\semham\brbet&amp;first=1 Berber etymology]&lt;/ref&gt;

As in modern Berber languages,&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1997"&gt;[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/4150/1267577_033.pdf?sequence=1 Kossmann, M.G.; Stroomer, H.J.: "Berber Phonology", in ''Phonologies of Asia and Africa'', 461 - 475 (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; most Proto-Berber consonants had a [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] [[tenseness|tense]] counterpart, with some exceptions such as w~gːʷ, ɣ~qː.&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1999"/&gt;

The consonants *ɟ and *g have remained distinct in some [[Zenati languages]]:&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1999"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
! PB !! Tam. !! [[Ghadamès language|Ghad.]] !! [[Riff languages|Riff]] !! Chen.
|-
| *ɟ || g || ɟ || ʒ || ʒ
|-
| *g || g || ɟ || y || g
|}

Similarly, Proto-Berber *c, corresponding to ''k'' in non-Zenati varieties, became ''š'' in Zenati (but a number of irregular correspondences for this are found).&lt;ref name="Kossmann 1999"/&gt; For example, ''căm'' "you (f. sg.)" becomes ''šəm''. (The change also occurs in [[Nafusi language|Nafusi]] and [[Siwi language|Siwi]].)

[[Eastern Berber languages]]:
*{{IPA|dˤ}} → {{IPA|tˤ}}

Proto-Berber *''-əβ'' has become ''-i'' in Zenati.&lt;ref&gt;See also Maarten Kossmann, "[https://www.openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/4153/1/1267577_036.pdf Les verbes à i finale en zénète] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718173608/https://www.openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/4153/1/1267577_036.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}", Etudes et Documents Berbères 13, 1995, pp. 99-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, *''arəβ'' "write" becomes ''ari''.  (This change also occurs in varieties including the [[Central Atlas Tamazight]] dialect of the [[Zayanes|Izayan]], Nafusi, and Siwi.)

[[Ghadamès language|Ghadamès]] and [[Awjila language|Awjila]] are the only Berber languages to preserve Proto-Berber *β as β;&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann 1999:61.&lt;/ref&gt; elsewhere in Berber it becomes ''h'' or disappears.

The Proto-Berber consonantal system reconstructed by Allati (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011) is based on remains from the ancient stages of this language preserved in the ancient toponymical stratas, in Libyan inscriptions and in the modern Berber varieties. It had stops b, t, d, k, g; fricative s; nasal n and liquids l, r. The stops of the phonological system have evolved since the proto-Berber stage into variants from which other consonants have been progressively formed (Allati, 2002, 2011).

==Grammar==
Karl G. Prasse has produced a comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Berber morphology based on Tuareg.&lt;ref name="Prasse"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Prasse|1972-1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional work on the reconstruction of Proto-Berber morphology was done by Maarten Kossmann.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://hum.leiden.edu/lucl/organisation/members-f-l/kossmannmg.html#publications Publications of Maarten Kossmann]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Berber had no [[grammatical case]]. Its descendants developed a marked nominative that is still present in [[Northern Berber languages|Northern Berber]] and [[Tuareg languages|Southern Berber]]/Tuareg. In some cases, Proto-Berber lost it thereafter, recently in [[Eastern Berber languages|Eastern Berber]] and [[Western Berber languages|Western Berber]] ([[Zenaga language|Zenaga]]).&lt;ref&gt;König 2008, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relics of the ancient morphological segments preserved in the modern varieties, in the Libyan inscriptions and in the ancient toponymical stratas show that the basis of word formation is a monosyllabic lexical unit (vc, cvc) whose vowels and consonants are part of the root.&lt;ref&gt;Allati,A. 2002,  2011b. “Sur les reconstructions berbères et afro-asiatiques”, in Parcours berbères, Mélanges offerts à P. Galand et L. Galand, ed. by Amina Mettouchi, Köln, Köppe, 65-74.  2011c. “De l’ergativité dans le berbère moderne”, in Studi Africanistici, Quaderna di Studi berberi e Libico-berberi, I, Napoli, 13-25.                   2012. “From proto-Berber to proto-Afroasiatic,” in Burning Issues in Afro-Asiatic Linguistics, ed. by Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 62-74.  2013. La réorganisation de l’ergativité proto-berbère : de l’état à l’état / procès, in Sounds and Words through the Ages : Afroasiatic Studies from Turin, ed. by Mengozzi, A et Tausco, M.,  Alessandria, Edizioni dell’Orsa, 177-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its forms and its characteristics are similar to those of the base of word formation postulated for proto-Afroasiatic.&lt;ref&gt;Diakonoff, I. M. 1988. Afrasian languages. Moscou: Nauka, 42-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The composition and the reduplication/doubling process whose traces are preserved in all the Afroasiatic branches, including Semitic where they are fossilized  in the quadrilaterals and quintiliterals, constitute the type of word formation at that stage of Berber.&lt;ref&gt;Allati, 2008. “Proto-berbère et proto-afro-asiatique : l’aspect”, in: Semito-Hamitic (Afroasiatic) Festschrift for A.B. Dolgopolsky and H. Jungraithmayr, ed. by Gábor Takács, Berlin, Dietrich Reimer, 19-26. 2009. “Sur le classement du lexique berbère”, in Etudes berbères IV, Essais lexicologiques et lexicographiques et autres articles. ed. by Rainer Vossen, Dymitr Ibriszimow, and Harry Stroomer, 9-24. Köln : Köppe, 9-24. 2015. La dérivation dans la morphologie berbère, forthcoming in Mélanges offerts à M. Peyron.&lt;/ref&gt;

These remains also show that [[agglutination]] is the Proto-Berber mode of the grammatical adjunction of morphemes whose placement was not fixed in relation to the elements that they determine (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011b/c, 2012, 2013, 2014). The relations between the predicate of existence, the core of the utterance in the proto-Berber stage, and its determinants&lt;ref&gt;Including its privileged determinant which is a patient not an agent.&lt;/ref&gt; ordered around it without a pre-established order, are indicated with affixes (cf. idem).

The Proto-Berber relics preserved at the lexico-semantic and syntactic levels show that the proto-Berber syntactic construction is of the ergative type (cf. idem). The proto-Berber statement core is a predicate of existence, a lexical base&lt;ref&gt;That has the role of the verb and the noun in systems where the noun-verb contrast exists.&lt;/ref&gt; which posits the existence of a fact, of a situation…i.e. it expresses a state, a quality (cf. Allati, 2002, 2011b/c, 2013 below) having the value of a stative (cf. idem et Allati, 2008). It is not oriented in relation to its determinants (agentive subject, object…) whose syntactic functions are insured by casual elements including the casual affix (ergative) that indicates, as needed, the agent or the subject. Similar elements attested in Cushitic, Chadic and Omotic, and remains preserved in Semitic drove Diakonoff to postulate the same type of syntactic construction for proto-Semitic et proto-Afroasiatic (cf. Diakonoff, 1988, 101 ; cf. equally Allati, 2008, 2011a, 2012).
	Many elements equally show that proto-Berber did not have the noun-verb contrast, the rection contrasts, diathesis and person (cf. idem).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14520">'''Religious education''' is the term given to  [[education]] concerned with [[religion]]. It may refer to education provided by a [[Church body|church]] or religious organization, for instruction in [[doctrine]] and [[faith]], or for  education in various aspects of religion, but without explicitly religious or [[moral]] aims, e.g. in a [[school]] or [[college]]. The term is often known as [[religious studies]].

==England==
Religious Education (RE) is a compulsory subject in the [[public education|state education]] system in [[England]].  Schools are required to teach a programme of religious studies according to local and national guidelines.

Religious Education in [[England]] is mandated by the [[Education Act 1944]] as amended by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] and the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]]. The provision of Religious Education is compulsory in all state-funded schools, but it is not compulsory for any of the children to take the subject. The subject consists of the study of different religions, religious leaders, and other religious and moral themes. However, the curriculum is required to reflect the predominant place of Christianity in religious life and hence Christianity forms the majority of the content of the subject. All parents have the right to withdraw a child from religious education, which schools must approve.&lt;ref name="withdraw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|title=Religious Education&amp;nbsp;— collective worship and the right to withdraw|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630193803/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/r/recollectiveworshipandtherighttowithdraw/|archivedate=2008-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, all schools are required by law to provide a daily act of [[Collective Worship (schools in England and Wales)|collective worship]], of which at least 51% must be Christian in basis over the course of the academic year.&lt;ref name="collwors"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|title=Collective worship|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families|year=2005|author=Department for Children, Schools and Families|work=Teachernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112044304/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/c/collectiveworship/|archivedate=2008-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Smalley, the chair of the Association of Religious Education inspectors, advisors and consultants, stated that some "schools did have problems fulfilling the requirement for worship" due to what they thought was "a lack of space to gather the entire school for worship" although Smalley noted that "there is actually no requirement for such a gathering, as smaller groups are allowed."&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4693129.stm|title=School worship: from sports to death|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=BBC|author=Lucy Wilkins|work=BBC News website | date=2005-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Union of Teachers]] suggested in 2008 that parents should have a right to have specific schooling in their own faith and that imams, rabbis and priests should be invited to offer religious instruction to pupils in all state schools.&lt;ref name="nutbbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7311178.stm|title=Call to offer faith class choice|accessdate=2008-03-27|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|author=Hannah Goff|work=BBC News website | date=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[England]] has a Local Agreed [[Syllabus]] which mandate subject teaching for each [[Key Stage]] and possibly for each school year. The [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] has also produced the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education, which provides guidelines for the provision of RE at all key stages, and models the eight-levels as applied in National Curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name="nc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page/@id=6004&amp;Subject/@id=7881|title=Religious Education: non-statutory framework|accessdate=2008-02-07|publisher=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|year=2004|author=Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|work=National Curriculum Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211211245/http://www.nc.uk.net/webdav/harmonise?Page%2F%40id=6004&amp;Subject%2F%40id=7881|archivedate=2007-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In France, RE is replaced by a non-religious moral teaching (called civic, legal and social education : ''éducation civique, juridique et sociale'', ECJS). Children can additionally receive, on a voluntary basis, a religious education, either at school in private religious school, or outside of school, in their religious community, if they are in a public (State) school. Although in some rare regions, namely Alsace-Moselle, the old Concordat of 1801 being still valid because of the German occupation at the time of the separation of Church and State in France and the strong stand of population in favour of this, religious education is compulsory, and a dispense is necessary if the child refuses to be following (Catholic or Protestant) religious education.

==Ireland==
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] religion is taught in a subject called Religious Education which is compulsory in many schools for the Junior Certificate, but available as an option for the Leaving Certificate{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. The course educates students about communities of faith, the foundations of the major world religions, the sacred texts, religious practices and festivals for Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Students also learn about religious change in Ireland, meaning in life, religious and non-religious responses to the search for meaning, atheism, agnosticism and other forms of belief. Students are also educated about morality in a number of different faiths and their moral codes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Israel==
Israeli school system includes State Schools; Religious State Schools; Recognized Schools and Exempt Schools, whose students are regarded as fulfilling the obligatory education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/taulwps/fp/art44 A. Maoz, "Religious Education in Israel", 83  U. Det. Mercy L. Rev (2006) p.&amp;nbsp;679-728.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The prevailing view is that the religious education would contravene the constitutional [[Secularism|separation of state and religion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In place of RE, there is a short but nonetheless compulsory subject called {{nihongo|"Ethics"|{{ruby-ja|道徳|どうとく}}|doutoku|''lit.'' "morality"}} in [[primary school]], where the purpose is to teach [[moral values]] rather than to teach ethics as an academic subject. However, despite the stated [[secular]] stance, references to the majority religions of Shinto and Buddhism are sometimes made in class texts.

==Lebanon==
Being a secular country, with no state religion, Lebanon is expected to have a neutral position regarding religious education in its schools, which is not the case in the country, as well as many European and American countries. Lebanon doesn't have a law concerning RE in its educational establishments. Schools have the right to either give RE classes, or do the opposite. Religious classes are not obligatory, nor banned, and they are not replaced by "ethics" classes.
Private Schools (Christian and Muslim) give mandatory religious classes, reflecting their religious identification. Students from other religions don't take any classes during the religious ones, but they always can sign up for the RE class. Catholic schools give only Catholic classes, mandatory for Christian students, but can be signed up for by Muslim students, if not, Muslims do not take any classes in parallel to Christian ones. Public schools kind of have a more liberal religious program. A Lebanese public school may give, or not give RE classes, which regard the predominant religion of the population in the area the school is located in. Students have to take these classes, whether they are Christian or Muslim. A public school located in a mixed area would prefer not to give RE classes, unless voted oppositely by locals, RE classes may be both Christian and Muslim at the same time in this case, and students divide when this happens.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Malaysia==
The Malaysian education system makes ''Moral Studies'' compulsory for non-Muslim students at secondary and primary schools. Muslim students instead partake in ''Islamic Studies'' lessons. Both subjects figure among the seven compulsory subjects undertaken by students for the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]]. There has been considerable debate about the usefulness of the "Moral" subject, primarily due to the strict exam-oriented marking-schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019192539/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2377731/Article/index_html |archivedate=2008-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2007}} Article 2 of the [[Constitution of Norway]] mandates Evangelical-Lutheran parents to provide a religious upbringing for their children.&lt;ref&gt;

==Scotland ==
{{Main|Education in Scotland}}
In [[Scotland|Scottish]] state schools, Religious Education is called ''Religious and Moral Education'' from ages 5 to 14, and ''Religious, Moral and Philosophical Studies'' from 14 to 18.

The majority of [[state school]]s in are [[Secular Education|non-denominational]], but as a result of the [[Education Act 1918]], separate denominational [[state school]]s were also established. The vast majority of denominational state schools are [[Roman Catholic]] but there are also a number of [[Scottish Episcopal]] schools. The school buildings are built and maintained by the Roman Catholic Church were handed over to the state under the Education Act. Since then,the Catholic schools are fully funded by the [[Scottish Government]] and administered by the [[Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate]]. As part of the deal, there are specific legal provisions to ensure the promotion of a Catholic ethos in such schools: applicants for positions in the areas of Religious Education, Guidance or Senior Management must be approved by the [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland]], which also appoints a [[chaplain]] to each of its schools. There is also one Jewish state primary school.

==South Africa==
The [[South Africa]]n National Policy on Religion and Education adopted in September 2003 provides for Religion Education, i.e. education about diverse religions, which does not promote any particular religion in the [[State school|public school]] curriculum. The policy does not apply to [[private school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Policy on Religion and Education|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|publisher=info.gov.za|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131232848/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=70211|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeenah|first=Na'eem|editor1-first=Brian|editor1-last=Ramadiro|editor2-first=Salim|editor2-last=Vally|title=Education Rights for Learners, Parents and Educators Book 5: Religion and Schools|url=http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|publisher=Education Rights Project|accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030181341/http://www.erp.org.za/pdf/religion%20booklet_WEB.pdf|archivedate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle East ==
The majority of middle eastern countries provide compulsory religious studies in both private and public schools. The religious studies in private schools can be based on the religious beliefs of the student and can be complied with by the school.

'''''Revelation''''' is a 2001 British film directed by [[Stuart Urban]] and starring [[James D'Arcy]], [[Natasha Wightman]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Terence Stamp]]. ''Revelation'' tells the story of the final search for an ancient relic known as the Loculus, dating back to 50 AD, and the effect of this relic on the Martel family and the whole world.

==Plot==
In two flashbacks a relic is created in 50 AD and then hidden by Jews from a Crusader mob in medieval [[Rennes-le-Château]]. In present-day Rennes-le-Château an academic under instructions from Magnus Martel is seen with the relic—the Loculus—researching on the ground to find the right place to hide it. Magnus's son Jake, an ace cryptographer, is released from [[Wormwood Scrubs]] and recruited by his father for research on the Loculus. Magnus reveals that the Loculus relates to the [[Knights Templar]] and its sinister successor organisation known as "the order", and in secret receives calls from this organisation threatening him if he does not accelerate his research—in spite of this, Magnus realises the Loculus' massive power for good or evil and has hidden it to ensure it does not fall into the order's hands. After breaking a code on the Loculus to reveal the word "palingenesis", Jake hides whilst members of the organisation kill and [[flaying|flay]] his father. Jake then flees with another researcher on the project (the occultist Mira) and seeks help from the Roman Catholic priest Father Ray Connolly. 

The trail takes the three characters to (among others) a Cambridge library to research Isaac Newton's involvement in attempting to unlock the Loculus and to Rennes-le-Château and its Tour Magdala. They discover that the Loculus is related to Christian [[eschatology]] and has been hidden on [[Patmos]], writing-place of the ''[[Book of Revelation]]''. Father Connolly stays behind in London as back-up while Mira and Jake go to Patmos and find the Loculus hidden in a crypt beneath a [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and former temple to [[Mary Magdalene]] as [[Aphrodite]]. Using the reflective properties of a [[hermaphrodite]] symbol on the Loculus they reveal a [[hexagram]] built into the floor, an occult symbol. Jake and Mira disrobe and [[sexual intercourse|make love]] within the symbol in an attempt to unlock it, experiencing a vision of themselves as Christ and Mary Magdalene before fleeing into the crypt when they hear a pursuer approaching. 

The pursuer turns out to in fact be Father Connolly and together they finally work out the Loculus's meaning—its significance in fact lies in the four nails holding it together, which are those used to [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucify]] [[historical Jesus|Christ]] and retain organic matter with his DNA, preserved in a ceremony on [[Mount Hebron]]. The Templars and the order have continually attempted to use the DNA on it to resurrect Christ (including one failed attempt by Newton), but have failed until the genetic advances of the present day. The three argue as to what to do with the discovery—Jake concurs with his dead father and wishes to destroy it to keep it out of the order's hands, whilst Ray wishes to take it to a trustworthy African cardinal at the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]]. Ray prevails and traps the other two, but on arrival in Rome the order's Grand Master seizes the Loculus, puts Ray under torture and sends troops to kill Mira and Jake. The couple manage to flood the chambers with sand to kill the troops and the church's monks are alerted to the couple's plight by an emergency postcard sent by Connolly before his departure, but only Mira manages to escape—Jake is fatally buried. In the meantime the Grand Master has cloned Christ and had him not only proclaimed the Messiah by the Vatican but put under his own tutelage and control, so that he can brutalize him and rule the world through him. The film closes with Mira realising that she (Magdalene's descendant) has given birth to a child by a Martel (Christ's descendant via the [[Merovingian dynasty]]) and that she must keep him secret from the order (as predicted by [[s:Bible (King James)/Revelation#Chapter 12|''Revelation'' 12.4]]) so as to oppose the Grand Master's puppet Christ.

==Reception==
Overall reception was hostile. ''[[The Guardian]]'', for example, noted the film's "rag-bag of extraordinary cameos" but criticised the "vulgar heresies" on which it was based and likened the "significant, ritual sex with a beautiful alchemist" with the "clean-limbed young hero" to an Occult-based sketch in ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures2|title=Wipe that smile off your face|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw|date=12 April 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote of the film as "ludicrous", a "farrago", "straight-faced" and "the fag end of a millennial cycle of apocalyptic pictures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/apr/14/features.review27|title=She's going for the funny bone (not the metatarsal)|first=Philip|last=French|date=14 April 2002|work=[[The Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ring of Gyges''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|ˌ|dʒ|iː|z}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Γύγου Δακτύλιος}}) is a [[mythology|mythical]] [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] artifact mentioned by the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] in Book 2 of his ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'' (2:359a–2:360d).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/631825| jstor = 631825| title = Ringing the Changes on Gyges: Philosophy and the Formation of Fiction in Plato's Republic| journal = [[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]| volume = 121| pages = 12–29| year = 2001| last1 = Laird | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grants its owner the power to become [[invisibility|invisible]] at will. Through the story of the ring, ''Republic'' considers whether an intelligent person would be moral if they did not have to fear being caught and punished for doing injustices.

==The legends==
[[Gyges of Lydia]] was a historical king, the founder of the [[Mermnad dynasty]] of [[Lydia]]n kings. Various ancient works—the most well-known being ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 1.7–13&lt;/ref&gt;—gave different accounts of the circumstances of his rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Kirby Flower | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1902 | title = The Tale of Gyges and the King of Lydia | journal = [[American Journal of Philology]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–387 | publisher =  | jstor = 288700 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All, however, agree in asserting that he was originally a subordinate of King [[Candaules]] of [[Lydia]], that he killed Candaules and seized the throne, and that he had either seduced Candaules' Queen before killing him, married her afterwards, or both.

In [[Glaucon]]'s recounting of the myth, an unnamed ancestor of Gyges&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeplato|Republic|359d|gr}}: "τῷ [Γύγου] τοῦ Λυδοῦ προγόνῳ". In ''Republic'', Book 10 ({{Citeplato|Republic|612b}}), Socrates refers to the ring as "the ring of Gyges" ({{lang|grc|τὸν Γύγου [[wikt:δακτύλιος|δακτύλιον]]}}). For this reason, the story is simply called "The Ring of Gyges".&lt;/ref&gt; was a shepherd in the service of the ruler of Lydia. After an earthquake, a cave was revealed in a mountainside where he was feeding his flock. Entering the cave, he discovered that it was in fact a tomb with a bronze horse containing a [[cadaver|corpse]], larger than that of a man, who wore a [[gold]]en [[finger ring|ring]], which he pocketed. He discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible by adjusting it. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks. Arriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen, and with her help he murdered the king, and became king of Lydia himself.

==The role of the legend in ''Republic''==
In ''Republic'', the tale of the ring of Gyges is described by the character of Glaucon who is the brother of Plato. Glaucon asks whether any man can be so [[virtue|virtuous]] that he could resist the temptation of being able to perform any act without being known or discovered. Glaucon suggests that [[morality]] is only a [[social construction]], the source of which is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and justice. Hence, if that sanction were removed, one's moral character would evaporate.

Glaucon posits:

{{quote|Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men.

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.

For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
|Plato|''Republic'', 360b–d ([[Benjamin Jowett|Jowett]] trans.)}}

Though his answer to Glaucon's challenge is delayed, Socrates ultimately argues that justice does not derive from this social construct: the man who abused the power of the Ring of Gyges has in fact enslaved himself to his appetites, while the man who chose not to use it remains rationally in control of himself and is therefore happy. (Republic 10:612b)

After the [[Second World War]] in 1945, issues surrounding wartime loss and compensation started to arise. Cultural valuables were taken from [[Germany]] and placed in the [[Soviet Union]]. Years later, at the break up of the [[USSR]], the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the [[Russian Duma]] and the [[Yeltsin]] government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the '''Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation'''.

==Background==
At the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the [[Soviet Union]] suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from [[Germany]]. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during [[World War II]], nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The [[USSR]] suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the [[Russian Federation]] began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monten|first=Lina|title=Soviet World War II Trophy Art In Present Day Russia: The Events, The Law, and The Current Controversies|journal=Depual J. Art. &amp; Ent. Law|year=2004–2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Yeltsin in Favour of Restitution 1992===
In June 1992, a Decree of the [[Russian Government]] created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], Germany, [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Poland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] for mutual [[restitution]] of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the [[Constitutional Court]] ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in June 1992 there was the only [[restitution]] of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the [[Netherlands]]. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma halts restitution 1994===
Starting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. [[Duma]] deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of [[international laws]] and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. 
Demands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to [[Moscow]] under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the [[Yeltsin]] government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions.

===Duma Proposes Law 1995 and 1996===
For six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in [[New York City]] titled "Spoils of War", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the [[United States]] had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention "forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such international law did not stop [[Stalin]] from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. 
Despite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other [[Europe]]an countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin's Position, July 1996===
It was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the [[Council of the Federation]], rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. [[Boris Yeltsin]], president of the [[Russian Federation]] at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma Passes Law, March 1997===
Nevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, [[Nikolai Gubenko]], continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin Vetoes the Law, March 1997===
Sticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin [[vetoed]] the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Court ruling==
Notwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the [[Constitutional Court]] in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
The Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are "to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Documentation Project|url=http://docproj.loyola.edu/rlaw/r2.html|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but been criticized on an international level. A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] specialist, who argues that [[Ukraine]] and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law "would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Recently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]. During a visit in [[St-Petersburg]], Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum]] that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merkel and Putin view exhibition of disputed art|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23001274|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rybon Art Center''' is an international, independent and artist-led institute based in [[Tehran]]. It was established in 2008 in order to encourage artistic innovations and experimentations among local artists and also explore possible exchange of ideas and knowledge in the field of [[contemporary]] critical art of [[Iran]] beyond ethnic and regional boundaries. During these years Rybon has initiated and conducted numerous projects including [[Artist residency|art residencies]], local and international artist [[workshops]], art shares and artist talks, screenings, enhancing local art networks and facilitating international art exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybonartcenter.com|title=Rybon Art Center Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.art21.org/newyorkcloseup/2015/07/11/if-you-happen-to-be-in-tehran|title=Screening of "New York Close Up" in  Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art|website=ART21 New York Close Up|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honaronline.ir/pages/news-59161.aspx|title=هفته فیلم ˝نیویورک نمای نزدیک˝ در موزه هنرهای معاصر|website=www.honaronline.ir|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybondoc.com/global/index/section/guest/module/news/lang/fa/catid/0/id/2268/page/19|title="From Experimental Film to Video Art" Workshop|last=|first=|website=www.rybondoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the history of art residency in the world, in early years of Rybon’s activity this form of art exchange did not have a serious professional background in Iran. Therefore, Rybon from the very beginning concentrated on different forms of art residency which facilitated dialogue and exchange of ideas among artists in Iran.

Rybon started its first residency projects in collaboration with local artistic and cultural institutes, inviting established artists from neighboring countries. Holding Rybon International Artists’ Workshop based on [[Triangle Arts Trust|Triangle]] workshops in 2012 in collaboration with Mohsen Gallery and Darbast Platform in Tehran was another step toward establishing residency culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasworks.org.uk/triangle-network/partners/rybon|title=Triangle Network {{!}} Gasworks|website=www.gasworks.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/rybon_workshop|title=a Review about 1st Rybon International Artists Workshop at Nafas Art Magazine|last=|first=|website=universes-in-universe.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.frieze.com/postcard-from-tehran|title="Postcard from Tehran" an Article by Daria Kirsanova at frieze blog|last=|first=|website=blog.frieze.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impediments for holding international residencies lead to devising a new form of residency, namely exchange programs, by Rybon. The first of these exchange programs was held in 2013 in collaboration with Organhaus Art Space of [[China]] and Mohsen Gallery in Tehran and [[Chongqing]], China. At the present the “Exchange Program” is being successfully practiced as a pivotal part of [[Kooshk Residency]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.organhaus.com/20141.html|title=Exchange Program (Iran-China) {{!}} Organhaus Art Space|website=器 .

Rybon organised the Second Rybon International Artists's Workshop in 2016 based on Triangle workshops in collaboration with Kooshk Residency, deegar platform and Gasworks. This program aimed to gather artists from all around the world to discuss and look for the possibilities to exchange ideas and knowledge beyond the ethnic, regional and artistic boundaries. Five Asian, European and African artists as well as five Iranian artists participated in this program. The program started on November 10 and lasted until November 25th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://engarmag.com/8468/|title=رای‌بُن، جشن بیکران|date=2016-12-13|newspaper=انگار|language=fa-IR|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabculturefund.org/bulletin/article.php?genre=2&amp;id=834#.WE-AqrV4GEc|title=AFAC :: BULLETIN|website=www.arabculturefund.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gasworks.org.uk/triangle-network/blog/|title=Triangle Network Blog {{!}} Gasworks|website=www.gasworks.org.uk|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rybonartcenter.com/sn/workshop/pt/full/catId/2/id/18|title=Rybon Art Center {{!}} مرکز هنری رای ُبن {{!}} Workshop {{!}} International {{!}} Second Rybon International Artists' Workshop|last=http://www.persiantools.com|first=PersianTools. {{!}}|website=www.rybonartcenter.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kooshkresidency.com/program/second-rybon-international-artists-workshop/|title=The Second Rybon International Artists' Workshop - Kooshk Residency|newspaper=Kooshk Residency|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology dynamics''' is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar [[science and technology studies]] field. It studies the process of [[technological change]]. Under the field of Technology Dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from "internal factors" as well as from "external factors". Internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various (changing) characteristics of the [[social environment]], in which a particular [[technology]] is embedded.

==Overview==

For the last three decades, it has been argued that [[technology development]] is neither an autonomous process, determined by the "inherent progress" of human history, nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate (develop) a technology, as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking. In mainstream neoclassical economic thinking, technology is seen as an exogenous factor: at the moment a technology is required, the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor, capital and eventually raw materials.

Conversely, modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not "self-evident" or market-demanded, but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social, economic and political factors. in this sense, technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct "internal" and "external" points of views by presenting co-evolutionary approach regarding technology development.

In general, technology dynamics studies, besides giving a "thick description" of technology development, uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context. Accordingly, Technology Dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining [[social control]] of technology, and also provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies. In that respect, it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies, besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations.

An important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi-evolutionary character of technological change: change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge, systems and [[institutions]] develop in interaction with each other. Processes of 'path dependence' are crucial in explaining technological change.

Following these lines, there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics.

==Different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology==
*[[Social construction of technology]]
*[[Actor–network theory]]
*[[Systems theory]]
*[[Normalization process theory]]
*Quasi-evolutionary theories
*[[Innovation system]]
*[[Technological innovation system]]

Based on the analysis of the various perspectives, one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology. Some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change:

*[[Technology assessment]]
*[[Backcasting]]
*Strategic niche management 
*[[Transition management (governance)]]

A '''term paper''' is a [[research]] paper written by [[student]]s over an [[academic term]], accounting for a large part of a grade. The online version of Merriam-Webster defined it as "a major writing assignment in a school or college course representative of a student's achievement during a term".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20paper|title=Definition of TERM PAPER|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Term papers are generally intended to describe an event, a concept, or argue a point. It is a written original work discussing a topic in detail, usually several typed pages in length, and is often due at the end of a semester.

There is much overlap between the terms: ''research paper'' and ''term paper''. A ''term paper'' was originally a written assignment (usually a research based paper) that was due at the end of the "term"—either a semester or quarter, depending on which unit of measure a school used. However, not all term papers involve academic research, and not all research papers are term papers.

==History==
Term papers date back to the beginning of the 19th century when print could be reproduced cheaply and written texts of all types (reports, memoranda, specifications, and scholarly articles) could be easily produced and disseminated. Moulton and Holmes (2003) write that during the years from 1870 to 1900 "American education was transformed as writing became a method of discourse and research the hallmark of learning."&lt;ref&gt;Moulton, Margaret R. and Holmes, Vicki L (2003) "The Research Paper:  A Historical Perspective," Teaching English in the Two Year College 30(4) p.366&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell (1991) writes that in the 1910s, "the research paper began to harden into its familiar form" adding that [[plagiarism]] and the sale of research papers both became a problem during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, David R. Writing in the Academic Disciplines, 1870–1990: A Curricular History. Southern Illinois University, 1991. p.87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism in the computer era==
{{See also|Essay mill}}
In the present day an entire industry has sprung up to provide plagiarized, pre-written or custom written term papers for students of varying levels of education. There are many websites that sell term papers of all levels of quality and writing proficiency, but submission of a purchased paper would be considered a serious breach the submitting student's [[academic integrity]] by any reputable academic institution.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6680457.stm|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; Google bans essay writing adverts|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[plagiarism]] can be unknowingly committed by students.&lt;ref name=facultyfocus&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Miki|title=Are You Committing Plagiarism? Top Five Overlooked Citations to Add to Your Course Materials|url=http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/instructional-design/are-you-committing-plagiarism-top-five-overlooked-citations-to-add-to-your-course-materials/|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=FacultyFocus.com|date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although plagiarism can be unknowingly committed there are quite a few steps that can be taken in order to avoid plagiarizing. When quoting another author's work, place quotation marks around the words or sentence that you take from that work, and use a footnote, end-note, or in-line [[citation]] to give credit to the original source. Merely changing a few words is not the same as true summarizing, and use of such a minorly-modified passage is still considered plagiarism unless a citation gives credit to the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967940184|title=Perspectives on contemporary issues : readings across the disciplines|last=Anne,|first=Ackley, Katherine|isbn=9781305969377|edition= Eighth |location=Boston|oclc=967940184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 15th century – A [[cupola]] or dome which did not require a framework supporting its curves was invented by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]].  To transport the large stones to the construction site, Brunelleschi invented a unique boat capable of moving heavy cargo upriver and was granted exclusive rights to use his boat to move heavy loads, patent rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Patenting Art and Entertainment by Gregory Aharonian and Richard Stim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 15th century – [[Linear perspective]] was invented with work by Filippo Brunelleschi, and a treatise on perspective theory by [[Leon Battista Alberti]].   Perspective is a method for depicting the illusion of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.&lt;ref&gt;ArtLex at www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Li.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1420 – The use of a single, consistent light source in painting with figures painted to appear three-dimensional was invented by the Italian artist [[Masaccio]] (Tommaso di Giovanni).  See his 1427 painting, "Tribute Money".

* 1861 – The color photograph was invented by physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].
* 1863 – Multiple subject painting was invented by [[Édouard Manet]].  His "[[Le dejeuner sur l'herbe]]" presents four disconnected figures not looking at one another, lighted from different directions.  Dejeuner sur l'herbe also has a disconnected background-to-foreground perspective that eliminates the middle ground.
* 1865 – [[Chromolithograph]] prints were invented by [[Jules Chéret]].

He painted the cathedral at Rouen at 40 different times of the day and he painted the same haystack at 20 different moments in a year.
* 1902- A technique of indeterminate time was invented in painting by Paul Cézanne in his painting "Mont Sainte-Victorie", in which the sources and direction of light are not discernible.
* 1902 – The [[teddy bear]] was invented by Morris and Rose Michtom based on a cartoon of a bear saved by President Theodore Roosevelt.

* 1904 – [[Fauvism]] was invented by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]] and others.
* 1907 – A variety of special effects for film were invented by [[Georges Méliès]] in his film ''[[Tunneling the English Channel]]'', including stop-motion photography, split-screen photography, [[stop action animation]] and the combination of live action with full-scale mechanical backgrounds.

* 1908 to 1917 – [[Cubism]] was invented by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]].  In Cubist artworks, the subject, whether it be a figure or a still life, is broken up and reassembled, and presented from multiple views simultaneously.  Cubism revolutionized western art, and influenced other art forms like music and literature.
* 1912 – [[Collage]] was invented by Picasso with his "Still Life with Chair Caning".  Attaching a material from the real world that was not ever used in high art into a painting violated what was previously considered the integrity of the artwork.  Collage was a new process for making art, a new art form, and it expanded the definition of art.
* 1912 – The [[Construction]] was invented by Picasso when he created "Guitar" in 1912 by joining parts together.  This additive image-making process was new to western sculpture which was previously made using subtractive processes like carving stone or wood, or modeling clay which may have then been cast in metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodbook.com/history/modernism/pablo-picasso.html |title=Pablo Picasso. Art, life, and world of modern |publisher=Moodbook.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refer to US Patent 2,201,689.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* 1947–50 – Painting was reinvented by [[Jackson Pollock]] whose novel method of spontaneously dripping and splattering paint from a can onto unscratched canvas laid out on the floor brought about an expanded understanding of pure abstraction and of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Jackson_Pollock.html |title=and also Michael Kimmelman www.NY Times.com "A Drip by Any Other Name", February 12, 2006 |publisher=Manythings.org |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1948 – The [[Glass House]] by the architect [[Philip Johnson]] reduced building down to its most basic elements: a horizontal slab on the ground, vertical supports, a flat roof and transparent glass wrapped around it.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt;
* 1952 – Stain painting, in which liquid paint soaks and bleeds into the fabric of unprimed canvas, was invented by [[Joan Miró]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]] and [[Jackson Pollock]] who influenced [[Helen Frankenthaler]], as seen in her painting "Mountains and Sea" of 1952.
* 1959 – the first public "[[happening]]" was produced by Allan Kaprow at the Reuben Gallery in New York.  A happening is defined by Kaprow as a choreographed event that facilitates interactions between objects including performers and visitors.

A [[locomotive]] or [[train]] can play many roles in art, for example:
* As a [[work of art]] in itself in addition to most functional considerations, especially in [[Streamliner|streamlined]] steam locomotives and luxury passenger accommodations of the early 20th century, known also as the [[Machine Age]]
* As a subject for a [[:Category:Rail transport in fiction|novel]] or [[:Category:Rail transport films|film]]
* As a [[metaphor]] in song or poetry, particularly for [[Power (physics)|physical power]] or directed movement (physical, ''romantic'' or other), as in ''[[Fisherman's Blues]]'':&lt;!--This should be short enough to qualify as fair use --&gt;

[[File:Church cabin in Utsjoki.JPG|thumb|300px|Wilderness hut in Utsjoki, Finland.]]

A '''wilderness hut''', '''backcountry hut''', or '''backcountry shelter''' is a rent-free, simple shelter or [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] for temporary accommodation, usually located in [[wilderness area]]s, [[national park]]s and along [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] and [[hiking]] routes.  They are found in many parts of the world, such as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and northern [[Russia]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]].  Huts range from being basic and unmanned, without running water, to furnished and permanently attended.  Remote huts sometimes contain emergency food supplies.

==Alps==
[[File:Birkkarhuetterl 20111016.jpg|thumb]]
Similar shelters can also be found in remote areas of the Alps (known in [[German language|German]] as ''Biwakschachtel''). In order to complete some tours, it is necessary to spend the night in such shelters. Even though ''Biwakschachteln'' are also tended to by the [[Alpine Club]]s, they differ markedly from the more accessible [[mountain hut]]s, which are actual houses suitable for permanent use. Unlike mountain huts, they do not have a permanent resident who tends to the building and sells food to mountaineers.

==Hut use==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Shed with green roof at Lyngen fjord, 2012 June.jpg|thumb|Wilderness hut at [[Lyngen]] fjord, Norway]]

In general, these huts do not have regular maintenance schedules nor paid maintenance staff. Unofficial rules for use have arisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoors.fi/tarvantovaara/instructionsandrules|title=tarvantovaara|publisher=www.outdoors.fi|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- yes it is encyclopedic --&gt; 
 
Visitors are expected to leave the hut as they would like to find it.  Fires should never be left unattended, and if the firewood supply is used up, the visitors should replace it.  Some areas are designated [[Portable stove|fuel stove]] only, because cooking on a fuel stove can reduce the use of firewood. Some huts contain emergency food stores like canned food and bottled water, meant to consumed in  urgent situations. Often no toilet facilities are present, and the general rule requires that toilet waste should be buried away from the nearest watercourse or the hut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoors.fi/pulju/instructionsandrules|title=instructions and rules|publisher=www.outdoors.fi|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Generally no running water is available in the huts.  It is often recommended when using water from a stream, that the water should be boiled for at least five minutes because of the potential danger of [[gastroenteritis]] and [[giardia]].{{Cn|date=January 2016}}
	
Detergents, toothpaste and soap (even biodegradable types) can harm aquatic life, and waterways are easily damaged.  When leaving the hut, visitors are generally expected to leave it clean and secure, with the fire out, and  the doors and windows securely closed. Escaping fires can severely damage the environment.  Rubbish should not be buried. Rubbish like cans, plastic bottles or broken glass are often dug out by native animals and may harm them. All waste should be disposed of by taking it away for proper disposal. Rules can differ between Europe, Australia and US.

==Wilderness huts by country==
[[File:Moscow villa02 oct 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Moscow Villa in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia.]]

===Finland===
[[File:Oahujoen autiotupa.jpg|thumb|The Oahujoki wilderness hut in [[Lemmenjoki National Park]], can accommodate seven people overnight.]]

Official wilderness huts are mostly maintained by [[Metsähallitus]] ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] for ''Administration of Forests''), the Finnish state-owned forest management company. Most of the wilderness huts in Finland are situated in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Their size can vary greatly: the Lahtinen cottage in the [[Muotkatunturi Wilderness Area]] can barely hold two people, whereas the Luirojärvi cottage in the [[Urho Kekkonen National Park]] can hold as many as 16.

A wilderness hut need not be reserved beforehand, and they are open for everyone tracking by foot, ski or similar means. Commercial stays overnight are prohibited in the wilderness huts owned by Metsähallitus.  Unofficial and unmaintained huts also exist.

For centuries the vast wildernesses of Finland and its resources were divided amongst the Finnish agricultural societies (such as families, villages, parishes, and provinces) for the purpose of collecting resources. Areas divided in this way were called ''erämaa'', literally "portion-land," (now literally the word for "wilderness" in modern Finnish). People from agricultural societies made trips to their ''erämaas'' in the summer, mainly to trap animals for [[fur]] but also to hunt game, fish, and collect taxes from the local hunter-fisher population.

Huts were built in the wilderness for use as base camps for hunters and fishermen. Also non-agricultural [[Sami people]] built huts to help them manage reindeer. The earliest huts were only allowed to be used by people from the communities that owned them. Outsiders were not allowed to use the resources of other communities' ''erämaas''.

Huts that were free for everyone were first seen in late 18th century Finland, when dwelling places were built along walking routes for passers-by. In the 19th century the authorities started building these huts. Later in the 20th century they started to be built for travellers.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Tramping in New Zealand}}

[[New Zealand]] has a network of approximately 950 backcountry huts.&lt;ref name=NZ-Huts&gt;{{cite web|title=Backcountry hut information: Places to stay|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-stay/backcountry-hut-information/|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The huts are officially maintained by the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] (DOC), although some of the huts have been adopted and maintained by local [[hiking]] and hunting clubs by arrangement.  There are also unofficial and privately owned huts in some places. They vary from small [[bivouac shelter]]s made of wood to large modern huts that can sleep up to 40 people, with separate cooking areas, utilities and gas.

Some huts were initially commissioned or built by clubs along commonly walked routes, both for safety reasons as appropriate, and sometimes for convenience.  The network of back-country huts in New Zealand was largely extended in the mid-20th-century, when many more were built to serve the deer cullers of the [[New Zealand Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Te Totara Hut: Te Urewera|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/east-coast/te-urewera/te-totara-hut/|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most larger and more modern huts, like some found on the [[New Zealand Great Walks|Great Walks]], have been purpose designed and built to serve [[Tramping|trampers]]. Many of New Zealand's back-country huts are remote and rarely visited, and it is common for recreational trampers to design trips with the idea of reaching and visiting specific huts. Some people actively keep count of which huts they have visited, a practice which is informally referred to as hut bagging.

[[File:Waiopehu Hut Pass.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand backcountry hut pass]]

Back-country huts in New Zealand were free to use until the early 1990s, when the New Zealand Department of Conservation began charging for their use. For most back-country huts, nightly hut tickets are purchased via an honesty system by people who use the huts, with an additional option of purchasing an annual pass for people who use huts frequently. Huts on frequently used and heavily marketed tracks, such as the [[New Zealand Great Walks]], usually operate on a booking system, and often have resident wardens checking the bookings of users who arrive to stay the night.&lt;ref name=NZ-Huts/&gt;

Since the inception of hut fees in New Zealand, there has been controversy amongst some hut users. Many users belong to clubs which helped to build and maintain the huts before the government department was created, and consequently inherited them. It is common to find people who refuse to pay for the use of huts in protest, arguing that the government is trying to charge them to use facilities that they themselves are entirely responsible for providing. DOC argues that all hut fees are used for the continued maintenance of huts, and for building new huts as appropriate. It has at times made efforts to demonstrate this by specifically allocating money from hut fees towards budgets for these purposes.

The majority of the huts were built in an era of lower levels of government regulation and the long term use of the huts was not considered.  As a result of the [[Cave Creek disaster]] in 1995, DOC tightened up on the standards for structures on public land.  Some of the huts were upgraded to meet build regulations whilst others were removed or had certain facilities (such as beds) removed to cause them to fall into less strict building categories. In 2008, because of the recognition of the unique situation and the remote locations, the government relaxed the building standards for the huts. They now no longer need to have emergency lighting, smoke alarms, wheelchair access, potable water supplies or artificial lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://feeds.beehive.govt.nz/release/building+rule+changes+reduce+red+tape+huts|title=Building rule changes reduce red tape for huts|date=2008-10-31|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the [[United States of America|United States]], backcountry huts may be provided by the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]], state or national parks such as the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/backcountry-camping.htm Great Smoky Mountains National Park - Backcountry Camping - Backpacking (U.S. National Park Service)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilderness huts are frequently located along hiking routes.

The Tenth Mountain Huts is a system of 29 backcountry huts in the Colorado Rocky Mountains honoring the men of [[10th Mountain Division]] of the [[US Army]], who trained during [[World War II]] at [[Camp Hale]] in central Colorado.  They provide a unique opportunity for backcountry skiing, [[mountain biking]], or hiking while staying in safe, comfortable shelter.

The '''À Gogo movement''' (also spelled àu gogo, a gogo, a go-go, or à go•go) started in postwar [[France]] and quickly spread throughout [[western Europe]], most notably in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Italy]]. The name derives from the French term à gogo (in abundance, galore). It is considered a continuation of [[café]] society, who were also wealthy [[socialite]]s and prominent members of the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. Participants were often referred to as ''the go crowd'', ''the in crowd'' and later as ''the jet set''. These are terms created and applied by the media to identify people of certain mindset and do not refer to any formal organization. To put the movement in context, it should be considered an aspect of social behavior existing under the overarching movement of post World War II modernism.

This article refers to the European à gogo movement, and should not be confused with the American gogo music that followed, borrowing certain elements from it years later.
