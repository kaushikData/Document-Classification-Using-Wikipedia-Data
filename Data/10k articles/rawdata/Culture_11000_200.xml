"'''A Madman's Diary'''" ({{zh|t=狂人日記|p=Kuángrén rìjì}}) is a short story published in 1918 by [[Lu Xun]], a Chinese writer. It was the first and most influential modern work written in [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] in the republican era, and would become a cornerstone piece of the [[New Culture Movement]]. It is placed first in ''[[Call to Arms (Lu Xun)|Call to Arms]]'', a collection of short stories by Lu Xun. The story was often referred to as "China's first modern short story".&lt;ref&gt;Yi-tsi Mei Fuerwerker, "Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, and Wang Meng," in: Ellen Widmer and David Der-wei Wang (editors). ''From May Fourth to June Fourth: Fiction and Film in Twentieth-Century China''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|0674325028}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=QaIliDxf0xUC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=%22A+Madman%27s+Diary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xn-lUKWjA4jb0QHL4ICQCQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Madman%27s%20Diary%22&amp;f=false 171] , p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was selected as one of the 100 best books in history by the [[Bokklubben World Library]].

The diary form was inspired by [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s short story "[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]", as was the idea of the madman who sees reality more clearly than those around him. The "madman" sees "[[cannibalism]]" both in his family and the village around him, and he then finds cannibalism in the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] classics which had long been credited with a humanistic concern for the mutual obligations of society, and thus for the superiority of Confucian civilization. The story was read as an ironic attack on traditional Chinese culture and a call for a New Culture.

==Synopsis==
The story presents itself as diary entries (in Vernacular Chinese) of a madman who, according to the foreword, written in [[Classical Chinese]],  has now been cured of his paranoia. After extensively studying the [[Four books]] and [[Five Classics|five classics]] of old [[Confucianism|Confucian]] culture, the diary writer, the supposed "madman", begins to see the words "Eat People!" ({{zh|t=吃人|p=chīrén|labels=no}}) written between the lines of the texts (in classical Chinese texts, commentary was placed between the lines of the text, rather than in notes at the bottom of a page). Seeing the people in his village as potential man-eaters, he is gripped by the fear that everyone, including his brother, his venerable doctor and his neighbors, who are crowding about watching him, are harboring cannibalistic thoughts on him. Despite the brother's apparently genuine concern, the narrator still regards him as a big threat, as big as any stranger. Towards the end the narrator turns his concern to the younger generation, especially his late sister (who died when she was five) as he is afraid they will be cannibalized.  By then he is convinced that his late sister had been eaten up by his brother, and that he himself might have unwittingly tasted her flesh.

The story ends with the famous line: "Save the children..."

The '''Kol language''', '''''Aka-Kol''''', is an extinct [[Great Andamanese languages|Great Andamanese]] language, of the Central group. It was spoken in the southeast section of [[Middle Andaman]].

==History==
The Kol were one of the [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Andaman Islands]], one of the ten or so [[Great Andamanese]] tribes identified by [[British Empire|British]] colonials in the 1860s.  Their language was closely related to the other [[Great Andamanese languages]]. They were extinct as a distinct people by 1921.&lt;ref name="vanDriem2001"/&gt;

==Grammar==
The Great Andamanese languages are [[agglutinative]] languages, with an extensive prefix and suffix system.&lt;ref name=Templ&gt;Temple, Richard C. (1902). ''A Grammar of the Andamanese Languages, being Chapter IV of Part I of the Census Report on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands''. Superintendent's Printing Press: Port Blair.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have a distinctive [[noun class]] system based largely on body parts, in which every [[noun]] and [[adjective]] may take a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] according to which body part it is associated with (on the basis of shape, or functional association). Thus, for instance, the *aka- at the beginning of the language names is a prefix for objects related to the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;  An adjectival example can be given by the various forms of ''yop'', "pliable, soft", in Aka-Bea:&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt; 
*A [[cushion]] or [[sponge]] is ''ot-yop'' "round-soft", from the prefix attached to words relating to the head or heart.
*A [[Walking stick|cane]] is ''ôto-yop'', "pliable", from a prefix for long things.
*A [[wikt:stick|stick]] or [[pencil]] is ''aka-yop'', "pointed", from the tongue prefix.
*A fallen [[tree]] is ''ar-yop'', "rotten", from the prefix for [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upright things.
Similarly, ''beri-nga'' "good" yields:
*''un-bēri-ŋa'' "clever" (hand-good).
*''ig-bēri-ŋa'' "sharp-sighted" (eye-good).
*''aka-bēri-ŋa'' "good at languages" (tongue-good.)
*''ot-bēri-ŋa'' "virtuous" (head/heart-good)

The prefixes are,

{| class=wikitable
! !!Bea !!Balawa? !!Bajigyâs? !!Juwoi !!Kol
|-
!head/heart
| ot- ||ôt- ||ote- ||ôto- ||ôto-
|-
!hand/foot 
|ong- ||ong- ||ong- ||ôn- ||ôn-
|-
!mouth/tongue 
|âkà- ||aka- ||o- ||ókô- ||o-
|-
!torso (shoulder to shins) 
|ab- ||ab- ||ab- ||a- ||o-
|-
!eye/face/arm/breast 
|i-, ig- ||id- ||ir- ||re- ||er-
|-
!back/leg/butt 
|ar- ||ar- ||ar- ||ra- ||a-
|-
!waist 
|ôto-
|}

Body parts are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], requiring a [[possessive adjective]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] to complete them, so one cannot say "head" alone, but only "my, or his, or your, etc. head".

The basic pronouns are almost identical throughout the Great Andamanese languages; Aka-Bea will serve as a representative example (pronouns given in their basic prefixal forms):
{| class=wikitable
| I, my
| ''d-''
| we, our
| ''m-''
|-
| thou, thy
| ''ŋ-''
| you, your
| ''ŋ-''
|-
| he, his, she, her, it, its
| ''a''
| they, their
| ''l-''
|}

'This' and 'that' are distinguished as ''k-'' and ''t-''. 

Judging from the available sources, the Andamanese languages have only two [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s &amp;mdash; [[1 (number)|one]] and [[2 (number)|two]] &amp;mdash; and their entire numerical lexicon is one, two, one more, some more, and all.&lt;ref name="Templ"/&gt;

'''The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety,''' also known as "the Alliance" or  '''AFBWS''', is a group of 28 major global retailers formed to develop and launch the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative, a binding, five-year undertaking with the intent of improving safety in Bangladeshi ready-made garment (RMG) factories after the [[Rana Plaza|2013 Rana Plaza building collapse]]. Collectively, Alliance members represent the majority of North American imports of ready-made garments from Bangladesh, produced in more than 700 factories.

==Background==
After the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], Walmart became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. Monsoon was a member of the [[Ethical Trading Initiative]] (ETI)&lt;ref name="uk.monsoon.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.monsoon.co.uk/view/category/uk_catalog/mon_7,mon_7.2 |title=Ethical Trading |website=Monsoon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130031649/http://uk.monsoon.co.uk/view/category/uk_catalog/mon_7%2Cmon_7.2 |archive-date=January 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethicaltrade.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/about-eti |title=About ETI &amp;#124; Ethical Trading Initiative |publisher=Ethicaltrade.org |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from before the [[2013 Savar building collapse]]&lt;ref name="uk.monsoon.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ethicaltrade.org"/&gt; due to [[structural integrity and failure]].

The building had housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Zain Al-Mahmood | first1 = Syed | last2 = Smithers  | first2 = Rebecca | date = April 24, 2013 | title = Bangladesh building collapse kills at least 76 garment workers | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/24/bangladesh-building-collapse-kills-garment-workers | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location=London | accessdate = April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factories manufactured apparel for brands including [[Benetton Group|Benetton]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; [[Monsoon Accessorize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |date=April 24, 2013 |title=Bangladesh Building Collapse: Factory 'Supplied High Street Fashion Retailers' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/24/bangladesh-building-collapse_n_3147634.html |publisher=The Huffington Post UK |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonmarché]],&lt;ref name="tg29Apr2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smithers |first=Rebecca |date=April 29, 2013 |title=Benetton admits link with firm in collapsed Bangladesh building |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/29/benetton-link-collapsed-building-bangladesh |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Children's Place]], [[El Corte Inglés]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Greenhouse | first=Steven | date=May 13, 2013 | title=Major Retailers Join Bangladesh Safety Plan | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/business/global/hm-agrees-to-bangladesh-safety-plan.html?google_editors_picks=true&amp;_r=0 | newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Fresh]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/04/30/extreme-pricing-at-what-cost-retailer-joe-fresh-sends-reps-to-bangladesh-as-death-toll-rises/ |title='Extreme Pricing' At What Cost?

==Formation of the Alliance==
The Alliance was organized through the U.S. [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] (BPC) with discussions convened and chaired by former U.S. Senate Majority Leader [[George J. Mitchell]] (D-ME) and former U.S. Senator [[Olympia Snowe]] (R-ME). The collaborative formation process involved apparel industry companies and stakeholders, including the U.S. and Bangladeshi governments, policymakers, international NGOs, and members of civil society and organized labor in Bangladesh. On July 10, 2013, the group announced the Bangladesh Worker Safety Initiative. The Initiative is a binding, five-year plan focused on fire and building safety inspections, worker training, and worker empowerment.

The Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety has elected former US Representative [[Ellen Tauscher]] as independent chairperson.

==Alliance work in Bangladesh==
===Factory inspections and public reporting===
The Alliance helped develop a common Fire Safety and Structural Integrity Standard – founded on the requirements of the 2006 Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC), though the Standard exceeds those requirements in some cases. The Standard was developed and is being implemented to ensure that all Member factories are held to the same safety requirements. The Standard was developed by technical experts from both the Alliance and the [[Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh]], and finalized in December 2013. The Standard has been harmonized with the guidelines developed by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) for the National Tripartite Plan of Action (NTPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---ilo-dhaka/documents/genericdocument/wcms_209285.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Tripartite Plan of action on Fire Safety for the Ready-Made Garment Sector in Bangladesh |publisher=Ilo.org |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance has retained a committee of independent fire and structural safety experts from Bangladesh, Europe and North America who are credentialed authorities in fire or building structural safety. The Committee of Experts (COE) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Alliance Standard, which includes approving qualified inspectors, conducting spot audits of remediation efforts and validating inspection reports. The Alliance has publicly announced that it aims to inspect all factories producing for its members by July 10, 2014.

The Alliance is working with the Fair Factories Clearinghouse, a non-profit organization that provides software to facilitate information-sharing. Alliance Members use this public platform to provide and exchange information about factories they use, fire and building safety training programs and curricula, and submit monthly reports on safety inspections and progress update on remediation plans being undertaken.

The Standard is used to evaluate all Alliance factories. The Board of Directors issues semi-annual public reports detailing its work and progress toward meeting in-country fire and building safety objectives, as well as training and worker empowerment goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshworkersafety.org/ |title=Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety – Home |publisher=Bangladeshworkersafety.org |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early September, 2015 the Alliance has recognized six RMG factories of Bangladesh to international standard as they finished all reformation works. These factories are; Green Textile, Kwun Tong Apparel, Laundry Industries, Lenny Apparel, Optimum Fashions, and Univogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haq |first=Ariful |date=September 9, 2015 |title=Six RMG factories upgraded to international standard:Alliance |url=http://banglaapparel.com/en/news/2015-09-09_18:42:05:0.218820001441802525.en.html |newspaper=BanglaApparel.com |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worker participation===
In November and December 2013, the Alliance conducted a Worker Baseline Survey among more than 3,200 workers in 28 garment factories in Bangladesh. 10 focus groups were conducted off-site with 101 participants in three Bangladeshi regions to obtain more information on fire and other health and safety issues.

The purpose of the survey and the off-site interviews was to better understand the current level of awareness of health and safety risks and what workers believe needs to be done to improve safety and reduce risk in the factories.  It is also a tool that will inform the necessary detail of our training programs.

The Alliance's worker helpline and education program will be implemented by three worker empowerment-focused, organizations, working in partnership. Clear Voice, the organization that provides tools for communication with workers, was founded by an early worker rights and human rights pioneer, Doug Cahn. Clear Voice will partner with Phulki, one of Bangladesh's leading worker rights non-governmental organizations (NGO), and Good World Solutions, whose focus will be on applying its Labor Link technology to train workers on their rights and survey them on their wellbeing.

Beginning March 2014, the helpline program will be piloted in 50 factories Dhaka and Chittagong, with in-factory orientations to accompany the launch at each location. Helplines will roll out to 100 factories by March 2015, with the goal of becoming functional in all Alliance factories by 2017.

==Local operations==
On December 9, 2013, the Alliance opened an office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshworkersafety.org/en/74-alliance-for-bangladesh-worker-safety-opens-its-doors-in-dhaka |title=Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety Opens its Doors in Dhaka |date=December 9, 2013 |website=Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the Alliance is focused on inspection implementation, development of a worker training curriculum, establishing a worker empowerment helpline, and building local capacity for completing factory improvements. As of February 2014, the Dhaka office serves as the primary hub for staff and organizational activities. All staff members in the Dhaka office are Bangladeshi nationals who bring decades of combined experience in Bangladesh's garment industry. As of March 2014, the team includes a managing director, managers for fire and structural safety, assessments, training, worker outreach and empowerment, factory liaison and remediation, as well as other support staff.

==Alliance governance==
The Board of Directors is entrusted with oversight responsibility for Alliance Members' compliance with Initiative requirements, such as meeting financial obligations and self-imposed deadlines for achieving inspections, information-sharing and worker training agreements.

The Board has the authority to investigate possible non-compliance, and take appropriate action against delinquent companies, by a two-thirds majority vote, including termination of membership in the Alliance.&lt;ref name="bangladeshworkersafety1"/&gt;

{{Calculus |Series}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''arithmetico–geometric sequence''' is the result of the term-by-term multiplication of a [[geometric progression]] with the corresponding terms of an [[arithmetic progression]]. Put more plainly, the ''n''th term of an arithmetico–geometric sequence is the product of the ''n''th term of an arithmetic sequence
and the ''n''th term of a geometric one. Arithmetico–geometric sequences arise in various applications, such as the computation of [[expected values]] in [[probability theory]]. For instance, the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\color{blue}{0}}{\color{green}{1}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{1}}{\color{green}{2}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{2}}{\color{green}{4}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{3}}{\color{green}{8}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{4}}{\color{green}{16}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{5}}{\color{green}{32}}, \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

is an arithmetico–geometric sequence. The arithmetic component appears in the numerator (in blue), and the geometric one in the denominator (in green).

The denomination may also be applied to different objects presenting characteristics of both arithmetic and geometric sequences; for instance the French notion of [[:fr:Suite arithmético-géométrique|arithmetico–geometric sequence]] refers to sequences of the form &lt;math&gt;u_{n+1}=a u_n+b&lt;/math&gt;, which generalise both arithmetic and geometric sequences. Such sequences are a special case of [[linear difference equation]]s.

==Terms of the sequence==
The first few terms of an arithmetico–geometric sequence composed of an [[arithmetic progression]] (in blue) with difference &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and initial value &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a [[geometric progression]] (in green) with initial value &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and common ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
are given by:&lt;ref name="RHB118"&gt;{{cite book |author1=K. F. Riley |author2=M. P. Hobson |author3=S. J. Bence |title= Mathematical methods for physics and engineering|edition= 3rd|year= 2010|page=118|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
t_1 &amp; =\color{blue}a \color{green}b \\
t_2 &amp; =\color{blue}(a+d) \color{green}br \\
t_3 &amp; =\color{blue}(a+2d)\color{green} br^2 \\
&amp; \ \,\vdots \\
t_n &amp; =\color{blue}[a+(n-1)d]\color{green} br^{n-1}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example===
For instance, the sequence

:&lt;math&gt;\dfrac{\color{blue}{0}}{\color{green}{1}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{1}}{\color{green}{2}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{2}}{\color{green}{4}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{3}}{\color{green}{8}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{4}}{\color{green}{16}}, \ \dfrac{\color{blue}{5}}{\color{green}{32}}, \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

is defined by &lt;math&gt;d=b=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r=\frac 12&lt;/math&gt;.

== Sum of the terms ==
The sum of the first {{math|''n''}} terms of an arithmetico–geometric sequence has the form

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_n &amp; = \sum_{k = 1}^n t_k = \sum_{k = 1}^n \left[a + (k - 1) d\right] br^{k - 1} \\
&amp; = ab + [a + d] br + [a + 2 d] br^2 + \cdots + [a + (n - 1) d] br^{n - 1} \\
&amp; = A_1G_1 + A_2G_2 + A_3G_3 + \cdots + A_nG_n,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; are the {{mvar|i}}th terms of the arithmetic and the geometric sequence, respectively.

This sum has the [[closed-form expression]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_n &amp; = \frac{ab - (a+nd)\,br^n}{1 - r}+\frac{dbr\,(1 - r^n)}{(1-r)^2}\\
    &amp; = \frac{A_1G_1 - A_{n+1}G_{n+1}}{1 - r}+\frac{dr}{(1-r)^2}\,(G_1 - G_{n+1}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof===
Multiplying,&lt;ref name="RHB118"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_n = ab + [a + d] br + [a + 2 d] br^2 + \cdots + [a + (n - 1) d] br^{n - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
by {{math|''r''}}, gives
:&lt;math&gt;r S_n = a br + [a + d] br^2 + [a + 2 d] br^3 + \cdots + [a + (n - 1) d] br^n.&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting {{math|''rS&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} from {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and using the technique of [[telescoping series]] gives
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
(1 - r) S_n = {} &amp; \left[ab + (a + d) br + (a + 2 d) br^2 + \cdots + [a + (n - 1) d] br^{n - 1}\right] \\[5pt]
&amp; {} - \left[a br + (a + d) br^2 + (a + 2 d) br^3 + \cdots + [a + (n - 1) d] br^n\right] \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; ab + d b\left(r + r^2 + \cdots + r^{n-1}\right) - \left[a + (n - 1) d\right] br^n \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; ab + d b\left(r + r^2 + \cdots + r^{n-1}+r^n\right) - \left(a + n d\right) br^n \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; ab + d br \left(1 + r + r^2 + \cdots + r^{n-1}\right) - \left(a + nd\right) br^n \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; ab + \frac{d br (1 - r^n)}{1 - r} - (a + nd) br^n, \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality results of the expression for the [[Geometric series#Formula|sum of a geometric series]]. Finally dividing through by {{math|1 − ''r''}} gives the result.

== Infinite series ==
If −1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1, then the sum ''S'' of the arithmetico–geometric [[Series (mathematics)|series]], that is to say, the sum of all the infinitely many terms of the progression, is given by&lt;ref name="RHB118"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S &amp;= \sum_{k = 1}^\infty t_k = \lim_{n \to \infty}S_{n} \\
  &amp;= \frac{ab}{1-r}+\frac{dbr}{(1-r)^2}\\
  &amp;= \frac{A_1G_1}{1 - r}+\frac{dG_1r}{(1-r)^2}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''r'' is outside of the above range, the series either
* [[Divergent series|diverges]] (when ''r'' &gt; 1, or when ''r'' = 1 where the series is arithmetic and ''a'' and ''d'' are not both zero; if both ''a'' and ''d'' are zero in the later case, all terms of the series are zero and the series is constant)
* or [[Alternating series|alternates]] (when ''r'' ≤ −1).

===Example: application to expected values===
For instance, the sum

:&lt;math&gt;S=\dfrac{\color{blue}{0}}{\color{green}{1}}+\dfrac{\color{blue}{1}}{\color{green}{2}}+\dfrac{\color{blue}{2}}{\color{green}{4}}+\dfrac{\color{blue}{3}}{\color{green}{8}}+\dfrac{\color{blue}{4}}{\color{green}{16}}+\dfrac{\color{blue}{5}}{\color{green}{32}}+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;,

being the sum of an arithmetico–geometric series defined by &lt;math&gt;d=b=1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;r=\frac 12&lt;/math&gt;, converges to &lt;math&gt;S=2&lt;/math&gt;.

This sequence corresponds to the expected number of [[Coin flipping|coin tosses]] before obtaining "tails". The probability &lt;math&gt;T_k&lt;/math&gt; of obtaining tails for the first time at the ''k''th toss is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;T_1=\frac 1{2}, \ T_2=\frac 1{4},\dots, T_k = \frac 1{2^k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the expected number of tosses is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k T_k = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac {\color{blue}k}{\color{green}2^k} = S = 2&lt;/math&gt; .

'''Baren''' (馬連、馬楝) ''{{Audio|Baren.ogg|listen}}'' is a disk-like hand tool with a flat bottom and a knotted handle used in [[Japanese woodblock printing]]. It is used to burnish (firmly rub) the back of a sheet of paper, lifting ink from the block.
  
==Construction==
[[File:Coiled_cord_for_a_baren.gif|thumb|upright=0.8|A coiled braided cord forms the core of the baren]]
[[File:Baren2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Finishing the wrapping by pressing the baren down firmly with the left hand to tighten the wrapping and twisting the sheath with the right hand to form a handle.]]
The baren is made of layers.  A flat coil of [[braid]]ed cord forms the core. This is placed on a disk (''ategawa'') consisting of 30–40 sheets of high-grade long-fibred hosokawa paper, wrapped in tissue and black [[lacquer]]. This is covered by a thin bamboo sheath (''takenokawa'') twisted in such a manner as to form the handle on the top.&lt;ref name="McGregorIshida2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mark McGregor|author2=Mariko Ishida|title=Ukiyo-e: Secrets of the floating world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbIDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=23 April 2016|publisher=Vyiha Publishing|isbn=978-988-13004-3-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hiroshi Yoshida]]'s manual ''Japanese Woodblock Printing'' (1939) the ''[[Phyllostachys bambusoides|madake]]'' species of bamboo, grown in Kyushu, southwest Japan, is considered the best one to use.&lt;ref name=hiroshi&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Hiroshi Yoshida|author=Hiroshi Yoshida|title=Japanese Wood-block Printing|year=1939|publisher= Sanseido Company, Tokyo and Osaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo-sheath covering the baren may need to be renewed after a day's printing.  Rewrapping requires great skill; a printer's ability is sometimes judged by their competence carrying out this work.&lt;ref name=hiroshi /&gt;

The disk inside the baren takes 40–50 days to create, as the craftsman glues one sheet of paper on the disk each day.  The disk must then dry for a year before the baren is assembled.  The coil and covering of the baren are woven and formed from parts of the bamboo plant, requiring the skill of a true master. Only one known person in Japan is still making traditional (''hon'') baren for a living — Hidehiko Goto of the Kikuhide workshop.

==Alternatives==
Large wooden spoons are also used as burnishing tools in printmaking, glass jars with a smooth circular base can also be used for some applications. Some new world barens are similar in shape to the traditional one with small metal ball bearings embedded in the bottom surface that generate the high point contact pressures (supplied by the braided cord) and have the low friction (offered by the bamboo leaf covering) of a traditional brayer.  Another interesting baren is one developed by Professor Seishi Ozakus and made from a bundle of bamboo toothpicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.usask.ca/~nis715/S%20Ozakus.htm Professor Seishi Ozakus' Toothpick Baren]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nik Semenoff has developed a palm press that serves as a baren replacement, made with a number of roller bearings alternating on two close spaced shafts in a small hand held mounting.  The bearings have negligible friction and the pressures achievable are suitable for some [[Offset printing|offset]] [[lithography]] printing, though wider spacing of fewer contact points may make it less suited for traditional wood cut printing.

The '''charreada''' ({{IPA-es|tʃaˈrea̯ða|-|CharreadaPronunciation.ogg}}) or '''charrería''' ({{IPA-es|tʃareˈɾi.a|pron}}) is a competitive event similar to [[rodeo]] and was developed from [[animal husbandry]] practices used on the [[haciendas]] of [[New Spain|old Mexico]]. The sport has been described as "living history," or as an art form drawn from the demands of working life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/458-charreada-in-guadalajara|title=Charreada in Guadalajara|work=mexconnect.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, charrería was inscribed in the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charrería, equestrian tradition in Mexico - UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/charreria-equestrian-tradition-in-mexico-01108?RL=01108|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolving from the traditions brought from Spain in the 16th century, the first charreadas were ranch work competitions between haciendas. The modern Charreada developed after the [[Mexican Revolution]] when ''[[charro]]'' traditions were disappearing.  The competing charros often came from families with a tradition of Charreria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|last=Kline=first=Chris|title=Mexico's charros are a breed apart|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9705/04/mexico.charros/|date=1997-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teams today are often made up from extended families who have been performing for up to five generations.&lt;ref name="sacharro16"/&gt;

The ''charreada'' consists of nine events for men plus one for women, all of which involve horses, cattle or both.&lt;ref name="Candelaria"/&gt;  Some of the events in the charreada have been criticized by animal advocacy groups and some states have banned certain events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=US Times|title=Weekends at the Charreada (Mexican Rodeo)|url=http://www.ustimes.us/weekends_at_the_charreda_%28mexican_rodeo%29.htm|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|access-date=2011-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325044010/http://www.ustimes.us/weekends_at_the_charreda_(mexican_rodeo).htm|archive-date=2012-03-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there is an absence of independent statistical data and unbiased recording of the injury rate of animals has not been undertaken.

==History==
[[File:Lazador insurgente Mexique.jpg|thumb|A historic image of charros as insurgent fighters by [[Claudio Linati]] (1828).]]
Charrería, a word encompassing all aspects of the art, evolved from the traditions that came to Mexico from [[Salamanca, Spain]] in the 16th century. When the Spanish first settled in [[Colonial Mexico]], they were under orders to raise horses, but not to allow [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to ride.  However, by 1528 the Spanish had very large [[hacienda|cattle-raising estates]] and found it necessary to employ indigenous people as [[vaquero]]s or herdsman, who soon became excellent horsemen.  Smaller landholders, known as rancheros or ranchers, were the first genuine [[charro]]s and they are credited as the inventors of the charreada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnn.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/10_la_charreada.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816195630/http://dnn.epcc.edu/nwlibrary/borderlands/10_la_charreada.htm |archivedate=2011-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]], ranch work competitions were generally between haciendas. Before World War I, there was little difference between rodeo and charreada. Athletes from the United States, Mexico and Canada competed in all three countries. Subsequently, charreada was formalized as an amateur team sport and the international competitions ceased.&lt;ref&gt;LeCompte, "Hispanic Roots of American Rodeo", Studies in Latin American Popular Culture, 13 (Spring 1994): 1-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the breakup of the ''[[hacienda]]s'' by the [[Mexican Revolution]], the ''charros'' saw their traditions slipping away. They met in 1921 and formed the ''Asociación Nacional de Charros'' to keep the ''charrería'' tradition alive.  The advent of the Mexican cinema brought greater popularity, especially musicals which combined [[ranchera]]s with the ''charro'' image, akin to the Western and "singing cowboy" genres in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorandomexico.com/about-mexico/5/153/|title=Information and biography of Jorge Negrete|work=Explorando México|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican Americans in the United States also held various ''charreadas'' during the same period, but in the 1970s, the ''[[Federación Mexicana de Charrería]]'' (FMCH) began assisting them in establishing official ''charreadas'' north of the border. They are now quite common.  At times, US champion teams compete in the national competition of Mexico.

==Performance==
[[Image:232901774 10376f0786.jpg|thumb|Charras in parade wearing the traditional ''Adelita''.]]

The participants in the ''charreada'' wear traditional ''charro'' clothing, including&lt;!--be nice to expand more on what this is, and photos would be ideal--&gt; a closely fitted suit, [[chaps]], boots, and a wide brim [[sombrero]].&lt;!--removing all the stuff on the hat, belongs in sombrero article--&gt; The body-fitting suit of the charro, while decorative, is also practical; it fits closely to insure there is no flapping cloth to be caught by the horns of steers.  The ''botinas'', or little boots, prevent feet from slipping through the stirrups.  [[Spur]]s are worn on the botinas.&lt;ref name=sacharro16&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sacharro.com/page16|title=CHARREADA san antonio charro association charreada charros|work=sacharro.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[saddle]] of the charro has a wider horn than that of a [[western saddle]], which helps safeguard the charro from being pitched off and from being hung up. There are two grips at the back of the saddle, in case the charro needs to hold on because of a [[bucking|buck]] or some other unexpected act of the horse.&lt;ref name=sacharro16/&gt;

A ''charreada'' is held within a marked-off area of an arena called a ''[[Lienzo charro]]'' consisting of a lane {{convert|12|m}} wide by {{convert|60|m}} long leading into a circle {{convert|40|m}} in diameter.

[[File:CHARRO HACIENDO SUERTES CON SU REATA.jpg|thumb|A [[Charro]] making a risky "suerte" (Luck).]]
In the opening ceremony, organizations and participants parade into the arena on horseback, usually accompanied by a [[mariachi band]] playing ''[[Marcha Zacatecas]]''. This signifies the long tradition of Charros being an auxiliary arm of the Mexican Army. The short charro jacket is remniscent of that worn by members of [[Pancho Villa|Villa's Army]].&lt;ref name=sacharro16/&gt;

The ''charreada'' itself consists of nine scoring events staged in a particular order for men. Unlike rodeos, most ''charreadas'' do not award money to the winners as charreadas are considered an amateur, rather than professional sport.  Prizes may take the form of trophies. Unlike American rodeo, events are not timed but judged and scored based on finesse and grace.  Charreada historically enjoys greater prestige in Mexico than in the United States.&lt;ref name="Candelaria" /&gt;

Until recently, the charreada was confined to men but a women's precision equestrian event called the [[escaramuza]] is now the tenth and final event in a charreada.  The event involves women's teams dressed in a style reminiscent of the nineteenth century, participating in precisely choreographed  patterns for horses.&lt;ref name="Candelaria"&gt;{{cite book |last=Candelaria |first=Cordelia |title=Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-313-32215-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STjcB_f7CVcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Latino+Popular+Culture&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate antecedent of the present Escaramuzas were the ''[[La Adelita|Adelitas]]'', or "women of the revolution."  Tradition holds that women on horseback were decoys during the [[Mexican revolution]]. The women would ride off to raise a cloud of dust so that the [[Federales]] were deceived into thinking an attack would come from that direction. The revolutionaries would then attack from the rear.&lt;ref name=damacharra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://damacharra.com/index2.php|title=damacharra.com - Escaramuza Charra|work=damacharra.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women in the escaramuza are mounted "a mujeriegas", that is, in an "albarda" or [[sidesaddle]] that is peculiar in style to the Charrería but the underlying design has also evolved over hundreds of years in both Europe and North Africa. The traditional ''albarda'' for the Escaramuza is a cut down charro saddle, with a leather seat and leg braces, U-shaped for the right leg and C-shaped for the left leg.&lt;ref name=damacharra/&gt;&lt;!--see the photo about halfway down in the sidesaddle article and verify if these are basically the two-horned "leaping horn" design seen in most other modern sidesaddles--&gt;

[[File:Charreria en la feria del Mole 03.JPG|thumb|A Charrería exhibition.]]

The ''charreada'' itself consists of a number of scoring events staged in a particular order&amp;mdash;nine for the men and one for the women. Two or more teams, called ''asociaciones'', compete against each other. Teams can compete to become state, regional, and national champions. The competitors are judged by both style and execution.

Unlike rodeos, most ''charreadas'' do not award money to the winners as ''charreadas'' are considered an amateur sport, not professional. Under Mexican laws it would be illegal to receive a monetary reward for participating in a ''charreada''. At times there are such prizes as saddles or horse trailers.

#''Cala de Caballo'' ([[Reining]]); Literally the demonstration of the horse rein, the horse is required to show its talents in the canter, gallop, slide stop, spins on its hind legs as well as backing. Is one of the hardest events to master and also the most elaborately scored, it is possible to score more negative points than positive ones.
#''Piales en Lienzo'' (Heeling); a horseman must throw a [[lasso|lariat]], let a horse run through the loop, catching it by the hind legs. Three opportunities are given. Points are awarded for distance needed to stop the mare. This is done in the rectangular portion of the arena;
#''Colas en el Lienzo'', or ''Coleadero''  (Steer Tailing) similar to [[Steer wrestling|bull dogging]] except that the rider does not dismount; the charro rides alongside the left side of the bull, wraps its tail around his right leg, and tries to bring the bull down in a roll as he rides past it. Points are given for technique, time, and roll of the bull.
#''Jineteo de Toro'' ([[Bull riding]]) similar to the rodeo event. Bulls are smaller, between 990 and 1320 pounds, and are ridden until they stop bucking. Two hands can be used on the bullrope. Points are given for technique. The charro cannot fall off, he must dismount and land upright. After the charro dismounts the bull he must remove the bullrope and bellrope so the Terna en el Ruedo can follow. This event has its roots in an earlier form known as [[Jaripeo]].
#''Terna en el Ruedo'' (Team Roping); a team roping event in which three charros attempt to rope a bull - one by its neck, one by its hind legs, and the last then ties its feet together. They have a maximum of 6 minutes. Points are awarded for rope tricks and time.
#''Jineteo de Yegua'' (Bareback on a wild mare); similar to [[Bareback bronc]] riding. Yegua means [[mare]]. An untrained horse, often a mare, is ridden with a bullrope. Two hands are used and the legs are held horizontally to the ground.
#''Manganas a Pie'' (Forefooting) a charro on foot (pie) has three opportunities to rope a horse by its front legs and cause it to fall and roll once. The horse, usually a mare, is chased around the ring by three mounted charros or hazers. Points are awarded for time and rope tricks as long as the horse is roped and brought down. Extra points are given for the tirón del ahorcado (hanged pull) in which the rope is around the charro's neck, like a noose, and he uses his body to cause the mare to fall and roll. Points for all three attempts are cumulative. Eight minutes are given.
#''Manganas a Caballo'' or (Forefooting on Horseback); a charro on horseback has three opportunities to rope a horse by its front legs.  In the USA, the horses are not rolled, they are released as soon as they are roped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charrosfederationusa.com/charreada-events/|title=Charros Federation USA - Mexican-American Rodeo - California - Charro and Rodeo Competition Descriptions|work=Charros Federation USA|accessdate=16 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206012319/http://charrosfederationusa.com/charreada-events/|archive-date=2015-02-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But elsewhere, the goal is to have the horse fall and roll once. The horse is chased around the ring by three mounted charros. Points are awarded for time and rope tricks as long as the horse is roped according to the national rules. Points for all three attempts are cumulative. Eight minutes are given. 
#''El Paso de la Muerte'' (The pass of death) a charro riding bareback, with reins, attempts to leap from his own horse to the [[bareback riding|bare back]] of a loose, unbroken horse without reins and ride it until it stops bucking. The most dangerous part of this is if the charro performing the pass falls under three other mounted charros that are chasing the loose horse round the arena ring. This is done backwards at times for show.
#''[[Escaramuza]]'' (English: "skirmish") is an event added in 1992 for teams of women who perform  precision equestrian displays riding sidesaddle and garbed in ''Adelita'' dress.  It is usually held between the ''Coleadero'' and the ''Jineteo de Toro''.&lt;ref name="Candelaria" /&gt;

==Animal welfare issues==
{{Further|Animal treatment in rodeo}}

[[Image:47148121 73274e8f1a.jpg|thumb|''Manganas a Caballo'' or Forefooting on horseback.]]
Various aspects of charreada have been criticized by [[animal welfare]] groups in the United States as being inhumane. While some [[animal rights]] organizations oppose many or all aspects of both charreada and American-style rodeo,&lt;ref name=sloan/&gt; other organizations do not oppose rodeos generally or the charreada events that are similar to those seen in US rodeo.  However, they do oppose specific charreada events, particularly steer-tailing and those that involve roping horses, which are grouped under the term "horse-tripping."&lt;ref name=sloan/&gt;

These organizations have particular criticism for ''piales'' and ''mangana,'' the heeling and two forefooting events that involve roping of horses,&lt;ref name=adhf&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Horse Defense Fund|url=http://www.ahdf.org/tripping.htm|title=History of Horse tripping|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903115809/http://www.ahdf.org/tripping.htm|archivedate=2011-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rentein/&gt;&lt;ref name=equine&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Equine Voices Rescue Sanctuary|url=http://www.equinevoices.org/pdf/pdf/rodeosch.php|title=La Charreada or La Charro – Mexican Rodeos}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=idusa&gt;{{cite web|publisher=In Defense of Animals |url=http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html |title=Horse-tripping facts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315182541/http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html |archivedate=2013-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they claim that the horses used will often sustain injuries, including broken bones and teeth, dislocated joints, and lacerations.&lt;ref name=adhf/&gt;  The distinction claimed between Manganas, or horse-tripping, and events that rope cattle, such as [[calf roping]], is that the high center of gravity of a horse, the longer legs and faster speed of a horse creates greater potential for injury, whereas cattle are smaller, have a low center of gravity, are slower and have sturdier limbs.&lt;ref name=adhf/&gt;   There are additional concerns that horses are underfed and overused, repeatedly roped until lame, with [[Friction burn|rope burns]] down to the bone.&lt;ref name=idusa/&gt;

forefooting is not permitted in motion pictures monitored by the [[American Humane Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Humane Association|title=Film monitoring|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/who-we-are/faqs/film-monitoring.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The California-based Charros Federation USA states that it has voluntarily banned horse-tripping in mainstream charros for over 15 years.&lt;ref name=Denver&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/legislature/ci_17188054 Glazier, Karl. "Bill banning Mexican rodeo events horse-tripping and steer-tailing dies" ''The Denver Post'', January 25, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  They also note, however, that the complete capture in mangana was not stopped due to a belief that there was an unreasonable danger to the horses used, but so teams from California would not be at a disadvantage when they competed in the United States, after a 1994 California law stopped the take down in mangana. Under the Federation rules, the complete capture is still permitted in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charrousa.com/noticias2011/maccho06.html|title=:::   MEXICAN AMERICAN PRO CLASSIC CHARRERÍA ORGANIZATION  :::|work=charrousa.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine  US states,&lt;ref name=hardsell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=12386|title=Horse Tripping Ban a Tough Sell in Some States|work=TheHorse.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the southwestern border states of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona, have banned horse-tripping as a sport, although horses may still be roped and taken to the ground when required for veterinary care, identification and branding; or essentially, reasons other than entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Penal Code Sec. 597, Ariz Penal Code 1329, Tex Penal Code, 42.09, NM Penal Code 30-18-11, Neb Penal Code, 21-1705, Olk Penal Code LB 764, Ill 21-1705&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the state legislatures of Oregon and Nevada considered but did not pass bills that would have stopped horse tripping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quarterhorsenews.com/index.php/news/industry-news/10223-oregon-anti-rodeo-bill-nixed.html|title=Oregon Anti-Rodeo Bill Nixed|work=Quarter Horse News|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and, in Colorado, a bill intended to ban both horse-tripping and steer-tailing also failed.&lt;ref name=Denver/&gt;

There are also concerns about the steer tailing event, due to concerns that a steer can suffer injuries to his tail, but also his back and limbs as he rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Humane Association|title=American Humane Opposes Tail-Grabbing Rodeo To Be Held In Jefferson County, Colo.|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/animal-welfare-news/american-humane-opposes-tail-grabbing-rodeo-to-be-held-in-jefferson-county-colo.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719202616/http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/animal-welfare-news/american-humane-opposes-tail-grabbing-rodeo-to-be-held-in-jefferson-county-colo.html|archivedate=2012-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation to ban steer tailing, which also is an event seen in some rodeos, was introduced in at least two states.&lt;ref name=sloan&gt;[http://charrousa.com/noticias07/associatedpress02.html Sloan, Karen and Andrew J.

Supporters of Charreda defend the sport, stating that there is little evidence to support claims of inhumane treatment and noting that few animals are seriously injured. The Charro Federation has stated that experienced Charros know how to properly rope a horse without injuring it.&lt;ref name=Rentein&gt;{{cite book| title=The Cultural Defense|author =Rentein, Alison Dundes |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year= 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyWr3dSXUrIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=charreda+cruel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EgeFWruuVj&amp;sig=81yrokFfJ5zT_mUAdopqQxgF0Po&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5fTjTcSTMNOUtwfgw6GjBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=107–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Charros Federation USA notes that fringe groups who do not follow mainstream standards give a bad name to the whole community.&lt;ref name=Denver/&gt;  Supporters point out that events sanctioned by the [[Federación Mexicana de Charrería]] (FMCH) are held in both the United States and Mexico, and they operate under rules promulgated by the Federation.&lt;ref name="noticas"/&gt; They also point to successful and highly public events such the Fiesta San Antonio, where Charreada has been an integral part of the festival for more than 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Fiesta-sa.org/|title=Fiesta San Antonio|work=fiesta-sa.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few hard statistics on either side of the issue.  Many charreadas are loosely organized in the USA and obtaining data is a challenge.&lt;ref name=adhf/&gt; Informal reports by organizations on both sides of the issue exist.  The American Horse Defense Fund claims that from 8 to 20 percent of horses leased for charreada in California were reported to be injured seriously enough to be "sent to slaughter" each week,&lt;ref name=adhf/&gt; and the president of the California Equine Council claimed to personally observe a circuit of 10 charreadas for which 78 horses were leased for a season's use, and only 2 were not sent to slaughter by the season's end.&lt;ref name=idusa/&gt;  [[Arabian horse]]s are said preferred by charros due to their lighter weight,&lt;ref name=idusa/&gt; and Arabian horse rescue organizations have reported on encountering rope-scarred animals in slaughter yards whose injuries have been attributed to charreada use by the feedlot owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrn.org/ahw/02ahrn.htm|title=Arabian Horse Rescue Network|work=ahrn.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charro associations question the legitimacy of these reports and lack of hard data.&lt;ref name=FMCH&gt;[http://lienzomagazine.com/wp-content/documents/FMCHSB364.pdf Contreras, Javier. Letter in opposition of SB 364, Nevada Legislature, March 25. 2011]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Charreada organizers in Texas began keeping statistics on injuries to both animals and charros for events sanctioned by the FMCH. Since that time, they have self-published results from 1035 charreadas. 624 of which were held in Mexico, where traditional mangana, piales and cola events are offered. 411 charreadas were held in the United States, with non-traditional manganas, but traditional piales and cola. There were also an additional 10 coleaderos. They have reported 10 injured Charros, two steers with horns broken, three steers had tails broken in cola, one steer losing the hair at the end of its tail, one steer's leg broken in cola. A horse started limping after hitting a wall in Paso, but the lameness resolved a few hours later. A horse pulled a ligament in cola. One horse was killed when it flipped in a bucking event. In the Charreadas and Coleaderos, held in Mexico, 6601 steers, 18059 horses and 2009 bulls were used. In the Charreadas and Coleaderos held in the United States 4570 steers, 3905 horses and 1216 bulls were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacharro.com/page13|title=CHARREADA san antonio charro association charreada charros|work=sacharro.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the  [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) reports an animal injury rate of less than one percent in its sanctioned US rodeos.   However, The Charro  Association notes that the PRCA only sanctions about 30 percent of all US rodeos,&lt;ref name=sloan/&gt; Unsanctioned rodeos may have higher abuse and injury rates, and the [[ASPCA]] notes that rodeo practice sessions are often the location of more severe abuses than competitions.&lt;ref name="ASPCA"&gt;"Animals in Entertainment: 5.4 Rodeo" web site accessed June 27, 2007 at {{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename%3Dpp_en_rodeo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123072049/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, anecdotal reports suggest the worst charreada abuses in the USA occur at events held in small venues with little public notice, and the deepest concerns are directed these unsanctioned events.&lt;ref name=law/&gt;  The problem appears to be most often reported in California, where horse-tripping is banned, yet private "backyard" events still feature these events.&lt;ref name=idusa/&gt;

===Cultural concerns===
[[File:Charreria en la Feria del Mole 2014 38.JPG|thumb|Charro with the Mexican flag]]
[[File:Charrería en Tequixquiac (10).JPG|thumb|A charreada in [[Tequixquiac]].]]

An additional issue separate from the animal welfare debate is concern from some people within the Hispanic community that bans on charreada are a form of cultural discrimination.&lt;ref name=Rentein/&gt; A professor from Yale University noted a correlation between anti-mangana laws and anti-immigrant policy in some southwestern states. Though initially such legislation often was introduced by those concerned with animal welfare, the debates were often taken over by "nativists who demand border militarization,
exclusion and deportation," citing as examples political figures who argued that people who abuse horses also abuse 'our children' and 'must be reminded of American laws'. Often, bans on charreada events corresponded with the passage of other blatantly anti-immigrant legislation.&lt;ref name=Barraclough&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barraclough|first1=Laura|title='Horse tripping': animal welfare laws and the production of ethnic Mexican illegality|url=http://www.legalizehorsetripping.com/page4|website=Ethnic and Racial Studies|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.800571|date=June 8, 2013|volume=37| issue=11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903070609/http://www.legalizehorsetripping.com/page4 |archivedate=3 September 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the mangana and piales events argue that catching horses by their legs has been and is a legitimate method of animal husbandry and therefore part of a celebration of traditional ranching methods of Mexico. This is evidenced by the veterinary and ranch work exemptions in the California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas statutes.&lt;ref name=noticas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Penal Code Sec. 597, Ariz Penal Code 1329, Tex Penal Code, 42.09, NM Penal Code 30-18-11&lt;/ref&gt; They also note the inclusion of mangana and piales in Charreada rules promulgated by the FMCH as proof of the tradition of catching horses by their legs.&lt;ref name=noticas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charrousa.com/noticias/fmch.html|title=:: Federación Mexicana de Charreria A.C. ::|work=charrousa.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Horses and traditions5.jpg|thumb|A traditional ''Adelita''.]]
On the other hand, others argue that horse-tripping is not a traditional part of Mexican culture.&lt;ref name=Rentein/&gt; Individuals within the Mexican-American community such as [[Cesar Chavez]] have come out in opposition to inhumane treatment of animals being justified on cultural grounds.&lt;ref name=Rentein/&gt;  Chavez, who became a vegetarian and had concerns for the welfare of animals in general,&lt;ref name=Dearing&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/295857 Dearing, Stephanie. "The accomplishments of animal welfare activist Eric Mills"] ''Digital Journal'', September 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; had written a letter in 1990 to [[Action for Animals]] stating his view that legislation was needed to ensure the humane treatment of animals at rodeos and explaining that violence was linked with racism, economic deprivation, and various animal sports, including dog fighting, cockfighting, bullfighting, and rodeo.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkonline.org/?P=0000001026|title=SHARK - Investigations and Campaigns Against Animal Abuse|work=sharkonline.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This letter did not specifically mention charreada, though Chavez drew particular attention to rodeos where no veterinarian was required to be present.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;

The legislative debate in California in 1994 brought this issue to the forefront.  When the bill banning horse-tripping passed, there was concern that the legislation was part of an overall anti-immigration climate that the voters in California were generally favoring at the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|first=Alison Dundes|last=Renteln|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyWr3dSXUrIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=charreda+cruel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EgeFWruuVj&amp;sig=81yrokFfJ5zT_mUAdopqQxgF0Po&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5fTjTcSTMNOUtwfgw6GjBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Cultural Defense|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, support from organizations such as the Mexican American Political Association, the Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, the United Farm Workers (UFW) and the International Longshore Workers Union helped procure passage of the bill.of the bill.&lt;ref name=Barraclough/&gt;

When horse-tripping legislation was debated in California, the sponsor of the original bill was [[Joe Baca]], an Assemblyman of Mexican descent who went on to become a member of the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name=SB364&gt;[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/76th2011/Exhibits/Senate/NR/SNR798D.pdf McGrath, Beverlee. Testimony on SB 364, Nevada Legislature, April 6. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the initial bill was submitted by Baca,  it was criticized as discriminatory by other Mexican American Assembly members such as [[Richard Polanco]]. The original bill was defeated, but was resubmitted during an emergency session of the legislature.  Assemblyman Baca did not sponsor the resubmitted legislation, instead it was sponsored by a non-Hispanic member, [[John L. Burton|John Burton]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; However, unlike the situation in Arizona, during the debate leading to the ban enacted in 1994, the California Equine Legislative Counsel presented testimony that individuals such as [[Cesar Chavez]] and organizations including the [[Mexican American Political Association]] opposed horse-tripping as a "cruel cultural anachronism."&lt;ref name=Rentein/&gt;

===Rodeo and charreada===
[[File:Horses and traditions3.jpg|thumb|Child in charro attire riding in a parade in Mexico.]]
The [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) does not take an official position on Horse tripping, as is not a sanctioned event.&lt;ref name="Capital press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalpress.com/content/ml-horse-tripping-house-050913|title=&lt;p&gt;Rodeo supporters line up against 'horse tripping' bill&lt;/p&gt;|work=Capital Press|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The California-based Charros Federation USA states that it has voluntarily banned horse-tripping in mainstream charros for over 15 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/legislature/ci_17188054 Glazier, Karl.  "Bill banning Mexican rodeo events horse-tripping and steer-tailing dies" ''The Denver Post'', January 25, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two non-charreada events in the United States that ropes horses by their front legs, the non-PRCA Jordan Big Loop Rodeo and the Harney County Ranch Rodeo in Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/13569/BIG%20HEARTS%20BEHIND%20THE%20Big%20Loop.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klamathbasinvisitor.com/buckaroos.html|title=Great Basin buckaroos and ranch rodeos&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|work=klamathbasinvisitor.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckaroohalloffame.com/links.html|title=Buckaroo Hall of Fame - Links|author=Carl F Hammond|work=buckaroohalloffame.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Oregon legislature considered legislation regulating horse-roping events. The PRCA opposed the bill on the grounds that the activities of concern to sponsors are already covered adequately under existing animal cruelty legislation and because the wording could define roping the legs of horses for any reason as ''per se'' cruelty.&lt;ref name="PRCA statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs163/1101303344550/archive/1112658453502.html|title=PRCA Oregon Legislative Bulletin|work=constantcontact.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Douglas Corey, chair of the Livestock Welfare Committee of the PRCA, said "We do not feel that simply roping the legs of a horse is an act that should be banned."."&lt;ref name="Capital press"/&gt;

During the 2011 legislative debate in Nevada on legislation to ban the horse-tripping events, some opponents of a ban expressed concern that it would also undermine rodeos. However, this was disputed by supporters of a ban:  "Horse tripping is not a recognized event in any form of sanctioned rodeo...This issue has absolutely nothing to do with rodeos nor is it some back door attempt to attack rodeo and livestock events..."&lt;ref name=law&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Animal law coalition|url=http://www.animallawcoalition.com/animal-cruelty/article/1645|title=NV Horse-tripping Ban May Go Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, supporters of charreada point out that some rodeo associations initially opposed the California horse tripping ban,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; pointing out that when the original bill was submitted, supporters such as [[Eric Mill]]s were also  seeking to ban [[calf roping]], "steer busting" and [[steer wrestling|bulldogging]]. After the bill failed, the California Equine Counsel, who was not opposed to those events, stepped in as the main spokes group for the resubmitted bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/eric-mills-and-the-horse-he-rode-in-on/Content?oid=1070587|title=Eric Mills and the Horse He Rode in On -     East Bay Express|work=East Bay Express|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Mills no longer took an active role in the legislation, the Rodeo Associations decided to remain neutral, and the bill passed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 2011, SB 613, a bill to stop "horse tripping" was submitted in Oregon. This was opposed by the United Horsemen. "They were joined by other SB 613 opponents, including the [[American Quarter Horse Association]], the Oregon Quarter Horse Association, and the PRCA.  Other opponents included the directors of the [[Pendleton Roundup]] plus other rodeo directors and supporters. The bill did not pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwhorsesource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4126:animal-rights-forces-foiled-in-oregon-legislature&amp;catid=920:northwest-news&amp;Itemid=324|title=Gypsy Girl Clothing ~ For the Free Spirit in All of Us - NW Horse Source|work=NW Horse Source|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastbay&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/gyrobase/eric-mills-and-the-horse-he-rode-in-on/Content?oid=1070587&amp;storyPage=7|title=Eric Mills and the Horse He Rode in On -     East Bay Express|work=East Bay Express|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRCA also worked with the Charros' groups to stop a bill to make steer tailing illegal, and to stop legislation that would have required two weeks advance notice of rodeo events.&lt;ref name=Eastbay /&gt;

The term '''circuit rider''', which has its [[circuit rider (Religious)|roots]] in [[Methodist]] preaching, has more recently been applied to technology assistance providers who travel to small [[non-profit organizations]] in a particular sector to troubleshoot or support particular technology needs in those organizations. Another term for these people is '''eRider'''.

In this context, a circuit rider is part trainer, part [[management consultant]], part [[computer]] expert. They provide consulting and assistance with technology strategy development, make multiple visits to the organizations they serve, and provide advice and information by phone and [[e-mail]]. They can serve regional constituencies by travel from a central location. Additionally, circuit riders can "cross-pollinate" the groups they service, transmitting insights, tools, and tips as they travel throughout the sector. In addition, training materials and resources can be used at multiple sites thereby spreading the development cost out across a number of organizations.

The umbrella term for this field is [[nonprofit technology]], and Circuit Riders are a form of [[NTAP|Nonprofit Technology Assistance Provider (NTAP)]]

== History ==
Modern technology circuit riding for nonprofits began in the U.S. in the mid-1990s when Gavin Clabaugh at the Telecommunications Cooperative Network approached the W. Alton Jones Foundation to get funding for technology services for a group of the foundation's grantees.  The making of a request directly from a service provider to a funding source (the foundation) to serve a group of grantees was a novel approach for technology provision in the nonprofit sector.  To differentiate the approach it was given the name ''circuit riding''&lt;ref&gt;Paul-Brian McInerney, ''Nonprofits and Technology:Emerging Research for Usable Knowledge'', editors Michael Cortes and Kevin M. Rafter, Lyceum Books, 2007.  pp 150 - 152.  {{ISBN|978-1-933478-06-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of Circuit Riders that eventually formed across the American nonprofit technology frontier was initiated by Rob Stuart while working at the Rockefeller Family Fund. [http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/remembering-rob-stuart-we-are-all-his-network Tribute to Rob Stuart]

'''Context-based learning''', CBL, refers to the use of real-life and fictitious examples in [[teaching]] environments in order to learn through the actual, practical experience with a subject rather than just its mere [[theory|theoretical]] parts. CBL is student centred approach to teaching and learning, utilising scenarios to replicate the social and political context of the students working/or potential working environment &lt;ref&gt;Trimmer, W. and Hawes, P. (2015). In Blessinger, P. and Carfora, J. Inquiry-based Learning for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Programs: A conceptual and practical resource  a for educators. United Kingdom: Emerald&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], CBL is often referred to as ''the Salters' approach''&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, B., Lazonby, J., Nicholson, P., Ramsden, J. and Waddington, D. (1994) Science: the Salters' Approach; a case study of the process of large-scale curriculum development, Science Education, 78 (5), 415-447, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; due to the efforts of the [[Salters' Company]] in creating teaching material in the field of [[chemistry]]. It can be generalized as: "The most important single factor influencing learning is the active engagement of the learner with the material. Obtain this - and teach by whatever methods retain this engagement.".&lt;ref&gt;Yam, H; Department of Physics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong; http://www.hk-phy.org/contextual/approach/tem/brief_e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contractor rating systems''', also known as contractor prequalifications, are one of the larger cost saving practices available and more routinely applied by governmental organizations as a means of avoiding the high cost and inflated pricing that results from reduced competition on public work by using [[surety bond|bonding]] and [[surety]] to guarantee performance of public work.

Years ago [[public purchasing officials]] began applying prequalification and short-listing of pre-selected contractors for bidding on public [[procurement]] contracts. A [[Subjectivity|subjective]] process are in many places the exclusive means of getting on a [[bidding|bidders]] list for public contract work.

These ratings and processes now make the whole issue of bonding and surety, (that has been around since the late 19th century to guarantee of performance and paying large [[insurance premium|premiums]]), obsolete and redundant since the public officials have already reduced risks and are paying premiums associated with reducing competition by using the prequalification process and rating systems.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Deadman Wonderland characters}}
A massive anomaly caused a great earthquake that ravaged [[Japan]]'s mainland and destroyed most of [[Tokyo]], sinking three-quarters of the city into the Pacific Ocean.

Ten years later, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. As an ''escapee'', a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life. This all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the "Red Man" massacres Ganta's entire class. Instead of killing him, the "Red Man" embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is subjected to a [[kangaroo court]] as a suspect and is sentenced to death at ''Deadman Wonderland'', a [[Private prison|prison]] that doubles as a theme park.

Arriving at the prison, Ganta is fitted with a special collar which monitors his location and vital signs. A lethal poison is constantly injected into his bloodstream through the collar, but it can be neutralized by consuming a peculiar candy-like medicine every three days, which can be acquired through various activities in the prison, e.g. performing for audiences, working backstage and purchasing with Cast Points (a form of currency among inmates at Deadman Wonderland). To gather Cast Points, an inmate must perform in the facility's lethal games and survive. Fortunately for Ganta, he is aided by a mysterious [[Albinism|albino]] girl named Shiro who apparently knows Ganta but whose existence is unknown to the other prisoners.

While trying to survive as an inmate on death row, Ganta intends to find the "Red Man" to clear his name. In a bizarre twist, Ganta begins to develop the ability to manipulate his own blood, to the point of turning it into a weapon. Unknown to Ganta, he has become one of the prison's "Deadmen," an isolated group of prisoners possessing the ''Branches of Sin'' which is an ability which makes them capable of controlling their blood for their own uses. After his ability is discovered, Ganta is forced to participate in brutal gladiatorial death matches known as Carnival Corpse, whose anonymous spectators pay large amounts of money to watch. In his long struggle to survive, he manages to befriend some of those he fought off in the arena and with their help, Ganta continues his quest to uncover the identity of the 'Red Man', why he turned into a Deadman, and the dark secrets the prison authorities are hiding.

===About Deadman Wonderland===
Deadman Wonderland is Japan's only privately operated prison, built after the Great Tokyo Earthquake on ground zero. Deadman Wonderland was founded by Rinichirō Hagire and run by Tsunenaga Tamaki. It gathers prisoners from all over Japan and raises money for the revival of the destroyed metropolis. To the public and the tourists that visit daily, Deadman Wonderland is a massive theme park-like facility run by the prison population. Unbeknownst to the general population, most of the prison's attractions involve cruel games of survival where many inmates lose their lives or are maimed for the entertainment of an oblivious public. The prison guards are also granted autonomy over how to punish the prisoners, which often results in bloodshed.

Each prisoner is fitted with a collar that functions as a life monitor, locator, and stunner. The prisoners on death row receive poison injections through their special collar and must consume a special antidote candy every three days. Their collars contain countdown timers that warn the wearer with blinking and beeping when time is running low. When the timer reaches zero, the collar displays the word "DEAD" and the inmate immediately succumbs to the poison and dies. Afterwards, the collar unlocks allowing it to be removed. The collars can also be removed by key cards used by the prison guards.

While the threat of violence is constant at the prison, most prisoners enjoy a great deal of liberty inside Deadman Wonderland. Utilizing Cast Points, the prison's unique form of currency, prisoners can purchase a wide variety of items from ordinary lunches, luxurious furniture for their rooms, and even years off of their sentences. Though Cast Points can't be used to buy the freedom of a Deadman. Those on death row also use Cast Points to purchase their life-saving candies.

Despite its identity as a prison and theme park, Deadman Wonderland houses a much darker secret. Hidden away from the eyes of tourists and the general prison population is a massive underground facility known as "G Block". This is where the prison keeps their Deadmen secluded and where the Carnival Corpse arena is located. G Block also houses numerous laboratories and rooms where experiments on humans are performed and where scientists are attempting to harness the powers of the Deadmen for monetary and political gain.

Eventually, Ganta and his Deadman allies received the assistance of Makina, the chief of the prison guards, to defeat Tsunenaga Tamaki. Rinichirō Hagire in Toto Sakagami's body assumed control of Deadman Wonderland while Tamaki committed suicide. After Deadman Wonderland was closed, the necklaces were removed from the inmates. Most of the remaining inmates were transferred to different prisons where some of them were allowed a retrial.

Makina later rallies the Deadmen on a mission to infiltrate Deadman Wonderland and activate the Mother Goose Program to completely seal the Wretched Egg (another name for the Red Man), with the resulting battle destroying most of Deadman Wonderland.

====Carnival Corpse====
Deadman Wonderland runs a secret [[gladiator]]-like game called the ''Carnival Corpse'' (also referred to as the ''Carnival of Corpses''), where wealthy anonymous donors pay to watch death-matches between the prison's Deadmen. The viewers of the Carnival Corpse also place their bets on who would win. Deadmen who are defeated yet survive the game have a part of their anatomy surgically removed for scientific research. In a cruel twist, the loser spins a [[bird]]-shaped [[macabre]] [[slot machine]] to determine which part of their body will be removed (with the show being broadcast live to the other prisoners) for research with the parts ranging from the right [[eye]] (which was removed from Senji), [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] (which were removed from Nagi), and the [[hair]], [[kidney]], and part of the [[stomach]] (which were removed from Minatsuki). The winner is awarded a large number of Cast Points, life-saving candies, and other [[prize]]s.

Being the only survivor out of the entire class, Ganta is charged with mass murder and, due to the overwhelming and doctored evidence against him with no way to prove his innocence, he is sentenced to death and sent to Deadman Wonderland's prison. As some of the higher ups plot to kill Ganta in an "accident", Ganta meets a strange white-haired girl named [[List of Deadman Wonderland characters#Shiro|Shiro]], who manages to read his heart and understand him. When a bunch of bullies start attacking Ganta and Shiro, an explosion causes a large object to fall towards Ganta. However, Ganta's desire to keep living so he can kill the Red Man activates the powers that were implanted in him, allowing him to control his blood to save himself as well as Shiro.

A '''doppelgänger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|əl|ɡ|ɛ|ŋ|əɹ|,_|-|g|æ|ŋ|əɹ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔpl̩ˌɡɛŋɐ|lang|De-doppelgaenger.ogg}}, literally "double-goer") is a non-biologically related [[look-alike]] or double of a living person, sometimes portrayed as a ghostly or [[paranormal]] phenomenon and usually seen as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an [[evil twin]]. In modern times, the term '''twin stranger''' is occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|title=See what happened when 3 friends set out to find their ‘twin stranger’|last=Murray|first=Rheana|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906134813/https://www.today.com/news/friends-compete-find-their-twin-stranger-social-media-t15506|archivedate=2017-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3994274/Identical-strangers-brought-Finding-Twin-Stranger.html|title=Identical strangers are brought together|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20161202192206/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article%2D3994274/Identical%2Dstrangers%2Dbrought%2DFinding%2DTwin%2DStranger.html|archivedate=2016-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "doppelgänger" is often used in a more general and neutral sense, and in slang, to describe any person who physically or behaviorally resembles another person.

==Spelling==
The word ''doppelgänger'' is a [[loanword]] from the German ''Doppelgänger'', a compound noun formed by combining the two nouns ''Doppel'' (double) and ''Gänger'' (walker or goer).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary'', 2nd Edition, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger Doppelgänger; Orthography, Meaning Synonyms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120074951/http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Doppelgaenger |date=2012-11-20 }} http://www.duden.de {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AeW56Irr?url=http://www.duden.de/ |date=2012-09-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English usually prefers the plural "doppelgängers". The first known use, in the slightly different form ''Doppeltgänger'', occurs in the novel ''[[Siebenkäs]]'' (1796) by [[Jean Paul]], in which he explains his [[neologism|newly coined word]] by a [[footnote]] – while actually the word ''Doppelgänger'' also appears, but with a quite different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pleasures of Abandonment: Jean Paul and the Life of Humor |author=Paul Fleming |publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-8260-3247-9 |page=126, footnote 13 |quote=In one of the stranger twists of fate in literary history, Jean Paul coins two terms in ''Siebenkäs'', "Doppelgänger" and "Doppeltgänger." The term Jean Paul uses to describe Siebenkäs and Leibgeber is "Doppeltgänger," which he defines in a footnote: "So heißen Leute, die sich selber sehen" ["the name for people who see themselves"] (2, 67). Earlier in ''Siebenkäs'' the neologism "Doppelgänger" also appears for the first time and means something quite different. In a description of the wedding banquet in the first chapter, the food is so delicious and abundant that "not only was one course [''Gang''] served but also a second, a {{italics correction|''Doppelgänger''}}" ["nicht bloß ''ein'' Gang aufgetragen wurde, sondern ein zweiter, ein Doppelgänger"] (2, 42). "Gang" in German has multiple meanings, ranging from a "walk" to the "course" of a meal; according to Jean Paul, when people "see themselves," when one "goes twice," one is a "Doppeltgänger"; when one has a meal of two courses, in which the second doesn't come second but together with the first, this is a "Doppelgänger."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all [[noun]]s in German, the word is written with an initial [[capital letter]]. ''Doppelgänger'' and ''Doppelgaenger'' are essentially equivalent spellings, and ''Doppelganger'' is different and would correspond to a different pronunciation. In English, the word should be written with a lower-case letter (doppelgänger) unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a title. It is further common to drop the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|umlaut]] on the letter "a", writing (and often pronouncing) "doppelganger".

==Mythology==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. [[Francis Grose]]'s, ''Provincial Glossary'' of 1787 used the term ''[[fetch (folklore)|fetch]]'' instead, defined as the "apparition of a person living." [[Catherine Crowe]]'s book on paranormal phenomena, ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848) helped make the German word well-known. However, the concept of [[alter ego]]s and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts, and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Zusne, Warren H. Jones (1989). ''Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-805-80507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Egyptian mythology]], a ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' was a tangible "spirit double" having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. ''The Greek Princess'' presents an Egyptian view of the [[Trojan War]] in which a ''ka'' of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] misleads Paris, helping to stop the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. This is depicted in [[Euripides]]' play [[Helen (play)|''Helen'']]. In [[Norse mythology]], a ''[[vardøger]]'' is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person's actions in advance. In [[Finnish mythology]], this is called having an ''[[etiäinen]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ganander, Christfrid.

==Examples==



[[Izaak Walton]] claimed that English [[metaphysical poet]] [[John Donne]] saw his wife's doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Izaak. ''Life of Dr. John Donne.'' Fourth edition, 1675. Cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt;

German playwright [[Goethe]] described an experience in his autobiography ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' in which he and his double passed one another on horseback.&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Wolfgang von Goethe.'' Translated by John Oxenford. Horizon Press, 1969. This example cited by Crowe in ''The Night-Side of Nature'' (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s drama ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' makes reference to a dead child who "met his own image walking in the garden".&lt;ref&gt;''Prometheus Unbound'', lines 191-199&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lord Byron]] uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.&lt;ref name="Burwick2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Burwick|title=Playing to the Crowd: London Popular Theatre, 1780-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=8 November 2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-37065-4|pages=83–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[The Devil's Elixir]] (1815), a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, E. T. A., ''The Devil's Elixers (English Translation)''. London, T. Cadell, Publishers, 1829; url=https://archive.org/details/devilselixirfrom01hoffuoft/page/n3&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s early novels.

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' (1846) presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. [[Charles Williams (British writer)|Charles Williams']] ''[[Descent into Hell (novel)|Descent into Hell]]'' (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Williams, ''Descent into Hell'', Faber and Faber&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clive Barker]]'s story "Human Remains" in his ''[[Books of Blood]]'' is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of [[Gothic fiction]].

With the advent of [[social media]], there have been several reported cases of people finding their "twin stranger" online, a modern term for a doppelgänger.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/473004/Twin-strangers-meet-plane-men-ginger-beards|title=Man sits next to stranger who looks EXACTLY like him on plane|last=Mitchell|first=Laura|date=2017-05-18|work=Dailystar.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/twin-strangers-the-website-can-find-your-doppelganger-but-you-may-not-be-pleased-with-your-matches-a6714141.html|title=Twin Strangers: The new website can find your doppelganger - but you may not be pleased with your matches|last=Alderson|first=Maggie|date=2015-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513090415/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/twin-strangers-the-website-can-find-your-doppelganger-but-you-may-not-be-pleased-with-your-matches-a6714141.html|archive-date=2017-05-13|dead-url=no|language=en-GB|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twinstrangers.net is a website where users can upload a photo of themselves and [[facial recognition software]] attempts to match them with another user of like appearance.

==Scientific applications==

[[Heautoscopy]] is a [[glossary of psychiatry|term used in psychiatry]] and neurology for the [[hallucination]] of "seeing one's own body at a distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Damas Mora JM, Jenner FA, Eacott SE | title=On heautoscopy or the phenomenon of the double: Case presentation and review of the literature| journal=Br J Med Psychol | year=1980 | volume=53 | pages= 75–83 | pmid=6989391 | issue=1 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.1980.tb02871.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur as a symptom in [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/JNMD86.htm |author=Blackmore S |title=Out-of-Body Experiences in Schizophrenia: A Questionnaire Survey |journal=[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]] |year=1986 |volume=174 |pages=615–619 |doi=10.1097/00005053-198610000-00006 |pmid=3760852 |issue=10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503013427/http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/Articles/JNMD86.htm |archivedate=2014-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[epilepsy]], and is considered a possible explanation for doppelgänger phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, P; Agosti, R; Regard, M; Wieser, H.

Criminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on [[eyewitness testimony]]. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Emily O'Hara.

'''E-society''' is a society that consists of one or more [[E-community|e-Communities]] involved in the areas ''from [[e-Government]], [[E-democracy|e-Democracy]], and  [[Electronic business|e-Business]] to [[E-learning|e-Learning]] and [[eHealth|e-Health]]'',&lt;ref name="multiple" /&gt;    that use information and communication technologies ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]]) in order to achieve a common interests and goals. The first areas of e-society that emerged were [[E-learning|e-Learning]] and [[Electronic business|e-Business]].

The development of e-Society is relying and depending on the development of [[virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] technologies that insure interaction between participants of an e-Society in a more acceptable and tangible way. The development of [[virtual reality|(VR)]] and consequently the e-Society is based on improvement and balancing of participants’ interaction methods, hardware necessary for such interaction, content presentation and effort required for development and maintenance.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Magoulas, G., Lepouras, G., Vassilakis, C., “Virtual reality in the e-Society”, Springer London, 2007, {{ISSN|1359-4338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">The '''enactment effect''', also called self-performed task effect (SPT effect) &lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, RL (1981) "On the generality of some memory laws". ''Scandinavian Journal of Psychology'', 22:267-281.&lt;/ref&gt; is a term that was created in the early 80's to describe the fact that [[verb phrase]]s are memorized better if a learner performs the described action during learning, compared to just getting the verbal information or seeing someone else perform the action.&lt;ref name="Engelkamp"&gt;Engelkamp, Johannes &amp; Krumnacker, Horst (1980). „Imaginale und motorische Prozesse beim Behalten verbalen Materials". ''Zeitschrift für experimentelle und angewandte Psychologie'' 27: 511-533.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[gesture]]s improves the quantity of phrases that can be recalled, the phrases can be recalled for a longer amount of time, and they can be accessed easier. Knowing that enacting improves memory performance can be useful in education and treatment of patients with [[memory disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Macedonia2012"&gt;Macedonia, Manuela &amp; von Kriegstein, Katharina (2012) . „Gestures Enhance Foreign Language Learning”. Biolinguistics 6(3-4): 393-416.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Studies showing the enactment effect==
In their study, Engelkamp and Krumnacker (1980) gave participants verbal phrases like “brush the teeth” or "shuffle the cards". In a [[Recognition memory|recognition task]] and a [[free recall]] task, the memory of participants was tested under four learning conditions: one group performed the action, a second group was supposed to imagine the action, the third group watched someone perform the action, and the last group just heard the phrases. The group that had enacted the gestures performed best in both tasks.&lt;ref name="Engelkamp"/&gt;
Around the same time, Cohen examined recall capacity of verbal phrases in participants under three conditions: one group performed the action on a concrete object, a second group saw the experimenter perform the action on an object, and a third group only got verbal instructions. The self-performed task led to the best results, supporting the claim that the enactment effect exists.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;
Since then, the effect has been reduplicated in many studies.&amp;nbsp; Recall after enactment tasks was shown to be superior to recall after verbal tasks in children as well as in adults.&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Eli &amp; Sizanne Donnenwerth-Nolan (1981) "Does Motoric Imagery Facilitate Memory for Sentences? A Selective Interference Test". ''JOURNAL OF VERBAL LEARNING AND VERBAL BEHAVIOR'' 20:322-332.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the enactment effect is existent in elderly people and people with moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, S., Sheppard, L., Rusted, J.M., &amp; H.H., Ratner(1996) "Structuring and Retrieval Environment to Facilitate Learning in Individuals with Dementia of the Alzheimer Type". ''MEMORY'' 4(2):113-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enactment effect in [[Second Language Acquisition|second language acquisition]]==
Gestures have been shown to be a useful tool in teaching a foreign language. The enactment effect can be used in second language teaching&amp;nbsp;in order to learn a language more efficiently, faster, and to prevent forgetting. Various studies have shown that the use of gestures while learning new words improves [[Recall (memory)|recall and retention]].&lt;ref name="Macedonia2012"/&gt; The enactment effect in second language learning could be shown in children as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Tellier, M. (2008) "The effect of gestures on second language memorization by young children". ''Gesture'' 8(2):219-235&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"&gt;Macedonia, Manuela &amp; Thomas R. Knösche (2011) "Body in Mind: How Gestures Empower Foreign Language Learning". ''Mind, Brain, and Education'' 5:4, 196-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinn-Allen, Linda (1995) "The effects of emblematic gestures on the development and access of mental representations of French expressions". ''The Modern Language Journal'' 79:521-529.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does enactment improve memorization, but also the use of words in speech production.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt; Using gestures while learning is helpful in learning concrete words as well as abstract words such as “change” or “difference”. Studies supported this claim in showing that abstract words were better remembered when a gesture was used while encoding.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt;

==[[Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistical]] research on the enactment effect==
In more recent studies, researchers have been trying to find the neurological explanation of the enactment effect, and the reason why memory is enhanced after enactment. It was shown that not mere physical motor information leads to the enactment effect, but that the [[Semantics|semantic]] content of the gesture plays a role as well.&lt;ref&gt;Masumoto, K., Yamaguchi, M., Sutani, K., Tsuneto, S., Fujita, A., &amp; M., Tonoike(2006) "Reactivation of physical motor information in the memory of action events". ''Brain Research'' 1101:102-109.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://multimodalityglossary.wordpress.com/gesture/ Iconic gestures] enhance memory compared to meaningless gestures which have no positive effect on memorization.&lt;ref name="MacedoniaKnösche"/&gt; [[Event-related potential]]s showed that enactment leads to deeper processing of new information, eliciting the assumption that by using gestures, the meaning of the new word is connected with an already existing concept in one’s native language.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Spencer D., Tara McDevitt, &amp; Megan Esch (2009) "Brief training with co-speech gesture lends a hand to word learning in a foreign language". ''Language and Cognitive Processes'', 24:313-334.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Merrill]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Emeritus]] at [[Utah State University]], is an [[instructional theory]] based on a broad review of many instructional models and theories.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2002). First principles of instruction. Educational Technology Research and Development, 50(3), 43-59. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/firstprinciplesbymerrill.pdf (Click for copy from Dr. Merrill's personal website)]
&lt;/ref&gt; First Principles of Instruction are created with the goal of establishing a set of principles upon which all instructional theories and models are in general agreement, and several authors acknowledge the fundamental nature of these principles.&lt;ref&gt;Instructional-Design Theories and Models, Volume III: Building a Common Knowledge Base [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780805864564/ (link to book site)]&lt;/ref&gt; These principles can be used to assist teachers, trainers and instructional designers in developing research-based [[instructional materials]] in a manner that is likely to produce positive student learning gains.

==The Principles==
First Principles of Instruction are described as a set of interrelated principles which, when properly applied in an instructional product or setting, will increase student learning. These principles include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2009). First Principles of Instruction. In C. M. Reigeluth &amp; A. Carr (Eds.), Instructional Design Theories and Models: Building a Common Knowledge Base (Vol. III). New York: Routledge Publishers. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesReigeluthCarr.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, M. D. (2007). First principles of instruction: a synthesis. In R. A. Reiser &amp; J. V. Dempsey (Eds.), Trends and Issues in Instructional Design and Technology, 2nd Edition (Vol. 2, pp. 62-71). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill/Prentice Hall. [http://www.mdavidmerrill.com/Papers/FirstPrinciplesSynthesis.pdf (Click for copy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Task/Problem-Centered''' – Students learn more when the instruction is centered on relevant real-world tasks or problems, including a series of tasks or problems that progress from simple to complex.
* '''Activation''' – Students learn more when they are directed to recall prior knowledge, to recall a structure for organizing that knowledge, or are given a structure for organizing new knowledge. This activation can also include a foundational learning experience upon which new learning can be based.
* '''Demonstration''' – Students learn more when new knowledge is demonstrated to them in the context of real-world tasks or problems. The knowledge that is demonstrated is both informational and skill-based. Demonstration is enhanced when it adheres to research-based principles of e-learning.
* '''Application''' – Students learn more when they perform real-world tasks or solve real-world problems and receive feedback and appropriate guidance during that application.
* '''Integration''' – Students learn more when they are encouraged to integrate their new knowledge into their life through reflection, discussion, debate, and/or presentation of new knowledge.

These principles can be used in a Task or Problem-Centered cycle of instruction beginning with Activation and continuing through Demonstration, Application, and Integration.

First Principles of Instruction is similar to other task-centered instructional theories (e.g. Van Merriënboer’s Four Component Instructional Design Model&lt;ref&gt;van Merriënboer, J. J. G., Clark, R. E., and de Croock, M. B. M. (2002a). Blueprints for complex
learning: The 4C/ID-model. Educ. Technol., Res. Dev. 50(2): 39–64.&lt;/ref&gt;) in that it uses a real-world problem or task as a vehicle for instruction. Students view demonstrations of real-world problem solving examples, are given opportunities to solve real-world problems and are given feedback on their application. Students are taught new knowledge and information within the context of the real-world task or problem, which provides a context in which the knowledge is obtained. First Principles is different than problem-based-learning, however, in that it provides more guidance and demonstration to students which is reduced as students gain expertise.

==Research support==
There is a growing body of research support for Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. In one study, researchers surveyed 140 students at 89 different higher education institutions and discovered that students were 9 times more likely to report that they had mastered learning the course objectives when First Principles of Instruction were used and when they spent ample time and effort studying.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, T., Chadha, R., Watson, C., Wang, Y., &amp; Green, P. (2007). Theory-based course evaluation: Nine Scales for measuring teaching and learning quality. Retrieved from http://www.indiana.edu/~tedfrick/TALQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another study observed award-winning instructors at an institute of higher education and found that they used some or all of First Principles of Instruction in their teaching strategies, thereby linking acclaimed instructors with the principles.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, J., (2011). How Award-winning Professors in Higher Education Use Merrill's First Principles of Instruction. International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 8(5), p. 3-16).[http://www.itdl.org/Journal/May_11/May_11.pdf (link to article)]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, researchers compared the effectiveness of instruction using First Principles of Instruction with more traditional instruction and found that students in the First Principles group learned significantly more and finished learning tasks significantly faster.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson. (2002). Thomson job impact study: The next generation of learning [electronic version]. Retrieved from http://www.delmarlearning.com/resources/job_impact_study_whitepaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that biology students learning from instruction using First Principles of Instruction had significantly increased confidence in their ability to solve similar problems in the future, compared to other learners.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Joel.

A '''funeral''' is a [[ceremony]] connected with the [[burial]], [[cremation]], or interment of a corpse, or the burial (or equivalent) with the attendant observances.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|funeral}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a [[culture]] to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various [[monument]]s, [[prayer]]s, and [[ritual]]s undertaken in their honor. Customs vary between cultures and [[Religion|religious]] groups. Common secular motivations for funerals include [[mourning]] the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the [[soul]] of the deceased reach the [[afterlife]], [[resurrection]] or [[reincarnation]].

The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the [[corpse]] receives a final dispositon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by [[cremation]] or [[sky burial]]) or its preservation (for example, by [[mummification]] or [[burial|interment]]). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and [[Mind–body problem|the relationship between body and soul]] are reflected in funerary practices. A '''memorial service''' or '''celebration of life''' is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person.&lt;ref name="celebrationoflife"&gt;{{cite web|title=The difference between funerals and celebrations of life - funerals often include flowers such as VineLily Moments or VineLily see www.vinelily.com. Funeral Costs Help|url=http://funeralcostshelp.co.uk/difference-funerals-celebrations-life/|website=Funeral Costs Help|date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''funeral'' comes from the Latin ''funus'', which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. [[Funerary art]] is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of [[tomb]]s, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a [[corpse]].

==Religious funerals==

===Bahá'í===
Funerals in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are characterized by not embalming, a prohibition against cremation, using a chrysolite or hardwood casket, wrapping the body in silk or cotton, burial not farther than an hour (including flights) from the place of death, and placing a ring on the deceased's finger stating, "I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate." The Bahá'í funeral service also contains the only prayer that's permitted to be read as a group - congregational prayer, although most of the prayer is read by one person in the gathering. The Bahá'í decedent often controls some aspects of the Bahá'í funeral service, since leaving a will and testament is a requirement for Bahá'ís. Since there is no Bahá'í clergy, services are usually conducted under the guise, or with the assistance of, a Local [[Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist===
{{main article|Funeral (Buddhism)}}
A Buddhist funeral marks  the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality.

===Christian===

{{main article|Christian burial|Cremation in the Christian World}}
Christian burials typically occur on [[Consecration|consecrated]] ground. Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The [[US Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said "The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine" (canon 1176.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/bereavement-and-funerals/|title =Bereavement and Funerals|website=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|date = |accessdate = 7 September 2015|series= Bereavement and Funerals|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congregations of varied denominations perform different ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, a sermon, homily, or eulogy, and music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accompany Them with Singing: The Christian Funeral|last = Long|first = Thomas G.|publisher = Westminster John Knox Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780664233198|location = Louisville, KY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/bereavement-and-funerals/music-at-funerals.cfm|title=Bereavement and Funerals - Music at funerals|website=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|date=|accessdate = 7 September 2015|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
{{main article|Antyesti}}
[[Antyesti]], literally "last rites or last sacrifice", refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=funeral+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Antayesti] Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as ''Antima Samskaram'', ''Antya-kriya'', ''Anvarohanyya'', or ''Vahni Sanskara''.

A dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt;&lt;ref name=fowler&gt;J Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723608}}, pages 59-60&lt;/ref&gt; The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.&lt;ref name=terje&gt;Terje Oestigaard, in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial (Editors: Sarah Tarlow, Liv Nilsson Stut), Oxford University Press, ISBN , pages 497-501&lt;/ref&gt; The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the ''Antyeshti'' ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space.&lt;ref name=terje/&gt; The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.&lt;ref name=olsonant&gt;Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terje/&gt; The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of [[Rigveda]] in section 10.16, as follows,

[[File:Bagamati cremation.jpg|thumb|A Hindu cremation rite in [[Nepal]]. The samskara above shows the body wrapped in saffron red on a pyre.]]
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni: let not his body or his skin be scattered,
O all possessing Fire, when thou hast matured him, then send him on his way unto the Fathers.
When thou hast made him ready, all possessing Fire, then do thou give him over to the Fathers,
When he attains unto the life that waits him, he shall become subject to the will of gods.
The Sun receive thine eye, the Wind thy ''Prana'' (life-principle, breathe); go, as thy merit is, to earth or heaven.
Go, if it be thy lot, unto the waters; go, make thine home in plants with all thy members.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Rigveda 10.16&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१६ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.१६] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitc06wils#page/38/mode/2up Sukta XVI - Rigveda], English Translation: HH Wilson (Translator), pages 39-40;&lt;br&gt;Wendy Doniger (1981), The Rig Veda, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0140449891}}, see chapter on Death&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rig Veda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to "neither harm our girls nor our boys", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitc06wils#page/46/mode/2up Sukta XVIII - Rigveda], English Translation: HH Wilson (Translator), pages 46-49 with footnotes;&lt;br&gt;Wendy Doniger (1981), The Rig Veda, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0140449891}}, see chapter on Death&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman,&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; the two toes tied together with a string, a ''Tilak'' (red mark) placed on the forehead.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt; The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south.&lt;ref name=fowler/&gt; The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt;&lt;ref name=carrie&gt;Carrie Mercier (1998), Hinduism for Today, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199172542}}, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying ''Yama'' (deity of the dead), ''Kala'' (time, deity of cremation) and the dead.&lt;ref name=olsonant/&gt; The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea.&lt;ref name=carrie/&gt; After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased. This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Parkes et al (2015), Death and Bereavement Across Cultures, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415522366}}, page 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic===
{{main article|Islamic funeral}}
[[File:Algeria 1779 Antique Hand Col Print. Algerine Funeral.jpg|thumb|1779 [[Algeria]]n [[Salat al-Janazah|funerals]]]]
'''Funerals in [[Islam]]''' (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific [[rite]]s. In all cases, however, [[sharia]] (Islamic [[religious law]]) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by [[salat]] (prayer).

Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body with water, [[camphor]] and leaves of [[ziziphus lotus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih al-Bukhari]] 1254&lt;/ref&gt; except in extraordinary circumstances as in the Battle.&lt;ref&gt;Sahih al-Bukhari 1346&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shroud|Enshrouding]] the dead body in a white cotton or linen cloth except extraordinary cases such as battle. In such cases apparel of corpse is not changed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sahih Muslim]] 943&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reciting the [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral prayer]] in all cases for a Muslim.
* Burial of the dead body in a grave in all cases for a Muslim.
* Positioning the deceased so that when the face or body is turned to the right side it faces [[Mecca]].

The mourning period is 40 days long.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/04/food-in-a-time-of-mourning-can-celebrate-life-and-death.html|title=How Do People Decide Which Snacks Belong at a Funeral?|last=Price|first=Dawnthea|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish===
{{main article|Bereavement in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Funerals in Judaism share many features with those of Islam. Jewish religious law (''[[Halakha]])'' calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the [[Hebrew Bible]], and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave.  Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Funeral Traditions|url=https://www.everplans.com/tools-and-resources/jewish-funeral-traditions|publisher=Everplans|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reformjudaism.org/practice/ask-rabbi/what-reform-judaisms-position-cremation|title=What is Reform Judaism's position on cremation?|date=2013-07-16|work=ReformJudaism.org|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include:
* Bathing the dead body.
* Enshrouding the dead body. Men are shrouded with a ''[[kittel]]'' and then (outside the [[Land of Israel]]) with a ''[[tallit]]'' (shawl), while women are shrouded in a plain white cloth.
* Keeping watch over the dead body.
* Funeral service, including eulogies and brief prayers.
* Burial of the dead body in a grave.&lt;ref name=Jewish /&gt;
* Filling of the grave, traditionally done by family members and other participants at the funeral.
* In many communities, the deceased is positioned so that the feet face the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] (in anticipation that the deceased will be facing the reconstructed [[Third Temple]] when the [[messiah]] arrives and [[resurrection of the dead|resurrects the dead]]).&lt;ref name=davidson&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Bodies Buried in a Specific Direction?|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1672031/jewish/Are-Bodies-Buried-in-a-Specific-Direction.htm|accessdate=November 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikh===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In Sikhism death is not considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam.{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part of the cycle of human life of "coming and going" ( ਆਵਣੁ ਜਾਣਾ, Aana Jaana) which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ਮੋਖੁ ਦੁਆਰੁ, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God; Sikhs believe in reincarnation.

The soul itself is not subject to the cycle of birth and death;{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.

The public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called Antam Sanskar  in the Sikh culture) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if this is not possible other methods such as burial, or burial at sea, are acceptable. Markers such as gravestones, monuments,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} etc. are discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell and the person's soul is their real essence.

On the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite "Waheguru" sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site.

At the point of cremation, a few more Shabads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes.

The ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in the Punjab (five famous rivers in India).

The Sidaran Paath
The ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Guru Granth Sahib is present:

{{Main article|Ancient Greek funerals and burial}}
The Greek word for funeral – ''kēdeía'' (κηδεία) – derives from the verb ''kēdomai'' (κήδομαι), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also ''kēdemón'' (κηδεμών, "guardian") and ''kēdemonía'' (κηδεμονία, "guardianship"). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000BC until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 BC the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BC constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.&lt;ref&gt;Lemos 2002: Lemos I., The Protogeometric Aegean. The Archaeology of the Late Eleventh and Tenth Centuries BC, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek funeral since the [[Homer]]ic era included the ''próthesis'' (πρόθεσις), the ''ekphorá'' (ἐκφορά), the burial and the ''perídeipnon'' (περίδειπνον). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic|title=IMS-FORTH: About IMS|website=www.ims.forth.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Próthesis'' is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funereal bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the ''epicedium'', the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.

''Ekphorá'' is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to "go along with him." In certain regions, [[Charon's obol|coins to pay Charon]], who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed.

[[File:2011 Enterrement de Jacquotte.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral with [[flowers]] on [[marble]]]]
The Roman orator [[Cicero]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the ''perídeipnon'', the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings–traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins–the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ανώνυμος Πιστός και Απολογητής του Χριστού |url=http://www.apologitis.com/gr/ancient/tafi_ethima.htm |title=Apologitis.com |publisher=Apologitis.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the burial, a ceremony called "the thirds" was held. Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where "the ninths" would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.{{Clarify|date=June 2016|reason=this section is about ancient Greece.

====Ancient Rome====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Sepolcro degli Scipioni 001 Entrata.jpg|thumb|Tomb of the [[Cornelia (gens)#Cornelii Scipiones|Scipios]], in use from the 3rd century BC to the 1st century AD]]
{{Main article|Roman funerals and burial}}
In [[ancient Rome]], the eldest surviving male of the household, the ''pater familias'', was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent.

Funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called ''libitinarii''. No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held ''curule magistracies''. Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (''collegia funeraticia'') that undertook these rites on their behalf.

Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a [[Banquet|feast]] was given (''cena novendialis'') and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a ''columbarium'' (literally, "dovecote"). During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, ''funesta'', and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death.

Several Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the ''Parentalia'', held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the [[Lemuralia|Feast of the Lemures]], held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which [[ghost]]s (''larvae'') were feared to be active, and the ''pater familias'' sought to appease them with offerings of beans.

The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city ''([[pomerium]])'', for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.

Restrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes.

The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of [[marble]], the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called [[hypogea]]. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called [[Columbarium|columbaria]].

===North American funerals===
[[Image:funeral.name.tribute.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A floral name tribute (spelling out the word "Mum") at a funeral in England.]]
Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts:
visitation, funeral, and the burial service.
[[File:South Korea funeral motorcade.jpg|thumb|A western-style funeral motorcade for a member of a high-ranking military family in [[South Korea]].]]

====Visitation====&lt;!-- This section is linked from Coffin --&gt;
At the ''visitation'' (also called a "[[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]]", "[[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]" or "calling hours"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent’s home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in – some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial.

The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show "happy times"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation.

The viewing is either "open casket", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or "closed casket", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket.

[[File:Tombstone of Yossele the Holy Miser.jpg|thumb|left|The tombstone of [[Yossele the Holy Miser]]. According to [[Jewish bereavement]] tradition, the dozens of stones on his tombstone mark respect for the Holy Miser.]]
However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282548/jewish/The-Basics.htm |title=Torah law forbids embalming |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost.  The Jewish [[Shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (''See also [[Jewish bereavement]].'')

The decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whichfuneralplans.com/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/Jewish_Funeral_and_Mourning_Customs.pdf|title=Jewish Funeral and Mourning Customs|website=whichfuneralplans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead).

[[Obituary|Obituaries]] sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers (e.g. "In lieu of flowers"). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2.2% of those mentioned [[charitable organization|charitable contributions]] instead. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 14.5%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;A Centennial History of the AMERICAN FLORIST, a publication of Florists’ Review Enterprises, Inc., Frances Porterfield Dudley, Publisher, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, well over 87% of them have such a note – but those statistics vary demographically.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The viewing typically takes place at a [[funeral home]], which is equipped with gathering rooms where the viewing can be conducted, although the viewing may also take place at a church. The viewing may end with a prayer service; in a Roman Catholic funeral, this may include a rosary.

A visitation is often held the evening before the day of the funeral. However, when the deceased person is elderly the visitation may be held immediately preceding the funeral. This allows elderly friends of the deceased a chance to view the body and attend the funeral in one trip, since it may be difficult for them to arrange travel; this step may also be taken if the deceased has few survivors or the survivors want a funeral with only a small number of guests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====Funeral====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Flower-arrangement-funeral-white.jpg|thumb|Traditional flower arrangement for funeral ([[Denmark]])]]
A memorial service, often called a funeral, is often officiated by clergy from the decedent's, or bereaved's, church or religion. A funeral may take place at either a funeral home, church, or crematorium or cemetery chapel. A funeral is held according to the family's choosing, which may be a few days after the time of death, allowing family members to attend the service. This type of memorial service is most common for Christians, and Roman Catholics call it a mass when Eucharist (communion) is offered, the casket is closed and a priest says prayers and blessings. A Roman Catholic funeral must take place in a parish church (usually that of the deceased, or that of the family grave, or a parish to which the deceased had special links). Sometimes family members or friends of the dead will say something. If the funeral service takes place in the funeral home (mostly it takes place in the funeral home's chapel) it can be directed by a clergy (mostly for Protestant churches and sometimes for Catholic churches) or hosted by a very close family member most common a parent. In some traditions if this service takes place in a funeral home it is the same if it would take place in a church. These services if taking place in a funeral home consists of prayers, blessings and eulogies from the family.

The ''open-casket service'' (which is common in North America) allows mourners to have a final opportunity to view the deceased and say good-bye. There is an order of precedence when approaching the casket at this stage that usually starts with the immediate family (siblings, parents, spouse, children); followed by other mourners, after which the immediate family may file past again, so they are the last to view their loved one before the coffin is closed. This opportunity can take place immediately before the service begins, or at the very end of the service.&lt;ref&gt;Iserson 1994: 445.&lt;/ref&gt; A Roman Catholic funeral must be closed-casket, and relatives are expected to attend the few days before the service. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Open casket funerals and visitations are very rare in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and most European countries, where it is usual for only close relatives to actually see the deceased person and not uncommon for no one to do so. The funeral service itself is almost invariably closed casket. Funeral homes are generally not used for funeral services, which are almost exclusively held in a church, cemetery, or crematorium chapel.

The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cortège), with the [[hearse]], funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions – such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.34. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium.

[[File:Beethoven Funerals.jpg|thumb|[[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s funeral as depicted by [[Franz Xaver Stöber]].]]
Religious funeral services commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung either by the attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of comfort by the clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend will be asked to give a [[eulogy]], which details happy memories and accomplishments rather than criticism. Sometimes the eulogy is delivered by clergy. Church bells may also be tolled both before and after the service.

In some religious denominations, for example, Roman Catholic, and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], eulogies from loved ones are somewhat discouraged during this service. In such cases, the eulogy is only done by a member of the clergy. This tradition is giving way to eulogies read by family members or friends. In these religions the coffin is traditionally closed at the end of the wake and is not re-opened for the funeral service.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

During the funeral and at the burial service, the casket may be covered with a large arrangement of flowers, called a casket spray. If the deceased served in a branch of the armed forces, the casket may be covered with a national flag; however, in the US, nothing should cover the national flag according to Title 4, United States Code, Chapter 1, Paragraph 8i. If the funeral service is held in a church, the casket is normally covered in a white pall, which recalls the white garments of baptism.

Funeral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful. A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.funeralwise.com/customs/firefighter/definitions/|title=Firefighter Funeral Terms|work=Funeralwise|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firefighter(s) travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a "Last Alarm Bell" is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony.

====Burial service====
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Millais - Das Tal der Stille.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]] – The Vale of Rest]]

At a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, [[tomb]], [[mausoleum]] or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion.

Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a [[funeral procession]] travels from the site of the memorial service to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter.

If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, [[military rites]] are often accorded at the burial service.

In many religious traditions, [[pallbearer]]s, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service. The pallbearers often sit in a special reserved section during the memorial service.

Most religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it.

[[File:Medieval Royal Funeral007.jpg|thumb|[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] depiction of a royal body being laid in a coffin.]]
Morticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased.

In the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation – if left in they could explode.

===Private services===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
The family of the deceased may wish to have only a very small, private service, with just the deceased's closest family members and friends attending. This type of ceremony  is not open to the public, but only to those invited.

===Memorial services===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[Image:BrochureMemorialSvcWilliamMcKinleyInsidePagesNashuaNH09191901.jpg|thumb|Order of exercises, local memorial service in Nashua, New Hampshire for U.S. President [[William McKinley]] on September 19, 1901, shortly after his assassination.]]

A memorial service, or a commemoration is one given for the deceased when the body is not present. The service takes place ''after'' cremation or [[burial at sea]], after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, or after the ashes have been scattered. It is also significant when the person is [[Declared death in absentia|missing and presumed dead]], or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home; however, they can be held in a home, school, workplace, church or other location of some significance. A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed.

After the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the [[assassination of James A. Garfield|assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield]] and [[assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley]].

===European funerals===

====In Wales====
A good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/9c24f1e1-d62c-3e28-a1db-7664cad06183|title=A good Welsh funeral|date=28 October 2010|website=BBC Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first child of [[William Price (physician)|William Price]], a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Neo-Druidism|Neo-Druidic]] priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] societies. 
The police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/15/1032054710047.html?oneclick=true| title = Druid doc with a bee in his bonnet | accessdate = 2007-02-03 | first = Tim | last = Harris | work = theage.com.au | date = 2002-09-16 | location= Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal.

====In Finland====
In Finland, religious funerals (hautajaiset) are quite ascetic. The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house.  The mourners (saattoväki) traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Nowadays the deceased is put into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (siunaustilaisuus) in a cemetery chapel or local church, than the burial.

====In Poland====
{{see also|Catholic funeral|}}
In Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one “stop”. The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel,Then there is a funeral mass or service at cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) on a hearse to the grave. Once at the gravesite, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery.

In some traditional rural areas, the wake (''czuwanie'') takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house.The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (''ceremonia pogrzebowa'', ''pogrzeb''): the wake (''czuwanie''), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite.

After the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (''stypa''). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland doesn't allow it. Cremation is popular among non-religious and Protestants in Poland.

====In Russia====
{{further|Russian traditions and superstitions|}}

====In Scotland====
An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as "earth laid upon a corpse". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bmpMAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262 "Salt"], IN: ''The Table Book of Daily Recreation and Information; Concerning Remarkable Men, Manners, Times, Seasons, Solemnities, Merry-Makings, Antiquities and Novelties, Forming a Complete History of the Year'', ed.

====In Spain====
In Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the [[funeral mass]] (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse.

===Jazz funeral===
{{main|Jazz funeral}}
Originating in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], U.S., alongside the emergence of [[jazz music]] in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the "main line", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow [[dirge]]s and [[Christian hymn]]s. After the body is buried, or "cut loose", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of "[[Second line (parades)|second liners]]" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a [[street festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sakakeeny|first1=Matt|title=Jazz Funerals and Second Line Parades|url=http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/jazz-funerals-and-second-line-parades|work=knowlouisiana.org Encyclopedia of Louisiana|editor=David Johnson|publisher=Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=13 May 2017|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Natural burial}}

The terms "green burial" and "natural burial", used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after he or she dies appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of [[North America]], the opening of the first explicitly "green" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of [[South Carolina]]. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of [[California]]. The instition works to officially certifies burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.&lt;ref name="Natural"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecatholicspirit.com/news/local-news/catholic-cemeteries-to-offer-natural-burial-option-starting-in-fall/|title=Catholic Cemeteries to offer ‘natural burial’ option starting in fall - TheCatholicSpirit.com|date=21 May 2018|website=thecatholicspirit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in "green" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in [[Catholic social teaching]].&lt;ref name="Natural"/&gt;

Those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Furthermore, individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland, sometimes known as an "ecocemetery", and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance.

===Humanist and otherwise not religiously affiliated===

[[Humanists UK]] organises a network of [[Humanist officiant|humanist funeral celebrants]] or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands&lt;ref name=bha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/ceremonies/humanist-funerals-memorials |title=Humanist Funerals and Memorials |publisher=Humanism.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar network is organised by the [[Humanist Society Scotland]].

In areas outside of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as ''Dublin Live''. This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more [[Urban area|urbanized areas]] in contrast to rural territories.&lt;ref name="Dublin"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/rising-number-people-speaking-beyond-14621186|publisher=''Dublin Live''|title=Rising number of people speaking from 'beyond the grave' by writing their own eulogies|date=5 May 2018|first=Lynne|last=Kelleher|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable secular-based funerals have been held in other nations such as the [[Republic of Malta]], in which civil rights activist and humanist [[Ramon Casha]] had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest. Although such non-religious ceremonies are "a rare scene in Maltese society" due to the large role of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] within [[Culture of Malta|that country's culture]], according to ''Lovin Malta'', "more and more Maltese people want to know about alternate forms of burial... without any religion being involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2017-01-26/local-news/Humanist-chairman-Ramon-Casha-gets-both-Catholic-secular-funeral-6736169596|title=Humanist chairman Ramon Casha gets both Catholic, secular funeral|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=23 May 2018|publisher=''[[The Malta Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lovinmalta.com/lifestyle/living-in-malta/so-how-do-you-organise-a-civil-secular-funeral-in-malta-exactly|title=So, How Do You Organise A Civil, Secular Funeral In Malta Exactly?|website=lovinmalta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual events during secular funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased. For example, the ceremony for the aforementioned [[Keith Floyd]], a [[restaurateur]] and [[television personality]], included a reading of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poetic work ''[[If (Rudyard Kipling)|If—]]'' and a performance by musician [[Bill Padley]].&lt;ref name="Floyd"/&gt; Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.&lt;ref name="Dublin"/&gt;

===Civil===

{{see also|Institute of Civil Funerals}}
Civil funerals are an alternative to religious or humanist ceremonies in the UK. Unlike a humanist funeral, a civil funeral can contain some religious content, such as hymns or reading if the family wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.iocf.org.uk/for-funeral-professionals-about-civil-funerals.html| title= About Civil Funerals| publisher = Institute of Funeral Celebrants | accessdate=2014-02-19| quote= Offered in England since April 2002, the Civil Funeral is a ceremony that reflects the beliefs and values of the deceased rather than those of the minister, officiant or Celebrant.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police/fire services===

[[Image:Stairway2heaven.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional "crossed-ladders" for a [[fire department]] funeral]]
Funerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas.&lt;ref name="C.C Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=William P.|title=Law enforcement funeral manual a practical guide for law enforcement agencies when faced with the death of a member of their department|date=2006|publisher=C.C Thomas|location=Springfield, Ill.|isbn=9780398084783|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade.&lt;ref name="C.C Thomas"/&gt;

===Masonic===
A Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Mason or family member. The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral.

There is no single Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges (it is a worldwide organisation) have a prescribed service. Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a "lambskin," on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colon|first1=Felix|title=Masonic Funerals|url=http://www.millburnlodge127.com/masonicfunerals.html|publisher=THE MASONIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandlodgeofiowa.org/docs/ObituaryRites/MasonicMemorialHandbook.pdf|format=PDF|title=HANDBOOK FOR MASONIC MEMORIAL SERVICES|website=Grandlodgeofiowa.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korean Funeral Armband.png|thumb|A traditional armband indicating seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, a common practice in South Korea.]]

In most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe.

Contemporary [[South Korea]]n funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in [[columbaria]].

===In Japan===
{{main article|Japanese funeral}}
[[File:Sudangee (last offices) shaving the head of the dead in Japan-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|Sudangee or last offices being performed on a dead person, illustration from 1867]]
Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/07/28/reference/japans-funerals-deep-rooted-mix-of-ritual-form/|title=Japan’s funerals deep-rooted mix of ritual, form|last=Nakata|first=Hiroko|date=2009-07-28|newspaper=The Japan Times Online|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Most Japanese are cremated.

Religious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shintō and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death.

According to an estimate in 2005, 99.82% of all deceased Japanese are cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srgw.info/CremSoc5/Stats/Interntl/2005/StatsIF.html |title=Cremation Society of G.B. – International Cremation Statistics 2005 |publisher=Srgw.demon.co.uk |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an [[urn]] and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a [[diamond]] that can be set in jewelry.

===In the Philippines===
{{main article|Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines}}
Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of [[person]]al, [[Filipino culture|cultural]], and [[traditional]] beliefs and practices which [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead. These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex [[History of the Philippines|history]].

Most if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an [[afterlife]] and give considerable attention to [[veneration of the dead|honouring the dead]].&lt;ref name=MC&gt;[http://musical-chemist.blogspot.com/2009/01/filipinos-and-funeral-traditions.html Filipinos and Funeral Traditions], Organ-ic Chemist, musical-chemist.blogspot.com, January 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Except amongst [[Islam in the Philippines|Filipino Muslims]] (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week.&lt;ref name=Sandi&gt;Clark, Sandi. [http://www.indiana.edu/~famlygrf/culture/clark.html Death and Loss in the Philippines], Grief in a Family Context, HPER F460, Summer, 1998, indiana.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home. Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as ''[[pancit]]'' noodles and ''[[bibingka]]'' cake'';'' any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Apart from spreading the news about someone’s death verbally,&lt;ref name=Sandi/&gt; [[obituaries]] are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians,&lt;ref name=Babao&gt;Guballa, Cathy Babao.

===In Korea===
[[File:Korean.cuisine-Yukgaejang-01.jpg|thumb|Yukgaejang is a spicy soup with a beef and vegetables in it. It is a Korean traditional food and served during funerals.]]
In Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day.

The first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehaneul.go.kr/contentsS.do?id=M010202003|title=ehanuel|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Soju in korean restaurant.JPG|left|thumb|213x213px|Soju is a Korean vodka and it is served during funerals.]]
On the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, [[Hanbok]], and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Kwang Kyu |last=Lee |year=1984 |title=The Concept of Ancestors and Ancestor Worship in Korea |journal=Nazan University |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=199–214 |issn=0385-2342 |doi=10.2307/1178009|jstor=1178009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. If they decide to bury the body in the ground, three people from the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In case of cremation, there are no specific things to be done like ground burial. The only thing needed is a jar to place burned bones in and a place to keep the jar.

Other than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called [[Yukgaejang]] is served to guests oftentimes with Korean alcohol called [[soju]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seoulsite.com/survival-faq/a-korean-funeral/|title=Seoul Site|website=Seoul Site|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Mongolia===

Like many other cultures, funeral practices in Mongolia are the most important rituals that they follow. They have mixed their rituals with Buddhists due to creating a new, unique way of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buddhistdeathrituals.blogspot.com/2010/05/mongolian-death-rituals.html|title=Buddhist Death Rituals: Mongolian Death Rituals|last=Stephen|date=2010-05-01|website=Buddhist Death Rituals|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mongolians who are very strict when it comes to their traditions, there were three different ways of burial that families could choose from.  The main one being open-air burial, and the others being cremation and embalming.  There were many factors that went into deciding which funeral practice to do.  These consisted of the family's social standing, the cause of death and the specific location they died at. The main people that were chosen to be embalmed were the people apart of the Lamaistic Church, by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position.  This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer.  Also, more important people such as Nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.welcome2mongolia.com/archives/mongolian-practice-of-burial/|title=Mongolian practice of burial|website=www.welcome2mongolia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coffin is built specifically designed by three to four relatives, mainly men.  In order to determine how big the coffin will be, the builders bring planks to the hut that the dead is located and put together the box and the lid to go with it.  The same people who help put together the coffin also help decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after the sun goes down.  With very specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughters house.  The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://materialreligions.blogspot.com/2015/04/objects-and-substances-of-funeral.html|title=Objects and Substances of Funeral Mediation in Mongolia: Coffin, Miniature Yurt and Food Offerings|date=2015-04-08|website=Objects and Substances of Funeral Mediation in Mongolia|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Vietnam===

In Vietnam, [[Buddhism]] is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of [[cremation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vietnamreporter.com.au/burying-the-dead-in-vietnam/|title=Burying the dead in Vietnam {{!}} Vietnam Reporter|website=vietnamreporter.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of the deceased is moved to a loved one’s house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://offroadvietnam.com/vietnam-info/customs-and-rites/funerals|title=Funerals. Important Traditions, Customs - Offroad Vietnam Adventures|work=Offroad Vietnam Adventures|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many services are also held in the Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethnomed.org/clinical/end-of-life/death-in-viet|title=Death Rituals in Vietnamese Society — EthnoMed|website=ethnomed.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Ancient Egypt===
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian funerary practices}}

===West African===
African funerals are usually open to many visitors.
The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] of Africa. The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed.

[[Ashanti people|The Ashanti]] and [[Akan people|Akan]] ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate "fantasy coffins" colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com/funeral-and-religious-customs.html |title=Funeral and Religious Customs |publisher=A-to-z-of-manners-and-etiquette.com |date=1936-01-10 |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]] in [[Teshie]], named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art.

{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
In Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead.

==Historical mausoleums==
===China===
====Tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang====
{{main article|Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor}}
[[File:Terra Cotta army.jpg|thumb|right|Terracotta warriors of Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum.]]

The first emperor of the Qin dynasty, [[Qin Shi Huang]]’s mausoleum is located in the Lintong District of [[Xi’an]], Shaanxi Province. Qin Shi Huang’s tomb is one of the World Heritage sites in China. Its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ma|first1=Ying|last2=Fuller|first2=Benjamin T.|last3=Sun|first3=Weigang|last4=Hu|first4=Songmei|last5=Chen|first5=Liang|last6=Hu|first6=Yaowu|last7=Richards|first7=Michael P.|title=Tracing the locality of prisoners and workers at the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang: First Emperor of China (259-210 BC)|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep26731|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor who united China for the first time. The mausoleum was built in 247 BC after he became the emperor of [[Qin Dynasty]].

Ancient Chinese [[mausoleum]]s have unique characteristics compared to other cultures. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=Shuang|title=The funeral and Chinese culture|date=1993|publisher=Bowling Green State University|pages=113–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor’s [[tomb]].

Archeologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor’s tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu, Nelson H. S., Charles Y. Liu, and Veronica Pagán|title=The Terra Cotta Army of Qin Shi Huang|publisher=World Neurosurgery|pages=352–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of the placement of [[Terracotta Army]] is to protect the emperor’s tomb. The figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery. The Terracotta Army resembles the soldiers, horses, government officials, and even musicians. All of the figures were made so acutely and delicately. The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying resembled entirely to the real weapons at that time. Furthermore, their facial features weren’t identical, but with unique features and details.

====Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties====
{{main article|Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties}}
[[File:Ming Dynasty Tomb.jpg|thumb|Ming Tomb in Beijing, China.]]

The Imperial Tombs of Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as [[World Heritage Sites]]. The three Imperial Tombs of Qin Dynasty were additionally inscribed in 2000 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1004|title=Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to praise the emperors of [[Qing Dynasty]] and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed the [[Feng Shui]] to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made followed by the Feng Shui theory. Harmony between the architecture and the surrounding topographical structure were seen as an integral part of nature. According to the Feng Shi theory, to build a tomb, there must be a mountain on the northern side and low land on the south. In the west and east, a river must be located.

The Imperial Tombs of Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly shows the cultural and architectural tradition that has swayed the area for more than 500 years. There is a great harmony between the surrounding nature and the architecture. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Mark M. "Imperial Tombs of China." Arts and Activities 119.4 (1996): 22. ProQuest. Web. 23 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutes and professional mourners==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "Mute (death customs)" --&gt;
{{further|Professional mourning}}
From about 1600 to 1914 there were two professions in Europe now almost totally forgotten. The mute is depicted in art quite frequently but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. [[Oliver Twist (character)|Oliver]] is working for [[Mr. Sowerberry]] when this conversation takes place: "There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love". And in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'', Moult, the undertaker, states, "This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals,...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff." The main purpose of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.&lt;ref name="Puckle"&gt;Bertram S. Puckle, ''Funeral Customs: Their Origin and Development'' (London: T. W. Laurie, ltd., 1926) p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. These people are mentioned{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in ancient Greek plays, and were commonly employed throughout Europe until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The practice continues in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy ''Crying Ladies'' revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in [[Binondo|Manila's Chinatown]]. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many.

==State funeral==
{{main article|State funeral}}
High-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered [[state funeral]]s.

==Final disposition==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Some cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a [[graveyard]] is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the [[groundwater]] is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called [[mausoleum]]s. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.
Burial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an [[ossuary]].

===Burial at sea===
"[[Burial at sea]]" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the [[Church of England]], special forms of funeral service were added to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] to cover it. In today's generation, "burial at sea" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while "whole body burial at sea" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Laws vary by jurisdictions.

[[Science fiction]] writers have frequently extended the concept to a "[[Space burial|burial in space]]".

===Cremation===
{{main article|Cremation}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
Cremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in [[ancient Rome]] (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in [[Monastiraki]]). [[Vikings]] were occasionally cremated in their [[longship]]s, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with [[standing stones]].

Since the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (''[[Halakha]]'') forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily [[resurrection]]. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of [[Protestantism]] allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and Islam also forbid cremation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=WhatIsCremation What is Cremation, ''Cremation Association of North America.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.

===Feeding to scavenger animals===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
{{see also|Sky burial}}
Rarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by [[Zoroastrian]]s in [[Mumbai]] and [[Karachi]], where bodies are placed in "[[Towers of Silence]]", where [[vulture]]s and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some [[Effects of high altitude on humans|high-altitude]] [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]], where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as ''jhator'' or "giving alms to the birds".

===Mummification===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Takabuti.JPG|thumb|[[Takabuti]], an Egyptian mummy from the 7th century BC]]
Mummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them. The most famous practitioners were [[ancient Egypt]]ians—many nobles and highly ranked bureaucrats had their corpses [[embalm]]ed and stored in luxurious [[sarcophagi]] inside their funeral mausoleums. [[Pharaoh]]s stored their embalmed corpses in [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Egyptian Conception of Immortality|last=Reisner|first=George Andrew|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|year=1912|isbn=|location=|pages=5, 6, 22|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannibalism===
Cannibalism has earlier been practiced post-mortem in parts of Papua New Guinea. The practice has been linked to the spread of [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], a [[Prion#Prion disease|prion disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch085/ch085e.html?qt=kuru&amp;alt=sh |title=Kuru: Prion Diseases: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promession===
[[Promession]] is a new method of disposing of the body. [[Patent]]ed by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company, a promession is also known as an "ecological funeral". Its main purpose is to return the body to soil quickly while minimizing pollution and resource consumption. It consists of separating the body from the coffin, freezing it with liquid nitrogen, vibrating it into small particles, freeze drying it, separating any metals, and placing the dry powder remains in a biodegradable casket in top soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nyteknik.se/energi/metoderna-som-ersatter-kremering-6404803|title=Metoderna som ersätter kremering|website=nyteknik.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-planned funerals==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=April 2016}}
Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qeepr.com/blog/who-has-the-right-to-make-decisions-about-your-funeral/ Who Has the Right to Make Decisions About Your Funeral?], www.qeepr.com, February 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral.

==Organ donation and body donation==
Some people [[Body donation|donate their bodies]] to a [[medical school]] for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hta.gov.uk/about_hta/faqs/body_donation_faqs.cfm|publisher=UK [[Human Tissue Authority]]|title=Body Donation FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roach |first=Mary |title=Stiff: The Curious Lives Of Human Cadavers |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0141007458 |id= {{ASIN|0141007451|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to [[Organ donation|donate organs]] and [[Tissue donation|tissue]] after death, for treating the sick, or for research.

'''''Porte des Lilas''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Gate of Lilacs'') is a 1957 French-Italian [[drama]]tic film directed by [[René Clair]], based on [[René Fallet]]'s novel ''[[La Grande Ceinture]]''. The film is known as both ''Gates of Lilacs'' and ''The Gates of Paris'', but was released under the latter title in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The IMDb website suggests ''Gates of Paris'' was the universal English title. However, according to Ronald Bergan and [[Robyn Karney]] in the ''Bloomsbury Foreign Film Guide'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1988, p.224) and Melissa E. Biggs (''French Films, 1945–1993'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 1996, p.221) the film has these two alternate English titles. The English title used on the original British release is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''gaung baung''''' ({{lang-my|ခေါင်းပေါင်း}} {{IPA-my|ɡáʊɴ báʊɴ|}}; {{lang-mnw|သမိၚ် ဍိုပ်}}, {{IPA-mnw|həmoiŋ dɒp|}}; [[Shan language|Shan]]: {{my|ၶဵၼ်းႁူဝ်}} {{IPA-shn|kʰén.hǒ|}}; [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]]: เฅียนหัว {{IPA-nod|xian.hǔa|}}) is a traditional Burmese [[turban]] and part of the traditional attire of many ethnic groups inhabiting modern day Burma and Northern Thailand, particularly among most of the Buddhist-professing ethnic groups: the [[Bamar]], [[Mon people|Mon]], [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Shan people|Shan]], and [[Northern Thai people|Tai Yuan people]]s. The design varies from region to region, but share basic similarities that distinguish the ''gaung baung'' from the [[turban]].

''Gaung baung'' literally means "head wrap" in the Burmese language. It is part of traditional ceremonial attire, worn at formal gatherings and ceremonies. The ''gaung baung'' is almost always a sign of rank, though no insignia or pattern exists to denote it. The ''gaung baung'' is more prevalent among the Arakanese and Shan ethnic groups.

The design of the modern Burmese ''gaung baung'' emerged in the mid-20th century and is called ''maung kyetthayay'' ({{my|မောင့်ကျက်သရေ}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no81/Timeouts/3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ready-made ''gaung baung'' made of cloth wrapped in a rattan frame and can be worn like a hat is worn. In the colonial era, silk ''gaung baungs'' called "B.A. ''gaung baung''," traditionally worn at graduation ceremonies, were popular.

The ''gaung baung'' is usually made of silk or cotton, depending on the rank or wealth of the owner. The older wrap versions were usually {{convert|4|to|5|ft}} long and {{convert|8|to|12|in|cm}} wide. It is put on the head in a clockwise manner, with the tongue on the left side. The tongue is the main distinguishing feature of the ''gaung baung'', and is also different from ethnic group to ethnic group.

The Burmese and Mon ''gaung baung'' tongues tend to be sloping down and rounded, while the Arakanese (Rakhine) and Shan tongues are fanned out.

Nowadays, most do not wear the ''gaung baung'', even to official functions. The ''gaung baung'', along with most other articles of Burmese attire, have become streamlined. Thus, most wear ready-made and woven ''gaung baung''s which are wrapped over a rattan or wicker frame.

== Material ==

Since the ''gaung baung'' is a ceremonial headgear, it is always for beautification. Depending on the wealth and or rank of the owner, the colour and material differ.

The Burmese and Mon wear yellow, white, grey or cream coloured ''gaung baung''s, of either silk or cotton. The Rakhine wear pink coloured ones, while the Shan is either cream, skin or tan coloured. The Shan ''gaung baung'' is made out of rough cotton, called '''pin''', the trademark garment of the Shan people.

== Contemporary usage ==

Usage of ''gaung baung'' has declined dramatically during the [[British rule in Burma|British colonization]]. It is only worn in official ceremonies, and social functions such as [[Weddings in Myanmar|weddings]].

In the Northern Hill areas, the hill tribes, such as the [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Akha people|Akha]] and [[Palaung people|Palaung]] still wear similar ''gaung baung''s, but for day to day wear, and they are usually made from towels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4173">The '''Geek Pride Festival''' was the name of a number of events between 1998 and 2000, organized by [[Tim McEachern]] and devoted to computer [[geek]] activities and interests. The name of the festival is most often associated with the large event held on March 31 and April 1, 2000 at the Park Plaza Castle in [[Boston]], United States.

Before that there were two events at the now closed Big House Brewery in [[Albany, New York]]. [http://www.wamc.org WAMC], the local NPR affiliate, sponsored the events which were organized by Tim McEachern.

==2000 event==
{{Tone|date=November 2008}}
[[Image:Geek pride festival t-shirt.png|thumb|right|Geek Pride Festival T-shirt]]
The 2000 event was a major production, organized with the help of [[Susan Kaup]], Chris O'Brien and many volunteers.

The event began Friday night, with a swap meet / social event at the Modern Lounge in Boston's [[Landsdowne Street]] nightclub district. Drink tickets were offered at the door, and the DJ played computer-themed music (e.g., ''[[It's All About The Pentiums]]'').

On Saturday, the main event occurred at the Castle, where admission was free. The middle of the floor held the "Email Garden", comprising about a dozen tables with [[Personal computer|PC]]s running [[Red Hat Linux]], in a wired [[LAN]] network and providing [[email]], [[World Wide Web|Web]], and general [[Internet]] access. At the front of the hall was a stage, which hosted a number of invited guests, including [[Rob Malda]] of [[Slashdot]], [[Eric S. Raymond]], the [[video game]] cover band [[Everyone (band)|Everyone]]. The stage was also host to the final round of a [[Quake III]] tournament, held in a back room, displayed on the stage's projection screen, as well as the final round of "Stump the Geek", a geek [[trivia]] contest.

Aside from the main events, the main floor had computer workstations displaying live [[webcam]] feeds of "satellite" Festivals in remote locations. A live [[Shoutcast]] feed was also provided of the Boston event. A poll for "greatest geek hero" was also held; the official winner was [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything.blockstackers.com/index.pl?node_id=475132]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Science/AAAS magazine, 2,000 people attended, though the open-door free admission made an official count impossible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Other events==
The 2000 event is widely referred to as the "first annual" event, although McEachern organized at least one previous event named Geek Pride Festival (and/or Geek Pride Day) at a bar in Albany, New York. Some sources refer to the Boston event as the ''third'' annual.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

McEachern planned another event to take place later the same year in [[San Francisco]], but was never realized.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'''''Ghost Squad''''' and '''''Ghost Squad: Evolution''''' are [[light gun]] [[Shoot 'em up#Tube and rail shooters|rail shooter]] [[arcade game]]s developed and published by Sega.  A home version of the original ''Ghost Squad'' was developed for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] [[video game console|game console]].&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameSpot: Ghost Squad (Wii)|url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/ghostsquad/index.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B4|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sequel, ''Operation GHOST'', was released in arcades in 2012.

==''Ghost Squad'' (Arcade)==
Sega released ''Ghost Squad'' for the arcade in 2004. ''Ghost Squad'' features a simulated IR light gun shaped similar to the standard issue weapon the game's protagonists use. This light gun is intended to function realistically: it features a working [[Selective fire|fire selector switch]], a stock, force-feedback recoil, and [[iron sights]].  To ensure that the light gun fires accurately, a 20-second "calibration" mode is provided in which the game adjusts for any jostling or damage to the rifle's light-emitting components.

''Ghost Squad'' features different weapons, each with its firing and reload properties (i.e. long shot splash, long reload time) which affect its difficulty of use. ''Ghost Squad'' features three semi non-linear levels with adjustable difficulty and branching choices, ranging from the jungle, a government-restricted villa, and inside an [[Air Force One]] flight.  There are many sub-activities in the game, such as defusing bombs and throwing grenades to disable armor, which are accomplished via the secondary "Action" trigger on the gun's [[foregrip]].

===Arcade version data features===
The arcade version of ''Ghost Squad'' use "IC Cards" to save the players customized character data, score, and provide the player with experience points, new outfits, new weapons, and increased rank. The card is available for players to purchase at some arcades. The card allows the player a maximum of 100 game and sixteen levels of difficulty. After 100 games the card must be recharged by purchasing a new card. The game also utilizes an internet ranking system, that is accessed when using a password provided by the game.

Most ''Ghost Squad'' cabinets in the United States do not have card slots. However, players have immediate access to four costumes, four guns, and the first four mission levels.

==''Ghost Squad: Evolution'' (arcade)==
''Ghost Squad Evolution'' is the arcade followup to the original ''Ghost Squad''. It was developed and published by Sega and released in 2007.

In ''Ghost Squad: Evolution'' the player is a member of Alpha Unit, or members of the “Ghost Squad”, an unofficial unit of the anti-terrorist group, Multi-Operation-Program (M.O.P.). [[Non-player character|Non-playable characters]] include fellow M.O.P. members consisting of the Commander, who provides radio backup and pertinent advice to the player. Along with the Bravo and Charlie Unit who assist the player in suppressing the terrorist threat.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;

The rifle can be set from single shot, to 3 burst shot to automatic fire. As well as a special effects to suit the situation Night Vision, Flash Light for the mounted gun, and scope for sniper rifle. The gun also features an action button which is used to pull off special moves like hand-to-hand combat. As well as recoil effects on every shot fired.&lt;ref name=Highway&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghost Squad Evolution - Ghost Squad 2|url=http://www.highwaygames.com/products/view.php?id=3267|publisher=Highway Games|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each mission contains multiple routes for the player to choose. Special events occur throughout the game depending on the route chosen, such as securing hostages, bomb removal, or providing friendly cover fire. The game is broken into 3 missions with 16 total levels. All 16 can be selected from the beginning. There are 14 costumes available for character customization, however, the costumes have no effect on gameplay. There are 25 different weapons.&lt;ref name=Manual/&gt;&lt;ref name=Highway/&gt;

==''Ghost Squad'' (Wii)==
Sega published the Polygon Magic developed Wii port of ''Ghost Squad'' in Japan on October 25, 2007, and in the U.S. on November 20, 2007. It uses the [[Wii Zapper]] as a multi-purpose tool to allow players easy control of targeting enemies, defusing bombs, and detaining hostages.

''Ghost Squad'' takes advantage of the [[Wii Remote]]'s pointer functionality, the nunchuk, and the Wii Zapper giving players controller flexibility. In addition, the game features a pointer calibration mode, enabling players to use line-of-sight aiming and fire precisely where the Wii Remote is pointed. The player has the option to turn off the on-screen pointer for more points.

Exclusive to the [[Wii]] conversion of the game are four-player support, and an online [[Score (game)#High score|high score]] leaderboard via the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|title=SEGA Announces Ghost Squad for Wii|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/787/787072p1.html |publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Ghost Squad'' for the Wii received a metascore of 69 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metacritic: Ghost Squad (Wii)|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/ghost-squad|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN gave it a 7.5, remarking that "most of what made ''Ghost Squad'' fun in the arcades is still retained though, as there's a huge emphasis on weapon management and mid-level missions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bozon|title=Ghost Squad Review|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/836/836873p1.html|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sport]], a '''golden generation''' or '''golden team''' is an exceptionally gifted group of players of similar age, whose achievements reach or are expected to reach a level of success beyond that which their team had previously achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/513450/20131013/england-steven-gerrard-frank-lampard-figo-denis.htm |title=Curse of the Golden Generations: The Unrewarded Exploits of Bergkamp, Figo, Drogba and England - International Business Times UK |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2013-10-13 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/team/belgium/459/blog/post/1923296/belgium-golden-generation|title=Belgium Golden Generation - ESPN FC|work=ESPNFC.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a list of teams who have been referred to by the media as golden generations, most of which played in the 21st century.

==Origins==
It was first coined by the Portuguese sports media to refer to a group of exceptionally gifted teenage Portuguese footballers. This group of players, spearheaded by "Golden Boy" [[Luís Figo]], won two [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Football World Youth Championship]]s in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] and [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/portugal/newsid_1985000/1985619.stm|title= Portugal must take their chance|accessdate= |work= BBC|publisher= |date= May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group were close to retirement in the early part of the 21st century, leading the European sports media to spotlight the Golden Generation's chances of winning a senior trophy at tournaments such as [[UEFA Euro 2000]], the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] (which Portugal hosted) and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].

Since then, it has been used by media in many different countries, with usage spreading to other areas, for example, in [[rugby union|rugby]].

==Basketball==

===Argentina (2000–2012)===
By winning the [[gold medal]] in the [[Americas Championship 2001]], [[silver medal]] in [[2002 FIBA World Championship]], the gold medal in [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics]], gold medal in [[FIBA Diamond Ball]] 2008, [[bronze medal]] in [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics]], and gold medal in [[2011 FIBA Americas Championship]] played in the city of [[Mar del Plata]], [[Argentina]]. Resulting in Argentina reached the first position in the [[FIBA World Rankings|FIBA Men's Ranking]] at the end of the [[2008 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aol.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2011-08-30/star-studded-but-aging-argentine-squad-looks-to-add-to-achievements-with-fiba-am|title= Star-studded but aging Argentine squad looks to add to achievements with FIBA Americas gold|accessdate= |work= |publisher=sportingnews |date= 12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
=== Asia ===
==== Australia (2006–2014) ====
This Australian team waited 32 years to qualify for a FIFA World Cup tournament. This group of players formed the backbone of Australia's [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], and [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]] squads and was used extensively during Australia's qualification matches for those respective tournaments, with this crop of players considered to be among the best Australia have ever produced. The Golden Generation is believed to have ended during the reign of [[Ange Postecoglou]] as manager of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/10/18/its-time-for-australia-to-move-on-from-the-golden-generation/|title=It’s time for Australia to move on from the ‘Golden Generation’|date=October 18, 2013|work=The Roar|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/asian-cup/fox-sports-simon-hill-says-the-asian-cup-final-will-be-fitting-farewell-to-socceroos-golden-generation/story-e6frf4fu-1225995483593?nk=940d0841d9989dd332a822175486d00d |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141203111942/http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/asian-cup/fox-sports-simon-hill-says-the-asian-cup-final-will-be-fitting-farewell-to-socceroos-golden-generation/story-e6frf4fu-1225995483593?nk=940d0841d9989dd332a822175486d00d |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-12-03 |title=Asian Cup 2015 |publisher=Foxsports.com.au |accessdate=2015-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/06/the-socceroos-golden-generation-world-cup|title=The Socceroos' golden generation: extraordinary in their ordinariness|author=Aaron Timms|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/socceroos-golden-generation-fall-one-by-one-to-the-sniper-20140326-zqnd8.html|title=Socceroos' Golden Generation fall one by one to the sniper|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Foster |url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/socceroos-golden-generation-has-much-to-teach-our-youth-20120721-22gti.html |title=Socceroos' golden generation has much to teach our youth |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/asian-cup-2015-after-historic-triumph-socceroos-now-target-world-cup-20150201-1334zz.html|title=Asian Cup 2015: After historic triumph, Socceroos now target World Cup|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic (1996–2006) ====
The Golden generation of the [[Czech Republic]] were born in the late seventies and early eighties of the twentieth century. Highlights of their generation include finishing second in [[UEFA Euro 1996]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=UEFA Euro 1996|date=2018-06-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UEFA_Euro_1996&amp;oldid=845841427|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and third in [[UEFA Euro 2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=UEFA Euro 2004|date=2018-06-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UEFA_Euro_2004&amp;oldid=846257921|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czech Republic national football team|national team]] was also qualified for the first time to a Fifa World Cup in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]]. During the first few years of the twenty first century the team were often ranked in the top five of the [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA World Ranking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.fifaranking.net/ranking/?d=2000-08-09|title=FIFA World Ranking as of Aug 2000 {{!}} FIFARANKING.net|website=en.fifaranking.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]] was the second best team in the world in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.fifaranking.net/ranking/?d=2005-12-16|title=FIFA World Ranking as of Dec 2005 {{!}} FIFARANKING.net|website=en.fifaranking.net|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the squad during this time played in the best leagues in Europe for the likes of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus F.C]]. One of them, [[Pavel Nedvěd]], even won the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ballon d'Or|date=2018-05-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ballon_d%27Or&amp;oldid=842827640|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in the history of this small Central European country a Czech player won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. It happened in [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final|2005]] during ''Miracle of Istanbul.'' [[Milan Baroš]] and [[Vladimír Šmicer]] winning with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool FC]]. 

==== England (2001–2010, 2018–) ====
During the reign of [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]], [[Adam Crozier]], the chief executive of [[the Football Association]] and some members of the British media, touted players such as [[David Beckham]], [[Michael Owen]] and [[Steven Gerrard]] as the nucleus of a potential Golden Generation team. Despite some impressive performances such as the [[2001 Germany vs England football match]] in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and the individual players' successes at club level, inconsistency resulted in this group of players failing to live up to expectations, resulting in the group becoming synonymous with disappointment and failed potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,1852626,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=McClaren ends the golden era | date=August 18, 2006 | first=Kevin | last=McCarra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1816198,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=England's golden generation are just big heads | date=July 9, 2006 | first=Paul | last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5137638.stm | work=BBC News | title=End of road for wayward England | date=July 2, 2006 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1826303.ece |location=London |work=The Independent |title=Eco Chic: All ethically made over |date=November 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106081248/http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/internationals/article1826303.ece |archivedate=November 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= England, Beckham booted from Euro 2008|work= [[MSNBC]]|date=|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21920060/|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/sam-wallace-golden-generation-fell-short-of-the-highest-standards-ndash-but-england-will-miss-them-2345567.html | title=Sam Wallace: 'Golden generation' fell short of the highest standards – but England will miss them |location=London | work=The Independent | first=Sam | last=Wallace | date=August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Eriksson left in 2006 and [[Steve McClaren]] became manager, although many of the players continued to achieve success with their respective clubs, the team failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008]], only the second time England failed to qualify for a major tournament in over 20 years (of the last 12 major tournaments). [[Rio Ferdinand]] claimed that the pressure of the "Golden Generation" tag had a negative effect on the players, restricting their ability to perform to their full potential for the national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/10/rio-ferdinand-england-world-cup|title=Rio Ferdinand urges England's young Lions to be fearless at World Cup|author=Owen Gibson|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Pep Guardiola]] said he could not understand why England did not achieve more with players such as Lampard, Carrick, Scholes, Gerrard, Terry and Ferdinand and claimed they were on the same level as Spain's golden generation of 2008–2014, The team entered a second golden generation in 2018, reaching the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] and the Finals of the [[UEFA Nations League]], causing a resurgence of england fans and high expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=harshit |first1=raghav |title=Another golden generation in the making for England |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/opinion-another-golden-generation-in-the-making-for-england |website=sportskeeda |publisher=sportskeeda |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France (1998–2006) ====
In late 1998 the [[France national football team]] began a period of international dominance defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3–0 to win the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], becoming the first French team to win the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Two years later, [[David Trezeguet]]'s golden goal in extra time gave France a 2–1 win over [[Italy national football team|Italy]] to give France the [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000 European Championship]]. France were subsequently ranked No. 1 in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and ranked No. 1 in the [[World Football Elo Ratings]] for two years. The team also secured the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Despite this impressive recent record the French team flopped at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], losing to newcomers Senegal in  the opening match of the tournament and crashing out in the group stages without scoring a goal and taking only one point from their three games. A years later they were successful at the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. They also reached the World Cup final in Berlin at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], where they lost to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=368242&amp;root=worldcup&amp;&amp;cc=3436 |title=Finals bow for Zidane et al - ESPN FC |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2006-05-17 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/english-players-are-an-endangered-species-we-must-do-more-to-protect-460942.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Sam | last=Wallace | title=English players are an endangered species we must do more to protect | date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French golden team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.ndtv.com/football/blanc-under-pressure-amid-race-row-storm-1571506|title=Blanc under pressure amid race row storm|last=Grelard|first=Philippe|date=6 May 2011|publisher=[[NDTV]] Sports|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was composed of the following players:

{{Main article|Golden Team}}
Between 1950 and 1956, the team recorded 42 victories, 7 draws and just one defeat, in the [[1954 World Cup final]] against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]]. Under the [[Elo rating system]] they achieved the highest rating recorded by a national side (2230 points, 30 June 1954).

==== Portugal (1994–2006) ====
Many of these players made up the youth national teams of Portugal that won consecutive FIFA Youth Championships in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] and [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991]]. These teams were the step-up to the senior team. As a result, Portugal reached the semi-finals of [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship]] and were runners-up [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|four years later]], on home soil. They were also [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] semi-finalists after a dominating run, though only [[Luís Figo]] was picked in the squad for the final tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Golden Generation' Must First Beat World Champion France : Can Portugal Go the Full Distance?|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 2000|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/28/sports/28iht-soccer.2.t_21.html|accessdate=|first=Rob|last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2000/euro2000/news/2000/06/02/por_mainfeature_ap/ | work=CNN | title=Figo and Co. aim to fulfill Portugal's promise at Euros}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/soccer/07/04/port.rdp/ | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Soccer - Portugal's golden generation just misses glory - 4&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2004 | date=July 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics contend that many of the players underachieved at international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=373269&amp;root=worldcup&amp;&amp;cc=5739|title= Portugal vs. France preview|accessdate= |work= ESPN|publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/808269.stm|title= Golden boys ready to shine|accessdate= |work= BBC|publisher= |date= June 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spain (2008–2014) ====
{{expand section|date=August 2018}}
This generation of Spanish players helped [[Spain national football team|Spain]] win three titles: the [[UEFA European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], while also reaching the final of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/the-rise-and-fall-of-spains-golden-generation|title=The rise and fall of Spain’s golden generation|publisher=Sportskeeda|first=Mahir|last=Tajwar|date=4 July 2016|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Spain also dominated the FIFA World Rankings until 2013, having first led the rankings in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/associations/association=esp/men/index.html|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking: Spain|publisher=FIFA|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Yugoslavia (1987–1992) ====
Yugoslavia's generation of young footballers won the [[1987 FIFA World Youth Championship]] and finished runner-up at the [[1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]]. The nation then reached the quarter-finals of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and, a year later, a [[Red Star Belgrade]] team featuring many of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|national team]]'s stars became the first Yugoslav side to ever win the [[1990–91 European Cup|European Cup]]. Yugoslavia qualified for [[UEFA Euro 1992]] with seven wins from eight matches and the best goalscoring record and goal difference of any team during the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|qualifying phase]]. However, the team was disqualified prior to the tournament due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (it was replaced by the eventual champion, [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]) and did not play together again after the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|country's division]]. Several players from the Yugoslav team went on to finish in third place at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/writers/jonathan_wilson/07/01/yugoslavia.1990/|title=Osim recalls what might have been for a brilliant Yugoslavia in 1990|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=18 June 2014|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/england/2953134.stm|title=Serbia &amp; Montenegro's new dawn|date=31 May 2003|accessdate=18 June 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Algeria national football team|Algerian team]] which reached the second round of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] has been described as a golden generation, or a "second golden generation" in reference to the Algerian team which reached the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] World Cups and which won the [[1990 African Nations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=7/news=lacen-this-golden-generation-has-matured-2393065.html|title=Lacen: This golden generation has matured|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=January 1, 1900|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trueafrica.co/article/algerias-fennec-foxes-team-look-2017-african-cup-nations/|title=Is it Algeria's time to shine in the football world?  - TRUE Africa|date=March 30, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2015/1/15/7517161/algeria-africa-cup-of-nations-2015|title=After their World Cup heroics, all eyes will be on Algeria at AFCON.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ivory Coast (2006–2015) ====
Despite winning the 1992 edition of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], the country saw an outpour of talent during the first half of the 2000s (decade). The majority of this generation consisted of talented players who enjoyed and still enjoy considerable success in Europe. Led by [[Didier Drogba]] (who is also the national team's highest ever goalscorer), several other players found contracts in the biggest football stages in the world. During this period, [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] managed its first [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/ivory-coast-les-elephants-world-cup-2014-barzil-didier-drogba-yaya-toure/|title=Last hurrah for Ivory Coast’s Golden Generation|date=26 May 2014|accessdate=29 May 2014|work=Sportsnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ivory-coast/10589548/World-Cup-2014-Time-for-Ivory-Coasts-ageing-golden-generation-to-finally-make-an-impact-on-the-world-stage.html|title=World Cup 2014: Time for Ivory Coast's ageing golden generation to finally make an impact on the world stage|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=29 May 2014|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They also won the [[2015 Africa Cup of Nations|Africa Cup of Nations]] in 2015.

=== South America ===
==== Chile (2007–2017) ====
The Chile team won back to back Copa América titles in [[2015 Copa América|2015]] and in [[Copa América Centenario|2016]]. The backbone of this team came from the U-20 squad that went on to finish third in the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. However, in 2017 they inexplicably failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], despite most of the squad being in the primes of their careers, following unexpected losses to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|qualification]].&lt;ref&gt;http://remezcla.com/sports/chile-golden-generation-world-cup/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Colombia (2012–) ====
The current Colombia team are considered as the "[[Colombia national football team#A new golden generation (2010–present)|Second Golden Generation]]" of Colombia, in reference to Colombia's [[Colombia national football team#1990s: Golden Era|Golden Generation]] from the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/sport/brazil2014/2014/06/colombia-new-generation-born-2014613212422678440.html|title=Colombia's new generation is born|last=Rhys|first=Paul|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rugby union==

===Ireland (2001–2014)===
Since 2001, Ireland's team has been chosen from a solid base of players, led by [[Brian O'Driscoll]] whose debut in 1999 has been linked to a transformation in the team's fortunes.&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/sport/other-sports/rugbys-golden-children-exploded-with-the-boom-1944005.html|title= Rugby's golden children exploded with the boom|accessdate= |work= |publisher= Sunday Independent |date= November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under-21 Triple Crown victories in 1996 and 1998 and an under-19 World Cup win in 1998 occurred with many members of those teams going on to become the golden generation of the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"/&gt; The senior team had only once in the 1990s won two [[Five Nations Championship]] games in one year (1995).&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"/&gt; However, the team of the 2000s were close runners-up in the expanded [[Six Nations Championship]] several times, and were disappointingly knocked out of the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], failing to advance from the pool stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyworldcup2007/story/0,,2179651,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Ireland's dying light stings Reddan in hunt for late revival | date=September 28, 2007 | first=Mike | last=Averis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four Triple Crowns during the 2000s equaled the amount Ireland had won in the previous one hundred years.&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"/&gt; A two-win Six Nations campaign in 2008 was the exception, leading to the departure of manager [[Eddie O'Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"/&gt;

Their crowning moment came under [[Declan Kidney]] in 2009 when they won the Grand Slam and [[2009 Six Nations Championship|Six Nations Championship]]. They remained unbeaten throughout 2009, beating [[2007 Rugby World Cup|World]] and [[2009 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]] champions [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] in their final match of the year. The ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' proclaimed the 2000s as "the greatest decade in the history of Irish rugby. In the space of 10 years we have progressed from penury to riches".&lt;ref name="Sunday Independent-1944005"/&gt; Most of this group of players have also led their respective Irish club/provincial sides to unprecedented success, with Munster winning the [[Pro14|Celtic League]] in [[2002–03 Celtic League|2003]], [[2008–09 Celtic League|2009]] and [[2010–11 Celtic League|2011]] and the [[Heineken Cup]] in [[2005–06 Heineken Cup|2006]] and [[2007–08 Heineken Cup|2008]]; and Leinster winning the Celtic League in [[2001–02 Celtic League|2002]], [[2007–08 Celtic League|2008]], [[2012–13 Pro12|2013]] and [[2013–14 Pro12|2014]] (as well as finishing runner up in 2010, 2011 and 2012), the [[Amlin Challenge Cup]] in [[2012-13 European Challenge Cup|2013]] and the Heineken Cup in [[2008–09 Heineken Cup|2009]], [[2010–11 Heineken Cup|2011]] and [[2011-12 Heineken Cup|2012]].

===Tone===
Golin is a [[tonal language]], distinguishing high ([˧˥]), mid ([˨˧]), and low ([˨˩]) tone. The high tone is marked by an acute accent and the low tone by a grave accent, while the mid tone is left unmarked. Examples:&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;
* High: mú [mu˧˥] 'type of snake'; wí [wi˧˥] 'scream (man)'
* Mid: mu [mu˨˧] 'type of bamboo'; wi [wi˨˧] 'coming from the same ethnic group'
* Low: mù [mu˨˩] 'sound of river'; wì [wi˨˩] 'cut (verb)'

[[File:Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans (DVD menu).jpg|thumb|A [[DVD-Video]] typically includes an interactive menu allowing the user to change settings or play additional content.]]
'''Interactive media''' normally refers to products and services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions by presenting content such as [[text (literary theory) | text]], [[moving image]], [[animation]], [[video]], [[Digital audio | audio]], and [[video games]].

==Definition==
[[Interactivity|Interactive]] media is a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive media|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|website=Investopedia|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When Smart Devices Interact With Pervasive Screens: A Survey", 
P.C. Ng, K.E. Eun, J. She, M. Baldauf, ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM) 
Volume 13, Issue 4, August 2017.
[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3115933]&lt;/ref&gt;
Interactive media works with the user's participation. The media still has the same purpose but the user's input adds interaction and brings interesting features to the system for better enjoyment.

==Development==
The analogue videodisc developed by NV [[Philips]] was the pioneering technology for interactive media. Additionally, there are several elements that encouraged the development of interactive media including the following: 
* The laser disc technology was first invented in 1958. It enabled the user to access high-quality analogue images on the computer screen. This increased the ability of interactive video systems. 
* The concept of the [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which was developed in the 1970s, popularized by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] was essentially about visual metaphors, intuitive feel and sharing information on the virtual desktop. Additional power was the only thing needed to move into multimedia.
* The sharp fall in hardware costs and the unprecedented rise in the computer speed and memory transformed the personal computer into an affordable machine capable of combining audio and color video in advanced ways. 
* Another element is the release of [[Windows 3.0]] in 1990 by [[Microsoft]] into the mainstream IBM clone world. It accelerated the acceptance of GUI as the standard mechanism for communicating with small computer systems. 
* The development by NV [[Philips]] of optical digital technologies built around the compact disk (CD) in 1979 is also another leading element in the interactive media development as it raised the issue of developing interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;Lat chem, C., Williamson, J., &amp; Henderson-Lancet, L. (1993). Interactive multimedia practice and promise. London; Philadelphia: Koran page.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the prior elements contributed in the development of the main hardware and software systems used in interactive media.

==Terminology==
Though the word ''media'' is plural, the term  is often used as a singular noun.

Interactive media is related to the concepts [[interaction design]], [[new media]], [[interactivity]], [[human computer interaction]], [[cyberculture]], [[digital culture]], [[interactive design]], and includes [[augmented reality]].

An essential feature of interactivity is that it is mutual: user and machine each take an active role (see [[interaction]]). Most [[interactive computing]] systems are for some human purpose and interact with humans in human contexts.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Dix  | first1 = Alan  | last2 = Finlay  | first2 = Janet  | last3 = Abowd  | first3 = Gregory D.  | last4 = Beale  | first4 = Russell  | authorlink = Alan Dix  | title = Human-computer interaction. 3rd edn.  | publisher = Pearson Education  | year = 2004  | page = xvi  | isbn = 9780130461094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manovich complains that 'In relation to computer-based media, the concept of interactivity is a tautology.  .... Therefore, to call computer media “interactive” is meaningless – it  simply means stating the most basic fact about computers.'.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Manovich  | first = Lev  | authorlink = Lev Manovich  | title = The Language of New Media  | publisher = MIT Press  | location = Cambridge  | year = 2001  | page = 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term is useful to denote an identifiable body of practices and technologies.

Interactive media are an instance of a computational method influenced by the sciences of cybernetics, [[autopoiesis]] and system theories, and challenging notions of reason and cognition, perception and memory, emotions and affection.

Any form of interface between the [[end user]]/[[audience]] and the medium may be considered interactive. Interactive media is not limited to [[electronic media]] or digital media. [[Board game]]s, [[pop-up book]]s, [[gamebook]]s, [[flip book]]s and [[constellation wheel]]s are all examples of printer interactive media. Books with a simple [[table of contents]] or [[Index (publishing)|index]] may be considered interactive due to the [[non-linear]] control mechanism in the medium, but are usually considered non-interactive since the majority of the [[user experience]] is non-interactive reading.&lt;ref&gt;[[Media psychology]] is the newest emerging dimension of media theory applied to interactive media. {{cite web |url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010440/http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/sfischo/MEDIADEF-2.html |archivedate=2011-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===Effects on learning===
Interactive media is helpful in the four development dimensions in which young children learn: social and emotional, language development, cognitive and general knowledge, and approaches toward learning. Using computers and educational computer software in a learning environment helps children increase communication skills and their attitudes about learning. Children who use educational computer software are often found using more complex speech patterns and higher levels of verbal communication. A study found that basic interactive books that simply read a story aloud and highlighted words and phrases as they were spoken were beneficial for children with lower reading abilities. Children have different styles of learning, and interactive media helps children with visual, verbal, auditory, and tactile learning styles.&lt;ref&gt;Glaucoma, Christina R., M.A. The Effects of Interactive Media on Preschoolers' Learning: A Review of the Research and Recommendations for the Future. P. 13-17. Ed. Eileen Espresso, Patti Miller, and Christine Cordoba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intuitive understanding===
Interactive media makes technology more intuitive to use. Interactive products such as smartphones, iPad's/iPod's, interactive whiteboards and websites are all easy to use. The easy usage of these products encourages consumers to experiment with their products rather than reading instruction manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Stuart. "The Disadvantages and Advantages of Interactive Media." EHow. Demand Media, 10 May 2011. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Interactive media promotes dialogic communication. This form of communication allows senders and receivers to build long term trust and cooperation. This plays a critical role in building relationships. Organizations also use interactive media to go further than basic marketing and develop more positive behavioral relationships.&lt;ref&gt;DeYeso, Jennifer. "The Effect of Interactive and Traditional Media on Relationship Building." Slideshare. LinkedIn Corporation, 25 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on families==
The introduction of interactive media has greatly affected the lives and inner workings of families, with many family activities having integrated with technology quite seamlessly, allowing both children and parents to adapt to it as they see fit. However, parents have also become increasingly worried about the impact that it will have on their family lives. This is not necessarily because they are opposed to technology, but because they fear that it will lessen the time that they get to spend with their children. Studies have shown that although interactive media is able to connect families together when they are unable to physically, the dependence on this media also continues to persist even when there are opportunities for family time, which often leads the adults to believe that it distracts children more than it benefits them.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Katie Headrick; Takeuchi, Lori; Stevens, Reed.

==Types==
===Distributed interactive media===
The media which allows several geographically remote users to interact synchronously with the media application/system is known as Distributed Interactive Media. Some common examples of this type of Media include Online Gaming, Distributed Virtual Environment, Whiteboards which are used for interactive conferences and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Mauve, Martin; Vogel, Jiirgen (2001) "Consistency Control for Distributed Interactive Media" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, 2001, Ottawa, Canada 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A couple of basic examples of [https://www.interactivemedia.az/en/ interactive media] (also known as a company in Azerbaijan) are video games and websites. Websites, especially social networking websites provide the interactive use of text and graphics to its users, who interact with each other in various ways such as chatting, playing online games, sharing posts that may include their thoughts and/or pictures and so forth. Video games are also one of the common examples of Interactive Media as the players make use of the joystick/controller to interactively respond to the actions and changes taking place on the game screen generated by the game application, which in turn reacts to the response of the players through the joystick/controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interactive-media.asp|title=Interactive Media|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=28 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and implementation==
Interactive media can be implemented using a variety of platforms and applications that use technology. Some examples include mobile platforms such as touch screen smartphones and tablets, as well as other interactive mediums that are created exclusively to solve a unique problem or set of problems. Interactive media is not limited to a professional environment, it can be used for any technology that responds to user actions. This can include the use of [[JavaScript]] and [[AJAX]] in web pages, but can also be used in programming languages or technology that has similar functionality.

One of the most recent innovations to use interactivity that solves a problem that individuals have on a daily basis is [[Delta Airlines]]'s "Photon Shower".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.cnn.com/delta-teases-us-shower-beats-jet-lag-473471/|title=Delta teases us with 'shower' that beats jet lag - CNN Travel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was developed as a collaboration between Delta Airlines and Professor [[Russell Foster]] of [[Cambridge University]]. The device is designed to reduce the effect of [[Jet lag|jet lag]] on customers that often take long flights across time zones. The interactivity is evident because of how it solves this problem. By observing what time zones a person has crossed and matching those to the basic known sleep cycles of the individual, the machine is able to predict when a person's body is expecting light, and when it is expecting darkness. It then stimulates the individual with the appropriate light source variations for the time, as well as an instructional card to inform them of what times their body expects light and what times it expects darkness. Growth of interactive media continues to advance today, with the advent of more and more powerful machines the limit to what can be input and manipulated on a display in real time is become virtually non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf | title=Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from Birth through Age 8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324042025/http://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/file/positions/PS_technology_WEB2.pdf|archivedate=24 March 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031121333/https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|url=https://www.naeyc.org/files/naeyc/PS_technology_Examples.pdf|title=Selected Examples of Effective Classroom Practice Involving Technology Tools and Interactive Media|archivedate=31 October 2012|publisher=|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/5-interactive-media-examples-of-the-new-mad-men/|title=Marketing|website=Salesforce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3191">A '''lapalissade''' is an obvious truth&amp;mdash;i.e. a [[truism]] or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]]&amp;mdash;which produces a comical effect. It is derived from the name [[Jacques de la Palice]], and the word is used in several languages.&lt;ref name=lebouc&gt;Georges Lebouc, ''2500 noms propres devenus communs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=zl-IBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT389 p. 389]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chabanne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Baker, ''Surrealism, History and Revolution'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=RmOr-yv5ySsC&amp;pg=PA195 p.195] &lt;!--Basically a redundant ref; I added it only to attest the English usage--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
La Palice's [[epitaph]] reads&lt;ref name="chabanne"&gt;Michel Chabanne (14 June 2007), comment on [http://www.mon-expression.info/une-verite-de-la-palice Encyclopédie des Expressions: Une vérité de La Palice / Une lapalissade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234315/http://www.mon-expression.info/une-verite-de-la-palice |date=2009-03-03 }}. Accessed 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lebouc/&gt;
:''"Ci-gît le Seigneur de La Palice: s'il n'était pas mort, il ferait encore envie."''
:("Here lies the Seigneur de La Palice: If he weren't dead, he would still be envied.")
These words were misread (accidentally or intentionally) as "''...il ſerait [serait] encore en vie''" ("...he would still be alive"), where the [[long s]] aids in the confusion.  In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed, including "''... que deux jours avant sa mort / il était encore en vie''" ("... that two days before his death / he was still quite alive") and "''... et quand il était tout nu, / il n'avait point de chemise''"
("... and when he was stark naked / he didn't wear a shirt").

In the early 18th century [[Bernard de la Monnoye]] collected over 50 of these humorous "La Palice" quatrains, and published them as a burlesque [[The Song of la Palice|Song of La Palice]]. From that song came the [[French language|French]] term ''[[wikt:lapalissade|lapalissade]]'' meaning an utterly obvious truth&amp;mdash;i.e. a [[truism]] or [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], and it was borrowed into several other languages. Since that day, when you say something very obvious, your interlocutor answers : ''"La Palice would have said as much !"'' (in French : ''"La Palice en aurait dit autant !"'').

==Similar terms==

In [[Spanish culture]], an analog is a folkloric character {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedro Grullo|es}} (Perogrullo) with his ''[[wikt:es:perogrullada|perogrullada]]s'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CJXBbIXnKKwC&amp;pg=PA131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Verdad de Pedro Grullo, que a la mano cerrada, la llama puño" (The truth of Pedro Grullo, when his hand is closed, he calls it a fist).&lt;ref&gt;A dictionary of Spanish proverbs, 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gPEIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 p. 382]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, one might reference "[[Captain Obvious]]" as having spoken a [[self-evident]] truth. Other kinds of trite expressions are  "[[platitude]]" and "[[wikt:bromide|bromide]]".

[[Image:Leave And Earnings Statement.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Example of an LES]]
A '''Leave and Earnings Statement''', generally referred to as an LES, is a document given on a monthly basis to members of the [[United States military]] which documents their pay and leave status on a monthly basis.

Employees in the [[Civil service in the United States|civil service]] receive a similar document each pay period, called a Civilian Leave and Earnings Statement, a link to which the Defense Finance and Accounting Service emails two days prior to the scheduled pay day.

==Delivery==
While paper LES documents were originally mailed or handed out in person, it is now almost always retrieved by the member from an online system called MyPay from the [[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]]. For U.S. Coast Guard personnel LES can be retrieved by the member from an online system called Direct Access that is controlled by U.S. Coast Guard Personnel Services Command.

==Sections==
There are multiple sections to an LES. 
[[File:LES Sections.png|thumb|alt=Sections of an LES]]

===Pay===
The first section lists the monetary entitlements that month. For all members it consists of Basic Pay, and for many members it also includes [[Basic Allowance for Housing]] and [[United States Military Pay|Basic Allowance for Subsistence]]. Other kinds of pay including [[Cost of Living Allowance]], [[Overseas Housing Allowance]], incentive pay, bonus pay, or hazardous duty pay may be included. 

Per diem and TDY money are usually not included in the LES.

===Deductions===
The second section describes the money that has been deducted. Common deductions include:
*[[Taxation in the United States|Federal and state taxes]]
*[[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]
*[[Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance]] (SGLI) (if the member is a participant)
*[[G. I. Bill of Rights|Montgomery GI Bill]] deduction for the first year (if the member is a participant)
*The service retirement center
*[[Thrift Savings Plan]] (TSP) (if the member is a participant)
*Mid month pay
**Most members receive their money two times per month, on the 15th of the month (known as mid month pay) and on the 1st of the following month (known as end of month pay). The mid month pay is also listed in the deductions section.

===Allotments===
Common allotments include:
*Bank account
**Savings
**Checking
**Loan payment (car, etc.)
*[[TRICARE]] premiums
*[[Combined Federal Campaign]] (CFC) contributions
*Service relief societies (i.e.: [[Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society]], [[Air Force Aid Society]], etc.)

===End of Month Pay===
After all the pay is added, all deductions &amp; allotments are subtracted, and loose ends from previous months are accounted for, what is left is the end of month pay, which is indicated on the far right.

===Leave===
{{Main|Leave (U.S. military)}}
Military members accumulate 2.5 days of leave per month or 30 days per year.  The maximum amount of leave that can accrue is 60 days (this can be more if a member was deployed within the year).  The fiscal year ends on September 30, unless Congress decides to make a change.

* BF Bal - Brought forward leave balance.  This is the unused leave rolled over from the last fiscal year.
* Ernd - The cumulative amount of leave earned in the current fiscal year, or current term of service if the service member re-enlisted or extended since the start of the fiscal year.
* Used - The cumulative amount of leave used during the current fiscal year, or term of enlistment.
* Cr Bal - The current leave balance as of the end of the period covered by the LES.  It is calculated by BF BAL + ERNED - USED.
* ETS Bal - The projected leave available through the current Expiration Term of Service.  This helps make appropriate plans if the member does not plan to re-enlist.
* LV LOST - The amount of leave that has been lost, usually because of having too high a balance at the end of the fiscal year.
* LV Paid - The number of days of leave for which you have been paid to date.
* Use/Lose - The projected number of days of leave that will be lost if not taken on in the current fiscal year on a monthly basis.  The number of days of leave in this block will decrease with any leave usage.

===TSP===
{{Main|Thrift Savings Plan}}
TSP information is listed near the bottom, along with the YTD (calendar year) total tax withholdings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">A '''literary element''', or '''narrative element''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lunsford|Horowitz|2005|p=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''element of literature'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Literature|2015|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a constituent of all works of [[narrative]] [[fiction]]—a necessary feature of verbal storytelling that can be found in any written or spoken narrative. This distinguishes them from [[literary technique]]s, or non-universal features of literature that accompany the construction of a particular work rather than forming the essential characteristics of all narrative. For example, [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Theme (narrative)|theme]], [[Character (arts)|character]] and [[Tone (literature)|tone]] are literary elements, whereas [[figurative language]], [[irony]], or [[foreshadowing]] would be considered literary techniques.

Literary elements aid in the discussion of and understanding of a work of literature as basic categories of critical analysis; literary elements could be said to be produced by the readers of a work just as much as they are produced by its author. For the most part, they are popular concepts that are not limited to any particular branch of [[literary criticism]], although they are most closely associated with the [[Formalism (literature)|formalist method]] of professional literary criticism. There is no official definition or fixed list of terms of literary elements; however, they are a common feature of literary education at the [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] level, and a set of terms similar to the one below often appears in institutional student evaluation. For instance, the New York State Comprehensive English [[Regents Examinations|Regents Exam]] requires that students use and discuss literary elements relating to specific works in each of the three essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regents High School Comprehensive Examination in English|url=http://www.nysedregents.org/ComprehensiveEnglish/113/engl12013-exam.pdf|work=Office of State Assessment|publisher=New York State Education Department|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10278">{{Anthropology of art}}
'''Museum anthropology''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice in the discipline of [[anthropology]].

==Characteristics==
A distinctive characteristic of museum anthropology is that it cross-cuts anthropology's sub-fields ([[archaeology]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]]) as these are understood in North American anthropology. All of these areas are sometimes pursued in museum contexts (usually on the basis of research work with systematic collections) and all can be (and are) explicated in museum-based exhibitions and public programs. Some museum anthropologists work full or part-time in museum contexts while others are anthropologists (employed in diverse settings) interested in studying museums as social institutions in cultural and historical context. These two sets of concerns—collections-based scholarship and the study of museums—provide the core around which the domain of museum anthropology has self-organized.

One theme prominent in recent museum anthropology research concerns reconnecting older collections of ethnographic objects curated in museum contexts with the present-day source communities from which these objects were gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Laura L. Peers and Alison K. Brown, eds. (2003) ''Museums and Source Communities: A Routledge Reader''. (London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison K. Brown and Laura L. Peers (2006) ''Pictures Bring Us Messages: Photographs and Histories from the Kainai Nation''. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is the development of museums and cultural centers by indigenous peoples in their own home communities.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Pierce Erikson with Helma Ward and Kirk Wachendorf (2002) ''Voices of a Thousand People: The Makah Cultural and Research Center''. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwyneira Isaac (2007) ''Mediating Knowledges: Origins of a Zuni Tribal Museum''. (Tucson: University of Arizona Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Christen (2007) Following the Nyinkka: Relations of Respect and Obligations to Act in the Collaborative Work of Aboriginal Cultural Centers.

There is much traffic between museum anthropology and the related, overlapping, and neighboring domains of (general) [[archaeology]], [[museum folklore]], [[material culture studies]], [[historical anthropology]], [[visual anthropology]], the [[anthropology of art]], and the [[history of anthropology]], as well as the [[art history]] of non-western societies and the field of [[museum studies]].

==Journals==
The journals ''[[Museum Anthropology (journal)|Museum Anthropology]]'', ''Journal of Museum Ethnography'', ''[[Gradhiva]]'', and ''[[Museum Anthropology Review]]'' are closely identified with museum anthropology as a field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0892-8339 Museum Anthropology].

==Museum anthropology and ethnography==
Drawing upon critiques of ethnographic representation in written genres, museum anthropologists have asked questions about the strategies used to represent histories and cultures in museum exhibitions and related forms of display (such as worlds fairs).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Handler and Eric Gable (1997) ''The New History in an Old Museum: Creating the Past at Colonial Williamsburg''. (Durham: Duke University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett (1998) ''Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage''. (Berkeley: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Related is historical work in which museum anthropologists seek to better understand the contexts, histories and biographies that shaped both the field and the collections that contemporary curators steward.&lt;ref&gt;Amiria Henare (2005) ''Museums, Anthropology and Imperial Exchange''. (New York: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard Krech III, ed. (1999) ''Collecting Native America, 1870–1960''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Jacknis (2002) ''The Storage Box of Tradition: Kwakiutl Art, Anthropologists, and Museums, 1881–1981''. (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Such historical concerns in turn intersect with work addressing repatriation claims and broader cultural property issues as these relate to museums.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Fine-Dare (2002) ''Grave injustice: The American Indian Repatriation Movement and NAGPRA''. (Lincoln : University of Nebraska Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Brown (2003) ''Who Owns Native Culture?'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of museum collections as a resource for research aimed at understanding ethnographic and culture historical questions in the lives of particular communities has long been the core motivation for collecting by anthropology museums. Such work has been central throughout the history of the field, but new developments in digital technologies (and the rise of the so-called [[digital humanities]]) together with the transformations that have motivated the new research interests just mentioned have generated an intensification of such work. A general revitalization of material culture studies is a further factor conditioning the renewal of collections-based research in the present period. The fruits of this work include new digital archives and databases, as well as published studies focusing on particular groups, object forms, and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chacoarchive.org/ The Chaco Research Archive].

== United Kingdom and North America ==
Professional organizations central to the museum anthropology domain include the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] (a section of the American Anthropological Association) in the United States and the [[Museum Ethnographers Group]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;[http://www.museumethnographersgroup.org.uk/ Making connections through world collections].

Retrieved on 2011-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom and in North America, most universities that possess both anthropology degree programs and campus-based museums of anthropology will also offer specific training and coursework in museum anthropology. Specialized training for graduate students in collections-based research in museum anthropology (focusing on ethnographic rather than archaeological, biological, or linguistics collections) is provided in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology (SIMA), an initiative funded by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.si.edu/summerinstitute/index.htm Smithsonian Institution Summer Institute in Museum Anthropology].

The '''Nizkor Project''' ({{lang-he|נִזְכּוֹר}}, "we will remember")  is an [[Internet]]-based project run by [[B'nai Brith Canada]] which is dedicated to countering [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nizkor Project|url=http://fighthatred.com/522/the-nizkor-project/|work=Fight Hatred|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the project==
The website was founded by [[Kenneth McVay|Ken McVay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Directory - The Nizkor Project|url=http://www.mvjf.org/IR/community-directory.aspx?id=3025&amp;category=637|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as a central Web-based archive for the large numbers of documents made publicly available by the users of the newsgroup ''alt.revisionism'' and gifted to B'nai Brith Canada in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The site also archives numerous postings made to the newsgroup since the early 1990s. It does not archive every single posting ever made to the newsgroup; rather, the maintainers of the web site have selected various messages for display that are seen as presenting factual information about [[the Holocaust]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nizkor Project holocaust web crawler|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/nizkor-search.html|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or, in the case of some posters, about the authors of the messages themselves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In addition to providing an extensive archive of documents regarding the Holocaust, including the transcripts of the 1st Nuremberg Tribunal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Military Tribunal Nuremberg|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/|work=Nizkor|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nizkor Project also seeks to expose the activities of Holocaust deniers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Newslink|url=http://edition.cnn.com/almanac/9605/10/|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=May 10, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the postings to the newsgroup over the years, it has compiled extensive writings from self-proclaimed revisionists, including [[David Irving]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Irving|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/i/irving-david/|work=Nizkor|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Zündel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ernst Zündel|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/|work=Nizkor|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael A. Hoffman II]], and others.
Among the various pieces of information stored at Nizkor is a sound recording of an [[answering machine]] message allegedly made by [[white supremacist]] [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]], encouraging various individuals to "take action" against "Zinkor {{sic}} on the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.A.R. Targets Nizkor|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/american/war/war-targets-nizkor.html|work=Nizkor Project|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] congratulated the NIZKOR who was one of those that initiated the effort that lead to the successful prosecution of three NAZI war criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=5711841&amp;ct=7499875|title=Wiesenthal Center Praises Indictment by Spanish Court of Three Nazi War Criminals Denaturalized and Ordered Deported From the United States - Simon Wiesenthal Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Criticisms===
Holocaust denial Web sites and spokespersons have made repeated accusations against McVay, challenging his neutrality and attacking him personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much of Nizkor's material is truth?|url=http://codoh.com/library/document/1056|work=codoh|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nizkor web site has been accused by self-proclaimed "Holocaust revisionists" and [[neo-Nazi]] Web sites as being funded by [[Israel]] and other [[Zionism|Zionist]] sources, though McVay consistently denies these charges. He states that the Nizkor Project is funded solely by donations from the general public, as well as his own personal finances.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the late 1990s, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the Nizkor Project for increasing the visibility of hate groups and Holocaust deniers, even as it sought to debunk them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Littman Letter|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/l/littman-sol/littman-letter.html|work=Nizkor|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This debate between [[free speech]] advocates such as McVay and those who favor the suppression of speech with [[hate crime]] laws continued throughout the late 1990s, but has now mostly been resolved with the two sides agreeing on the common goal of confronting holocaust deniers and keeping their disagreements over specific tactics private. In 1996, McVay spoke out against Internet hate crime laws in Canada in front of a committee of the Canadian Parliament, stating that it is better to address the false claims of Holocaust deniers, rather than to censor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/35/Archives/committees352/huso/evidence/05_96-04-30/huso-05-cover-e.html |title=Committee Evidence, House of Commons of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Development Preschool Program''' in Great Britain, is an approach to [[early childhood development]], that emphasizes a caring, nurturing, positive atmosphere, for preschoolers to learn through personal, directed experience and [[creativity]].  In the [[Oxford]] Program, every minute is a ‘teaching moment’ and every action, attitude and interaction is undergirded with an unwavering commitment to each child as a unique and delightful individual; an individual that should be guided through an exciting, sequential [[journey of self-discovery]] and personal creativity, as they develop a sense of [[Moral character|character]], good judgment, and positive [[self-worth]] while building foundational language and mathematical skills in an environment rich in [[social development]].&lt;ref&gt;"Journal of Character Education", Oxford Developmental Preschool Program Comes to Wisconsin, Madison: March, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Oxford Development Preschool Program was founded in [[Great Britain]] in the early 1980s, as part of a growing recognition that lifelong character traits and [[social skills]] are inculcated in the earliest years of childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;Character Matters: How to Help Our Children Develop Good Judgment, Integrity, and Other Essential Virtues, Thomas Lickoma, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on the ground-breaking insights of the Oxford Preschool Research Project, the Program began with the hope that every child's first five years might be put to their fullest use towards the goals of lifelong physical, emotional, spiritual and relational health along with personal contentment, self-awareness discipline, a strong moral character and a sense of community responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Under Five in Britain: the Oxford Preschool Research Project, Jerome Bruner, London: Grant McIntyre, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The activities and daily schedule of the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program optimize sensory, motor, perceptual, language and mathematical skill advancement and enhancement through child-centered, active, creative involvement.&lt;ref&gt;"Early Childhood Research Quarterly", Influences on Children's Competence in Early Childhood Classrooms, Susan Kontos and Amanda Wilcox-Herzog, Lafayette, Indiana: 1997, pp. 247-262&lt;/ref&gt; In the Oxford Program, the process as is important as the product, therefore, children learn through a meaningful symmetry of projects and activities balancing teacher-directed structure and [[free choice]], reinforced through repetition.

Fundamental to the Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is respect for each child as an individual and an understanding of the uniqueness of every family situation and structure.  An Oxford Developmental Preschool seeks to work as a ‘team’ with parents and guardians to create a consistent and dynamic developmental synthesis between home and school so that each child&amp;nbsp;– beginning at their stage of development and progressing without anxiety or pressure&amp;nbsp;– will attain their greatest potential while developing a love and excitement for learning.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Teacher Education'', "Dispositions as Virtues: The Complexity of the Construct", Hugh Sockett, Washington: May/June, 2009, pp. 292-303&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequential Development ==
The Oxford Preschool Developmental Program fosters a sense of security and consistency as essentials for healthy emotional, social and mental development, therefore, all activities and schedule follow an easily understood, child-centered, gently teacher-directed sequence.  Children are guided through a wide range of interconnection, ‘hands-on’ activities and encouraged to use their personal creativity and curiosity in focused Discovery Centers.

In Life Discovery Centers, children are introduced to nature (and in the growing months, to outdoor vegetable and flower gardens); in the Arts and Crafts Center, children are free to experiment and create within a safe and encouraging space; in the Mathematics Center, some puzzles, games and manipulatives stimulate cognitive development through play and interaction; and, in the Home and Health Center, children learn household safety, housekeeping and healthy habits through dramatic play.

== Character Education ==
The Oxford Preschool Developmental Program is committed to an intentional, focused and individually sensitive effort to instill in the child entrusted to their care core universal, [[ethical values]] such integrity, honesty, fairness, responsibility, and respect for themselves and for others.  Following the model of sequential, experiential learning, the school calendar has followed themes that guide, teach and reinforce a logical synthesis of character qualities and cognitive and [[social development]].

[[File:Scope advertising, The Times, 1994.jpg|thumbnail|Advertising for second passports and information about becoming a "Perpetual Traveller". Scope, ''The Times'', 1994.]]
The term "'''perpetual traveler'''" (also "'''PT'''", "'''permanent tourist'''", or "'''prior taxpayer'''") refers to the idea that by basing different aspects of one's life in different countries and not spending too long in any one place, a person can reduce taxes, avoid civic duties, and increase personal freedom. Books and services relating to the PT idea have been a staple of companies that specialise in marketing [[Offshore financial centre|offshore financial services]], [[tax avoidance]] schemes, and personal privacy services.

==Principles==
The perpetual traveler idea proposes that individuals live in such a way that they are not considered a [[Residency (domicile)|legal resident]] of any of the countries in which they spend time or operate. By lacking a legal permanent residence status, the theory goes, they may avoid the legal obligations which accompany residency, such as income and asset [[tax]]es, social security contributions, [[jury|jury duty]], and [[military service]].{{citation required|date=February 2016}} The idea has been described as a "late capitalist nomadism".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25691117 "Cyberspatial Sovereignties: Offshore Finance, Digital Cash, and the Limits of Liberalism"], Bill Maurer, ''[[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 2 (Spring 1998), pp. 493-519.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag theory==
The perpetual traveler idea has been presented in terms of flag theory, wherein each flag represents one of the legal jurisdictions under which the perpetual traveller operates. The Three Flags Theory is credited to investment pundit [[Harry D. Schultz]], who proposed that everyone should have a second passport and an address in a tax haven  and that their assets should be kept outside their home country. The idea was later expanded to Five Flags to include a place where money was earned and a place for recreation.

Whether to minimize governmental interference (via taxes or otherwise), or to maximize privacy, the theory proposes that each of the following should be in a separate country:

# [[Passport]] and [[citizenship]] – in a country that does not tax money earned outside the country or control actions.
# [[Law|Legal]] [[tax residence|residence]] – in a [[tax haven]].
# Business base – where one earns one's money, ideally somewhere with low [[corporate tax]] rates.
# [[Asset]] haven - where one keeps one's money, ideally somewhere with low taxation of passive income and capital gains.
# Playgrounds - where one spends one's money, ideally somewhere with low [[consumption tax]]es.

In 1995, financial commentator [[Bob Beckman]] commented about his residence in Monaco: "A long time ago, I was told that the most efficient way for an individual to handle his affairs was to work one place, keep his money in a second place and live in a third place. I live in Monaco. I don't work here, my money is placed elsewhere, but managed from here."&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.monaco.mc/actualite/95nov/a_beck.html|title=Robert C. Beckman An American in Monaco|periodical=''Monaco Actualité''|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope International and W.G. Hill==
Harry Schultz's ideas were picked up by Scope International Limited&lt;ref&gt;No. 01482077. Incorporated as Scope-books Limited 28 February 1980. Now dissolved.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Waterlooville]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eP0zAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=scope+international+waterlooville&amp;dq=scope+international+waterlooville&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1jqrRxuXKAhWBYA8KHa4jDvkQ6AEIPjAH Cassell and the Publishers Association directory of publishing 1994: UK, Commonwealth and overseas]''. 19th edition. Continuum International Publishing, 1993. p. 138. {{ISBN|0304328200}}&lt;/ref&gt; England (not related to Scope International owned by Standard Chartered Bank), who popularized the idea through a series of books they published under the name of W.G. Hill (William G. Hill) (possibly a pseudonym) in the 1980s and 90s which were sold through [[classified advertising]] in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Classified advertising. ''The Times'', 3 May 1991, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1989, they published ''PT: A coherent plan for a stress-free, healthy and prosperous life without government interference, taxes or coercion'' by Hill which was said to have been "inspired and edited by Harry Donald Schultz"&lt;ref&gt;British Library. Retrieved 4 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and went through up to seven editions. In 1993, they published ''PT2: The practice: freedom and privacy tactics: A reference handbook'' by Hill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31167005 Worldcat.] Retrieved 7 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which also went through several editions. Other books published by Scope and said to have been written by Hill include ''Banking in silence'', ''The Monaco report'' and ''Think like a tycoon''.

'''Piblokto''', also known as '''pibloktoq''' and '''Arctic hysteria''', is a condition most commonly appearing in [[Inughuit]] ([[Greenlandic Inuit]]) societies living within the [[Arctic Circle]]. Piblokto is a culture-specific hysterical reaction in [[Inuit]], especially women, who may perform irrational or dangerous acts, followed by amnesia for the event. Piblokto may be linked to repression of the personality of [[Inuit women]].&lt;ref&gt;Segen's Medical Dictionary. (2012). Farlex, Inc. [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pibloktoq ''Pibloktoq'']&lt;/ref&gt; The condition appears most commonly in winter.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S., Shelor, N., &amp; Abdelnour, M. (1972). [http://soar.wichita.edu/xmlui//handle/10057/1641 Nutritional ecology: a new perspective].&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a form of a [[culture-bound syndrome]], although more recent studies (see ''Skepticism'' section) question whether it exists at all. Piblokto is also part of the glossary of cultural bound syndromes found in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV).&lt;ref&gt;Mezzich, Juan E. (2002). "International Surveys on the Use of ICD-10 and Related Diagnostic Systems" (guest editorial, abstract). Psychopathology. doi:10.1159/000065122. {{PMID|12145487}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Piblokto was first documented in 1892 and reports by European explorers describe the phenomenon as common to all [[Arctic]] regions. Explorers were the first to notice piblokto. Among these, Admiral [[Robert Peary]] provided a detailed look into the disorder during an expedition to [[Greenland]]. The acts Peary and his men witnessed among the Inuit women provided entertainment, and, having sent the women's male counterparts out on missions, Peary's men reaped the sexual benefits of being the only males present.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C. and Robert E. Ackerman. (Anthropologica, 1960). Pibloktoq-An Interdisciplinary Approach to Mental Disorder among the Polar Eskimos of Northwest Greenland.Vol. II(2):249-260&lt;/ref&gt; Piblokto is not limited to the [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous people]]; reports of stranded sailors during the 1800s exhibiting the same symptoms have been found. The disorder is said to have existed before Western contact and still occurs today.&lt;ref&gt;Lister,J. [http://soar-dev.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1813/LAJ_v20_p111-129.pdf.txt?sequence=3 TWO PERSPECTIVES ON THE ETIOLOGY OF PIBLOKTOQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220023309/http://soar-dev.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1813/LAJ_v20_p111-129.pdf.txt?sequence=3 |date=2015-02-20 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, as discussed below, many scholars now hold that culture bound disorders may often be an artifact of colonial encounters, and contemporary discussions of piblokto in [[medical anthropology]] and [[cross-cultural psychiatry]] consider it to be an example of the suspect nature of [[culture bound syndromes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Karen. 2013. A Disability of the Soul: An Ethnography of Disability and Mental Illness in Contemporary Japan. Cornell University Press. p98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Piblokto is most often found but not confined to the [[Inuit culture|Inughuit culture]] in the [[Polar regions of Earth|polar regions]] of northern Greenland. Similar symptoms have been reported in European sailors stranded in [[Arctic]] regions in the 1800s. Among the Inughuit, the attacks are not considered out of the ordinary. No native theory of the disorder is currently reported. This condition is most often seen in Inughuit women.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, P. (2007) [http://www.sequeltsi.com/files/library/Understanding_Cultural_Identity.pdf Focusing on Culture and Ethnicity in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326002708/http://www.sequeltsi.com/files/library/Understanding_Cultural_Identity.pdf |date=2012-03-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Piblokto is most common during long [[Polar night|Arctic nights]].&lt;ref&gt;Brill, A. (August 1913) [http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Citation/1913/08000/Piblokto_or_Hysteria_Among_Peary_s_Eskimos.2.aspx Piblokto or Hysteria Among Peary's Eskimos]. Volume 40. Issue 8. pp. 514-520.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Piblokto is an abrupt dissociative episode with four phases: social withdrawal, excitement, convulsions and stupor, and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Fulk,M. (2012) [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/328614.html Pibloktoq].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Although there is no known cause for piblokto, Western scientists have attributed the disorder to the lack of sun, the extreme cold, and the desolate state of most villages in the region. A reason for this disorder present in this culture may be due to the isolation of their cultural group.&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"&gt;Ephron, Sarah. (July/August 2003) [http://www.sarahefron.com/stories/arctichysteria.shtml ''Arctic Hysteria''], from [http://www.uphere.ca Up Here Magazine]; archived at SarahEfron.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This culture-bound syndrome is possibly linked to [[vitamin A]] toxicity ([[hypervitaminosis A]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kontaxakis, V., Skourides, D., Ferentinos, P., Havaki-Kontaxaki, B., &amp; Papadimitriou, G.(2009)."Isotretinoid and Psychopathology: A Review", ''Annals of General Psychiatry'', 8 (2), doi: 10.1186/1744-859X-8-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wiseGEEK"&gt;Smith, S. (2012, December 6). [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-piblokto.htm What is Piblokto?] wiseGEEK: clear answers for common questions. Retrieved March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The native [[Inuit cuisine|Inughuit diet]] or [[Eskimo]] nutrition provides rich sources of vitamin&amp;nbsp;A through the ingestion of livers, kidneys, and fat of arctic fish and mammals and is possibly the cause or a causative factor. This causative factor is through the disturbance that has been reported for males, females, adults, children, and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Landy,D. (1985) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4049004 Pibloktoq (hysteria) and Inuit nutrition: possible implication of hypervitaminosis A].&lt;/ref&gt; The ingestion of [[Offal|organ meats]], particularly the [[Liver (food)|livers]] of some Arctic mammals, such as the [[polar bear]] and [[bearded seal]], where the vitamin is stored in toxic quantities, can be fatal to most people.

Inughuit tradition states that it is caused by evil spirits possessing the living. [[Shamanism]] and [[animism]] are dominant themes in [[Inuit religion|Inughuit traditional beliefs]] with the [[angakkuq]] (healer) acting as a mediator with the supernatural forces. Angakkuit use trance states to communicate with spirits and carry out faith healing. There is a view among the Inughuit that individuals entering trance states should be treated with respect given the possibility of a new "revelation" emerging as a result. Treatment in piblokto cases usually involves allowing the episode to run its course without interference. While piblokto can often be confused with other conditions, (including [[epilepsy]]) in which failure to intervene can lead to the victim coming to harm, most cases tend to be more typical.

==Skepticism==
Although piblokto has a place in the historical record and official medical canons, a number of Arctic researchers and Arctic residents doubt its existence. The phenomena, they suggest, may be more rooted in the experience and behavior of the early European explorers than the Inuit themselves.&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"/&gt;

In 1988 [[Parks Canada]] historian Lyle Dick began a substantial challenge to the concept that piblokto exists at all. Dick examined the original records of the European [[Arctic exploration|Arctic explorers]], and ethnographic and linguistic reports on Inughuit societies, and discovered that not only is the majority of academic speculation into piblokto based on reports of only eight cases, but the word "piblokto" / "pibloktoq" does not exist within [[Inuktun]] (the Inughuit language); possibly, Dick concluded, this may have been the result of errors in [[phonetic transcription]]. In a 1995 paper published in the journal ''[[Arctic Anthropology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dick|first=L|title="Pibloktoq"(Arctic Hysteria): A construction of European-Inuit relations.|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=February 1995|volume=32|issue=2|pages=2|url=http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?hid=23&amp;sid=fcfa52f5-9576-463b-9e9c-52ae709b9f3a%40sessionmgr15&amp;vid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9512292521|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his 2001 book ''Muskox land: Ellesmere Island in the Age of Contact'', Dick suggests that piblokto is a "phantom phenomenon", arising more from the [[culture shock|Inuhuit reaction to European explorers in their midst]].&lt;ref name = "ArcticHis"/&gt;

Similarly, Hughes and Simons have described piblokto as a "catch-all rubric under which explorers lumped various Inuhuit anxiety reactions, expressions of resistance to [[patriarchy]] or [[sexual coercion]], and shamanistic practice".&lt;ref&gt;Simons, R. C., Hughes, C. C. The culture-bound syndromes: folk illnesses of psychiatric and anthropological interest. D. Reidel Publishing Company, (1985), Holland. p. 275, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, rather than understanding piblokto as a strange cultural phenomenon, some critical scholars now understand it to be an expression of trauma of colonial violence, including rape. For example, transcultural psychiatry scholars Lawrence Kirmayer and Harry Minas write: 

″Most comprehensive psychiatric texts mention pibloktoq
as a culture-bound syndrome characterized by sudden wild and erratic
behaviour. Recently, the historian Lyle Dick collected all the published accounts
of pibloktoq, of which there are only about 25. It seems that psychiatric
case description transformed a situation of sexual exploitation of Inuit
women by explorers into a discrete disorder worthy of a new diagnostic
label. With hindsight, we can see how insensitivity to the impact of exploration
on other peoples distorted the picture when vital information on
social context was not included. The legacy of these colonialist blinkers is
still with us. . .″ &lt;ref&gt;Kirmayer, L. J. (2007). Cultural psychiatry in historical perspective. Textbook of cultural psychiatry, 3-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prishtina International Film Festival''', also known as the '''Pristina Film Festival''' and '''PriFilmFest''', is a [[film festival]] held annually in [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]], that screens prominent international cinema productions in the [[Balkans|Balkan region]] and beyond, and draws attention to the Kosovar [[film industry]]. It was created after the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]]. The first festival was held in 2009, and featured actress [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as the host. In 2015, the festival was cancelled due to a cut in funding by the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo. The 7th edition of the festival, which was scheduled to take place from 24 April to 1 May, was thus instead held in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] on 24 and 25 April and renamed to "PriFest in Exile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prifest.org/?id=3&amp;n=187&amp;l=en |title=PriFest in exile, Minister of Culture responsible |work=PriFest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&amp;l=en&amp;did=288271|title=PriFest cancelled owing to lack of state support |work=Cineuropa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|its independence in 2008]], Kosovo looked for ways to promote its cultural and artistic image. Vjosa Berisha "designed a project on promoting Kosovo internationally and build a better image for Kosovo." The project became PriFilmFest; Berisha served as an artistic director.&lt;ref name="naac"/&gt; The organizers submitted a proposal for the festival for June 2009, with actress Vanessa Redgrave serving as the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name="withoutabox"&gt;{{cite web

| work = Without A Box

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rescheduled to September. {{As of|2009|10}}, it has become one of five active Kosovar film festivals that have emerged from 2002.&lt;ref name="openair"/&gt;

PriFilmFest posted that its mission was "to open doors of the newest country in the world, Kosovo, to welcome different cultures of the world through cinema, using it as a medium to promote open dialog between cultures and nations." It brought in international directors and producers, and promotes Kosovar films. Its organizers have stated that Kosovo should not be known solely for political events, but for its culture.&lt;ref name="NKR"/&gt; Berisha stated that PriFilmFest was inspired by the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]], which had "branded the city internationally."&lt;ref name="openair"/&gt;

As part of the event, the winners would each receive a statue called the Golden Goddess, which was based on "Goddess of the throne", a terracotta figure from the [[Neolithic]] period that was discovered in Kosovo in 1960, and had become the city's symbol.&lt;ref name="prishtinapress"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web

==PriFilm Forum==

Starting with the second edition in 2010, the PriFilmFest launched a co-production group called PriFilm Forum. It consisted of seminars, workshops, and discussions designed to connect Kosovar filmmakers with those in neighboring countries. The two-day workshop in 2010 brought together filmmakers from Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia; they listened to presentations from co-production professionals, including EAVE (European Audio-Visual Entrepreneurs), Medienboard (German Film Fund), and Robert Bosch Stiftung. Producers and filmmakers from Bosnia, Croatia and Bulgaria shared their experiences.

==PriFilmFest 2009==
The first edition ran from 22 September to 30 September 2009. The slogan for the first edition was "The beginning...", which referenced [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' quote: “This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”&lt;ref name="openair"&gt;{{cite web

The event included both competition and non-competition films.&lt;ref name="southeast"/&gt; Six awards were presented. The event only screened one Kosovar film: ''Across the Road'' by Yll Citaku. However, the film was not qualified for the competition section, because it had been filmed in digital camera format.&lt;ref name="openair"/&gt; The festival also fostered discussion among the filmmakers and the audience on how to help filmmaking in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="openair"/&gt;

A '''public aquarium''' (plural: ''public aquaria'' or '' public aquariums'') is the aquatic counterpart of a [[zoo]], which houses living [[aquatic animal]] and [[aquatic plant|plant]] specimens for public viewing. Most public [[aquarium]]s feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists, as well as smaller tanks. Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid-19th century, they have become popular and their numbers have increased. Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public.&lt;ref name="azacon"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205213201/http://www.aza.org/Newsroom/PR_VisitorImpact/ Visitor Impact], [http://www.aza.org/ AZA official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Detroit aquarium 1890-1910.jpg|thumb|left|Various aquariums at the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit, Michigan c. 1900]]
[[Image:Aqwa stingray.jpg|thumb|right|A stingray at the [[Aquarium of Western Australia]], Australia's largest public aquarium]]
[[File:Hyogo ikesu.jpg|thumbnail|An early aquarium in Japan in the 18th century]]
The first public [[aquarium]] was opened in [[London Zoo]] in May 1853; the ''Fish House'', as it came to be known, was constructed much like a [[greenhouse]].&lt;ref name=Brunner&gt;{{cite book | last = Brunner | first = Bernd | title = The Ocean at Home | publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2003 | location = New York | isbn = 1-56898-502-9 | pages = 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[P.T. Barnum]] quickly followed in 1856 with the first American aquarium as part of his established [[Barnum's American Museum]], which was located on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[New York City]] before it burned down.&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt; In 1859, the [[Boston Aquarial Gardens|Aquarial Gardens]] were founded in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt; A number of aquariums then opened in Europe, such as the [[Jardin d'Acclimatation]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Vienna|Viennese]] Aquarium Salon (both founded 1860), the Marine Aquarium Temple as part of the [[Zoological Garden of Hamburg|Zoological Garden]] in [[Hamburg]] (1864), as well as aquariums in [[Berlin]] (1869) and [[Brighton]] (1872).&lt;ref name=Brunner/&gt;

The old Berlin Aquarium opened in 1869.
The building site was to be ''Unter den Linden'' (along a major avenue), in the centre of town, not at the [[Berlin Zoological Garden|Berlin Zoo]].
The aquarium's first director, [[Alfred Brehm]], former director of the [[Zoological Garden of Hamburg|Hamburg Zoo]] from 1863 to 1866, served until 1874.&lt;ref name=Hoage69&gt;Strehlow, Harro, "Zoos and Aquariums of Berlin" in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.69. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With its emphasis on [[education]], the public aquarium was designed like a grotto, part of it made of natural rock. The ''Geologische Grotte'' depicted "the strata of the [[earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]]". The grotto also featured [[bird]]s and pools for [[earless seal|seal]]s.
The Aquarium ''Unter den Linden'' was a three-story building. Machinery and water tanks were on the ground floor, [[aquarium]] basins for the [[fish]] on the first floor. Because of Brehm's special interest in [[bird]]s, a huge [[aviary]], with [[cage (enclosure)|cage]]s for [[mammal]]s placed around it, was located on the second floor.
The facility closed in 1910.&lt;ref name=Hoage70&gt;Strehlow, Harro, "Zoos and Aquariums of Berlin" in ''New World, New Animals: From Menagerie to Zoological Park in the Nineteenth Century'', Hoage, Robert J. and Deiss, William A. (ed.), Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1996, p.70. {{ISBN|0-8018-5110-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artis aquarium at [[Natura Artis Magistra|Amsterdam Zoo]] was constructed inside a Victorian building in 1882, and was renovated in 1997.
At the end of the 19th century the Artis aquarium was considered state-of-the-art, as it was again at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Van Bruggen, A.C., "Notes on the Buildings of Amsterdam Zoo", [http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/319/IZN-319.htm#amst International Zoo News Vol.49/6 (No.319)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411023210/http://www.zoonews.ws/IZN/319/IZN-319.htm#amst |date=2008-04-11 }}, September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to its closing on September 30, 2013, the oldest American aquarium was the [[National Aquarium in Washington, D.C.]], founded in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;David Lin, former Director of Operations, National Aquarium, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the opening of other public aquariums: San Francisco ([[Woodward's Gardens]], 1873–1890), [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]] ([[Woods Hole Science Aquarium]], 1885), New York ([[New York Aquarium]], 1896–present), La Jolla ([[Birch Aquarium|Scripps]], 1903), Honolulu ([[Waikiki Aquarium]], 1904–present), Detroit ([[Belle Isle Aquarium]], 1904–2005, 2012–Present), Philadelphia ([[Philadelphia Aquarium]], 1911–1962), San Francisco ([[Steinhart Aquarium]], 1923), Chicago ([[Shedd Aquarium]], 1929). For many years, the Shedd Aquarium was the largest aquarium in the United States until the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in [[Atlanta]] opened 2005. 
Entertainment and aquatic circus exhibits were combined as themes in Philadelphia's [[Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea]] (1962–1969) and Camden's re-invented [[Adventure Aquarium]] 2005, formerly the [[New Jersey State Aquarium]] (1992).

The first Japanese public aquarium, a small freshwater aquarium, was opened at the [[Ueno Zoo]] in 1882.&lt;ref name=Kisling298&gt;Kawata, Ken, "Zoological Gardens of Japan", in ''Zoo and Aquarium History: Ancient Collections to Zoological Gardens'', Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2001, p.298. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Georgia Aquarium, with more than 8 million U.S. gallons (6.7 million imp gal; 30 million L) of marine and fresh water, and more than 100,000 animals of 500 different species opened in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The aquarium's notable specimens include [[whale sharks]] and [[beluga whales]].

==Public aquariums today==
[[Image:Male whale shark at Georgia Aquarium.jpg|thumb|A male [[whale shark]] in [[Georgia Aquarium]]'s largest aquarium]]
Modern aquarium tanks can hold millions of litres of water and can house large species, including [[dolphin]]s, [[shark]]s or [[Beluga (whale)|beluga]] whales. This is accomplished through thick, clear [[acrylic glass]] windows. Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals, including [[otter]]s,&lt;ref name = "Otter"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsSeaOtters.asp?sid=2 Sea Otters], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[pinniped|seals]]&lt;ref name = "Seal"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsSeals.asp?sid=2 Seals], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; are often cared for at aquariums. Some establishments, such as the [[Oregon Coast Aquarium]] or the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]], have aquatic [[aviary|aviaries]].&lt;ref name = "Birds"&gt;[http://www.aquarium.org/exhibitsBirds.asp?sid=2 Birds], [http://www.aquarium.org/  Oregon Coast Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandy Shores"&gt;[http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/sandy.asp Sandy Shores] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212155628/http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/sandy.asp |date=2009-02-12 }}, [http://www.mbayaq.org/  Monterey Bay Aquarium's official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214235655/http://www.mbayaq.org/ |date=2009-02-14 }}, accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern aquariums also include land animals and plants that spend time in or near the water.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leighton R., ''Aquariums: Windows to Nature'', Prentice Hall General Reference, New York, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-85019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For marketing purposes, many aquariums promote special exhibits, in addition to their permanent collections. Some have aquatic versions of a [[petting zoo]]. The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] has a shallow tank filled with common types of [[batoidea|rays]]&lt;ref name="Sharks and Rays"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020056/http://www.mbayaq.org/efc/smm_meet.asp Sharks and Rays], [http://www.mbayaq.org/  Monterey Bay Aquarium's official website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214235655/http://www.mbayaq.org/ |date=2009-02-14 }}, accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which visitors are encouraged to touch.  The [[South Carolina Aquarium]] lets visitors feed the rays in their Saltmarsh Aviary exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logistics==
[[Image:Feeding time melb aquarium.jpg|thumb|right|Feeding time at [[Melbourne Aquarium]] draws a large crowd]]
Most public aquariums are located close to the [[ocean]], for a steady supply of natural seawater. An inland pioneer was [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Shedd Aquarium]]&lt;ref name="Shedd History 1"&gt;[http://www.sheddaquarium.org/history.html Shedd History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515082202/http://www.sheddaquarium.org/history.html |date=2008-05-15 }}, [http://www.sheddaquarium.org/  Shedd Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; that received seawater shipped by rail in special tank cars. The early (1911) [[Philadelphia Aquarium]], built in the city's disused [[Fairmount Water Works|water works]], had to switch to treated city water when the nearby river became too contaminated.&lt;ref name = "Shedd History 2"&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/phso/rtca2001/news_waterworks.htm], [http://www.nps.gov/  Philadelphia Inquirer article], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the recently opened [[Georgia Aquarium]] filled its tanks with fresh water from the city water system and salinated its salt water exhibits using the same commercial salt and mineral additives available to home aquarists. The [[South Carolina Aquarium]] pulls the salt water for their exhibits right out of the Charleston harbor.

In January 1985, Kelly Tarlton began construction of the first aquarium to include a large transparent [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] tunnel, [[Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium|Kelly Tarlton's Underwater World]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. Construction took 10 months and cost NZ$3 million. The {{convert|110|m|ft|adj=on}} tunnel was built from one-[[tonne]] (2,200-lb) slabs of German sheet plastic that were shaped locally in an oven. A moving walkway now transports visitors through, and groups of school children occasionally hold sleepovers there beneath the swimming sharks and rays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/kelly_tarltons_antarctic_encounter_underwater_world_auckland_index.html Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World, Auckland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503111959/http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/kelly_tarltons_antarctic_encounter_underwater_world_auckland_index.html |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Public aquariums are often affiliated with oceanographic research institutions or conduct their own research programs, and sometimes specialize in species and ecosystems that can be found in local waters. For example, the [[Vancouver Aquarium]] in [[Vancouver, BC]] is a major center for marine research, conservation, and marine animal rehabilitation, particularly for the rich ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name = "vanaqua"&gt;[http://www.vanaqua.org/research/ Research], [http://www.vanaqua.org/ Vancouver Aquarium's official website], accessed February 3rd, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vancouver Aquarium]] was the first aquarium to capture and display an [[orca]] whale, Moby Doll, for three months in 1964; as well as [[Beluga (whale)|belugas]], [[narwhals]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mi.mun.ca/mi-net/fishdeve/cetace14.htm Narwhal (Monodon monoceros)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526034038/http://www.mi.mun.ca/mi-net/fishdeve/cetace14.htm |date=2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dolphin]]s. The [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] was the first public aquarium to display a [[great white shark]]. Beginning in September 2004, the Outer Bay exhibit (now the Open Sea galleries) was the home to the first in a series of great white sharks. The shark was at the aquarium for 198 days (the previous record was 16 days). The shark was released on March 31, 2005. The [[Adventure Aquarium]] in New Jersey has [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s. The [[Aquarium du Quebec]] houses [[polar bear]]s.

{{nihongo|'''''Shadow of Memories'''''|シャドウ・オブ・メモリーズ|Shadou obu Memorīzu}} ('''''Shadow of Destiny''''' in North America) is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo]] and published by [[Konami]]. Originally released for the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2001, it was later ported to [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (which is only released in Europe) and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2002. A [[PlayStation Portable]] version was released on October 1, 2009 in Japan and on January 26, 2010 in North America.

==Gameplay==

The objective of ''Shadow of Memories'' is to guide [[player character]] Eike Kusch through the fictional [[Germany|German]] town of Lebensbaum (Life's Tree) as he travels through time to prevent and unmask his murderer.&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/07/shadow-of-destiny-2 |title=Shadow of Destiny (PS2) |date=March 6, 2001 |author=Zdyrko, David |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the [[non-player character]] [[Homunculus]], and travels back in time before his death with the intent of changing events to prevent it.

== Plot ==
Set in a fictional [[Germany|German]] town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), ''Shadow of Memories'' revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by [[Charles Martinet]] in English), a [[djinn]] or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1979/1980, 1902 and 1580 to 1584 — as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day [[fortune teller]], who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private [[art museum]] who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarete; and Alfred Brum, the [[great-grandfather]] of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarete or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the [[Philosopher's Stone]], to resurrect his mother.

===Endings===
''Shadow of Memories'' consists of eight endings, with six available at first. The last two must be unlocked by achieving the first six. The endings are presented in an alphabetical format, A–E, with B having two variations, and then two "EX" endings.  In all endings, he discovers that Homunculus was using him to ensure that he would be "created" (actually unsealed) by Wagner, and returns the digipad to him.

'''Ending A:''' Eike discovers that Homunculus switched the infants Dana and Margarete after meeting him in the towns park in 1980, making modern-day Dana actually Margarete Wagner and medieval-Margarete actually Dana. Furthermore, after visiting the fortuneteller in the modern day, it is revealed that she is the trapped disembodied spirit of Hugo's mother, Helena Wagner, brought back after a failed attempt by Hugo to resurrect her using unmastered alchemy. Homunculus creates a puppet resembling Wolfgang Wagner to attempt to dissuade Hugo from his plans, and after a short discussion, the puppet and Hugo disappear in a haze of smoke. Homunculus slyly reveals they could not call up the spirit of the real Dr. Wagner-as Eike had requested-because he was in fact not dead yet but Homunculus does not disclose Dr. Wagner's whereabouts.  While returning the digipad to Homunculus, Eike accidentally drops the device, which explodes, killing Homunculus with a single piece of shrapnel striking his cheek(Homunculus had stated on multiple occasions that their body was extremely fragile). Sometime later, it is mentioned that Margarete is now reunited with her biological parents, the Brums, who adopted her, though it appears that none of them are aware of their true relation to each other.  Depending on the outcome of a certain time-travelling sub-quest, Eckart's wife and Margarete's mother, Miriam Brum, may or may not be alive as well (she was implied to have been killed  by a seemingly stray bullet while taking a walk with her baby, in the original time-line). While on a date together in the townsquare, Eike and Margarete (who are implied to now be in a relationship) return to the spot where Homunculus died, only to discover a large full-grown tree which contains the Philosopher's Stone already embedded in its trunk.

'''Ending B:''' There are two variations to ending B: B1 and B2. In B1, Eike discovers the fortune teller's identity and convinces Hugo to enter the hut to meet with her; Helena causes the building to collapse, killing Hugo, who allows himself to be killed by debris in order to be reunited with his mother (though it is not mentioned if her spirit is actually freed by this).  He then returns Margarete to the past in which she grew up (though the present is actually her birth-era).  B2 sees Hugo attempt to abandon Margarete in the present, only to have Eckart subdue and scold him (neither he nor Margarete are aware of their true relation to each other). Hugo apologizes and returns to the past with Margarete. Both variations conclude with Eike's decision to have a drink at the bar in celebration of living.

'''Ending C:''' Eike travels to 1580. Hugo searches for his father's research while an elderly Hugo appears with a time machine and offers to teach him to use it. When Eike reveals his presence in an effort to stop young Hugo from listening, the older version panics and tries to escape up the stairs.  Margarete gets in his way, and he threatens and tries to strike her with his cane.  Hugo rushes to stop him, and the two make contact, causing both Hugos cease to exist due to a dimensional paradox.  Margarete collapses, and Eike returns to the present, where he gives the Digipad back.  After Homunculus' departure, Eike lies down in the street to look at the stars praising being alive, only to be run over by two drunk men in a car.

'''Ending D:''' Eike enters the ruined lab and burns Wagner's notes about the Stone, just as Hugo and Margarete enter. Unable to read the burned notes, Hugo apparently never learns about what his father was working on and thus never desires revenge or create a time machine, causing the Hugo and Margarete in the present to disappear.  Hugo then decides to live his own life.  It is revealed in a flashback that Homunculus is actually a djinn or genie imprisoned in the form of what became known as the Philosopher's Stone, and not at all an artificial life created by Wolfgang Wagner. Upon learning of this from a newly awakened Homunculus (who appears once the Stone evaporates into smoke), Wolfgang suddenly realizes that he has ultimately wasted the majority of his adult life for literally nothing as he has neglected his family by spending virtually all of his time over the years seeking to cure his wife's progressively degenerative illness by attempting to create a Philosopher's Stone in his lab, only for her to die anyway before he ever managed to accomplish anything; with Homunculus' revelation that the Philosopher's Stone is merely just the Homunculus' sealed form and not really an alchemical creation at all, it turns out that it was always impossible to begin with, already right from the very start. Instantly becoming extremely depressed, Wolfgang immediately experiences a nervous breakdown and fervently wishes to be young again like Eike (who he had met earlier and who impressed him with his youthful energy), so as to have a "do-over".  Homunculus callously derides him for his spontaneous emotional outburst and an enraged Wolfgang then tries to reseal them with a pentagram.  This enrages Homunculus in turn and just before they transform into the Stone again, they curse Wolfgang "to suffer the eternal night of youth" (the blessing of eternal youth but saddled with perpetually recurring amnesia) thus filling the room with smoke and lightning.  Once the air clears, Wolfgang Wagner's younger self is revealed to in fact actually be Eike himself (it is subtly hinted earlier in the game in a conversation between Eike and Helena on her deathbed shortly before her death, that Helena finds that Eike's voice sounds shockingly similar to Wolfgang's).  Over the course of the next several centuries, Eike then becomes an immortal wanderer who permanently loses all his long-term memories on a regular periodic basis.

'''Ending E:''' Eike asks Dana, the actual Margarete Wagner (his biological daughter, based on Ending D, though neither is aware of this), to return with him to the present in which she grew up, and she agrees.  She is held hostage by Hugo (again, neither of them nor Eike are aware of their true relation to each other).  Eike goes to get Margarete and brings her to the present, where she slaps and scolds Hugo.  Tearfully, she tells him she can try and be more like their mother was to them and take care of them both.  Hugo apologizes, then returns to the past with Margarete, who had managed to warn Eike about Hugo's plans. Eike and Dana are then about to intimately share a tender embrace but are suddenly interrupted by Homunculus.  After a brief conversation in which Eike returns the digipad to Homunculus, Eike walks Dana back to her apartment.  It is shown that while Dana says to Eike that she feels that he seems like he would be a "cool dad" as he appears to her to be "with it all", it remains deliberately ambiguous as to whether they still retain any serious romantic attraction for each other after literally years of separation between them on the part of Dana when she was in the Middle Ages; this has caused many fans to speculate that, given their continued flirtatious rapport with each other due to [[genetic sexual attraction]], could possibly lead to future [[accidental incest]] on their part as they are actually secretly long-lost father and daughter (further fueled by the ending screen featuring Dana's picture and containing an admission from Eike that he does not know what his future may hold, which may be for the best).  In a flashback, it is shown that Homunculus made Wagner disappear (possibly killing him), after he had wished never to see the creature again.  It is possible this is not actually a flashback, but an epilogue, revealing what happens after Eike gives Dr. Wagner the Stone, which contains the Homunculus he sealed away in another timeline.  This also explains how Eike is able to encounter Homunculus in the ruins of Wagner's house after the experiment fails and why they did not recognize him.

'''EX Ending:''' This has two variations. Awakening from his first death with all his memories, Eike gets the red stone from the diner before Dana comes looking for him.  
:In EX 1 he gives Dr. Wagner the Philosopher's Stone, which allows him to make an elixir and successfully heals Helena at last.
:In EX 2 Eike dies in the bar fire to enter Homunculus' dimension and throws the Philosopher's Stone at him, causing them to cease to exist as a result of coming into contact with themself. 
Both result in Eike fading away. Regardless of either choice, the final scene is the same. A young man who resembles Eike is walking through the streets in present-day and struck down like before. The object turns out to be a soccer ball that hit him, and the man returns the ball to a boy similar in appearance to Hugo.

The PlayStation 2 version received "favorable" reviews, while the PC and PSP versions received "mixed or average reviews" according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MCPSP"/&gt;  In Japan, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.&lt;ref name="FamPS2"/&gt;

Reviewers praised the overall plot of the PS2 version as the game's strength.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s David Zdyrko called the story "one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Andrew Vestal of [[GameSpot]] enjoyed the idea of the detective in a [[murder mystery]] as the intended victim.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Writing for [[Game Revolution]], Shawn Sanders liked the time-traveling aspect of the game.&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt;

The graphics of the PS2 version received mixed responses. Sanders found the textures of the game "clean and detailed".&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; Zdyrko disliked the low amount of detail on the characters and some of the background, but enjoyed the "lighting and particle effects", particularly the snow and night.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Vestal praised the different visual depictions of Lebensbaum, and felt that high level of detail in the backgrounds helped to somewhat counterbalance the low-resolution of the game's graphics.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; Critics agreed that the [[full motion video]]s were well-done,&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; and praised the realistic character animation.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt; 
 
Critics commented on the general absence of action in the gameplay.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; Sanders considered it the game's greatest flaw and a possible source of frustration for players.&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; The slow beginning to the PS2 version was remarked on by critics, who felt that the game eventually picked up after a while.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt; Additionally, the "stiff" motion of the protagonist when running drew criticism.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Reviewers noted the relatively short play time,&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; and felt that the multiple endings enhanced the game's replay value.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Revolution"/&gt;

The game's soundtrack was well received. Critics wrote that it suited the mood&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; and occasionally helped to build suspense.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt; The voice acting also went over well, with several critics remarking on the quality of it.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RPG Fan"/&gt; Zdyrko described it as "first-class" and believable, and commented that since much of the PS2 version consists of dialogue, flawed voice acting might have ruined the game.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Vestal considered the voice acting of [[B-movie]] quality, but not flawed enough to be a major distraction.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21383">'''Societal attitudes towards abortion''' have varied throughout different [[history of abortion|historical periods]] and [[culture]]s. One manner of assessing such attitudes in the modern era has been to conduct [[opinion poll]]s to measure levels of [[public opinion]] on [[abortion]].

==Attitudes by region==

===Africa===
*'''[[South Africa]]:''' A 2003 [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] study examined moral attitudes among South Africans:&lt;ref&gt;Rule, Stephen.

Retrieved March 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
** 56% said they believed that abortion is wrong even if there is a strong chance of serious defect in the fetus.
** 70% said they believed that abortion is wrong if done primarily because the parents have low income and may be unable to afford another child.

===Europe===
*'''[[Austria]]:''' A May 2007 OGM survey examined Austrian opinion on the morality of abortion, asking, "Personally, do you think of abortion as a moral issue?" 20% of those polled replied, "yes, always", 59% replied "yes, under certain circumstances", 19% replied "no, never", and 2% replied that they were "not sure".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15961 Abortion Sometimes a Moral Issue, Say Austrians]."

==Among physicians==
A survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians (not only obstetricians) came to the result that 34% of physicians would perform an abortion in certain situations, even if it were against their own beliefs. Approximately 54% would not, and for the remaining 12%, it would depend on circumstances.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_7 Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas: Other Ethical Issues] Author: Leslie Kane. 11/11/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tasmania]], given its small geographic size and population has a flourishing literary culture.  Historically Tasmania provides a fascinating literary background with visits from early European explorers such as the Dutchman [[Abel Tasman]], the Frenchmen [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] and [[Marion du Fresne]] and then the English explorers [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[George Bass]]. The colonisation of Tasmania was characterised by deteriorated relations with the indigenous Aboriginal people and a harsh convict heritage.&lt;ref&gt;McCausland, Ian. 'Tasmania', ''World Book'',&lt;/ref&gt;  These early elements of Tasmanian history are found both in the large number of colonial sandstone buildings and in the place names.  Environmentally, Tasmania's picturesque landscapes and changeable weather, provide a vivid backdrop to Tasmanian literary culture.  Tasmania's geographical isolation, rich creative community,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.examiner.com.au/story/4606170/tasmanian-author-tops-prestigious-literary-prize/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-18/book-inspired-by-marina-abramovic-takes-out-2017-stella-prize/8450568&lt;/ref&gt; proximity to Antarctica, controversial colonial past, bourgeoning reputation as a dynamic centre for the arts,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/weekend-australian-magazine/the-mona-effect-towns-want-in-on-david-walshs-museum-act/news-story/f803dae3f027a31eb59e4a461303e345&lt;/ref&gt; and status as an island state, are some of the influences found in the island's significant collection of literature.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Pearl, ''Book Lust'', Sasquatch Books:Seattle, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.examiner.com.au/story/4606170/tasmanian-author-tops-prestigious-literary-prize/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://theconversation.com/the-flanagan-effect-tasmanian-literature-in-the-limelight-39431&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors of both fiction and non-fiction call Tasmania home,&lt;ref&gt;''The Tasmanian Writers Centre'', {{cite web |url=http://www.tasmanianwriters.org/readtasmania_stuv.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607031948/http://www.tasmanianwriters.org/readtasmania_stuv.htm |archivedate=7 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many acclaimed and highly awarded titles set in Tasmania or written by Tasmanians.  The long established national journal of letters, ''[[Island magazine|Island]]'' magazine is published quarterly in Tasmania.  The Tasmanian government provides some arts funding in the form of prizes, events and grants,&lt;ref&gt;''Arts Tasmania'' {{cite web |url=http://www.arts.tas.gov.au/projects/litprizes/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528054655/http://www.arts.tas.gov.au/projects/litprizes/index.htm |archivedate=28 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while local bookshops contribute to the writing community by hosting book launches and other literary events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Tasmanian Writers Centre'', http://www.tasmanianwriters.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasmania's unique history and environment gave rise to [[Tasmanian Gothic]] literature during the 19th century.

'''''Terms of Endearment''''' is a 1983 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] adapted from [[Larry McMurtry]]'s [[Larry_McMurtry#Houston_series|1975 novel]], directed, written, and produced by [[James L. Brooks]], and starring [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Jeff Daniels]], and [[John Lithgow]]. The film covers 30 years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway (MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Winger).

The film received eleven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, and won five. Brooks won the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium]], while MacLaine won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and Nicholson won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In addition, it won four [[Golden Globe]]s: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama|Best Actress in a Drama]] (MacLaine), [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]] (Nicholson), and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] (Brooks).

==Plot== 	
Widowed Aurora Greenway ([[Shirley MacLaine]]) keeps several suitors at arm's length, focusing instead on her close, but controlling, relationship with daughter Emma ([[Debra Winger]]). Anxious to escape her mother, Emma marries young college professor Flap Horton ([[Jeff Daniels]]) over her mother's objections, moves away, and has three children. Despite their frequent spats and difficulty getting along, Emma and Aurora have a tie between them that cannot be broken, and keep in touch by telephone.

Emma and Flap soon run into financial and marital difficulties. Emma has trouble managing the children and household, and she and Flap both have extramarital affairs. Emma relies increasingly on her mother for emotional support. Meanwhile, the lonely Aurora overcomes her repression, and begins a whirlwind romance with her next-door neighbor, retired [[astronaut]] Garrett Breedlove ([[Jack Nicholson]]). 

The Horton family moves from Houston to Des Moines and eventually to Nebraska, apparently for Flap's career, but mostly so he can be near his girlfriend. Emma is diagnosed with cancer, which becomes terminal. Aurora stays by Emma's side through her treatment and hospitalization, even while dealing with her own pain after Garrett suddenly ends their relationship. The dying Emma shows her love for her mother by entrusting her own children to Aurora's care. After Emma's death, Garrett re-appears in the family's life, and begins to bond with Emma's young children.

* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Flap Horton
* [[John Lithgow]] as Sam Burns

** Shane Sherwin as Tom "Tommy" Horton (toddler)

==Production==
Brooks wrote the supporting role of Garrett Breedlove for [[Burt Reynolds]], who turned down the role because of a verbal commitment he had made to appear in ''[[Stroker Ace]]''. "There are no awards in Hollywood for being an idiot", Reynolds later said of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/23/lkl.00.html | title= 	Larry King Live:Burt Reynolds Discusses His Career in Showbiz | date=February 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior shots of Aurora's home were filmed at 3060 Locke Lane, Houston, Texas. [[Larry McMurtry]], writer of the novel on which the screenplay was based, had received his M.A. at [[Rice University]], a mere three miles from the home.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We're like old smoothies working together. You know the old smoothies they used to show whenever you went to the [[Ice Follies]]. They would have this elderly man and woman – who at that time were 40 – and they had a little bit too much weight around the waist and were moving a little slower. But they danced so elegantly and so in synch with each other that the audience just laid back and sort of sighed. That's the way it is working with Jack. We both know what the other is going to do. And we don't socialize, or anything. It's an amazing chemistry – a wonderful, wonderful feeling.&lt;ref name=tcm/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
MacLaine confirmed in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' that Nicholson improvised when he put his hand down her dress in the beach scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Shirley MacLaine tries to bring Jack Nicholson on board "with every script"|date=2 March 2017|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/03/02/shirley-maclaine-tries-bring-jack-nicholson-board-every-script/98621194/|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film was generally well regarded by critics, and maintains an 88% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus: "A classic tearjerker, ''Terms of Endearment'' isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings – but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terms_of_endearment/ | title=Terms of Endearment Movie Reviews, Pictures | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, calling it "a wonderful film" and stating, "There isn't a thing that I would change, and I was exhilarated by the freedom it gives itself to move from the high comedy of Nicholson's best moments to the acting of Debra Winger in the closing scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Ebert | first =Roger | title =Terms of Endearment | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date =November 23, 1983 | url =http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/terms-of-endearment-1983 | accessdate =April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]], who gave the film a highly enthusiastic review, correctly predicted upon its release that it would go on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] of 1983. In his movie guide, [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film a rare four-star rating, calling it a "Wonderful mix of humor and heartache", and concluded the film was "Consistently offbeat and unpredictable, with exceptional performances by all three stars".&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Maltin| first=Leonard| authorlink=|title=2013 Movie Guide|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|date=|location=|pages=1386|isbn=978-0-451-23774-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Bridge'''" was a #1 chart hit in 1981 for New Zealand singer [[Deane Waretini]], and his backing group [[The Rising Stars]]. This also marked a first. It was the first Maori language record to hit the no 1 spot in New Zealand. "The Bridge" is an example of an artist in the 1980s contributing to the success of a record. This was done by kick starting the process in the beginning by self-financing the record, having a hand in its own promotion by employing various tactics to get the record heard by the public.

==Background==
It was sung in [[Māori language]], and set to [[Nini Rosso]]'s tune "[[Il Silenzio (song)|Il Silenzio]]".&lt;ref name="must remember"&gt;''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' March 30, 2009 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10564340 You must remember this - By Alan Perrott]&lt;/ref&gt; The words were written Waretini's cousin, [[George Tait (New Zealander)|George Tait]], a Te Arawa elder.&lt;ref&gt;NZ On Screen [https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/the-bridge-1981 The Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt; It pushed [[John Lennon]] off the charts when it climbed to the top.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'' Monday September 10, 2012 [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10832996 "Talking Heads: Deane Waretini and Orlando Stewart" - By Sam Wicks]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridge was originally independently and self-released. It wasn't picked up [[CBS Records International|CBS]] until later. After that it became the first no 1 song to be sung in the Maori language. It stayed at the top of the charts for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;NZ On Screen [https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/dean-waretini/artist Deane Waretini]&lt;/ref&gt;

The song has a meaning to it. It centers around the construction of the [[Mangere Bridge (bridges)|Mangere Bridge]]. The songs lyrics refer to the linking of two cultures in New Zealand, Māori and Pakeha.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'', Saturday, July 25, 2015 [http://m.nzherald.co.nz/maori/news/article.cfm?c_id=252&amp;objectid=11486484 "Songs that took Te Reo into the Pop Charts, Deane Waretini - The Bridge"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Making the record==

===Recording===
It was recorded in Auckland in the suburb of [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]]. The session took place in a garage studio that belonged to a country singer. The ensemble that backed him on the recording included musicians from the Blind Institute. According to [[Alan Perrott]]s article, "You must remember this" in  the March 30, 2009 edition of ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', the group that backed Waretini, referred to there as The Rising Suns, was formerly called [[The Radars]]. The trumpet player on the song who happened to be married to the niece of George Tait was Kevin Furey formerly of the [[Quincy Conserve]].  Waretini didn't have money to pay the musicians so he paid them in [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]].

===Production &amp; promotion===
His use of a  tactic first employed by [[Gary Havoc &amp; The Hurricanes]] of self-financing a record,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stranded in Paradise: New Zealand Rock'n'Roll, 1955-1988]], by John Dix, Page  219, Page 294&lt;/ref&gt; Waretini paid for his own record. He had a pile of the singles produced, which cost him $96. Some singles were sent to [[1ZB|Radio 1ZB]]. Waretini then bombarded them with play requests. He also managed to get it played at intermission time at Auckland's [[Auckland Civic Theatre|Civic Theatre]]. Another tactic was recruiting a news paper boy to sell copies to passing people for 50 cents a piece. (His backing band, The Rising Stars,&lt;ref name="must remember"/&gt;&lt;ref name="inn009"&gt;45cat [http://www.45cat.com/record/inn009 Artist: Deane Waretini With The Rising Stars, Catalogue: INN 009]&lt;/ref&gt; two years later in 1983 would use the same approach to getting the single out there.)&lt;ref&gt;''Central Leader'', January 22, 2009 [http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/central-leader/805597/Former-rockers-beat-goes-on Former rocker's beat goes on]&lt;/ref&gt;  The single which was produced by Allan Witana, and originally released on the Innovations label.&lt;ref name="inn009"/&gt;  A short time later, people going into record shops looking for "The Bridge". Not long afterwards, CBS wanted to put it out. On the third of April 1981, the song went to no 1, pushing [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Woman (John Lennon song)|Woman]]" from the top spot it previously held.&lt;ref name="must remember"/&gt; It also reached no 7 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;''Stuff'' 05/09/2012{{Clarify|reason=September 5 or May 9?|date=August 2016}} [http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/tv-radio/7610156/Is-this-Daene-Waretinis-hour Is this Deane Waretini's hour? - James Croot]&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Warentini he received $27,000 from CBS and also gave up his rights to the song.&lt;ref name="must remember"/&gt;

==Other versions==

===Alternative version===
There is an Unreleased Alternative Version by Waretini that appears on the ''[[Waiata : Maori Showbands, Balladeers &amp; Pop Stars|Waiata Maori Showbands, Balladeers &amp; Pop Stars]]'', various artists compilation that was released by [[His Master's Voice]] and [[EMI Records|EMI]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="discogs.com"&gt;Discogs [https://www.discogs.com/Various-Waiata-Maori-Showbands-Balladeers-Pop-Stars/release/3963612 Various  – Waiata - Maori Showbands, Balladeers &amp; Pop Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat [http://www.worldcat.org/title/waiata-maori-showbands-balladeers-pop-stars/oclc/749896144 Waiata : Māori showbands, balladeers &amp; pop stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parody version===
In 1981, the song became victim to a parody by [[Kevin Blackatini and the Frigids]], and a record was released on the [[RTC (record label)|RTC]] label. Kevin Blackatini was actually [[Radio Hauraki]] DJ, [[Kevin Black (broadcaster)|Kevin Black]].&lt;ref&gt;45cat [http://www.45cat.com/record/kevs1 Record Details, Artist: Kevin Blackatini And The Frigids]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NZ On Screen [https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/kevin-blackatini-and-the-frigids/artist Kevin Blackatini and the Frigids]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Total Drama''''' is a Canadian [[animated]] [[comedy]] [[television]] series which is a homage and parody to common conventions from [[reality television]]. The show and its sequel seasons are collectively referred to as the ''Total Drama'' series. It premiered on the Canadian cable television specialty channel [[Teletoon]] on July 8, 2007, and on the American cable television channel [[Cartoon Network]] on June 5, 2008.&lt;ref name="Thorny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totaldramaisland.blogspot.com/2008/06/howdy-neighbour-or-is-it-neighbor.html|title=Howdy Neighbour!... (or is it neighbor?)|accessdate=June 11, 2008|author=Thorny|date=June 3, 2008|work=Total Drama Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the contestants have distinct personalities that serve as main plot points with the characters consisting of the eponymous fictional reality series and the contestants therein. The style of this series is similar to that of ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''. ''Total Drama'' was met with critical acclaim upon release and has developed a [[cult following]].

The ''Total Drama'' series is the original series of the greater ''Total Drama'' franchise, which consists of five seasons that have aired during a timeframe of seven years: the first season, ''[[Total Drama Island]]'', the second season, ''[[Total Drama Action]]'', the third season, ''[[Total Drama World Tour]]'', the fourth season, ''[[Total Drama: Revenge of the Island]]'', and the fifth season, titled as both [[Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island|''Total Drama All-Stars'' and ''Total Drama: Pahkitew Island'']]. The latest installment premiered on July 7, 2014, in the United States&lt;ref name="s5100" /&gt; and September 4, 2014, in Canada.&lt;ref name="newswire.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1181701/inspector-gadget-reboot-tops-off-teletoon-canada-s-latest-original-production-slate|title=Teletoon Canada Inc. &amp;#124; Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off Teletoon Canada's Latest Original Production Slate|publisher=Newswire.ca|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spin-off series based on the main series, ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race|The Ridonculous Race]]'', was produced shortly after the fifth season was aired. A spin-off series in an alternative universe, titled ''[[Total DramaRama]]'' was released on September 1, 2018 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and on October 7, 2018 on Teletoon in Canada.&lt;ref name="s6annoucement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2017/12/19/cn-teletoon-open-up-total-drama-daycare/|title=CN, Teletoon open up Total Drama Daycare|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dramaRama" /&gt;

A month after the American debut of ''Total DramaRama'', McGillis confirmed there would be no more new seasons of ''Total Drama'', citing the lack of a "market for this experience in the wider entertainment marketplace" as the main reason for the cancellation of the series.&lt;ref name="tdCancellation"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McGillis |first1=Tom |title=Cancellation Confirmation |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9iwjqn/im_tom_mcgillis_creator_of_6teen_total_drama/e6mz7n2/ |website=Reddit |publisher=Tom McGillis |accessdate=3 October 2018 |ref=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The name of each season consists of the title ''Total Drama'' with a different word or phrase later added. That changing word or phrase defines the theme for that season. This series is a competition to win a cash prize of [[Canadian dollar|C]]$100,000 in the first season and C$1,000,000 in every other season. This series takes elements of other widely known series such as ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', ''[[Fear Factor]]'', ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', and ''[[Escape from Scorpion Island]]''. Like these other series, ''Total Drama'' is rated [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|TV-PG]] because it features mild profanity, censored language, brief censored nudity, and some suggestive dialogue. When more suggestive dialogue is present, the episode is rated TV-PG-D. The first three seasons are rated TV-PG-D while the latter two are rated TV-PG. Unlike many other animated shows, this series has a different logo for every season (while each season might have multiple alternate logos), so there is no official logo for this series.

===Location===
Most seasons in this series takes place in a different location. The first season, ''Total Drama Island'', is set in Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located in an unspecified area in [[Muskoka]], [[Ontario]]. The second season, ''Total Drama Action'', is set in an abandoned movie studio lot in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. In the third season, ''Total Drama World Tour'', the contestants are taken all around the world in the "Total Drama [[Boeing 747|Jumbo Jet]]", which seems to be structurally unstable. Some of the countries that are visited in the third season include [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. The fourth season, ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island'', is set back at Camp Wawanakwa, but this time the island is radioactive. The first part of the fifth season, ''Total Drama All-Stars'', also takes place on the island,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toynewsi.com/news.php?itemid=19834|title=Cartoon Network Announces It's New &amp; Returning Shows For 2013–2014 Season – What's In Store For DC Nation? – - Action Figures Toys News|publisher=Toynewsi.com|date=January 28, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the success of the first and fourth seasons. The second part, ''Total Drama: Pahkitew Island'' however, takes place on another island called Pahkitew Island after the destruction of Camp Wawanakwa.&lt;ref name="newswire.ca" /&gt;

==Production==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
''Total Drama'' was developed and produced by [[Fresh TV]] and was distributed by [[Cake Entertainment]]. The series is funded in part by the [[Canada Media Fund]] (formerly the [[Canadian Television Fund]]), and the Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit.&lt;ref name="stinson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stinson|first=Scott|title=Stinson: CanCon on the Croisette at Mipcom|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/10/13/stinson-cancon-on-the-croisette-at-mipcom|accessdate=October 14, 2011|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 13, 2011|location=Toronto ON}}{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=Trade |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season was funded by Xenpohile Media, Bell Broadcast and New Media Fund.

McGillis says they used a "countrywide online research project" to determine this demographic's likes.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{Citation| author = Raju Mudhar| url = https://www.thestar.com/article/568536| title = Canadian cartoon show sucking 'em all back in| newspaper = The Toronto Star| accessdate = December 25, 2010| date=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh TV Inc. partners McGillis, Pertsch, Elliott and [[Brian Irving|Irving]] produced the series.&lt;ref name="itbegins"&gt;{{Citation| url = http://totaldramaisland.blogspot.com/2006/07/and-so-it-begins.html| title = Total Drama Island: And So It Begins| author = Playback Staff| date = May 15, 2006| accessdate = December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget for the first season was [[US$|$]]8 million.&lt;ref name = "budget"&gt;{{Citation| url = http://canali.kataweb.it/kataweb-guardaconme/2010/02/21/lisola-di-cartone-che-prende-in-giro-i-reality| title = L'Isola di cartone che prende in giro i reality| author = Annalisa D'Aprile| language = Italian| work = Kata Web| accessdate = December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was animated in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],&lt;ref name = "production" /&gt; at Elliott Animation's studio in Toronto.&lt;ref name="itbegins" /&gt;

Every cast and crew member on ''Total Drama'' had to sign a [[confidentiality agreement]] not to disclose who the winner was.&lt;ref name = "secret"&gt;{{Citation| url = http://www.channelcanada.com/Article1894.html| title = From the creators of the award winning series 6teen, the number one show on Teletoon, comes a truly unique reality show for kids| work = Channel Canada| author = Teletoon| date = Jun 24, 2007| accessdate = December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the characters were designed by Kauffman.&lt;ref name="Final 4"&gt;[http://totaldramaisland.blogspot.com/2007/11/final-4.html Total Drama Island: Final 4] {{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early name for the series was ''Camp TV'' when the series first started production in 2006.&lt;ref name = "camptv"&gt;{{Citation| url = http://coldhardflash.com/2006/03/neptoons-promo-washes-ashore.html| title = Neptoon's Promo Washes Ashore| author = admin| work = Cold Hard Flash| date = March 27, 2006| accessdate = December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp TV Productions is still labeled in the end credits of every episode, along with the season number in [[Roman numerals]].

Series production stopped in 2014 as no new seasons were produced since. Instead, starting in 2015 the studio has focused the franchise more on producing separate spin-off series, with their respective voice actors being reused in the new spin-offs.

On May 3, 2017, it was announced that ''Total Drama'' would be making a return. It was later revealed that it would be returning as a new series titled ''[[Total DramaRama]]''. The show is a spin-off that has the contestants as kids in daycare.

This is a list of all the seasons that have aired with the original Canada air dates shown below along with basic elements for each season.

| ShortSummary= ''Total Drama Island'' is the first season of the series. It first premiered on Canada on July 8, 2007, and June 5, 2008, in the United States. This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located somewhere in [[Muskoka]], [[Ontario]] where the season is based on a summer camp theme (although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode). Like the whole series, this season is a competition to see which of the twenty-two contestants will survive and last the longest. This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given. Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like ''[[Fear Factor]]'' and ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''. All of this is so that the winner of the season (the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated), will win a small fortune of [[C$]]100,000 and cheesy fame. Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island.

| ShortSummary= ''Total Drama Action'' is the second season of the series. It premiered on Canada on January 11, 2009, and June 10 in the U.S. It is a sequel to the first season of the series, ''Total Drama Island''. In this season, fourteen characters from previous returned: Beth, Bridgette, DJ, Duncan, Geoff, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Justin, Leshawna, Lindsay, Owen, and Trent. Courtney returns later on in the season due to a lawsuit. In this season, the contestants are taken to a brand new location: an old film lot in the center of [[Toronto]], Ontario. The challenges are now based on movie genres, and the grand prize is now C$1,000,000. Cody, Eva, Ezekiel, Noah, Katie, Sadie, and Tyler do not return to compete but still appeared for the aftermath special, an extra show which was hosted by Bridgette and Geoff, the first two eliminated contestants. All losers must take the Walk of Shame on the [[red carpet]] and ride the Lame-o-sine.

| ShortSummary= ''Total Drama World Tour'' is the third season of the series. It premiered in 2010 internationally and continued onto 2011 in Canada. In this season, seventeen contestants are taken on a trip around the world as they compete in cultural themed challenges based on the countries or regions that they visit. An added twist in this season is that the contestants are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated by Chris (although this rule was not strongly enforced, and no one was eliminated for not singing anyway). Fifteen of the original characters from previous returned: Bridgette, Cody, Courtney, DJ, Duncan, Ezekiel, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Leshawna, Lindsay, Noah, Owen, and Tyler. Two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra, also joined the cast at the beginning of this season. Additionally, a third new character, Blaineley, was brought on to compete past the halfway point of the season. Beth, Eva, Geoff, Justin, Katie, Sadie, and Trent did not return to compete but have instead appeared for the aftermath specials. The prize for this season is also C$1,000,000. People are eliminated by jumping off the Drop of Shame.

===Future plans and cancellation===
Originally, co-creator [[Tom McGillis]] had stated that his personal goal was for ''Total Drama'' to go up to ten seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tommcgillis/status/345896747932995584|title=Twitter / tommcgillis: @JuLiO_CeSaRrrr you got it!|publisher=Twitter.com|date=June 15, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Ganetakos, the executive story editor and the senior writer for the series, also mentioned that the production team planned to make more seasons in the future.&lt;ref name = "alexg.twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/alexganetakos/status/505872879796641792|title = Alex Ganetakos Twitter|date = August 30, 2014|accessdate = December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a [[Reddit]] Q&amp;A on September 25, 2018, when asked if there would be additional seasons, Tom McGillis responded with "Nope.

Most voice actors have only voiced one character, while some actors have voiced two characters. Peter Oldring and Clé Bennett are the only two voice actors who have voiced more than two characters, Oldring voicing three and Bennett voicing four (five if counting DJ's mother). However, if the spin-offs are to be included, then multiple voice actors have voiced multiple characters throughout the franchise. Brian Froud, Rochelle Wilson, and Bennett are the only voice actors to voice contestants from more than one generation. Claire-Barlow revealed that Courtney was originally voiced by an unnamed voice actress, later revealed to be Rochelle Wilson as the first voice of Courtney in the first two episodes of ''Total Drama Island'' before the role was later given to her. Alejandro is the only character to have three voice actors; he was voiced by Marco Grazinni in ''Total Drama World Tour'', [[Keith Oliver]] while he was in the robot suit and Alex House in ''Total Drama All-Stars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-all-stars-speculation|title=Total Drama All-Stars Speculation – Fresh TV|publisher=Freshtvinc.com|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207170408/http://www.freshtvinc.com/blog/total-drama-all-stars-speculation/|archivedate=December 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh is the only minor character to have a voice actor of his own, [[Dwayne Hill]], as these roles are usually given to one of the main cast members.

It's THEIR reality show".&lt;ref name="s5100" /&gt;

===Critical reaction===
The first season, ''Total Drama Island'' received general acclaim from critics and fans. Users from ''[[TV.com]]'' gave the show an 8.6 "Great",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/total-drama-island/show/74640/reviews.html?tag=page_nav;reviews|title=Total Drama Island Show Reviews on TV|work=TV.com|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while users from ''[[IMDB]]'' gave it a 7.5 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1173427|title=Total Drama Island (2007)|work=IMDb|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Common Sense Media'' gave the show 4 out of 5 stars, calling it a "[c]lever cartoon reality show spoof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/total-drama-island|title=Total Drama Island – Television Review|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014|date=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second season, ''Total Drama Action'', received less acclaim due to being seen as less on par with ''Total Drama Island''; a primary criticism was the selection of contestants from ''Island'' who had already made it far in that season, thus neglecting most of the contestants who were eliminated earlier. ''Action'' currently holds a 7.9 on Metacritic based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/total-drama-island/season-2 |title=Total Drama Island - Season 2 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season, ''Total Drama World Tour'', has also received critical acclaim from critics and won multiple awards including "Best Animated Series", "Best Voice Actress" (for Annick Obonsawin), and was also nominated for several other awards; however, the criticisms included the overuse of the love triangle between Courtney, Duncan, and Gwen, as well as the destruction of the character Ezekiel.

''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island'' received mixed to positive reviews, airing in over 100 countries and holding a 6.7 on Metacritic based on 15 reviews, thus indicating "Generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ZombieWhosoever |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/total-drama-island/season-4 |title=Total Drama Island - Season 4 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Total Drama All-Stars'' has received mixed to negative reviews, with the primary criticisms being the neglecting of original favorites in favor of the ''Revenge of the Island'' cast, and many wasted plotlines such as building up a reconciliation between Courtney and Gwen, only to have it be ruined again. ''All-Stars'' currently holds a 5.4 rating on Metacritic based on 9 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/total-drama-island/season-5 |title=Total Drama Island - Season 5 Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Total Drama Pahkitew Island'', however, received significantly more positive reviews.

Up until November 1, 2011, only ''Total Drama Island'' had been released on DVD. [[Cartoon Network]] released their ''Total Drama Island'' DVD in the U.S. on August 18, 2009 (Region 1), while [[Madman Entertainment]] (Region 4) also released ''Total Drama Island'' on DVD in Australia, but this time in two parts (Collection 1 on May 5, 2010,&lt;ref name="austdidvd" /&gt; and Collection 2 on September 29, 2010&lt;ref name="madman.com.au" /&gt;). However, almost two years after ''Total Drama Action'' was first aired, Madman released their Collection 1 DVD of the second season on November 2, 2011&lt;ref name="dvdwarehouse.com.au" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; (with Collection 2 being released on July 4, 2012&lt;ref name="tdac2" /&gt;), making Australia the only country that has released the entirety of ''Total Drama Action'' for private home viewing. Australia also released ''Total Drama World Tour'' on DVD with Collection 1 being released on April 3, 2013,&lt;ref name="madmanw3" /&gt; and Collection 2 being released on August 7, 2013.&lt;ref name="tdwt2" /&gt; On October 8, 2014, ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island'' was released into one part due to it being a shorter season. The first part of the fifth season, ''Total Drama All-Stars'' was released on March 4, 2015, with the second part, ''Total Drama: Pahkitew Island'' being released on July 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Madman Entertainment"/&gt;

===Streaming===
''Total Drama'' episodes were made available on streaming services, such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime]], and [[iTunes]]. Currently, Netflix is missing ''Total Drama World Tour'' and ''Total Drama: Revenge of the Island'' while retaining all other seasons, especially ''[[Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race|The Ridonculous Race]]''. ''Total Drama'' was made available for purchasing on iTunes until December 5, 2015, but still available on Amazon Prime, with the exception of ''The Ridonculous Race''.

===Online promotion===
Teletoon hosted a ''Total Drama''-based website called "Total Drama Online" from 2009 to 2013 where players could play games and earn badges to win prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totaldramaonline.com|title=ACCUEIL &amp;#124; teletoon.com|publisher=Totaldramaonline.com|accessdate=May 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202209/http://www.totaldramaonline.com/|archivedate=October 28, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though most features (like user accounts, original avatar designer and badge counter) from this website are exclusive to only Canadian viewers, all of the games and basic elements were available to the rest of the world. Cartoon Network also had their own ''Total Drama'' website from 2009 to 2015 which was very similar to the Canadian one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/total-drama/index.html|title=Total Drama All-Stars &amp;#124; Free Videos and Online Games|publisher=Cartoon Network|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was only exclusive to viewers in the United States. Various alternate websites based on the series also exist throughout most of the other countries the show airs in, which are all in their respective languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=META tags by www.cartoonnetwork.com.au|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/minisite/total_drama_island|title=Total Drama Island &amp;#124; Free Videos and Online Games &amp;#124; Cartoon Network Australia|publisher=Cartoonnetwork.com.au|date=February 22, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521033139/http://www.cartoonnetwork.com.au/minisite/total_drama_island/|archivedate=May 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spin-off series===

==== The Ridonculous Race ====
{{Main|Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race}}
A new spin-off series called ''Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race'' was created by Fresh TV which takes place in the same universe as the current show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corusent.com/home/Corporate/PressReleases/tabid/1697/Default.aspx?Id=2720|title=Press Release – Corus Announces a Robust Slate of New and Returning Original Productions for YTV and Teletoon with 18 Commissioned Shows|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new series is loosely based off after the format of ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' where the cast is split into multiple teams of two (referred to as duos) which race around the world throughout the series. There is a new host this series called Don, who replaced the original host Chris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/alexganetakos/status/490580661275611136|title=Alex Ganetakos on Twitter: "@AcunaAndrew the Ridonculous Race does have its own host – all I can say for now is that his name is Don, and I hope you like him! :)"|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though some of the characters from the main series make appearances, the spin-off series is primarily dominated by a new cast.&lt;ref name="race"/&gt; The spin-off series is a "buddy comedy" and includes 18 pairs of teams (36 characters). It first premiered on September 7, 2015, on Cartoon Network and later premiered on January 4, 2016, on the Canadian version of [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freshtvinc.com/contest/ |title=Fresh TV - The Ridonculous Team Contest |publisher=Freshtvinc.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214160959/http://www.freshtvinc.com/contest/ |archivedate=December 14, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Total DramaRama ====
{{Main|Total DramaRama}}
Another spin-off series was announced on December 19, 2017, as ''Total Drama Daycare''. The series was later renamed ''Total DramaRama''. It was released in September 2018 on Cartoon Network in the U.S. and October 2018 on Teletoon in Canada.&lt;ref name="dramaRama" /&gt; The new series will have 52 episodes and for the first time in the franchise, the episodes will have a new runtime with a shorter length of eleven minutes. It is set to feature some of the original characters from ''Total Drama Island'' as toddlers such as Beth, Bridgette, Cody, Courtney, Duncan, Gwen, Harold, Izzy, Leshawna, Noah and Owen as well as Jude Lizowski from ''[[6teen]]''. Chef Hatchet will also return as a younger adult.&lt;ref name="s6annoucement" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cn-teletoon-return-to-total-drama/|title=CN, Teletoon return to Total Drama|website=C21media|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series began production in early 2017, and Christian Potenza is confirmed to still have a role for the prequel.&lt;ref name="s6tdspecialannouncement"&gt;{{Citation|last=SwitchBoardNetwork|title=Total Drama Announcement|date=2017-05-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVluv4dVcGo|accessdate=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In [[Romania]] transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if [[Romania]] is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the [[National Audiovisual Council]] (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the [[Trade Register Company]]. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority===

Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-romania.pdf.pdf IREX 2016, Europe &amp; Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant law, named [[Audiovisual Law no. 504]], requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to [[beneficial ownership]], which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the [[National Audiovisual Council]], a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.

One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the [[National Audiovisual Council]] there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation.

Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public===

According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law ===

In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is [[Corporate law|company law]] which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the [[Trade Register Office]] (TRO) and to communicate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information.

According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;.

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==

Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of Europe]] standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.

An '''ukay-ukay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|k|aɪ|.|uː|k|aɪ}} {{respell|OO|ky|oo|ky}}) is a Philippine store wherein [[Used good|secondhand]] apparels such as clothes, [[Bag#Types of bags|bags]], shoes and other accessories are being sold at a very cheap and [[Contract|bargained]] prices. Items sold at the ukay-ukay are commonly shipped from different countries.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Ukay ukay galore.jpg|thumb|right|In [[Davao City]]]]
The term ukay-ukay is derived from the [[Filipino (language)|Filipino]] verb ''hukay'' or ''halukay'', which means "to dig" or "to sift through" respectively. It is synonymous with the verb ''wagwag'', an act of dusting off a piece of clothing by taking hold of one end and snapping it in the air, and shake the item chosen to dust it off; and SM, meaning ''segunda mano'' ([[secondhand]]), which is also a [[pun]] on the foremost Philippine retail chain [[SM Prime Holdings|SM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=A. Go|first1=Miriam Grace|title=Illegal clothing trade costs Philippines dear|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FA06Ae04.html|accessdate=1 February 2017|work=Asia Times|date=6 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first ukay-ukay was believed to have been founded in the early 1980s in [[Baguio]]. When calamities frequented the Philippines during that year, the Philippine [[Salvation Army]] would send secondhand garments and other goods to the refugees and victims as humanitarian assistance to the victims of the calamities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukay-Ukay in Cebu|url=http://www.everythingcebu.com/lifestyle/culture/ukay-ukay-in-cebu/|accessdate=1 February 2017|work=Everything Cebu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The university of ukay|url=http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/17072-the-university-of-ukay|accessdate=1 February 2017|publisher=[[Rappler]]|date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordero-Fernando|first1=Gilda|title=The ubiquitous ‘ukay’|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/236950/the-ubiquitous-ukay/|accessdate=1 February 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon enough, the shipped goods, upon piling up, were bought in bulk by traders and sold to the public at significantly low prices. They used to market it to the low-income bracket, but following ukay-ukay's increase in popularity, relatively richer customers who seek low-priced branded goods patronize ukay-ukay stores.

==Legality==
The commercial importation of secondhand clothing to the Philippines is prohibited since 1966 under the Republic Act No. 4653 also known as the "Act to safeguard the health of the Filipino people and maintain the dignity of the nation through the prohibition of the importation of used clothing and rags".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Customs cracks-down on Baguio ‘ukay-ukay’|url=http://asianjournal.com/news/customs-cracks-down-on-baguio-ukay-ukay/|accessdate=4 February 2017|work=Asian Journal|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It renders a significant part of the ukay-ukay business illegal.  There have been many calls to review and amend the law legalizing the sale of imported used clothing by ukay-ukay stores.&lt;ref name="legalize"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lorenciana|first1=Carlo|title=Should gov't legalize it?

An '''online school''' ('''virtual school''' or '''e-school''' or '''cyber-school''') teaches students entirely or primarily online or through the internet. It has been defined as "education that uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the students and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Elaine|date=May 2017|title=Distance Education Enrollment Report 2017|url=https://onlinelearningsurvey.com/reports/digtiallearningcompassenrollment2017.pdf|journal=Digital Learning Compass|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Online education exists all around the world and is used for all levels of education (K-12, college, or graduate school). This type of learning enables the individuals to earn transferable credits, take recognized examinations, or advance to the next level of education over the internet.
[[File:Number_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Courses_by_Level_(2012-2015).png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Number_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Courses_by_Level_(2012-2015).png|thumb|Number of Students Taking Distance Courses  by Level (2012-2015)&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;]]
Virtual education is most commonly used at the high school or college level. Students who are of the age 30 or older, tend to study on online programs at higher rates. This group represents 41% of the online education population, while 35.5% of students ages 24-29 and 24.5% of students ages 15-23 participate in virtual education.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlineschoolscenter.com/25-surprising-facts-online-education/|title=25 Surprising Or Little Known Facts About Online Education|date=2017-10-21|work=Online Schools Center|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Percentage_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Course_(2012-2015).png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Percentage_of_Students_Taking_Distance_Course_(2012-2015).png|alt=|thumb|Percentage of Students Taking Distance Courses (2012-2015)&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;]]
Virtual education is becoming increasing used worldwide. There are currently more than 4,700 colleges and universities that provide online courses to their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/online-education/articles/2018-01-11/study-more-students-are-enrolling-in-online-courses|title=Studey: More Students are Enrolling in Online Courses|last=Friedman|first=Jordan|date=January 11, 2018|website=U.S News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, more than 6 million students were taking at least one course online, this number grew by 3.9% from the previous year. 29.7% of all higher education students are taking at least one distance course. The total number of students studying on a campus exclusively dropped by 931,317 people between the years 2012 and 2015.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Experts say that because the number of students studying at the college level is growing, there will also be an increase in the number of students enrolled in distance learning. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Instructional models==
Instructional models vary, ranging from distance learning types which provide study materials for independent self-paced study, to live, interactive classes where students communicate with a teacher in a class group lesson. Class sizes range widely from a small group of 6 pupils or students to hundreds in a virtual school.

The courses that are independent and self paced are called asynchronous courses. Typically for this type of learning, the students are given the assignments and information, and are expected to complete the assignments by the due date. This is done on their own time. There is no scheduled time when the class meets. Usually the only interactions that takes place are through discussion boards, blogs, and wikis.

On the other hand, synchronous online courses happen in real time. The instructor and students all interact online at the same time. This is done either through text, video, or audio chat. Therefore these lessons are socially constructed. In addition to the scheduled class time, there is usually additional assignments to complete.  

Hybrid, sometimes also called blended, courses are when students learn and interact both in person and online. Theses classes meet in person during the semester in addition to computer based communication. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/24884/online_learning/7897/types_of_online_learning/1|title=Types of Online Learning|last=D.|first=Potts Zachary|website=www.fordham.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mid-1990s&lt;ref name="reality"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The reality of virtual schools: A Review of the literature|journal=Computers &amp; Education|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2008.09.009|volume=52|issue=2 |date=February 2009|pages=402–416|author1=Barbour, Michael K.|author2=Reeves, Thomas C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the advent of completely virtual schools. Many of today's virtual schools are descendants of correspondence schools. The earlier online schools began in Australia, New Zealand, North America and the UK, generally in areas where low density population made schooling by conventional means difficult and expensive to provide.&lt;ref name="reality" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = ICT Assisted Project Based Learning: eLearning in Aviation|url = http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.4472.3043|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.4472.3043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 an assessment found high dropout rates.&lt;ref name="predicting"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter114/roblyer114.html, |title=Predicting Success for Virtual School Students: Putting Research-based Models into Practice|year=2008|author=M. D. Roblyer|author2=Lloyd Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other computerized environments, once the glamour of the new methods wore off it became clear that human skills were paramount to success, in this case teaching and welfare expertise. Where this is recognized retention is good, i.e. in the synchronous, socially structured models; in the huge MOOC style courses the same isolation problems as correspondence learning are found.

Sometimes referred to as "[[distance education|distance learning]]", correspondence schools offered students an alternative to the traditional brick and mortar meetings within a schoolhouse. These schools utilized the postal service for student-teacher interaction, or used two-way radio transmissions, sometimes with pre-recorded television broadcasts. Students were expected to study their learning material independently and, in some cases, meet with a proctor to be tested.

Virtual schools now exist all around the world.  Over the past decade, [[K-12]] online instruction has dramatically increased in both Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|url = http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.5029.3602|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these virtual schools have been integrated into public schools (particularly in the United States), where students sit in computer labs and do their work online. Students can also be completely [[home-schooled]], or they can take any combination of public/private/home-schooling and online classes.

The International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) developed a set of standards released in September 2007 and updated on October 12, 2011. These standards will help monitor online programs and ensure that every provider of education is accredited. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wicks|first=Matthew|date=October 2010|title=A National Primer on K-12 Online Learning|url=http://www.inacol.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iNCL_NationalPrimerv22010-web1.pdf|journal=iNACOL|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pricing and location==
Where online methods are integrated with State provision, costs follow state school standards. Otherwise fees must be met by the student, or parents. Many US [[school district]]s are now creating their own online services  to avoid paying external providers. Such students can graduate from their home district without ever leaving home.  In most of these cases, students are given computers, books, and even internet service to complete coursework from home.

With the resources of the internet as a [[library]], and the ease of making online study materials, there is usually a comparatively small requirement for [[textbook]]s. Most courses will provide electronic materials free of cost, or included in the course fee. Textbooks are most often required for an exam syllabus course.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

Advocates of online schools and online learning point to a number of advantages:

* There is a lack of costly and tiring travel involved, with a much greater dependability of lessons. Weather disrupting transport is almost irrelevant (though an area subject to frequent power cuts will suffer consequent disruptions). Similarly common health disruptions through minor illness or injury will not halt learning, because the physical demands are so much less. Transcripts of lessons can plug short absences.
* Many students who have personal or health conditions that make physical school difficult or impossible can instead learn using virtual educational programs. 
* Ideal for individuals and families who need flexible arrangements. However, synchronous learning does impose limits due to timezones, which tends to divide online schools in Europe and Asia from North America.
* The integration of internet resources provides a huge library of content, and students quickly become adept at online research. 
* There is a greater flexibility for [[Autodidacticism|self-learners]] or [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students to explore learning beyond the standard curriculum. Independent minded students, those with specialist skills and ambitions, can develop at their own preferred pacing using net resources.
* Online schools can be equalizers, as age, appearance, and background are far less obvious. Groups can be categorized by personal ability.
* Students and pupils benefit from exposure to others in different cultures of the world, which enriches understanding of history, geography, religions and politics, and develops social skills.
* Part-time students with jobs or family commitments may benefit from the flexibility of online schedules, as claimed by supporters of virtual education.
* For asynchronous education, a student may study, learn, or do their homework when they have free time. Therefore, this gives the students flexibility with their education. 
* It is argued that online learning is more effective and efficient at providing education to a large number of people no matter the physical distance between the students and professors than traditional education. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harsasi|first=Meirani|date=|title=A Study of a Distance Education Institution|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1165872.pdf|journal=Determinants of Student Satisfaction in Online Tutorial|volume=19|pages=89 - 99|via=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are claims that online education "develops higher order skills such as collaborating across time and place and solving complex real-world problems" better than in-class learning. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Students have the ability to avoid the requirement of traveling to a physical school.
* As pointed out by advocates of online schooling, this type of education could be beneficial in rural areas, where the distance between students and educators is vast. 
*A student may have the ability to take a course that is not offered at a location near them. 
* Some affirm that virtual education is very cost effective for schools or districts because it allows a teacher to instruct more students than in a face-to-face classroom setting. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-should-take-online-courses/|title=Online schooling: Who is harmed and who is helped?|last=Dynarski|first=Susan M.|date=2017-10-26|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It has been claimed that courses online are less expensive for the students than course taken in traditional school, college, or university. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ies.ncsu.edu/resources/white-papers/pros-and-cons-of-online-education/|title=Pros and Cons of Online Education {{!}} NC State Industry Expansion Solutions|website=NC State Industry Expansion Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some disadvantages of virtual school includes:

* Critics argue that students do not interact with their instructors or peers face-to-face, which lends itself to a "lack of socialization" unless supplemented using online groups such as Elluminate or Wimba, or by attending other social activities outside of school.
* A challenge pointed out by critics is that there is an added challenge of staying focused while in the home environment. It has been reported that many students have a difficult time staying on task when participating in learning online. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* Some argue that the cost of starting up an online school is expensive.
* As pointed out by opposers of online school, not everyone has access to digital technologies which would prohibited them to attend virtual schools, unless their local libraries or community programs may offer access to computers and research materials.
* An argument identified by critics is that virtual schools are relatively new and because of that there are no seldom methods of evaluating their effectiveness in educating their students.
* As claimed in a study done by Eric Bettinger and Susanna Loeb, on average, online students "do substantially worse than students in the same face-to-face course".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
*Critics have pointed out that it is common for technology to be unpredictable, glitch, or not function correctly. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Some people who oppose virtual education have argued that obtaining a job with an online degree may be harder because potential employers may be skeptical of the credibility of these virtual programs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The assignments due for online schooling may not be assessing the ability of the students because many answers can be found on the internet, as claimed by critics of online schooling. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Historically and presently, in many parts of the world, women's participation in the profession of medicine (as [[physician]]s or [[surgeons]] for instance) has been significantly restricted. However, women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]] has been widespread. Most countries of the world now provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. However, not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;See generally, "Women's Human Rights", 1998, [[Human Rights Watch]] (available [https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html online]).&lt;/ref&gt; and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichenbach|first=Laura|last2=Brown|first2=Hilary|date=2004-10-02|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|issn=0959-8138|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsugawa|first=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

They continued to practice without formal training or recognition in England and eventually North America for the next several centuries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The History of Women in Surgery, by Debrah A. Wirtzfeld, MD&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's participation in the medical professions was generally limited by legal and social practices during the decades while medicine was [[professionalization|professionalizing]].&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches"&gt;See generally [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] &amp; [[Deirdre English]], ''Witches, Midwives, and Nurses'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; However, women openly practiced medicine in the [[allied health professions]] ([[nursing]], [[midwifery]], etc.), and throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, women made significant gains in access to [[medical education]] and medical work through much of the world. These gains were sometimes tempered by setbacks; for instance, [[Mary Roth Walsh]] documented a ''decline'' in women physicians in the US in the first half of the twentieth century, such that there were fewer women physicians in 1950 than there were in 1900.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977"&gt;Walsh, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, through the latter half of the twentieth century, women made gains generally across the board. In the United States, for instance, women were 9% of total US medical school enrollment in 1969; this had increased to 20% in 1976.&lt;ref name="Walsh-1977" /&gt;  By 1985, women constituted 16% of practicing US physicians.&lt;ref name="Morantz-Sanchez-2001-preface"&gt;Morantz-Sanchez, Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the twenty-first century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.  Women have achieved parity in medical school in some industrialized countries, since 2003 forming the majority of the United States medical student body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2003/031104.htm "Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools Increase; Women the Majority for the First Time"],  [[Association of American Medical Colleges]], Nov. 3, 2003, press release ("Women made up the majority of medical school applicants for the first time ever").&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007-2008, women accounted for 49% of medical school applicants and 48.3% of those accepted.&lt;ref name="aamc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aamc.org/download/153708/data/ |format=PDF |title=U.S. Medical School Applicants and Students 1982-1983 to 2011-2012 |work=aamc.org |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;!--dead link: http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/charts1982to2007.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) 48.3% (16,838) of medical degrees awarded in the US in 2009-10 were earned by women, an increase from 26.8% in 1982-3.&lt;ref name="aamc" /&gt; While more women are taking part in the medical field, a 2013-2014 study reported that there are significantly fewer women in leadership positions within the academic realm of medicine. This study found that women accounted for 16% of deans, 21% of the professors, and 38% of faculty, as compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rebecca M. "Gender Inequality in Medicine: Too Much Evidence to Ignore." Psychiatric Times, vol. 34, no. 5, September 2017, pp. 1–5., http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/early-career-psychiatry/gender-inequality-medicine-too-much-evidence-ignore&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the practice of medicine remains disproportionately male overall. In industrialized nations, the recent parity in gender of medical students has not yet trickled into parity in practice. In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.

Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,&lt;ref&gt;Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery - Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website].&lt;/ref&gt; while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so. In the United States, female physicians outnumber male physicians in pediatrics and female residents outnumber male residents in family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16229.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102101755/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/16229.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 November 2007 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 16 - Physician Specialties by Gender- 2006 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/12915.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022162222/http://www.ama-assn.org:80/ama/pub/category/12915.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 October 2004 |title=AMA (WPC) Table 4 - Women Residents by Specialty - 2005 |date=25 September 2015 |work=Women Physicians Congress (WPC) |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women continue to dominate in nursing. In 2000, 94.6% of registered nurses in the United States were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030212144558/http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/healthworkforce/reports/rnsurvey/rnss1.htm |archivedate=2003-02-12 |deadurl=yes |title=The Registered Nurse Population |date=March 2000 |work=bhpr.hrsa.gov |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In health care professions as a whole in the US, women numbered approximately 14.8 million, as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/05/13/womens-health-at-work/ |title = Women’s Health at Work |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |date = 13 May 2013 |first1 = Naomi |last1 = Swanson |first2 = Julie |last2 = Tisdale-Pardi |first3 = Leslie |last3 = MacDonald |first4 = Hope M. |last4 = Tiesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined by S.E. Berryman in "Who Will Do Science?", 1983; see Louise Luckenbill-Edds, [http://www.ascb.org/index.cfm?id=1584&amp;navid=112&amp;tcode=nws3 "2000 WICB / Career Strategy Columns (Archive)"], Nov. 1, 2000, WICB Newsletter, ''American Society for Cell Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

=== Glass ceiling ===
The [[glass ceiling]] is used as a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace.

One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"&gt;Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). "Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters".&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Women's Health''.&amp;nbsp;'''16'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 1–13.&amp;nbsp;{{doi|10.1089/jwh.2006.0127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments.

This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. &amp;nbsp;More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.&lt;ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127"/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their [[Intersectionality|race and gender]].&amp;nbsp;

In an article titled "I'm too used to it”: A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education," the author described how confidence in ability varies based upon gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts. This study also commented on the impact of power dynamics within medical school, which is established as a hierarchy that ultimately shapes the educational experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Specifically, this article described how power dynamics led to the formation of a “hidden curriculum” in medical school, which revolves around understanding the contribution of gender roles in regards to being a female doctor. According to this article, this position holds females more accountable for their actions as a result of unrealistic expectations set forth by these gender roles, which expects female doctors to take on a nurturing and matronly persona when dealing with patients. The hidden curriculum, according to this article, is an integral aspect of a female's medical education that must be learned in order to tolerate instances of gender discrimination.

On the topic of power dynamics, another study commented on the nature of sexual harassment, stating that it was most commonly perpetrated within career training stages, by people in positions of power. According to this article, instances of sexual harassment attribute to the high attrition rates of females in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clancy K. H., Nelson R. G., Rutherford J. N., Hinde K. | year = 2014 | title = Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 7| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0102172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study describes sexual harassment as a growing problem due to the fact that it goes widely underreported, which is said to be caused by the transient nature of career training, alongside weak policies and the perpetrators holding positions of power over the victim.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babaria|first=Palav|last2=Abedin|first2=Sakena|last3=Berg|first3=David|last4=Nunez-Smith|first4=Marcella|date=2012-04-01|title="I'm too used to it": A longitudinal qualitative study of third year female medical students' experiences of gendered encounters in medical education|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612000780|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.11.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's Contributions to Medicine in the United States==

Women have successfully provided the world with information not previously known. A few women who provided knowledge were:
 
'''Helen Brooke Taussig:''' ''The First Female President of the American Heart Association''

[[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Brooke Taussig]] was born on May 24, 1898, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She is most commonly known as the first female president of the American Heart Association&lt;ref name=TaussigEB&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Helen-Brooke-Taussig|title=Helen Brooke Taussig {{!}} American physician|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taussig was diagnosed with [[Dyslexia]] when she was young. Around the same time, her mother, Edith Guild Taussig (1861-1909) died.&lt;ref name=TaussigEB/&gt; Her father, [[Frank William Taussig]] (1859-1940), was an economist and educator in the United States. He was also known for creating the "Foundation of Modern [[International trade|Trade Theory"]].  Taussig earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B]] from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1921. In 1922 she applied at [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard University's Medical School]], and was denied. The University was not accepting women at the time. Instead she graduated from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1927. In her 30s, Taussig grew deaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013565/html/13565bio.html|title=Helen Brooke Taussig|last=Morton|first=Lauren|date=2005|website=Archives of Maryland|archive-url=|archive-date=December 5, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Taussig was appointed the Head of he Children's Hear Clinic at the Harriet Lane home, which was part of Johns Hopkins University. Due to her inability to hear, Taussig found an alternative method to studying the heartbeat in children by feeling the beat with her hands. This method lead her to discover [[Blue baby syndrome|"Blue Baby Syndrome]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blalock|first=Alfred|date=1945-05-19|title=THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF MALFORMATIONS OF THE HEART|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|language=en|volume=128|issue=3|doi=10.1001/jama.1945.02860200029009|issn=0002-9955|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was termed so due to the cyanotic hue resembling babies who were thought to be ill. In 1947, a surgeon named [[Alfred Blalock]] teamed up with Taussig and wrote an article called,&lt;ref&gt;"Congenital Malformations of the Heart",&lt;/ref&gt; which explored their creation and alternative approach for a stunt-"[[Blalock–Taussig shunt|Blalock-Taussig Shunt]]"- that would help circulate blood from the lungs to the heart. In the article it states, "The operation here reported and the studies leading thereto were undertaken with the conviction that even though the structure of the heart was grossly abnormal, in many instances it might be possible to alter the course of the circulation in such a manner as to lessen the 'cyanosis' and the resultant disability." (Read before the [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] Medical Society, March 12, 1945.) Taussig received multiple awards after 1950. In 1954, Taussig received the Albert Lasker award, which is awarded for outstanding contributions to medicine. In 1959, Taussig was acknowledged for being one of the first women who received full professorship to Johns Hopkins University. In 1964, Taussig was awarded the [[Medal of Freedom|medal of freedom]] from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Finally, in 1965, Taussig was known as the first women of the [[American Heart Association]], for which she is so prominently known for. To further her interest in pediatrics, nearly a decade and a half later in the 1960s, Taussig remained to advocate for children's&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; health. She was "responsible for investigating the epidemic of serious congenital limb malformations". This investigation focused on European children and Taussig had a theory that the malformations were caused by the use of [[Thalidomide]]. She resolved this ongoing issue by persuading the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to discontinue the use and sale of Thalidomide in the U.S

'''Helen Flanders Dunbar:''' ''The "Mother" of Holistic Medicine''

[[Helen Flanders Dunbar]] was born in [[Chicago]] on May 14, 1902, and Dunbar was the oldest child. Dunbar's mother, Edith Vaughn Flanders (1871-1963), was an Episcopalian clergyman's daughter as well as a professional [[Genealogy|Genealogist]]. Dunbar's father, Francis William Dunbar (1868-1939), was very much established as well due to his standing as an electrical engineer, as well as a patent attorney. In her early life, Dunbar's education was strictly limited to tutors and attending private schools. She graduated from [[Brearley School]], which was located in [[New York City]], in 1919, which lead to her enrollment in [[Bryn Mawr College]]. At this particular point in her life her interest in [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and medicine. Dunbar met [[James H. Leuba|James Henry Leuba]] at [[Bryn Mawr College]], which sparked her interest due to his standing as a psychologist of religion at the college. In the summer of 1929, after successfully receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics and psychology from [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], Dunbar continued her education by spending five weeks in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts receiving clinical training. In 1927, Dunbar received a [[bachelor's degree]] as [[Latin honors|"Magna Cum Laude]]" from Union Theological Seminar. This achievement was awarded primarily due to her thesis, "Methods Training in the Devotional Life Emphasized in the American Churches".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Dunbar also won a travelling Fellowship due to this particular piece of writing. From 1931 until 1936, Dunbar held the position as director of Joint Committee of the [[New York City]] Religion and Health of the Federal Council and Churches of the Academy of Medicine. From 1943 until the year before she died, Dunbar wrote an assortment of books including: [http://www.womeninmedicinemagazine.com/profile-of-women-in-medicine/helen-flanders-dunbar-pioneer-in-psychosomatic-medicine "Psychosomatic Diagnosis]" in 1943, "Mind, Body: Psychosomatic Medicine"&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/helen-flanders-dunbar/|title=Helen Flanders Dunbar|last=Young|first=Tracy L.|date=2010|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947, "Your Child's Mind and Body; A practical guide for parents" in 1949, and "Illness: the realization of an infant's fantasy with special reference to testing methods" in 1951. During the year of her death, Dunbar wrote "Accidents of Life Experience", "Basic aspects and applications of the psychology of safety", and "Psychiatry in medicine specialties".&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt; Helen Flanders Dunbar died in 1959.

==Midwifery in 18th Century America==
As per the documentary “A Midwife’s Tale”, historian of 18th century America, [[Laurel Thatcher Ulrich]], follows the diary of [[Martha Ballard]], which proves to be a telling source of women's roles as medical practitioners. Out of the different occupations women took on around this time, [[midwifery]] was the best paid of them all.&lt;ref name="Ulrich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ulrich|first1=Laurel Thatcher|title=A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812|date=1990|publisher=Knopf|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[18th century]], households tended to have an abundance of children largely in part to have a helping hand in responsibilities and to combat high mortality rates.&lt;ref name="McMillen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillen|first1=Sally Gregory|title=Motherhood in the Old South: Pregnancy, Childbirth and Infant Rearing|date=1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high chance of complications in labor, Martha Ballard, specifically, had high success rates in delivering healthy babies to healthy mothers.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt;

==Competition Between Midwifery and Obstetrics==
A shift from women midwifery to male obstetrics occurs in the growth of medical practices such as the founding of the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="Feldhusen" /&gt; Instead of assisting labor in the basis of an emergency, there were doctors such as Dr. Benjamin Page who wanted to take over the delivery of babies completely; putting midwifery second.&lt;ref name="Ulrich" /&gt; This is an example of the growing sense of competition between male physicians and female midwives as a rise in obstetrics took hold. The education of women on the basis of midwifery was stunted by both physicians and public-health reformers, driving midwifery to be seen as out of practice.&lt;ref name="Brodsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodsky|first1=Phyllis L|title=Where have all the midwives gone?|journal=Journal of Perinatal Education|date=2008|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.1624/105812408X324912|pmid=19436438|pmc=2582410|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Societal roles also played a fact in the downfall of the practice in midwifery because women were unable to obtain the education needed for licensing and once married, women were to embrace a domestic lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Feldhusen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://midwiferytoday.com/web-article/history-midwifery-childbirth-america-time-line/|last1=Feldhusen|first1=Adrian E|title=The History of Midwifery and Childbirth in America: A Time Line|website=Midwifery Today|publisher=Midwifery Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]].

===Medieval Europe===
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were an important place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c.1151-58).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archivedate=2005-04-06 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].&lt;ref name=hildegard&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe - An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in many healing techniques and capacities. According to historical documents, small numbers of women occupied almost all ranks of medical personnel during the period.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs|date=1989|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|jstor=3174557}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked as [[herbalists]], [[midwives]], [[surgeons]], [[barber-surgeons]], nurses, and traditional [[empirics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=William L.|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–295|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmid=1739168|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women treated everyone, not only women as historians once thought. The names of 24 women described as surgeons in Naples between 1273 and 1410 are known, and references have been found to 15 women practitioners, most of them Jewish and none described as midwives, in Frankfurt between 1387 and 1497.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siraisi|first1=Nancy G.|title=Medieval and Early Renaissance Medicine: An Introduction to Knowledge and Practice|date=2009-05-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-76131-2|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without leaving any trace of their activities in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care.
Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male dominated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their real motives. If they were not accused of malpractice, then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. According to documents, Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period. Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care, likewise, women did not involve themselves in men's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was an important center of medical learning and practice in the 12th century.  There, the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] gathered a number of her medical practices in several written collections.  One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England.  There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, ed. and trans., ''The 'Trotula': A Medieval Compendium of Women’s Medicine'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dorotea Bucca]] was another distinguished Italian physician. She held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the University of Bologna for over forty years from 1390.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite journal| author= JS Edwards |title= A Woman Is Wise: The Influence of Civic and Christian Humanism on the Education of Women in Northern Italy and England during the Renaissance |journal=Ex Post Facto: Journal of the History Students at San Francisco State University |volume =XI | year=2002 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/2002/edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RoqNOWuNa8oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22dorotea+bucca%22 Howard S.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little specific information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.  Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (singular, ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.  For example, the late 10th/early 11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]], in explaining how to excise bladder stones, notes that the procedure is difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients: because of the need to touch the genitalia, the male practitioner must either find a female doctor who can perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who takes instruction from the male surgeon.  In other words, even though direct evidence for female practitioners is rare, their existence can be inferred.&lt;ref&gt;Monica H. Green, "History of Science," ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures''.  Volume I: ''Methodologies, Paradigms and Sources'', Suad Joseph, general editor (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), pp. 358-61; Peter Pormann, "Female Patients and Practitioners in Medieval Islam," ''The Lancet'' 373 (May 9, 2009), pp. 1598-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As al-Zahrawi's example also suggests, midwives played an important role in the delivery of women's healthcare.  For these practitioners, there is more detailed information, both in terms of the prestige of their craft ([[ibn Khaldun]] calls it a noble craft, "something necessary in civilization") and in terms of biographical information on historic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giladi Avner | year = 2010 | title = Liminal Craft, Exceptional Law:  Preliminary Notes on Midwives in Medieval Islamic Writings | url = | journal = International Journal of Middle East Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 2| pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1017/s0020743810000012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Molénat, "Priviligiées ou poursuivies: quatre sages-femmes musulmanes dans la Castille du XVe siècle," ''Identidades marginales'', ed.

===Western medicine in China===
[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.  However, Western Medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816-1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).  Sun later led the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]], which changed China from an empire to a republic. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, women of China were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, [[Hü King Eng]], to study medicine at [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's [[Woolston Memorial Hospital]] in 1899 and trained several female physicians.&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite book | title=Notable Women of Modern China | last1=Burton | first1=Margaret E. | author-link=Margaret E.

===Women's health movement in the 1970s===
The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]]{{where|date=August 2015}}. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes.

Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[women's movement]].

A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]]. Wendy Kline &lt;ref&gt;Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the blurring of "clinical" and "sexual" that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction ."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellen Frankfort's book ''Vaginal Politics'', Frankfort talks about the "shame" and "humiliation" felt during a pap test; "I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders "&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, Ellen. ''Vaginal Politics'' (New York: Vintage, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed.  One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, "Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.&lt;ref&gt;Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines,'' 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

With women entering the medical field and women's rights movements came also the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Women’s Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices. Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental, warm, and comfortable care for women.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Kline speaks to this claim women were taking on their body in relation to the medical world; women felt that "not only should women have access to information about their bodies... they should also help to create this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women’s Health in the Second Wave, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].

While scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—the study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the [[women's movement]] in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].  Two publications in 1973 were critical in establishing the women's health movement and scholarship about women in medicine: First, the publication of ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' in 1973 by the Boston Women's Health Collective,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; and second, "Witches, Midwives, and Nurses: A History of Female Healers", a short paper by [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]] also in 1973.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich-English-1973-Witches" /&gt; The Ehrenreich/English paper examined the history of women in medicine as the professionalization of the field excluded women, particularly [[midwifery|midwives]], from the practice.  Ehrenreich and English later expanded the work into a full-length book, ''[[For Her Own Good]]'', which connected the exclusion of women from the practice of medicine to [[sexism|sexist]] medical practices; this text and ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' became key texts in the women's health movement. The English/Ehrenreich text laid out some early insights about the professionalization of medicine and the exclusion of women from the profession, and numerous scholars, such as [[Diana Elizabeth Long]], have greatly built upon and expanded this work.

The '''Yonaguni language''' ({{lang|yoi|与那国物言/ドゥナンムヌイ}} ''Dunan Munui'') is a [[Southern Ryukyuan languages|Southern Ryukyuan language]] spoken by around 400 people on the island of [[Yonaguni]], in the [[Ryukyu Islands]], the westernmost of the chain lying just east of [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="KieferBlevins2017"&gt;{{cite book

Due to the Japanese policy on languages, the language is not recognized by the government, which instead calls it the {{nihongo|Yonaguni dialect|与那国方言|Yonaguni hōgen}}. As classified by [[UNESCO]], the Yonaguni language is the most endangered language in all of Japan.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===

The table below shows the [[vowel]]s present in the Yonaguni language. Vowels which are only [[Allophone|allophonic]] appear in parentheses.

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|- style="font-size: 90%;"
!
![[Front vowel|Front]]
![[Central vowel|Central]]
![[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! &lt;small&gt;[[Close vowel|Close]]&lt;/small&gt;
| {{IPA link|i}}
|
| {{IPA link|u}}
|-
! &lt;small&gt;[[Near-close vowel|Near-close]]&lt;/small&gt;
| ({{IPA link|ɪ}})
|
| ({{IPA link|ʊ}})
|-
! &lt;small&gt;[[Close-mid vowel|Close-Mid]]&lt;/small&gt;
|

|-
! &lt;small&gt;[[Open vowel|Open]]&lt;/small&gt;
|
| {{IPA link|a}}
|({{IPA link|ɑ}})
|}
:{{note|o|a}} [o] can also probably be recognized as an independent phoneme and not just as an allophone of /u/. However, its distribution is very limited. Excluding a few interjections, the only morpheme in which it appears is the sentence-final, exclamatory particle ''do''.

===Consonants===

The table below shows the [[consonant]]s present in the Yonaguni language. Consonants which are only [[Allophone|allophonic]] appear in parentheses. Plosive and affricate [[phoneme]]s have three-way contrast between fortis, lenis, and voiced consonants.

===Phonological cognates===

As a Southern Ryukyuan language, Yonaguni, similar to [[Miyako language|Miyako]] and [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]],  has {{IPA|/b/}} in place with [[Standard Japanese]] {{IPA|/w/}}, such as Yonaguni {{IPA|/bada/}} ('stomach, belly'), cognate with Japanese {{IPA|/wata/}} ('guts, bowels').  Yonaguni also has {{IPA|/d/}} where Japanese and other Ryukyuan languages have {{IPA|/j/}} (orthographically ''y''). Thus, for example, Yonaguni {{IPA|/dama/}} ('mountain') is cognate with Japanese and Yaeyama {{IPA|/jama/}} ('id.'). Yonaguni {{IPA|/d/}} is probably a recent development from an earlier {{IPA|*/j/}}, however, judging from the fact that even the {{IPA|*/j/}} in loanwords of [[Chinese language|Sinitic]] origin is pronounced {{IPA|/d/}} by speakers of the Yonaguni language.

The Yonaguni language exhibits intervocalic voicing of [[plosive]]s, as do many Japonic languages. It also exhibits the tendency for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, especially when intervocalic, to be pronounced as a velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, as in Standard Japanese.

===Syllable structure===

Below is the syllable template for Dunan:

:(C (G) ) V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (N)

* C = consonant
* G = glide [w] or [j]
* V = vowel
* N = [[Japanese_phonology#The_moraic_nasal_.2F.C9.B4.2F|moraic nasal]]

The [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] allows for a single consonant with the occasional presence of a glide. The [[Syllable#Nucleus|nucleus]] can contain up to two vowels. The only allowable [[Syllable#Coda|coda]] is a moraic nasal.

==Writing system==
{{main|Kaidā logogram}}
Yonaguni was once written with a unique writing system called [[Kaidā logogram]]s. However, after conquest by the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] and later annexation by the [[Empire of Japan]], the logograms were replaced by Japanese kana and Chinese characters.
