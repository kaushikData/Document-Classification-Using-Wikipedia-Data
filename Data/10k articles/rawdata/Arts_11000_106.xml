[[File:AGroupOfNobleDames.jpg|thumb|First US edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Harper and Brothers]])]]
'''''A Group of Noble Dames''''' is an 1891 collection of short stories written by [[Thomas Hardy]]. The stories are contained by a [[frame story|frame narrative]] in which ten members of a club each tell one story about a noble dame in the 17th or 18th century.

==Contents==
'''Part I—Before Dinner'''
*''The First Countess of Wessex'' by the local historian
*''[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]'' by the old surgeon
*''The Marchioness of Stonehenge'' by the rural dean
*''Lady Mottisfont'' by the sentimental member
'''Part II—After Dinner'''
*''The Lady Icenway'' by the churchwarden
*''Squire Petrick’s Lady'' by the crimson maltster
*''Anna, Lady Baxby'' by the colonel
*''The Lady Penelope'' by the man of family
*''The Duchess Of Hamptonshire'' by the quiet gentleman
*''The Honourable Laura'' by the spark

==Publication==
All ten stories were published in serial magazines before Hardy collected them into book form. "The Duchess of Hamptonshire" and "The Honourable Laura" were written relatively early in Hardy's career, in 1878 and 1881 respectively. "The First Countess of Wessex" and "The Lady Penelope" were written in 1888-89. Hardy revised all four of these stories significantly before adding them to the collection in 1891. The remaining six stories were written in early 1890 and published in [[bowdlerised]] form in a special Christmas number of ''[[The Graphic]]'' in December 1890.

Hardy collected all ten stories together for the first time in ''A Group of Noble Dames'', which was published in England by Osgood, McIlvaine, &amp; Co. and in America by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] in 1891. The critical reception of the book was mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wallace, William|title=Brief review: ''A Group of Noble Dames''|journal=[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]|date=22 Aug 1891|volume=40|issue=1007|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzcZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brief review: ''A Group of Noble Dames''|journal=[[National Review (London)|The National Review]]|date=March–August 1891|volume=17|page=845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayktAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TV and Film Adaptations==
"[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]" was adapted as a television drama by the BBC as part of an anthology series called ''Wessex Tales''. Broadcast 12 December 1973 on [[BBC2]].

'''''ArtAsiaPacific''''' is the longest running English-language periodical solely dedicated to covering [[contemporary art]] and [[culture]] from sixty-seven countries, territories, and [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|Chinese Special Administrative Regions]] that it considers to be within Asia, the Pacific, and the Middle East. It is published six times a year and is distributed internationally. A regular issue includes feature-length articles on artists, themes or events; essays; profiles on artists or collectors; reviews of biennials, exhibitions, art publications and films; news including obituaries and appointments; auction and art fair reports; and previews of shows. 

''ArtAsiaPacific'' produces an annual [[almanac]] edition, published in January, which surveys the past year in the 67 countries and territories covered in the magazine. In addition to news, exhibition, festival and country reports, the almanac includes reports on five outstanding artists from the previous year and one promising artist for the next year, and essays written by prominent curators and cultural figures.

==History==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Backissuecover1.jpg|thumb|''Art and Asia Pacific'' Issue no.1, June 1993]] --&gt;
The magazine first launched as ''Art and Asia Pacific'' in June 1993 in Australia. Published quarterly, it began more as an academic journal than a standard consumer magazine and each issue would focus on a different country or theme. While the first issue was published by Janet Gough, it was then published and edited by Dynah Dysart/Fine Art Press Pty Limited, [[Sydney]], until October 2003. It was then  purchased by Gang Zhao and Wendy Siegelman and moved to New York.

In the fall of 2004, Elaine W. Ng took over as editor-in-chief, and eventually purchased and co-published the magazine along with author [[Simon Winchester]] in March 2005, effectively re-launching it under the slogan "Today's Art From Tomorrow's World." This marked a dramatic movement in the magazine's design and focus; the editorial content became more journalistic and reader-friendly. In 2006, the first almanac edition of the magazine was released with the goal of covering the past year in Asian art and culture along with profiles and informational listings of each of the 67 countries covered by the magazine.

As of January 2007, Elaine W. Ng is the sole publisher and editor-in-chief of the magazine. Formerly, produced in an office in the gallery district of [[Manhattan| Manhattan's]] [[Chelsea (Manhattan)|Chelsea]] neighborhood, the magazine moved production to [[Hong Kong]] in 2011.

'''Celia''' is one of the important characters of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]''.

Celia is the daughter of Duke Frederick and niece of the banished Duke Senior. Celia and [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] are cousins but they have sisterly affection.
==Physical appearance==
Celia is beautiful, but with a beauty less sparkling than that of Rosalind. [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]] describes both of them as 'fair and excellent ladies'. 

Celia is shorter than her cousin and less majestic in appearance. She has a gentle expression combined with a habitual serious appearance. Hence Rosalind addresses her at one time as 'my pretty little coz', and at another as, 'sad brow and true maid'.

==Love for Rosalind==

Celia's love for Rosalind knows no limits and is frequently referred to in the play. Charles, the wrestler, relates that Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have followed Rosalind into exile in case Rosalind too had been banished along with her father.

Le Beau, the courtier, describes their love as 'dearer than the natural bond of sisters'. This shows that her love for cousin is pure and supreme.

==Character==

Celia is silent and reserved. She is more conventional than Rosalind and hence more worldly and prudent. Her silence is in contrast to Rosalind's talkative nature. However, Celia, by her prudence, exercises command over herself as well as over others. When the two cousins are alone, Celia is full of life and humour, but in the presence of others she is content to play the part of a spectator. She first listens and judges what to speak, exactly opposite to Rosalind.  Some consider that Celia's individual character has been overlooked by literary critics in favour of the more central character of Rosalind.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=UMjPwZa5TBsC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=celia+as+you+like+it&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7x2KU66XG4KiO9GFgPAD&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=celia%20as%20you%20like%20it&amp;f=false Clara Calvo, "In Defence of Celia: Discourse Analysis and Women's Discourse in 'As You Like It'", in ''Feminist Linguistics in Literary Criticism]] (ed. Katie Wales), 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Marriage with Oliver==

Celia's love for Oliver is sudden, intense and uncontrollable, despite the knowledge of Oliver's past wicked deeds. In this connection, it should be remembered that love in Shakespeare is an irrational passion.

Celia's marriage with Oliver has been criticised by many critics. [[Stopford Brooke (chaplain)|Stopford Brooke]] opines that this marriage is against probability because it looks strange that Oliver should change in a moment from the scoundrel. But her marriage with Oliver does not bring disgrace to her character. Oliver was a bad character but has changed into a good one by a sudden stroke. So Celia's marriage with Oliver is not a blot on her character.

==Alternative interpretations==
It has been suggested that Celia's role in the play is "subversive", in the sense that she adds to the sexual complications of the plot by her friendship with the cross-dressing Rosalind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.uakron.edu/ovsc/issues/current-issue/the-dangers-of-playing-house-celias-subversive-role-in-as-you-like-it/ Selected Papers of the Ohio Valley Shakespeare Conference - Allison Grant, "The Dangers of Playing House: Celia’s Subversive Role in As You Like It"]. Accessed 31 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Celia effectively sets up home with Rosalind in the forest, requiring no male presence, and her marriage to Oliver may be regarded as a means of prolonging their relationship rather than the result of any affection she feels for him.

==Performance==

Celia has been played by various notable actresses on screen. [[Sophie Stewart]] played Celia in a 1936 film, [[Rosalind Knight]] in the 1963 UK television series, [[Angharad Rees]] in the [[BBC Television Shakespeare#As You Like It|1978 BBC version]] of the play directed by Basil Coleman, and [[Romola Garai]] in the [[As You Like It (2006 film)|2006 production]] directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]].  In a 1985 production by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], Celia was played by [[Fiona Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=UMjPwZa5TBsC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=celia+as+you+like+it&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7x2KU66XG4KiO9GFgPAD&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=celia%20as%20you%20like%20it&amp;f=false Clara Calvo, "In Defence of Celia: Discourse Analysis and Women's Discourse in 'As You Like It'", in ''Feminist Linguistics in Literary Criticism]] (ed.

==History==

[[File:Chapter Arts in Cardiff.jpg|thumb|right|Image taken in 2006, prior to the redevelopment]] 

Chapter was founded by Welsh artists, [[Christine Kinsey]] and Bryan Jones with journalist Mike Flood and opened in 1971.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.chapter.org/history.html A Brief History of Chapter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003184935/http://www.chapter.org/history.html |date=3 October 2011 }}, Chapter Arts Centre website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The building was previously a school, Canton High School, and was built in 1905.&lt;ref name="AJ2010"&gt;Rory Olcayto [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/culture/chapter-arts-centre-cardiff-by-ash-sakula-architects/5215220.article ''Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, by Ash Sakula Architects''], The Architects' Journal, 11 March 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Chapter underwent a £3.8 million redevelopment, designed by architects [[Ash Sakula Architects]], who were appointed in 2006. The practice prioritised remodelling of the public areas on the ground floor, while adding a storey-high 'light box' above the main entrance as an 'artistic billboard'.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; The centre remained open through the redevelopment and the new Chapter opened in November 2009. The building won a [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A.]] Wales Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx RIBA Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310122544/http://www.architecture.com/RegionsAndInternational/UKNationsAndRegions/Wales/Awards/RIBA%20Awards.aspx |date=10 March 2012 }}, R.I.B.A. website. Retrieved 2011-11-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The new open-plan design was described as user friendly with many great details.&lt;ref name="AJ2010" /&gt; 

Following the Centre's refurbishment in 2009, the number of visitors doubled to 800,000 per year, making it the second most popular attraction in Cardiff.&lt;ref name="Unveils plans"&gt;Cathy Owen (11 April 2014) [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/arts-culture-news/chapter-arts-centre-unveils-plans-6949419 "Chapter Arts Centre unveils plans for £6m expansion"], ''WalesOnline''. Retrieved 2014-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of March 2014 Chapter installed 60 photovoltaic [[Solar cells|solar panels]] to their roof providing up to 15KW of electricity. {{cn|date=April 2014}}

In the autumn of 2014 Chapter became a venue for the international [[Artes Mundi]] exhibition and art prize, which expanded for the first time beyond the [[National Museum Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Emma Crichton-Miller |title=Artes Mundi: international art in Cardiff |work=Apollo Magazine |date=13 November 2014 |url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/artes-mundi-international-art-cardiff/ |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 Chapter announced that the main Theatre and Stiwdio spaces would be renamed to celebrate a significant donation from [http://www.aandbcymru.org.uk/david-and-philippa-seligman/ David Seligman]. The spaces will be known as Theatr Seligman Theatre and Stiwdio Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chapter celebrates significant donation from David Seligman|url = http://www.chapter.org/news-noise/news/chapter-celebrates-significant-donation-david-seligman|website = Chapter|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Bargue''' (c. 1826/1827 – April 6, 1883) was a [[France|French]] painter and lithographer noted for devising an influential drawing course.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Bargue The Chess Game.jpg|thumb|''The Chess Game'', by Charles Bargue]]
He is mostly remembered for his ''Cours de dessin'', one of the most influential classical drawing courses conceived in collaboration with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by [[Goupil &amp; Cie]], comprised 197 [[lithograph]]s printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model. The Charles Bargue Drawing Course is used by many academies and ateliers which focus of [[classical realism]]. Among the artists whose work is based on the study of Bargue's plate work are Pablo Picasso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glueck|first1=Grace|title=In the Days When Artists Were Taught How to Draw|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/books/art-review-in-the-days-when-artists-were-taught-how-to-draw.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who copied the complete set in 1880/1881, and (at least a part of it) again in 1890.

Bargue was a student of Jean-Léon Gérôme.  Bargue worked closely with Gérôme and was influenced by his style, which included Orientalist scenes and historical genre.  Bargue's last painting was completed by Gérôme and is now conserved in the Malden Public Library, [[Malden, Massachusetts]], USA. He travelled extensively through North Africa, and the Balkans, during which time he executed many portraits of local people with meticulous detail.

'''Clare Victoria Balding''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 29 January 1971)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/raiseyourgame/sites/concentration/getyourkiton/pages/clare_balding.shtml "Clare Balding"], interview on BBC Wales website&lt;/ref&gt; is a broadcaster, journalist and author. She currently presents for [[BBC Sport]], [[Channel 4]], [[BT Sport]] and formerly presented the religious programme ''Good Morning Sunday'' on [[BBC Radio 2]].

==Early life and family==
Balding was educated at [[Downe House School|Downe House]] in Berkshire, where she was Head Girl and a contemporary of comedian [[Miranda Hart]]. Hart and Balding are in fact tenth-cousins, sharing a nine-times-great-grandfather in [[Sir William Leveson-Gower, 4th Baronet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w7dv9 Miranda] BBC Two, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Clare Balding applied to read law at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], but failed her interview and realised that law was not what she most wanted to do.&lt;ref name="camb"&gt;[http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAMArticles/CAM%2052/My%20Time%20at%20Cambridge.pdf My Time At Cambridge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072305/http://www.alumni.cam.ac.uk/uploads/File/CAMArticles/CAM%2052/My%20Time%20at%20Cambridge.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She later successfully applied to [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], and read English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Clare Balding, BBC sports presenter|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-clare-balding-bbc-sports-presenter-2014814.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=1 July 2010|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Sale}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at university she was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] in Easter 1992 and graduated in 1993 with a 2:1 honours degree.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

From 1988 to 1993, Balding was a leading amateur [[flat racing|flat]] jockey and Champion Lady Rider in 1990. Her memoir ''My Animals and Other Family'' documents her life growing up in a racing yard. It won the National Book Awards "Autobiography of the Year" in 2012.

Clare Balding has close family links to horse racing: her father, [[Ian Balding]], trained [[Mill Reef]], 1971 winner of [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] and [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]]; and her younger brother, [[Andrew Balding]], trained [[Casual Look]], the winner of the 2003 [[Epsom Oaks]]. The latter win led to a very emotional post-race interview with her brother. Her uncle [[Toby Balding]] trained winners in the [[Grand National]], [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] and [[Champion Hurdle]]. Furthermore, her maternal grandfather was the trainer [[Peter Hastings-Bass]] and her maternal uncle [[Earl of Huntingdon|the 17th Earl of Huntingdon]] was once trainer to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Her maternal grandmother, [[Priscilla Hastings]], is descended from the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]] and was one of the first women elected to membership of the [[Jockey Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/priscilla-hastings-racing-trainer-who-bridged-the-gender-gap-in-her-sport-2070137.html|title=Priscilla Hastings: Racing trainer who bridged the gender gap in her sport|accessdate=6 November 2012 | location=London|work=The Independent|first=Sue|last=Montgomery|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Balding's well-documented aristocratic lineage on her mother's side can be seen in records that [[TheGenealogist]] has identified in research.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=TheGenealogist featured article on Clare Balding|url=https://www.thegenealogist.co.uk/featuredarticles/2017/who-do-you-think-you-are/clare-balding-556/|website=TheGenealogist|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found Balding's maternal line reveals that she is the great-granddaughter of [[Sir Malcolm Bullock, 1st Baronet|Sir Malcolm Bullock]] whose sexuality was investigated in her episode of the ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (UK TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' programme first broadcast in July 2017. Balding's paternal grandfather [[Gerald Barnard Balding Sr.|Gerald Barnard Balding Sr]], was a 10-goal polo player who travelled to play polo in America in the 1920s when he was in his 20s. Outbound passenger lists on a genealogy website include Balding's grandfather and it was at this time that Gerald Balding Sr met and later married the American heiress, Eleanor Hoagland.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Broadcasting career ==
Clare became a trainee with BBC National Radio in 1994, working on [[BBC Radio Five Live|5 Live]], [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] (presenting the sport on the [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] Breakfast Show), [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. In June 1995, she made her debut as a television presenter, introducing highlights of [[Royal Ascot]]. The following year she began presenting live, and in December 1997 she became the BBC's lead horse racing presenter after the retirement of [[Julian Wilson (broadcaster)|Julian Wilson]], and has fronted coverage of the [[Grand National]].
Infamously humiliating Liam Treadwell Grand National winner 2009.

Balding has reported from six [[Olympic Games]], for [[BBC Radio]] in [[Atlanta]] and for BBC Television in Sydney, [[Athens]], Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro. She has presented four [[Paralympic Games]], the [[Winter Olympics]] from Salt Lake City, [[Turin]], Vancouver and [[Sochi]] as well as the [[Commonwealth Games]] from [[Melbourne]], [[Delhi]] and [[Glasgow]]. She was the face of the BBC's [[rugby league]] coverage, having presented ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'' from a Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] semi-final, and having been so impressed by the vibrancy and physical challenge of the sport she asked to cover further rugby league events.

===Copy-control controversy===
Balding was involved in a copy-control controversy in 2017, when it was alleged that she or her agent rewrote part of an interview that she gave to ''[[Saga plc|Saga]]'' magazine, provoking the journalist [[Ginny Dougary]] to remove her byline from the interview. According to Dugarry, Balding removed sections of the text and inserted promotional material about her new book, as well as details of her hosting of the women’s European football championships and the words "And indeed she [Balding] sparkles all the way through the photo shoot," despite Dougary commenting that this was not the case and that Balding was rather "a brisk, jolly-hockey-sticks type".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dougary|first1=Ginny|title=How BBC star Clare Balding nicked my byline|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/30/celebrity-interview-bullying-behaviour-balding-saga|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=The Observer|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=Should PRs ever ask for copy approval?

On 29 May 2009, Balding announced that she had [[Thyroid neoplasm|thyroid cancer]].

On 21 August 2009, she announced that the radioactive iodine had been successful with no signs of the cancer having spread.

In July 2010, Balding made a complaint to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] over an article by writer [[A. A. Gill]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that she felt had mocked her sexuality and appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10817463|title= Clare Balding makes Sunday Times sex jibe complaint|publisher= BBC News|date= 30 July 2010|accessdate= 30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for which the newspaper refused to apologise.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Davies [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/30/clare-balding-lesbian-complaint-gill Clare Balding complains to press watchdog over 'dyke' jibe], ''The Guardian'', 30 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The PCC found in her favour, judging that AA Gill had "refer[red] to the complainant's sexuality in a demeaning and gratuitous way".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11333484 Clare Balding complaint over sexuality is upheld] BBC News, 17 September 2010; Retrieved 17 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, she was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Pride Power List 2014|url=http://www.worldpridepowerlist.com/|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208160458/http://www.worldpridepowerlist.com/|archivedate=8 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Liam Treadwell's Grand National victory on 4 April 2009, Balding interviewed him and made fun of his apparently bad teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.uk.msn.com/forum/thread.aspx?page=1&amp;thread=00000071-0000-0000-0be5-0f0000000000&amp;board=00000071-0302-0000-0000-000000000000 | title = Presenter apologises for teeth jibe | accessdate = 6 April 2009 | date = 6 April 2009 | publisher = Microsoft (MSN News UK) | location = United Kingdom | quote = The BBC has apologised to Grand National winner Liam Treadwell after presenter Clare Balding made fun of his teeth.

A BBC spokeswoman said: "Clare Balding... has also apologised directly to Liam Treadwell."  The jockey told the Daily Mail that Balding had apologised by text message.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the [[BBC]] and Balding apologised by 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7985997.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Jockey on Balding teeth joke | date=6 April 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balding later clarified on BBC's ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' quiz that she believed Treadwell to have had his teeth "kicked out" by a horse, a common injury suffered by jockeys, apologising again for her error.

In 2014, Balding publicly backed [[Hacked Off]] and its campaign towards UK press self-regulation by "safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/benedict-cumberbatch-alfonso-cuaron-maggie-689289 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Georg | last=Szalai | title=Benedict Cumberbatch, Alfonso Cuaron, Maggie Smith Back U.K. Press Regulation | date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/campaign-group-hacked-off-urge-newspaper-industry-to-back-the-royal-charter-on-press-freedom-9197869.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Burrell | title=Campaign group Hacked Off urge newspaper industry to back the Royal Charter on press freedom | date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hackinginquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4282-HackedOff-Guardian-ad-286x440-d3.png]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319063439/http://hackinginquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/4282-HackedOff-Guardian-ad-286x440-d3.png |date=19 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancestors ==
Balding's matrilineal great-great-grandparents [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]] and [[Alice Stanley, Countess of Derby|Lady Alice Montagu]] both descended from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. The earl's lineage can also be traced back to [[Sir Thomas Frankland, 2nd Baronet|Sir Thomas Frankland]]. This makes Balding a 11-times-great-granddaughter of [[Oliver Cromwell]].

She is also descended, via [[Joseph C. Hoagland]], from [[Sarah Rapelje]], the first woman of European descent born in what is now New York, to Dutch-settler parents.&lt;ref name="WDYTYA"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Clare Balding |series=Who Do You Think You Are? |serieslink=Who Do You Think You Are?

*'''It was what I wanted now was nearly invisible''' (2013) is a stack of papers next to a wall. Four- and five-digit-long numbers are printed on the paper tracking Zavitsanos’ projected student loan debt over the next 25 years and the minimum income necessary to make monthly loan payments.  Corinna Kirsch of ArtFCity has described the work as a strong statement with limited means. As Kirsch put it, "if a loan officer handed me thousands of pages showing my future indebtedness, I might’ve rethought signing away my future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://artfcity.com/2013/06/14/looking-at-our-financial-future-the-2013-whitney-isp-studio-exhibition/ Corinna Kirsch, "Looking at Our Financial Future: The 2013 Whitney ISP Studio Exhibition" Art F City, JUNE 14, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuco, Enguera.jpg|thumb|Cuco. Built with dry-masonry technique, Enguera (Valencia · España).]]
The  '''cuco''' is a type of construction made with the [[dry stone]] technique, in &lt;!-- the --&gt; [[Valencian Community|Valencia]].

At the Valencian autonomous community (''Comunidad Valenciana'') they are located geographically in the regions of the valley of Ayora-Cofrentes, La Costera and La Canal de Navarrés. The latter being the one that concentrates the greatest number of these constructions, highlighting quantitatively the entire municipality of Enguera.&lt;ref&gt;(es:) ''En Enguera se construyen en fincas agrícolas, alejadas del casco urbano. La amplitud de su término municipal favoreció su proliferación'' (In Enguera, they are built on agricultural farms, far from the urban center. The amplitude of its municipal district favored its proliferation). (Castellano Castillo, 2001, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

They use the raw materials found in their environment, rarely used manufactured materials. Two types of stone are used, the limestone that is used in the body of the construction, the one that holds the cover and the cover stone (tap:&lt;ref&gt;
(es:) ''Margas muy calcáreas, de color claro, que en este ámbito geográfico se conocen con el nombre de "tap"'' (Very calcareous margas, of a light color, which in this geographical area are known as "tap") · (Darder, 1929, 603).&lt;/ref&gt; white marls), lighter, on the deck.[[File:Cubierta de un cuco.jpg|thumb|Cuco. Detail of the wall on which the roof rests. Enguera (Valencia).]]

== Tipology ==
The typology of the constructions is very varied. The constructions of round plant predominate, although also those of quadrangular plant are frequent. In occasion the ''cuco'' adapts to the relief of the land and adopts an irregular plant.

The covering systems are all the same. A false dome is built by approaching courses.

The covering of the access spans is made with large slabs as a lintel. testimonially other typologies are documented as two slabs supported on both sides of the span, the approach of courses or the ''adovelado'' (with ''dovelas'') arch (built with irregular slabs arranged radially.

Inside the ''cucos'' you can find complementary structures: fireplace, cupboard, manger, etc.

They are usually free buildings, although sometimes they are attached to the roadways (terraces); or they can have a quadrangular annex space.

Detail of the outer area of the roof, in which the different layers that compose it are appreciated.&lt;!-- Detalle de la zona exterior de la cubierta, en el que se aprecian las distintas capas que lo componen. --&gt; Enguera (Valencia).]]

== Functionality ==
They are constructions destined to the refuge and temporary stays of the agriculturists. Its occupation used to be seasonal, coinciding with the moments of greater work in the agricultural parcels. Its use is different from that in other areas of the Valencian Community where it is linked to livestock.

'''Federico Ferrari''' (born 15 September 1969) is an Italian [[philosopher]] and [[art critic]]. He teaches Philosophy of Art at [[Brera Academy]], in Milan, Italy.

== Career ==
Under the influence of [[Maurice Blanchot]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] he has published many essays on philosophy, as well as literature. He has written two books with [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]: the first on the subject of nude,&lt;ref&gt;Ginette Michaud, ''Nus sommes [la peau des images], de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 192, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the second on the iconography of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Mavrikakis]], ''Iconographie de l’auteur, de Federico Ferrari et Jean-Luc Nancy'', Spirale, Montreal, n. 204, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, he has been working on the deconstruction of the museum in post-modernity, on the issue of art and/in time and on the ontological status of the image.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.teknemedia.net/magazine_detail.html?mId=8842/ Il re è nudo]" by Antonello Tolve in "Arskey"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.doppiozero.com/materiali/contemporanea/il-mondo-immagine-e-l%E2%80%99insieme-vuoto/ Il mondo-immagine e l'insieme vuoto]" by Fabrizio Migliorati in "doppiozero"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 he theorized the aesthetics of "Arte Essenziale", which manifested itself in the show held at [[Collezione Maramotti]] ([[Reggio Emilia]], Italy) and at [[Frankfurter Kunstverein]] (Germany).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fkv.de/files/111031_besucher_a4_arte_rz04.pdf/  Shortguide of the exhibition]" by FKV&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eugenio Viola]] writes of Ferrari, "In a time when many continue to lament what they see as the inexorable decline of theory’s role in criticism, “Arte essenziale” (Essential Art), curated by philosopher Federico Ferrari, does its part to placate concerns with an exploration of the ties that link artistic practice and philosophical speculation. The show focuses on the Wesen, or essence, of a work of art—a notion that has always been inextricably linked with a search for the new."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://artforum.com/picks/id=28538&amp;view=print/  Arte essenziale]" by Eugenio Viola in "Artforum"&lt;/ref&gt;

is an organization. Its main idea is to create detailed and public documentation for all stages of software creation. The foundation was established in 2002 on the grand opening of the semifinals of [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] by [[Anatoly Shalyto]]. This foundation was announced on the [[Linux Summit]] 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.ifmo.ru/foundation/linux/ Part of the program of Linux Summit 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalyto|Shalyto A.]] Naumov L.

[[Image:Shalyto Linux Summit 2004.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|[[Anatoly Shalyto]] on [[Linux Summit]] 2004, Helsinki ]]

== Motivation ==
The motivation for creating ''detailed'' documentation is considered the following:
* software quality increases
* program verification simplifies
* project modification becomes easier and safer

The motivation for making documentation ''open'' is considered the following:
* project becomes less dependent on its initial authors
* other people can easily understand structure and behaviour of a program
* design decisions reuse becomes easier and safer
* it becomes possible to use real project for study purposes

== Application ==
Foundation for Open Project Documentation gives a project a greater understandability and re-usability potential, than [[open source software|Open Source foundation]]. It is loosely connected with [[Free Software Foundation]]. OpenDoc project can also be commercial.

== Main principles ==
* The project documentation should be a base for source code, but not vice versa.
* The documentation should describe not only the final product, but also the creation process.
* The documentation should be easy to understand even for less qualified developers than its author.
* The documentation should be available every time anyone explores or modifies a project.

'''Francis Oliver Finch''' (1802–1862), was an English [[watercolour]] painter, and a member of [[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]], the group of young artists formed around [[Samuel Palmer]] and the elderly 
[[William Blake]] in the 1820s.

==Life==
Finch was the son of Francis Finch, a merchant in Friday Street, [[Cheapside]], London, was born on 22 November 1802, and spent his boyhood at Stone, near [[Aylesbury]]. When twelve years of age, at that time 
fatherless, he was placed under [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], with whom he worked altogether five years, a friend having paid a premium of £200. Among his earliest patrons was [[John Rushout, 2nd 
Baron Northwick|Lord Northwick]], a patron of the fine arts, who employed FInch in making views of his mansion and grounds. Some time after leaving his master's studio the same friend who had assisted in 
placing him there afforded him the benefit of a tour through Scotland.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

After his return he doubted for some time whether he should continue the  practice of landscape or enter as a student at the [[Royal Academy]]. He joined [[Henry Sass|Sass's life academy]] and produced several 
portraits, but circumstances drawing him back to landscape-painting he became a candidate for admission into the then newly formed [[Society of Painters in Water Colours]]. On 11 February 1822 he was elected an 
associate, and on 4 June 1827 a member of that society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, at that period living at 44 Conduit Street, Bond Street. He married in the spring of 1837, and lived in Charlotte Street for some time, and later in Argyle Square, [[Euston Road]]. 

He possessed a fine voice, and was a talented musician, and  a poet. He printed a collection of sonnets entitled ''An Artist's Dream''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; 

==Works==
Among his best works may be counted ''Garmallon's Tomb'', (oil 1820); ''View of Loch Lomond'' (1822); ''View on the River Tay'' (1827); ''View of Windsor Castle'' (1829); ''View of the College of Aberdeen'' (1832); ''The Dell of [[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (1835); ''Alpine Scene, Evening'' (1838); ''A Watch Tower'' (1840); ''The Thames near Cookham, Berkshire'' (1845); ''Ruined Temple, Evening'' (1852); ''Rocky Glen, Evening'' (1855); ''The Curfew - Gray's Elegy'' (1860); ''Pastoral Retreat'' (1861); and ''Moonlight over the Sea'' (1862). His portrait was engraved by A. Roffe.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Finch, Francis Oliver|last=Fagan|first=Louis Alexander|volume=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 10 October 1861 Finch lost the use of his limbs, and died 27 August 1862.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Goldbeater's skin''' is the processed outer membrane of the [[intestine]] of an animal, typically an [[oxen|ox]], valued for its strength against tearing. The term derives from its traditional use as durable layers interleaved between sheets of gold stock during the process of making [[gold leaf]] by [[goldbeating]], as a batch process producing many "leaves" at the same time. In the early modern production of [[airship]]s,&lt;!-- between the world wars -- consider citing here specific years of construction and operation, --&gt; application of its high strength-to-weight ratio and reliability were crucial for building at least the largest examples.

== Manufacture ==
To manufacture goldbeater's skin, the gut of [[oxen]] (or other [[cattle]]) is soaked in a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide]], washed, stretched, beaten flat and thin, and treated chemically to prevent [[putrefaction]]. A pack of 1,000 pieces of goldbeater's skin requires the gut of about 400 oxen and is {{convert|1|in}} thick.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up to 120 sheets of gold laminated with goldbeater's skin can be beaten at the same time, since the skin is thin and elastic and does not tear under heavy [[goldbeating]]. The resultant thickness of gold leaf can be as small as 1 μm-thick.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Application areas ==
=== Humidity sensor ===
Goldbeater's skin is used as the sensitive element in [[hygrometer]]s, since its [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] behavior includes  contraction or expansion in response to atmospheric humidity.
=== Early telephones ===
[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used a drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetised iron attached to its middle as a sound receiver (''see [[Invention of the telephone]]'').
=== Printing material ===
The [[North German Confederation]] printed 10- and 30-[[groschen]] [[postage stamp]]s on goldbeater's skin to prevent reuse of these high-value stamps. 
=== Airtight test instruments ===
[[Joseph Thomas Clover]] invented an apparatus for measuring the inhalation of [[chloroform]] in 1862; it included a large reservoir bag, lined with goldbeater's skin to make it airtight, into which a known volume of liquid chloroform was injected, while its contraction or expansion was monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, W.S. (1960), ''Essays on the First Hundred Years of Anaesthesia'', Vol. 2, Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh. {{ISBN|0-443-02866-4}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{confusing|date=January 2018}}

=== Old manuscripts repair ===
Due to its transparency, strength, and fairly uniform thickness, goldbeater's skin is also used to repair holes and tears in manuscripts written on [[vellum]].
=== Construction of airships  ===
Large quantities of goldbeater's skin were used to make the gas bags of early balloons created by the Royal Engineers at [[Chatham, Kent]] starting in 1881–82 culminating in 1883 with "The Heron", of 10,000 cu ft capacity.  The method of preparing and making gas-tight joins in the skins was known only to a family from Alsatia called Weinling who were employed by the RE for many years.  The British had a monopoly on the technique until around 1912 when the Germans adopted the material for the internal gas bags of the "Zeppelin" [[rigid airship]]s, exhausting the available supply: about 200,000 sheets were used for a typical [[World War I]] [[Zeppelin]], while the [[USS Shenandoah (ZR-1)|USS ''Shenandoah'']] needed 750,000 sheets.&lt;ref name="PTMD" &gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Steadman |date=2006-05-01 |title=The Goldbeater, the Cow and the Airship |url=http://www.ptt-museum.dk/en/online_magazine/previous_articles/broadcasting/?id=74 |publisher=Post &amp; Tele Museum, Denmark |accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheets were joined together and folded into impermeable layers.&lt;ref name="PTMD"/&gt;
=== Sealing of oboe mouthpieces ===
Goldbeater's skin (sometimes also called "fish skin" in this context) is sometimes also used to seal [[oboe]] [[Double reed|reed]]s to prevent them from leaking air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britanniareeds.com/_ItemDetail.as ItemID=210&amp;SesssionID=68662662&amp;code=0001000200010009&amp;sid=290&amp;stitle=Oboe%20Reed-making Goldbeaters' skin for Oboe - large - Oboe Reed-making - Britannia Reeds]&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Test material ===
The [[Tannin#Tests for tannins|goldbeater's skin test]] is used to assess the [[tannin]]g properties of a compound.
=== Early condoms ===
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, goldbeater's skin  was also used as a material for condoms.&lt;ref&gt;François Lebrun, ''Les "Funestes secrets"'' Les Collections de l'Histoire, 2nd quarter 2006, p.  63 {{ISSN|0182-2411}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Historical criticism''', also known as '''the historical-critical method''' or '''higher criticism''', is a branch of criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand "the world behind the text".&lt;ref name="Handbook, 78"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of biblical criticism|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=0-664-22314-1|edition=3rd ed., rev. and expanded.|author2=Soulen, R. Kendall|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While often discussed in terms of Jewish and Christian writings from ancient times, historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from various parts of the world and periods of history.
The primary goal of historical criticism is to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense or ''sensus literalis historicus''. The secondary goal seeks to establish a reconstruction of the historical situation of the author and recipients of the text. That may be accomplished by reconstructing the true nature of the events that the text describes. An ancient text may also serve as a document, record or source for reconstructing the ancient past, which may also serve as a chief interest to the historical critic. In regard to Semitic biblical interpretation, the historical critic would be able to interpret the literature of Israel as well as the history of Israel.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism|year=2001|publisher=John Knox|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 18th century [[Biblical criticism]], the term "higher criticism" was commonly used in mainstream scholarship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahn|first=general editor, Scott|title=Catholic Bible dictionary|year=2009|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-51229-5|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with "[[lower criticism]]". In the 21st century, historical criticism is the more commonly used term for higher criticism, and [[textual criticism]] is more common than the loose expression "lower criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism |year=2001|publisher=John Knox|pages=108, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical criticism began in the 17th century and gained popular recognition in the 19th and 20th centuries. The perspective of the early historical critic was rooted in [[Protestant Reformation]] ideology since its approach to biblical studies was free from the influence of traditional interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Ebeling. Word and Faith. Philadelphia, Fortress Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; Where historical investigation was unavailable, historical criticism rested on philosophical and theological interpretation. With each passing century, historical criticism became refined into various methodologies used today: [[source criticism]], [[form criticism]], [[redaction criticism]], [[tradition criticism]], [[canonical criticism]], and related methodologies.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt;

==Methods==
Historical-critical methods are the specific procedures &lt;ref name="Handbook, 78"/&gt; used to examine the text's historical origins, such as/the time, the place in which the text was written; its sources; and the events, dates, persons, places, things, and customs that are mentioned or implied in the text.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt;

===Application===
Application of the historical critical method, in [[biblical studies]], investigates the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as the [[New Testament]]. Historical critics compare texts to other texts written around the same time. An example is that modern biblical scholarship has attempted to understand the [[Book of Revelation]] in its 1st century historical context by identifying its [[literary genre]] with Jewish and Christian [[apocalyptic literature]].

In regard to the [[Gospels]], higher criticism deals with the [[synoptic problem]], the relations among [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]. In some cases, such as with several [[Pauline epistles]], higher criticism can confirm the traditional understanding of authorship.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Higher criticism understands the New Testament texts within a historical context: that is, that they are not adamantine but writings that express the ''traditio'' (what is handed down). The truth lies in the historical context.

In [[classical studies]], the 19th century approach to higher criticism set aside "efforts to fill ancient religion with direct meaning and relevance and devoted itself instead to the critical collection and chronological ordering of the source material."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (1985), Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, higher criticism, whether biblical, classical, Byzantine or medieval, focuses on the source documents to determine who wrote it and where and when it was written.

Historical criticism has also been applied to other religious writings from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Islam]].

===Methodologies===

]]

Historical criticism comprises several disciplines, including&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"/&gt; [[source criticism]], [[form criticism]], [[redaction criticism]], [[tradition criticism]], and [[radical criticism]].

====Source criticism====
{{Main|Source criticism}}
Source criticism is the search for the original sources which lie behind a given biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th century French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], and its most influential product is undoubtably [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' (1878), whose "insight and clarity of expression have left their mark indelibly on modern biblical studies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony F. Campbell]], SJ, "[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/9780631210719/perdue.pdf Preparatory Issues in Approaching Biblical Texts]," in ''The Hebrew Bible in Modern Study'', p. 6. Campbell renames source criticism as "origin criticism".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Two source hypothesis.png|thumb|250px|[[Source criticism]]: diagram of the [[two-source hypothesis]], an explanation for the relationship of the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.]]

====Form criticism====
{{Main|Form criticism}}

Form criticism breaks the Bible down into sections (''pericopes'', stories), which are analyzed and categorized by genres (prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament etc.). The form critic then theorizes on the pericope's ''Sitz im Leben'' ("setting in life"), the setting in which it was composed and, especially, used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibledudes.com/biblical-studies/form.php Bibledudes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tradition history]] is a specific aspect of form criticism, which aims at tracing the way in which the pericopes entered the larger units of the biblical canon, especially the way in which they made the transition from oral to written form. The belief in the priority, stability and even detectability, of oral traditions is now recognised to be so deeply questionable as to render tradition history largely useless, but form criticism itself continues to develop as a viable methodology in biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/3815_3767.pdf Yair Hoffman, review of Marvin A. Sweeney and Ehud Ben Zvi (eds.), ''The Changing Face of Form-Criticism for the Twenty-First Century'', 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redaction criticism====
{{Main|Redaction criticism}}
Redaction criticism studies "the collection, arrangement, editing and modification of sources" and is frequently used to reconstruct the community and purposes of the authors of the text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-relg-studies.scu.edu/facstaff/murphy/courses/exegesis/redaction.htm Religious Studies Department, Santa Clara University.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060228065539/http://www-relg-studies.scu.edu/facstaff/murphy/courses/exegesis/redaction.htm |date=2006-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pioneers of historical criticism as applied to the Bible include the Dutch scholars [[Desiderius Erasmus]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} (1466? – 1536) and [[Benedict Spinoza]] (1632–1677).&lt;ref&gt;

When it is applied to the Bible, the historical-critical method is distinct from the traditional, devotional approach.&lt;ref name="JInt"&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]]. [[Jesus, Interrupted]], HarperCollins, 2009. {{ISBN|0-06-117393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, while devotional readers concern themselves with the overall message of the Bible, historians examine the distinct messages of each book in the Bible.&lt;ref name="JInt"/&gt; Guided by the devotional approach, for example, Christians often combine accounts from different gospels into single accounts, but historians attempt to discern what is unique about each gospel, including how they differ.&lt;ref name="JInt"/&gt;

The phrase "higher criticism" became popular in Europe from the mid-18th century to the early 20th century to describe the work of such scholars as [[Jean Astruc]] (1684-1766), [[Johann Salomo Semler]] (1725–91), [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]] (1752–1827), [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] (1792–1860), and Wellhausen (1844–1918).&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In academic circles, it now is the body of work properly considered{{by whom?|date=July 2017}} "higher criticism", but the phrase is sometimes applied to earlier or later work using similar methods.

"Higher criticism" originally referred to the work of [[Germany|German]] biblical scholars of the [[Tübingen School]].  After the groundbreaking work on the [[New Testament]] by [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), the next generation, which included scholars such as [[David Friedrich Strauss]] (1808–74) and [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–72), analyzed in the mid-19th century the historical records of the Middle East from biblical times, in search of independent confirmation of events in the [[Bible]]. The latter scholars built on the tradition of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Rationalism|Rationalist]] thinkers such as [[John Locke]] (1632–1704), [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Gotthold Lessing]], [[Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] (1770–1831) and the French [[rationalism|rationalists]].

Such ideas influenced thought in [[England]] through the work of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and, in particular, through [[George Eliot]]'s translations of Strauss's ''The Life of [[Jesus]]'' (1846) and Feuerbach's ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1854). In 1860, seven [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Anglican]] theologians began the process of incorporating this historical criticism into Christian doctrine in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'', causing a five-year storm of controversy, which completely overshadowed the arguments over [[Charles Darwin]]'s newly-published ''[[The Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''. Two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862, but in 1864, they had the judgement overturned on appeal. ''La Vie de Jésus'' (1863), the seminal work by a Frenchman, [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), continued in the same tradition as Strauss and Feuerbach. In Catholicism, ''[[L'Evangile et l'Eglise]]'' (1902), the magnum opus by [[Alfred Loisy]] against the ''[[Essence of Christianity]]'' of [[Adolf von Harnack]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} (1851–1930) and ''La Vie de Jesus'' of Renan, gave birth to the [[modernist crisis]] (1902–61). Some scholars, such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884–1976) have used higher criticism of the Bible to "[[demythologization|demythologize]]" it.

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] argues that the term "historical-critical method" conflates two nonidentical distinctions, and prefers the term "Biblical criticism":
::Historical study... can be either critical or noncritical; and critical study can be historical or nonhistorical. This suggests that the term "historical-critical method" is an awkward hybrid and might better be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;
John Barton, ''The Nature of Biblical Criticism'', Westminster John Knox Press (2007), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Not a few observers, especially among religious circles, have criticized the historical-critical method as biased by ''a priori'' reasons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From these two principles the Modernists deduce two laws, which, when united with a third which they have already got from agnosticism, constitute the foundation of '''historical criticism'''. We will take an illustration from the Person of Christ. In the person of Christ, they say, science and history encounter nothing that is not human. Therefore, in virtue of the first canon deduced from agnosticism, whatever there is in His history suggestive of the divine, must be rejected. Then, according to the second canon, the historical Person of Christ was transfigured by faith; therefore everything that raises it above historical conditions must be removed. Lately, the third canon, which lays down that the person of Christ has been disfigured by faith, requires that everything should be excluded, deeds and words and all else that is not in keeping with His character, circumstances and education, and with the place and time in which He lived. A strange style of reasoning, truly; but it is Modernist criticism.
''[...]''
Now we ask here: Who is the author of this history? The historian? The critic? Assuredly, neither of these but the philosopher. From beginning to end everything in it is a priori.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">[[File:CasaOctaviusQartiogarden.jpg|thumb|The house's garden]]
'''The House of Loreius Tiburtinus''' (also called the '''House of Octavius Quartio''') is renowned for its meticulous and well-preserved artwork as well as its large gardens. It is located in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]]. It, along with the rest of Pompeii was preserved by the volcanic eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] on October A 24, 79 AD.

== History ==
[[Image:Map showing the main streets of Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Pompeii's layout highlighting main streets. Via Dell'Abbondanza is in green]]
The House of Loreius Tiburtinus was excavated between the years 1916  and 1921  by V. Spinazzola. It can be found on the Via Dell'Abbondanza (or street of abundance), one of the most prosperous streets in Pompeii.  There is considerable debate over the naming of this particular house.&lt;ref name="Tronchin"&gt;Tronchin, Francesca C. "An Eclectic Locus Artis: the Casa Di Octavius Quartio At Pompeii." Diss. Boston Univ., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Its original name of Loreius Tiburtinus was derived from electoral advertisements of sorts etched in the outer façade, some saying "Vote for Loreius" and others "Vote for Tiburtinus."  In fact, the last known owner of the house was a man named Octavius Quartio, whose bronze seal was found inside the house during excavation.&lt;ref name="Nappo"&gt;Nappo, Salvatore. Pompeii: Guide to the Lost City. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1988. 32-33, 41-45, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians choose to refer to this house as the House of Octavius Quartio.

[[Image:Pompeji Casa Di Octavio Quartio Wall.jpg|thumb|left|Painting on south wall of oecus]]
Pompeii is organized into a series of ''[[insulae]]'' or rectangular blocks of buildings made up of a combination of shops and residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5D*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book V Chapter 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Loreius Tiburtinus occupies almost its entire ''insula'' with a combination of its residential area and its garden. Also included in the ''insula'' were two ''cauponae'' (Inns where locals could receive a hot meal). Its location was convenient to both the palaestra and the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii|amphitheatre]], and the section of Via Dell'Abbondanza it occupied was closed off to cart traffic in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The inside of the house is fairly uniform in its organization, and matches the standard of much of the [[Roman architecture]] at the time. Unfortunately some of the house's original integrity was compromised before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|earthquake of 62 AD]].&lt;ref name="Tronchin"/&gt;

The entryway or anteroom leads into the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], a large open room with an ''[[impluvium]]'' in the center. This basin collected rainwater through a hole in the roof to be used by the patrons of the house. On the far side of the atrium is a modest [[peristyle]] where the original [[tablinum]] (office) once was. The lack of a functional tablinum is evidence of the earthquake's toll on the house's infrastructure. There are several [[oecus|oeci]] off the main atrium used as receiving rooms with various art displayed in each room. In the House of Loreius Tiburtinus, one specific oecus that borders the ''viridarium'' or indoor garden functioned as a ''[[triclinium]]'' or dining area where guests could be entertained. This room was particularly well decorated to please the many guests that must have passed through. Bordering the garden is a summer ''triclinium'' where diners could recline during the warmer months.&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt;

==Gardens==
[[Image:Pyrthis.jpg|thumb|Pyramus and Thisbe in the house of Loreius Tiburtinus]]
The House of Loreius Tiburtinus is particularly well known for its extensive gardens and outdoor ornamentation. Beyond the summer triclinium there was a specific arrangement of two ''Euripi'', a decorative type of fountain. These fountains were the centerpiece for many [[fresco]]es and statuettes. The upper ''Epirus''  has a strong significance to the excavated city of Pompeii because its decorative frescoes are the source of the only known artist's signature: "Lucius pinxit" or "Painted by Lucius."&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt; These frescoes portray the myths of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]  on one side of the fountain and [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] on the other. The other lower Euripus is a fountain that spans the long garden which holds numerous types of foliage including various fruit trees. All of these fountains operate using a technology called castellum plumbeum, a fairly complex water pressure system which functioned with the local water towers, providing to several locations.

=== Early life ===
Kaća Čelan ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Каћа Челан}}) was born and grew up in [[Ratkovo (Odžaci)]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soinfo.org/vesti/vest/15658/1/Heimatbuch-premijerno-u-petak/ |title="Heimatbuch" premijerno u petak |date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |work=SOinfo.org |author=triletrip |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spero&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/ljubavna-prica-nemice-i-cuvara-logora-u-somboru/y6knx3l |title=Ljubavna priča Nemice i čuvara logora u Somboru |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |work=Blic |author=Špero, Sofija P. |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area in the multicultural and multifaceted region of [[Vojvodina]], dominated by five cultures and languages: Serbian, Hungarian, German, Ukrainian (Rusyn) and Czech, which influenced and shaped her early childhood. She graduated from the scientific high school in [[Odžaci]]&lt;ref name=spero/&gt; and its rigorous classical curriculum with straight A's as best student of her generation.

=== Move to Sarajevo ===
After finishing her high school education, she chose the city of [[Sarajevo]] as her "home of choice". Her studies in the Olympic metropolis included [[comparative literature]], theatre studies, and acting at the [[University of Sarajevo]]. Following her studies, she founded Teatar Amfiteatar Sarajevo (TAS) theatre, which she ran for seven years. Čelan has also worked as a directing professor at the Academy for Scenic Arts, Sarajevo. Her awards have included Best Young Actress in [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the Yugoslavian award for [[avant-garde]] Arts, and Best Director award at the Avant-garde Theatre Festival in [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]].

=== Slovenia and Germany ===
Prior to the siege of Sarajevo, Čelan moved to [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]], where she worked as a writer and director for a year. With a fellowship from the German cultural department and the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] in hand, she moved to Germany in 1993. In the Böll-House, she founded the TAS theatre in exile, and during its first project, ''Project 3'', she toured well-known German theatres such as the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] and Hamburg's [[Thalia Theater (Hamburg)|Thalia Theater]].

In 1995, Čelan won the first prize for the best German-language play from the [[:de:Bund der Theatergemeinden|Bund der Theatergemeinden]] (Alliance of the German Theatre Community) for her play ''{{Lang|de|Heimatbuch}}''. That was followed by the International Award, Kristal Vilenice, for poetry in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vilenica.si/kristal_vilenice.html International Literary Festival, 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328162435/http://www.vilenica.si/kristal_vilenice.html |date=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the Cultural Minister of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] awarded her the prize in theatre literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuenstlerinnenpreis.nrw.de/celan/celan.html 1997 Theatre Literature Award from the Cultural Minister of NRW, Germany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426204732/http://www.kuenstlerinnenpreis.nrw.de/celan/celan.html |date=2007-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York and Los Angeles ===
In 2008, Čelan re-established Theater TAS in New York City with the performance and installation ''Yard Sale: New Footfalls...'' as its first production, presented by the arts organization [[chashama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyartbeat.com/event/2009/2F14 NY Art Beat – ''Yard Sale: New Footfalls...'']&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of [[PEN American Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatertas.com/nyc/ Theater TAS Official, NYC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106100151/http://www.theatertas.com/nyc/ |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theater TAS production of [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s play "Blood on the Cat's Neck" directed by Čelan was presented in March 2014 by the [[Goethe-Institut]] LA as a multimedia theater and film performance. On June 28, 2014, the [[Max Kade]] Institute at the [[University of Southern California]] hosted the multimedia reading of Čelan's play "Woyzeck von Sarajevo" under her direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatertas.com Theater TAS Official, Current]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Fox-Hubbard''' (also '''Fox''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Tameka Empson]]. She is the half-sister of [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]), and aunt to [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) and [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]). She first appeared as a guest character on 24 November 2009, and was reintroduced in 2010 as a regular character after piquing the interest of new executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. Empson took maternity leave in October 2013 and after appearing several times during her break via webcam, Kim returned to Albert Square on 30 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a553048/eastenders-star-tameka-empson-expecting-baby.html EastEnders star Tameka Empson expecting baby&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03wnvpl BBC One – EastEnders, 24/02/2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bnc88 BBC One – EastEnders, 22/07/2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0419k8n BBC One – EastEnders, 17/04/2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04fc277 BBC One – EastEnders, 18/08/2014&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim is described as "viscous and bubbly" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem. The ''EastEnders'' website describes Kim as having [[big hair]], a loud personality, hyperactive and a big heart. She is sharp, family-orientated and cares about her appearance, having a loud dress sense and being the life and soul of any party. She chooses the wrong men to have relationships with, but knows what she wants when it comes to love. Kim makes her first appearance for Denise's wedding to [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). She briefly returns after Denise is presumed dead, but makes a more permanent return when she separates from her boyfriend [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]). Kim kisses [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]), sparking a brief feud with his wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). She establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]] and later opens a [[bed and breakfast]]. Kim also goes through a [[HIV]] scare and has a relationship with [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]). Kim gave birth to a baby girl, [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Pearl Fox|Pearl]], prematurely during [[EastEnders Live Week|''EastEnders'' Live Week]], which celebrated ''EastEnders''' 30th anniversary. In a later storyline, Kim suffered a [[miscarriage]].

Kim is often shown in a comedic light and as a result, Empson earned a nomination for "Best Comedy Performance" at the 2011 [[British Soap Awards]]. That same year she won the "Funniest Performance" award at the ''[[Inside Soap Awards]]'' and again the following year. Ruth Deller from entertainment website [[Lowculture]] praised the character during her guest appearance in 2009 and later said Kim is a "big, ballsy, whirlwind", who provides some light relief to the show. Daniel Maier from ''[[The Guardian]]'' has criticised Kim's B&amp;B venture, calling it a "holding pen for characters who are 'between homes' within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere."

==Storylines==
Kim visits [[Walford]] to attend the wedding of her sister, Denise. She is disappointed by her plans for a low-key [[hen night]], so organises a livelier event. During her visit, Kim's partner, [[Dexter Mulholland]] ([[Robbie Gee]]), makes a pass at her niece, Chelsea, but she chooses to forgive him. She makes a repeat visit seven months later and reveals that she has broken up with Dexter, as he was unfaithful to her. The following month, Kim is told that Denise has committed suicide. She returns to Walford for the funeral, as does her sister, [[Daphne Fox|Daphne]] (Emi Wokoma). It later transpires that Denise is still alive, as her death was staged by her husband, [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]). Kim comes to stay with her, having once more separated from Dexter. She begins working at the local beauty salon and establishes a short-lived [[speakeasy]]. Kim causes trouble by kissing her married neighbour, [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). His wife, [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), finds out and is initially furious, but she and Kim forge a bond and become friends. Despite earlier conflict over her speakeasy, Kim also becomes friends with [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), landlady of the local pub. When Dexter buys Kim out of their restaurant business, she purchases the house next door to Denise's and opens a [[bed and breakfast]], called "Kimberley's Palace". It becomes her sole source of income when she is fired from the beauty salon for her lax attitude to work. Walford's new GP, [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]), makes a long term booking at the B&amp;B. Kim is initially attracted to him, but refrains from pursuing him as Denise is also interested in him. She accidentally tells [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) that Denise and Yusef haven't had sex yet which Masood uses to his advantage by telling Denise. Denise is at first annoyed with Kim for telling people about her private life, but they later reconcile. The next day, Kim helps out at [[Tommy Moon]]'s christening.

Kim wakes up in a skip and after initially lets Patrick and Denise believe she may have been attacked. However, Patrick find CCTV footage of a drunken Kim entering the local shop, the Minute Mart, late at night and taking alcohol. Kim explains to Denise that her erratic behaviour is due to a former boyfriend telling her that he has contracted HIV. Denise persuades Kim to take a HIV test which comes back negative, leaving Kim relieved. After Yusef sets the B&amp;B on fire, Kim, Patrick and Denise are left homeless, so they move in with [[Anthony Moon|Anthony]] ([[Matt Lapinskas]]) and [[Tyler Moon]] ([[Tony Discipline]]) and borrow clothes from friends. Kim starts spending money, thinking that insurance will cover the damage, but Patrick tells her that he was holding illegal alcohol and fireworks in the B&amp;B, which made the fire worse, and the insurance may not pay out. Kim is angry and says she no longer wants to live with Patrick, but Denise later convinces Kim that her material possessions are not what matters and they should be a family.  After the insurance company refuse to pay for the damage, Patrick decides to retire and offers Kim and Denise the Minute Mart. Kim arranges a blind date, and on her way to it, is saved by [[Ray Dixon]] ([[Chucky Venn]]) from a falling ladder. She is attracted to him, and later when he sees she has been stood up, he offers to get her another drink. However, she is disappointed to learn that he has two children, saying she is fed up of men with "baggage". She then tries to chat up [[Gethin Williams]] ([[Bradley Freegard]]), but he harshly rejects her.

She turns her attention back to Ray after seeing him running and tells him she has started an fitness venture called "Kimba". She enlists some people to come to the class but Ray does not come. Ray asks Kim out but she says she has a date, and then meets [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Sinclair|Sinclair]] (Colin Michael Carmichael) from the Internet. Sinclair makes inappropriate comments about Kim's race. Ray calls Kim easy so she slaps him, and she then slaps Sinclair for his comments. When [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) inherits all of Yusef's money, she gives it to Kim and Denise but is unhappy when they start spending it frivolously. Kim and Ray eventually reconcile and they share a kiss, although Kim continues to play hard to get, pretending she does not like him. Kim dislikes it when she sees Ray and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) playfight in the kitchen. She also becomes jealous when she overhears him flirting with Bianca whilst helping in the kitchen. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship. Ray is upset when his son, [[Morgan Jackson-King|Morgan]] (Devon Higgs) moves away. To cheer him up, Kim organises an intimate evening for them, however Ray arrives with his daughter, [[Sasha Dixon|Sasha]] (Rebecca Sanneh). Kim is shocked and tells Ray that, although she is interested in him, she does not think she can take on his children. Denise convinces Kim that she needs to accept Sasha and arranges for Kim to look after her. It goes well and she promises to do it again.

Meanwhile, a man from the local council tells Kim that the new name for the B&amp;B, Kim's Olympic Palace, infringes copyright. The next day, Kim is disappointed as the B&amp;B's sign is taken down. Kim and Sasha start to bond and Kim and Ray declare their love for one another. When the B&amp;B opens, Denise is annoyed by Kim's apaethetic approach to running the place and quits. Kim struggles to run the B&amp;B by herself and they later reconcile. When playing basketball with Sasha and Morgan, Kim smashes a window in the charity shop. Sasha takes the blame and works there, but she is unhappy, so Kim says she will organise some work experience for Sasha with a forensic scientist. Kim later admits this was a lie, leading to Ray moving out. Kim then gets Sasha a placement with [[Les Coker]]'s ([[Roger Sloman]]) firm of funeral directors, and Ray and Kim make up. Kim discovers that Ray has been looking for flats locally and she assumes that Ray is looking for somewhere for them both to live. However, she is left upset and humiliated when Ray reveals that the flat is actually for Sasha's mother, Deanne, so that they can both be closer to Sasha. Ray affirms his love for her and they reconcile. A few months later, Ray kisses Denise, and when Kim finds out, Ray says Denise initiated it. Kim slaps Denise and disowns her, however they soon reconcile. Ray ends his relationship with Kim, who is devastated and blames Denise, saying she does not want to see her again. Kim and Denise reconcile again when Ray admits he kissed Denise. A few months later Kim and Ray resume their relationship. Ray learns that Deanne has been in an accident and so decides to move to Essex to be closer to Sasha. Kim agrees to move with him, but at her birthday party she realises they do not have much in common and decides to stay, saying a tearful goodbye to him. Kim departs to work on a cruise ship, and during her time away, she marries [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]).

Kim returns to Walford after splitting from Vincent and reveals to Denise that she is pregnant. Kim struggles with caring for Patrick, who has suffered a [[stroke]]. Kim goes into labour early and gives birth to a girl, [[Pearl Fox|Pearl]]. She briefly falls out with Denise when she insults Kim's failed marriage, and leaves a voicemail and a text message for Vincent, informing him that he is a father. She regrets this afterwards and confides in Kat, [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), [[Shirley Carter]] (Linda Henry) and Patrick that after the cruise, she visited Vincent to tell him she was pregnant but discovered he was a criminal when she saw him covered in blood and fled. Pearl develops an infection and is ill in hospital for several months, and when she brings her daughter home, Kim finds Vincent waiting for her. He explains that he was helping the victim of a mugging when she saw him, and although she is still suspicious, she reunites with him. She provides him with a false alibi for the assault on a drug dealer and key witness at [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) trial, and later discovers from his foster sister [[Donna Yates]] ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) that he did this for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), a former girlfriend of his. She confronts Ronnie thinking she is having an affair with Vincent, but they explain they are no longer together, although Kim tells Ronnie to stay away from Vincent. Vincent cons [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) into giving him his wife, [[Sharon Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sharon Mitchell]]'s ([[Letitia Dean]]) bar, the Albert. Sharon reinvests in the bar and Kim competes with Sharon to manage it. Vincent surprises Kim with news that he has bought them a house, but Denise tells Kim that he is just sweetening her up and Patrick throws him out of the house. Vincent tries to win Kim back by saying the new house is for Pearl. Kim decides to move on from Vincent but soon changes her mind and they kiss. Kim and Vincent's mother [[Claudette Hubbard]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) then realise that Vincent has invited them both to live with him without telling them. When Claudette accuses Kim of freeloading, Kim decides to sell her share of her house, where Denise and Patrick live, which leaves them with a smaller home.

Kim is shocked to discover Vincent has taken delivery of a large amount of drugs, but he tells her that it is so he can set up Phil by planting them in his house as revenge for his father, Eric, killing Vincent's father, Henry. Vincent tells Kim how this happened, and Claudette confirms it, but convinces Kim not to tell anyone. When Phil deliberately scares Kim, Kim and Sharon attempt to end the feud and with Ronnie's help, Phil and Vincent agree. However, Phil later kidnaps Pearl from the house, and Vincent refuses to call the police, instead revealing he has a gun and will end it his own way. However, it soon emerges that Claudette killed Henry, not Eric, and Kim is reunited with Pearl.

Kim and Claudette clash at Pearl's first birthday party, and when Claudette's foster son [[Linford Short]] ([[Leon Lopez]]) announces that she is a finalist in the Pride of Walford Awards, Kim tries to take the attention away by jumping on Pearl's bouncy castle, which Claudette then punctures; Denise tells Kim that Claudette did this deliberately. Kim is horrified when Donna decides she wants Vincent to be a sperm donor so she can have a baby, but Vincent convinces her it is the right thing to do, however, it does not work and Donna changes her mind. When Kim finds out that Denise is pregnant but wants the baby adopted, Kim decides she and Vincent should adopt the child, but Denise is against this. Vincent discovers that Kim has received a parking fine in his car for parking in a bus lane; she discovers that Donna has a disabled parking permit so Kim uses Claudette as a way into Donna's flat and steals the permit to go shopping. Vincent discovers this and tells Donna, who tells her it is wrong; Patrick reveals Kim has never passed her driving test so Vincent bans her from driving his car. Vincent then gives Kim driving lessons, but she is angry that people are taking bets on whether she will pass or fail her test. She also worries when Denise does not want to tell her daughters that she is pregnant; Kim tells Libby, prompting her return to Walford. She passes her driving test but breaks her arm, so she is annoyed that she is unable to drive. Kim and Vincent travel to [[Montserrat]] and Denise is upset to learn that Kim has told their mother, [[Emerald Fox]] ([[Doña Croll]]), that Denise is pregnant. Denise gives birth to a boy, but Kim becomes angry when she discovers that Denise still plans to have her son adopted and tries to reason with her. Denise refuses to change her mind, so Kim brands her a "cold-hearted bitch". Vincent comforts Kim but advises her to accept and respect Denise's decision otherwise she would lose her sister, however, Kim stands by her own decision and decides to cut all ties with Denise. When Denise survives a bus crash, Denise rejects Kim's support. Kim throws Emerald a farewell dinner and invites Denise but Emerald and Patrick suspect that she has planned it for the same time as Denise's class to make her look bad. Kim embarrasses Denise by interrupting her class and revealing that Denise abandoned her son. An angry but defiant Denise eventually goes to the dinner but confronts Kim, telling her that she realises that Kim still sees Denise as a mother and fears being abandoned by her. At Emerald's leaving party, Kim and Denise stand up for each other against Emerald when she criticises Kim's parenting, and when Kim says she is thankful for her sister, Emerald says they are not really sisters, explaining that Denise was brought to her as a baby. This causes Kim and Denise to reunite. After learning that Denise's friends know the identity of her son's biological father, Kim decides to find out the truth herself, concluding that Denise's former fiancé [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) is the father. Kim confronts Ian but his wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) informs her that he has had a vasectomy so cannot father any more children. Denise eventually tells Kim that [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) is the father, which shocks Kim; Denise begs her not to tell anyone. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, Kim assists [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]), who performs CPR. Kim is interviewed by a local radio station and plans to use the opportunity to advertise The Albert, but changes her mind after seeing Ian, who has lost his son and business in a fire.

Kim thinks she has food poisoning but later finds out she is being sick because she is pregnant. She tells Vincent but he refuses to show interest of the idea of having another child, which hurts and confuses Kim, but they later are both excited by this. However, Kim suffers a [[miscarriage]], which devastates her. She continues to pretend she is pregnant and tries to get pregnant but this fails and she eventually tells Denise and Carmel the truth. Kim suspects Vincent is cheating on her but he is selling the Albert, which he has been forced to do by [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]). Aidan buys it from Vincent for £1, and Kim discovers that she and Vincent risk losing their home due to Vincent's loss of income. Vincent decides to return to his police informant days, offering information on the heist in return for cash. However, Phil discovers Vincent is talking to the police and has a corrupt officer threaten Vincent. Vincent disappears and Kim is forced to move in with Denise and get a job at the local shop.

==Creation and development==

===Introduction===
Kim was referenced multiple times following Denise's arrival in ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a177716/robbie-gee-to-guest-in-eastenders.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Robbie Gee to guest in 'EastEnders'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initially appeared as a guest character, along with her boyfriend Dexter, between 24 and 27 November 2009.&lt;ref name="24NO"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187179/owen-crashes-denises-hen-night.html|title=Owen crashes Denise's hen night|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="27NO"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a187182/peggys-furious-by-phils-actions.html|title=Peggy's furious by Phil's actions|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] was asked by entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' if there were plans for Kim and Dexter to return. He said, "There's nothing currently storylined for Kim and Dexter, but they really caught my eye. I know they've caught [future executive producer] [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan [Kirkwood]]]'s eye, too, because we were only talking about them recently. They work brilliantly with the rest of the family. I hope that if the actors are up for it and if me or Bryan find the right moment, we'll see them again."&lt;ref name="dssanter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a189597/eastenders-exec-teases-2010-storylines.html|title='EastEnders' exec teases 2010 storylines|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|location=[[London]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim was subsequently brought back as a regular character by Kirkwood in 2010, on which he said, "I'm a huge fan of Tameka. She is a real talent and will bring a fresh, funny and exciting new flavour to the show."&lt;ref name="kimreturns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a219222/tameka-empson-returns-to-eastenders.html|title=Tameka Empson returns to 'EastEnders'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=11 May 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=10 May 2010|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empson said "I'm really thrilled and excited to be returning to ''EastEnders''. I've always loved the show and working with such fantastic actors makes the whole experience even sweeter. Kim Fox is such a great character to play and gives me scope to do things I usually wouldn't get away with."&lt;ref name="kimreturns" /&gt; Kim's return was aired on 27 July 2010.&lt;ref name="22JU"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a237492/patrick-goes-into-meltdown.html|title=Patrick goes into meltdown|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empson also believes that she is different from Kim, commenting : "I don't know if I am, you know! In a way yes, and no. She's bolder than myself. She can go on all night – I need a break in between dancing and stuff! I like good shoes, comfortable shoes. But it all works [for Kim], from the toes right the way up." Empson managed to win the 'Funniest Female' award at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/2012-winners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AwUOzUf2?url=http://www.insidesoap.co.uk/2012-winners |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characterisation and style===
With the announcement of Kim's permanent return to Albert Square, the character was described as "viscous and bubbly" on the outside, but hiding vulnerability and low self-esteem by Kris Green of Digital Spy.&lt;ref name="kimreturns" /&gt; The ''EastEnders'' website describes Kim as having "big hair", a "loud personality" and a big heart to match."&lt;ref name="EastEnders Profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m86d/profiles/kim-fox|title=Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) |date=March 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to read: "With dress sense louder than Bianca Jackson's brood and an unsuitable boyfriend in toe, you will definitely know when Kim Fox enters the building! With her big hair and loud personality she is always the life and soul of the party. Kim's appearance is important to her, but she's not concerned about labels – for her it is 'upkeep on the cheap'. She might look like a long in the tooth ghetto princess, but scratch beneath the surface and you will find a sharp, family-orientated person with a big heart."&lt;ref name="EastEnders Profile" /&gt; Kim has also been described as "feisty".&lt;ref name="Empson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/100511-tameka-empson.shtml|title=Feisty Fox|date=11 May 2010|work=EastEnders|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=7 April 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|When it comes to love, Kim knows what she wants – a hunk with a good heart.

While speaking to the [[Press Association]], Empson said she felt good about bringing humour to ''EastEnders'' through her character. The actress explained "I think people want to smile, people want to have a laugh and I love Kim. You get so much theatre with Kim. I'm not actually like her but I love it. I like to party like Kim, but Kim can out-drink me any time."&lt;ref name="PA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5i6mWXksZRkCR_kGUHyXW8Q83B8OQ?docId=N0611441317114513770A |title=EastEnders pair want happy ending |publisher=[[Press Association]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/622R4YGCN?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5i6mWXksZRkCR_kGUHyXW8Q83B8OQ?docId=N0611441317114513770A |archivedate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empson said of the character and her style: "I like to have a good time but Kim's like ten times more full-on than me. Her outfits—I could only dream about wearing her outfits. The tighter the better for Kim! I like a bit of comfort and to be able to breathe. [...] Kim knows no bounds—she feels no shame. Kim's very feminine and she's all about 'the look' and pampering herself."&lt;ref name="Empson interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a239209/tameka-empson-kim-fox-eastenders.html|title=Tameka Empson (Kim Fox, 'EastEnders')|last=Green|first=Kris|date=13 July 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=15 July 2010|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaci Stephen from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' has described Kim's style as "bling-on-a-budget" and said that if her outfits do not turn heads, then her loud voice will always get attention as her voice is "louder than her taste in clothes".&lt;ref name="Jaci Stephen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1320924/JACI-STEPHENS-Soap-Watch-Another-day-Mitchell--Oh-dear.html|title=Soap Watch: Another day, another Mitchell...

===Storyline development===
Speaking in July 2010 about the storyline where Denise is discovered to be alive, Empson told ''Digital Spy'' that finding out was "crazy" for Kim, but said that "It's the start of a new direction for Kim and Denise, though."&lt;ref name="denise twist" /&gt; Speaking about Kim's relationship with Denise, Empson said that they are "chalk and cheese—and the macaroni's yet to be made. You'll start to see—even more than you can now—that Denise and Kim are very different. You'll start to wonder how they can be sisters! They're Foxes by blood, though. They'll watch each other's backs but at the same time, they'll tear each other down. They won't let anyone else tear the other down, though—that's their job!"&lt;ref name="denise twist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a239213/enders-tameka-empson-on-that-denise-twist.html|title=Enders Tameka Empson on that Denise twist|last=Green|first=Kris|date=13 July 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=24 February 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Empson teased that Kim would stir things up with her kiss with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]): "Well put it this way, all the men are in my eyesight. [...] I don't think anybody is safe from Kim."&lt;ref name="stirring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a279170/enders-tameka-empson-teases-kim-stirring.html|title='Enders Tameka Empson teases Kim 'stirring'|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=28 September 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=20 February 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empson revealed in December 2011 that both Kim and Denise will stand up to Phil Mitchell after they receive incriminating evidence about him on Christmas Day.&lt;ref name="Christmas Shock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=8 December 2011|title='EastEnders' star teases Kim, Denise Christmas shock|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a355032/eastenders-star-teases-kim-denise-christmas-shock.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both shocked when they find a USB stick which contains a recording of Phil confessing the role he had in Kevin's death.&lt;ref name="Christmas Shock" /&gt; Speaking to ''[[Inside Soap]]'', Empson commented: "When all the information about Kevin Wicks and Phil blows up, it comes out of nowhere for the Fox girls. Kevin's death was way before Kim's time, so she's bewildered by the whole thing. They wonder why someone would tell them about such a thing on Christmas Day. Kim knows no fear. It might be Phil, but she's not afraid to take him on. The Mitchells think that they're the big guns in the Square – but as far as Kim's concerned, the Fox family are the same. They might not have the same numbers as the Mitchells, but they won't shy away from a fight."&lt;ref name="Christmas Shock" /&gt; Empson added that she gets on much better with McFadden when not filming. She commented: "He's such a great actor because he's not like his character Phil at all. He's so lovely."&lt;ref name="Christmas Shock" /&gt;

==''The B&amp;B''==
'''''The B&amp;B''''' (also called '''''The B&amp;B – Kim's Palace''''') is a mock–documentary focussing on Kim and her life running her bed and breakfast. There have been four episodes, plus one video featuring outtakes. Empson wrote the entire series, which was produced by Matt Taylor. Kim's sister Denise features in two of the episodes, and Lorna Sinclair plays a B&amp;B guest in the third episode. The official synopsis says: "A camera crew is given access to all areas of 'Kim's Palace'. The team focus on her adventures (and mishaps) as she strives to raise her small business from the ashes of disaster, catapulting her into the realm of the [[Alan Sugar]]s and [[Richard Branson]]s of this world. With Kim at the helm, surely nothing can go wrong. Can it?! Watch this space..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a407445/eastenders-kim-fox-gets-online-bb-spinoff.html|title='EastEnders' Kim Fox gets online 'B&amp;B' spinoff|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=21 September 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empson revealed in an interview with [[Digital Spy]] that she came up with the idea for the spin-off when she was on set thinking that the B&amp;B should be used more, and more people should be seen staying there, but as most regular characters have their own homes, Empson though of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the B&amp;B. [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] was ''EastEnders''{{'}} executive producer at the time, and Empson had heard the B&amp;B would be burnt down, but she was reassured that it would be refurbished. [[Lorraine Newman]] took over from Kirkwood and agreed to Empson's idea. Empson worked with the ''EastEnders'' web team to create the series, and they wanted it to be shorter than she did, so her scripts were edited but all her jokes were kept. Empson said of the series: "It's still ''EastEnders'', but at the same time it's going to be its own show. It's a standalone thing and Kim is showing how to run a successful business. She thinks that she's a bit like [[Hilary Devey]], but she would give Hilary Devey a run for her money! It's a bit of ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]'', a bit of ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and ''[[The Hotel Inspector]]'' all rolled into one."&lt;ref name="B&amp;B Digital Spy interview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a430125/eastenders-tameka-empson-talks-kim-foxs-online-spinoff-interview.html|title='EastEnders' Tameka Empson talks Kim Fox's online spinoff – interview|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 October 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Daniel Maier from ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticised Kim's B&amp;B, saying, "There's been a [...] futile relaunch afoot in ''EastEnders'', in which the B&amp;B has reopened as Kimberley's Palace. Who stays there? Really, though? Tourists? Escaped convicts? Delegates for Whelk 2011, Europe's leading mollusc expo at Walford International Conference Centre? By the look of it, the place is actually a holding pen for characters who are "between homes" within Albert Square's hermetically sealed biosphere.&lt;ref name="Maier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/mar/26/soap-opera-television?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Daniel Maier's World of lather|last=Maier|first=Daniel|date=26 March 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=4 March 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Deller from [[Lowculture]] praised Kim on her guest appearance in 2009 saying, "Denise Johnson's sister, Kim, has only been in the show five minutes and has already stolen the limelight big style. Tameka [Empson] is a joy in everything she appears in and she was the only thing that made those terrible wedding episodes worth watching. A new [[Aunt Sal]] type recurring character, perhaps? She's a much more interesting prospect than yet another new Mitchell/Branning/Slater/etc, though I'd fear for her if she was made a permanent fixture and had to complete the obligatory [[Phil Mitchell]] shagging initiation ritual. Some people are just too good for all that nonsense".&lt;ref name="rd2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/11/30/soapstar-superstars-november/ |title=Soapstar Superstars: November |last=Deller |first=Ruth |date=30 November 2009 |publisher=[[Lowculture]] |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820081951/http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/11/30/soapstar-superstars-november/ |archivedate=20 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deller later praised Kim when she had returned saying, "It's widely acknowledged that ''EastEnders'' can't do comedy very well, but that's only because it tries to do comedy the way ''[[Coronation Street]]'' or ''[[Neighbours]]'' do, which just won't wash in Britain's most miserable postcode.  What it can do is provide characters who offer some light relief to the show, whilst still functioning (just about) as believable human beings. Kim Fox is one such character—a big, ballsy, whirlwind, she brings a sense of fabulousness to all her scenes and works well as the kind of character that can sympathise with those going through the usual Walford misery whilst encouraging them to embrace their inner fag/hag. Cherish her before she succumbs to the inevitable marriage to Phil/Ian/Max/Whoever."&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2010/12/30/soapstar-superstars-july-december-2010/ |title=Soapstar Superstars: July – December 2010 |last=Deller |first=Ruth |date=30 December 2010 |publisher=[[Lowculture]] |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vQ5HSnEu?url=http://www.lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2010/12/30/soapstar-superstars-july-december-2010/ |archivedate= 1 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She laughs. She cracks jokes. She is warm, funny, vivacious and we must enjoy her while we can.

==Latin American queer cinema==
Queer individuals' contradiction of the heterosexual norm significantly impacts the machismo ideals within the Latin American culture, where men are expected to be strong and dominant. This strongly male-dominated culture is cinematographically afraid of a male that contradicts the traditional ideal, leading to a lack of exposure for the transgender male within Latin American queer cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Subero, Gustavo. "Fear of the Trannies: On Filmic Phobia of Transvestism in the New Latin
American Cinema." Latin American Research Review 43.2 (2008): 159-79. JSTOR. Web.
31 May 2013. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/20488133&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; While many have attempted to bring the Latino transgender man into queer cinema, such as in [[Arturo Ripstein]]’s ''[[The Place Without Limits|El Lugar sin limites]]'' (1978), the man is seldom portrayed in a positive light.
In queer Latin American cinema, the body is often seen as a tool above all else. The body is a tool that is used in order to attain satisfaction above all other things.&lt;ref name="SchulzCruz"&gt;Schulz, Cruz Bernard. Imágenes Gay En El Cine Mexicano: Tres Décadas De Joterío,
1970-1999. Coyoacán, Mexico: Fontamara, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a normative ideal in Latin American cinema that it is acceptable for women to sleep in the same bed together, situation such as those do not automatically place a movie within the realm of queer cinema. It is not a social norm, however, for two men to share a bed. Two men sharing a bed within Latin American cinema, even if those men are young, is often used as an indication of queer acts that are not explicitly shown.&lt;ref name="SchulzCruz" /&gt;

Che thought that he brought up his son right by encouraging him to be a better person than Che. However, dynamics change when he finds out that his son is gay. He does not accept it and ends up kicking Jes out of the house. For Che, being gay is losing your [[machismo]] within the community and you are viewed as weak. But if he wants to be a part of his son’s life, he has to engage into an emotional side of himself that he is not familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;La Mission. Dir. Peter Bratt. By Peter Bratt. Perf.

'''''Louise Dahl-Wolfe: Painting with Light''''' is a 1999 [[documentary film]] about [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]], an important woman in the history of photography.  It was written and directed by [[Tom Neff]], and produced by Neff and Madeline Bell, who previously collaborated on the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominated short-documentary ''[[Red Grooms: Sunflower in a Hothouse]]'' (1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0219888|title=Louise Dahl-Wolfe: Painting with Light}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
This short documentary film on the life of [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]] draws upon her art and her personality. The documentary reviews how Dahl-Wolfe "discovered" [[Lauren Bacall]], who at the time was a young actress (seventeen years-of-age) and worked as a model.  It was Dahl-Wolfe's photos of Bacall that film producer [[Harry Warner]] saw, and subsequently asked Bacall that she come to Hollywood for a screen test. As a result, Bacall was cast opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the film ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).

Dahl-Wolfe also photographed: [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Eudora Welty]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Bette Davis]], and others.

==Background==
The documentary took over ten years to complete and features the only surviving modern footage of Dahl-Wolfe, including extensive interviews.

==Interviews==
* [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]

'''Marine art''' or '''maritime art''' is any form of [[figurative art]] (that is, painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture) that portrays or draws its main [[Sea in culture|inspiration from the sea]].  Maritime painting is a genre that depicts ships and the sea—a genre particularly strong from the 17th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary American Marine Art'' by American Society of Marine Artists, Richard V. West, American Society of Marine Artists, Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens, Charles and Emma Frye Art Museum, Published by University of Washington Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-295-97656-X}}, 9780295976563 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIAJAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=marine+art] (accessed Jan. 15, 2009 on Google Book Search)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the term often covers art showing shipping on rivers and estuaries, beach scenes and all art showing boats, without any rigid distinction - for practical reasons subjects that can be drawn or painted from dry land in fact feature strongly in the [[genre]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;"Grove": Cordingley, D., ''Marine art'' in [[Grove Art Online]]. Accessed April 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking "maritime art" should always include some element of human seafaring, whereas "marine art" would also include pure seascapes with no human element, though this distinction may not be observed in practice.

Ships and boats have been included in art from almost the earliest times, but marine art only began to become a distinct genre, with specialized artists, towards the end of the [[Middle Ages]], mostly in the form of the "ship portrait" a type of work that is still popular and concentrates on depicting a single vessel.  As [[landscape art]] emerged during the Renaissance, what might be called the marine landscape became a more important element in works, but pure seascapes were rare until later.  Marine painting was a major genre within [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], reflecting the importance of overseas trade and naval power to the [[Dutch Republic]], and saw the first career marine artists, who painted little else.  In this, as in much else, specialist and traditional marine painting has largely continued Dutch conventions to the present day.  With [[Romantic art]], the sea and the coast was reclaimed from the specialists by many landscape painters, and works including no vessels became common for the first time.

==Earliest times to 1400==
[[File:8-pointed star on the boat in Qobustan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The [[reed boat]] petroglyph at [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape|Gobustan]].]]

Vessels on the water have featured in art from the earliest times.  The earliest known works are [[petroglyph]]s from 12,000 BCE showing [[reed boat]]s in the [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape|Gobustan Petroglyph Reserve]] in modern [[Azerbaijan]], which was then on the edge of the much larger [[Caspian Sea]].  Rock carvings and carved objects depicting ships have been found on several islands of the Aegean (Andros, Naxos, Syros, Astypalaia, Santorini) as well as mainland Greece (Avlis), dating from 4,000 BCE onwards.

Both men and gods are shown on river "barges" in [[Ancient Egyptian art]]; these boats were made of [[papyrus]] reed for most uses, but the vessels used by the [[pharaoh]]s were of costly imported [[Cedar wood|cedar]] wood, like the 43.6&amp;nbsp;m (143&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 5.9&amp;nbsp;m (19.5&amp;nbsp;ft) wide [[Khufu ship]] of c. 2,500.  [[Nilotic landscape]]s in [[fresco]] in Egyptian tombs often show scenes of hunting birds from boats in the [[Nile delta]], and [[grave goods]] include detailed models of boats and their crews for use in the [[afterlife]].  The central cult image in [[Egyptian temple]]s was usually a small figure of the god, carried in a barge or "barque".

Ships sometimes appear in [[Ancient Greek vase painting]], especially when relevant in a narrative context, and also on coins and other contexts, though with little attempt at a seascape setting.  As in Egyptian painting, the surface of the water may be indicated by a series of parallel wavy lines.  [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman painting]], presumably drawing on Greek traditions, very often shows landscape views from the land across a lake or bay with distant land on the horizon, as in the famous "Ulysses" paintings in the [[Vatican Museums]].  The water is usually calm, and objects that are submerged, or partly so, may be shown through the water.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The large [[Nile mosaic of Palestrina]] (1st century BCE) is a version of such compositions, with a view intended to show all the course of the river.

From [[Late Antiquity]] to the end of the [[Middle Ages]] marine subjects were shown when required for narrative purposes, but did not form a genre in the West, or in Asian [[ink painting]] traditions, where a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of scholar landscapes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Marine highlights in [[Medieval art]] include the 11th century [[Bayeux Tapestry]] showing the [[Norman Invasion of England]].  From the 12th century onwards, seals of ports often featured a "ship portrait".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship functioned as an image of the church, as in [[Giotto]]'s lost ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' above the entrance to [[Old St Peter's]] in Rome, but such representations are of relatively little interest from the purely marine point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Accademia - Arrivo a Colonia Cat.579 - Vittore Carpaccio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vittore Carpaccio]], ''Arrival of the Pilgrims in Cologne'', 1490.]]

A distinct tradition begins to re-emerge in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], with two lost miniatures in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], probably by [[Jan van Eyck]] in about 1420, showing a huge leap in the depiction of the sea and its weather.  Of the seashore scene called ''The Prayer on the Shore'' (or ''Duke William of Bavaria at the Seashore'',  the ''Sovereign's prayer'' etc.) [[Kenneth Clark]] says: "The figures in the foreground are in the chivalric style of the de Limbourgs; but the sea shore beyond them is completely outside the fifteenth-century range of responsiveness, and we see nothing like it again until [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]'s beach-scenes of the mid-17th century."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a true seascape, the  ''Voyage of St Julian &amp; St Martha'',&lt;ref&gt;Kren, 84, note 1.  Châtelet, 34–35 and 194–196 – both are illustrated there.&lt;/ref&gt; but both pages were destroyed in a fire in 1904, and only survive in black and white photographs.  For the rest of the 15th century [[illuminated manuscript]] painting was the main medium of marine painting, and in France and Burgundy in particular many artists became skilled in increasingly realistic depictions of both seas and ships, used in illustrations of wars, romances and court life, as well as religious scenes.  Scenes of small pleasure boats on rivers sometimes feature in the calendar miniatures from [[books of hours]] by artists such as [[Simon Bening]].

During the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] the [[nef (metalwork)|nef]], a large piece of [[goldsmith]]'s work in the shape of a ship, used for holding cutlery, salt or spices, became popular among the grand.  Initially just consisting of the "[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]", from the 15th century the most elaborate had masts, sails and even crew.  As the exotic [[nautilus shell]] began to reach Europe, many used these for their hull, like the [[Burghley Nef]] of about 1528.  Lower down the social scale, interest in shipping was reflected in many early [[old master print|prints]] of ships.  The earliest are by [[Master W with the Key]], who produced several [[engraving]]s of ships; for some time such "ship portraits" were confined to prints and drawings, and typically showed the ship with no crew, even if under sail.  They also usually anticipated the low horizon that painting would not achieve until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The first print of a naval battle is an enormous (548 x 800&amp;nbsp;mm) [[woodcut]] of the [[Battle of Zonchio]] in 1499 between the [[Venice|Venetians]] and the Turks.  The only surviving impression is coloured with [[stencil]]s; most were probably pasted onto walls.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, 104-105,[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/t/the_battle_of_zonchio_navarin.aspx British Museum highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018221608/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pd/t/the_battle_of_zonchio_navarin.aspx |date=2015-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest comparable painting to survive comes from several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;The Greenwich Portuguese carracks - see next section.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time artists were often involved in the expansion of Western [[cartography]], and more aware than might always seem evident of the scientific and nautical advances of the age. According to Margarita Russell, one of [[Erhard Reuwich]]'s [[woodcut]]s from the first printed travel book (1486) shows him trying to demonstrate his understanding of the curvature of the earth with a ship half-seen on the horizon.  The many coastal views in the book's woodcuts are important in the development of such representations.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 24-32&lt;/ref&gt;  Birds-eye plans of cities, often coastal, which we would today usually consider as cartography, were often done by artists, and considered as much as works of art as maps by contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Russell; this is the main theme of here chapter 2, especially pp. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Renaissance art]] showed maritime scenes when required, but apart from the [[Venice|Venetian]] artist [[Vittore Carpaccio]] there were few artists in this or the next century who often returned to such scenes, or did so with special sensitivity.  Carpaccio's scenes show Venetian canals or docksides; there are several arrivals and departures in his ''[[Legend of Saint Ursula]]''.  In the German-speaking lands, [[Konrad Witz]]'s ''Miraculous Draught of Fishes'' (1444) is both the first [[landscape painting]] to show a recognisable rural location, and an atmospheric view across [[Lake Geneva]].

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 031.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Peter Brueghel]], ''Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples, (The Harbour of Naples)'', c. 1558]]
The Netherlandish tradition of the "[[world landscape]]", a panoramic view from a very high viewpoint, pioneered by [[Joachim Patinir]] in the 1520s, once again begins to include a wide expanse of water in a rather similar way to the classical paintings, which these artists cannot have been aware of.  These paintings were essentially landscapes in the guise of [[history painting]]s, with small figures usually representing a religious subject.  A strong marine element was therefore present as landscape painting began to emerge as a distinct genre.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] greatly restricted the uses of religious art, accelerating to the development of other secular types of art in Protestant countries, including landscape art and secular forms of [[history painting]], which could both form part of marine art.

An important work by a Flemish "follower of Patenir" is the ''Portuguese Carracks off a Rocky Coast'' of about 1540 (787 x 1447&amp;nbsp;mm), in the [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]], London, "which has justly been labelled the earliest known pure marine painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 40-41, and Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  This probably represents the meeting of two small fleets involved in escorting a Portuguese princess going to be married; a type of ceremonial maritime subject which remained very common in court art until the late 17th century, although more often set at the point of embarkation or arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0705 National Maritime Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617185001/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0705 |date=2010-06-17 }}; see also Grove.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the painting in the [[Royal Collection]] showing [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] embarking for the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], which is typical in clearly showing the ships side-on, with no attempt to adjust for the high view point.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Embarkation-Dover.jpg|Commons image]], Russell, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  A superb coloured drawing by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] of a ship crowded with drunken [[lansquenet]]s was perhaps done in preparation for a mural in London.

[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] is famous for his development of [[genre painting]] scenes of [[peasant]] life, but also painted a number of marine subjects, including [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]] (c. 1568); the original is now recognised as lost, and the painting in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]] is now seen as a good early copy of Bruegel's original.  He also painted a large ''[[:Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 031.jpg|Naval Battle in the Gulf of Naples]]'', of 1560, [[Galleria Doria-Pamphilj]], [[Rome]], and a small but dramatic late shipwreck scene.  A larger storm scene in [[Vienna]], once regarded as his, is now attributed to [[Joos de Momper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 038b.jpg|Commons images]]; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Such subjects were taken up by his successors, including his sons.

The highly picturesque and historically useful [[Anthony Roll]] was a luxury [[illuminated manuscript]] inventory of the ships of the [[Royal Navy]] prepared for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in the 1540s.  However it is neither very visually accurate nor artistically accomplished, having perhaps been illustrated by the official concerned.&lt;ref&gt;The conventional view, although Russell seems unpersuaded of this, see p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  As in France, 16th-century English paintings of elaborate royal embarkations and similar occasions are formulaic, if often impressive.  Most used Netherlandish artists, as did representations in prints of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.  [[The Virgin of the Navigators]] is a Spanish work of the 1530s with a  group of ships at anchor, presumably in the [[New World]], protected by the Virgin.

[[Mannerism]] in both Italy and [[Northern Mannerism|the North]] began to paint fantastic tempests with gigantic waves and lightning-filled skies, which had not been attempted before but were to return into fashion at intervals over the following centuries.  As naval warfare became more prominent from the late 16th century, there was an increased demand for works depicting it, which were to remain a staple of maritime painting until the 20th century, pulling the genre in the direction of history painting, with an emphasis on the correct and detailed depiction of the vessels, just as other trends pulled in the direction of increasingly illusionist and subtle effects in the treatment of the sea and weather, paralleling those of landscape painting.  Many artists could paint both sorts of subject, but others specialized in one or the other.  However at this date seascapes showing a large portion of sea and with no vessels at all were very rare.

==Maritime painting of the Dutch Golden Age==
[[File:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]], 1617, ''Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602'']]
{{main article|Dutch Golden Age painting}}

The [[Dutch Republic]] relied on fishing and trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. By 1650 95% of ships passing from the [[North Sea]] into the [[Baltic sea|Baltic]] were Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the "calms", or more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated.  It is therefore no surprise that the genre of maritime painting was enormously popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213, the start of his chapter 9, which is devoted to Marine painting&lt;/ref&gt;  As with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting to a low viewpoint was a crucial step, made by the first great Dutch marine specialist [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;

More often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists probably often had precise models of ships available to help them achieve accurate depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 57-61&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], and [[Hendrick Dubbels]].&lt;ref&gt;Described in Slive, 216-220&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Salomon van Ruisdael Deventer.jpg|right|thumb|320px|[[Salomon van Ruysdael]], typical ''View of Deventer Seen from the North-West'' (1657); an example of the "tonal phase".]]

The prolific workshop of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] was the leader of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, but incorporating the advances of the tonal works of earlier decades where the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. The Younger van de Velde was very strongly influenced by Simon de Vlieger, whose pupil he was. The Elder van de Velde had first visited England in the 1660s, but both father and son left Holland permanently for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 220-224&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reinier Nooms]], who had been a sailor and signed his works ''Zeeman'' ("seaman"), specialized in highly accurate battle scenes and ship portraits, with some interest also in effects of light and weather, and it was his style that was to be followed by many later specialized artists.  [[Abraham Storck]] and [[Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten]] were other battle specialists.  Nooms also painted several scenes of dockyard maintenance and repair operations, which are unusual and of historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 223&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of marine painting continued in the Flemish part of the Netherlands, but was much less prominent, and took longer to shake off the Mannerist style of shipwrecks amid fantastic waves. Most paintings were small ''zeekens'', whereas the Dutch painted both large and small works.  The leading artist was [[Bonaventura Peeters]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Schepen aan lager wal - Ships running aground - The 'Ridderschap' and 'Hollandia' in trouble in the Street of Gibraltar 1-3 March 1694 (Ludolf Backhuysen, 1708).jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], Dutch warships in trouble off [[Gibraltar]], a real incident of 1690]]

The Dutch style was exported to other nations by various artists who emigrated, as well as mere emulation by foreign artists.  The most important emigrants were the leading Amsterdam marine artists, the father and son Willem van de Velde.  Having spent decades chronicling Dutch naval victories over the English, after the collapse of the art market in the disastrous [[rampjaar]] of 1672, they accepted an invitation from the English court to move to London, and spent the rest of their lives painting the wars from the other side.  Artists loosely said to have "followed" their style include [[Isaac Sailmaker]], although he was a much earlier Dutch emigrant who had preceded their arrival in England by at least 20 years, and whose style is very different from theirs; as well as [[Peter Monamy]], whose style derives from numerous marine painters besides the van de Veldes, such as Nooms, Peeters and Bakhuizen; and several others, such as Thomas Baston and the Vale brothers, who painted in the native English tradition.

Increasingly, marine art was already mostly left to specialists, with rare exceptions like [[Rembrandt]]'s powerful ''[[The Storm on the Sea of Galilee]]'' of 1633, his only true seascape.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 214&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Van Dyck]] made some fine drawings of the English coast from boats off [[Rye]], apparently when waiting for his ship to the continent, but never produced any paintings.  Some of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens's]] paintings involve the sea and ships, but are so extravagant and stylised that they can hardly be called marine art.  However [[Claude Lorrain]] developed an influential type of harbour scene, usually with a view out to a sea with a rising or setting sun, and extravagant classical buildings rising on both sides of the channel.  This elaborated on a tradition of Italianate harbour scenes by Northern artists (Italian ones took little interest in such scenes) that goes back at least as far as [[Paul Bril]] and was especially popular in Flanders, with [[Bonaventura Peeters]] and [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], an emigrant from [[Rotterdam]], as the leading exponents there, and [[Jan Baptist Weenix]] in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, 178 and 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Hodges, Resolution and Adventure in Matavai Bay.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Hodges]], ''The [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]] and [[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]] in [[Matavai Bay]]'' ([[Tahiti]]), 1776.]]
The century supplied an abundance of military actions to depict, and before the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759]] the English and French had roughly equal numbers of victories to celebrate.  There were a considerable number of very accomplished specialist artists in several countries, who continued to develop the Dutch style of the previous century, sometimes in a rather formulaic manner, with carefully accurate depictions of ships.  This was insisted on for the many paintings commissioned by captains, ship-owners and others with nautical knowledge, and many of the artists had nautical experience themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Slive, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Nicholas Pocock]] had risen to be master of a merchantman, learning to draw while at sea, and as official marine painter to the king was present at a major sea battle, the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794, on board the frigate [[HMS Pegasus (1779)|HMS ''Pegasus'']].  [[Thomas Buttersworth]] had served as a seaman in several actions up to 1800.  The Frenchman [[Ambroise Louis Garneray]], mainly active as a painter in the following century, was an experienced sailor, and the accuracy of his paintings of [[whaling]] is praised by the narrator in [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'', who knew them only from prints.&lt;ref&gt;"But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale... " and "Who Garneray the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvelously tutored by some experienced whaleman.'' (CHAPTER 56: Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes), [[Moby Dick]].&lt;/ref&gt;  At the bottom end of the market, ports in many European countries by now had "pierhead artists" at the docks, who would paint cheap ship portraits that were typically fairly accurate as to the features and rigging of the ship, which was demanded by sailor customers, but very formulaic in general artistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Osborne , Anthony Langdon.  "Marine painting", in ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online.

The Venetian artists [[Canaletto]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] painted [[vedute]] in which the canals, [[gondola]]s and other small craft, and lagoon of Venice are most often prominent features; many of Guardi's later works barely show land at all, and Canaletto's works from his period in England also mostly feature a river and boats. Both produced a large quantity of work, not all of the same quality, but their best paintings handle water  and light superbly, though in very different moods, as Canaletto's world is always bright and sunny, where Guardi's is often overcast, if not misty and gloomy.
[[File:Vernet, Claude Joseph - The Shipwreck - 1772.jpg|thumb|''The Shipwreck'', 1772, by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]]]

Naval cadets were now encouraged to learn drawing, as new coastal charts made at sea were expected to be accompanied by "coastal profiles", or sketches of the land behind, and artists were appointed to teach the subject at naval schools, including [[John Thomas Serres]], who published ''Liber Nauticus, and Instructor in the Art of Marine Drawings'' in 1805/06.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 134-135&lt;/ref&gt;  Professional artists were now often sent on voyages of exploration, like [[William Hodges]] (1744–1797) on [[James Cook]]'s second voyage to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and exotic coastal scenes were popular as both paintings and prints.

Prints had become as significant as a source of income as the original painting for some artists, for example the much-engraved French painter [[Claude Joseph Vernet]] (1714–1789), who both revived something of the spirit of the Mannerist tempest, and looked forward to [[Romanticism]], in his large and extremely dramatic scenes of storms and shipwrecks.  He was also commissioned by the French government to produce a series of views of French harbours,&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt; with the strange result that many of his works showing merchant shipping are very violent, and most showing naval vessels very tranquil.  He also developed a type of large Claudeian harbour-scene, at sunset and with a generalized Mediterranean setting, which were imitated by many artists.  Another early Romantic French, or at least Alsatian-Swiss,  artist was [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]] (1740–1812), who spent most of his career in England, where he was commissioned by the government to produce a number of works depicting naval victories.  [[Watson and the Shark]] is a famous marine history subject of 1778 by [[John Singleton Copley]].

==Romantic Age to present==
[[File:Slave-ship.jpg|thumb|300px| [[J. M. W. Turner]], ''[[The Slave Ship]]'', 1840]]
The Romantic period saw marine painting rejoin the mainstream of art, although many specialized painters continued to develop the "ship portrait" genre.  [[Antoine Roux]] and sons dominated maritime art in [[Marseille, France|Marseille]] throughout the 1800s with detailed portraits of ships and maritime life. 
Arguably the greatest icon of Romanticism in art is [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1819), and for [[J.M.W. Turner]] painting the sea was a lifelong obsession.  The ''Medusa'' is a radical type of history painting, while Turner's works, even when given history subjects, are essentially approached as landscapes.  His public commission [[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]] (1824) was criticised for inaccuracy, and his most personal late works make no attempt at accurate detail, often having lengthy titles to explain what might otherwise seem an unreadable mass of "soapsuds and whitewash", as [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]] described Turner's ''[[Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth|Snow Storm - Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth making Signals in Shallow Water, and going by the Lead.  The Author was in this Storm on the Night the Ariel left Harwich]]'' of 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 177-178; [[:File:William Turner - Snowstorm.JPG|Snowstorm]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new force in painting, the [[art of Denmark]], featured coastal scenes very strongly, with an emphasis on tranquil waters and still, golden light. These influenced the German [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who added an element of Romantic mysticism, as in ''[[The Stages of Life]]'' (1835); his ''[[The Sea of Ice]]'' is less typical, showing a polar shipwreck.  [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] continued the old themes of battles, shipwrecks and storms with a full-blooded Russian Romanticism, as in [[The Ninth Wave]] (1850).
River, harbour and coastal scenes, typically with only small boats, were popular with [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and the [[Barbizon school]], especially [[Charles-François Daubigny]]; many of the most famous works of the most important Russian landscapist, [[Isaac Levitan]], featured tranquil lakes and also the huge rivers of Russia, which he and many artists treated as a source of national pride.  [[Gustave Courbet]] painted a number of scenes of beaches with cliffs and views looking out to sea of waves breaking on a beach, usually with no human figures or craft. During the 1860s [[Édouard Manet]] painted a number of paintings depicting important and newsworthy events including his 1864 'marine' painting of the ''Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama,'' memorializing a sea battle that took place in 1864 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/101707.html Philadelphia Museum of Art] Retrieved April 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hovhannes Aivazovsky - The Ninth Wave - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Ivan Aivazovsky]], ''[[The Ninth Wave]]'', 1850]]

The ship portrait genre was taken to America by a number of emigrants, most English like [[James E. Buttersworth]] (1817–1894) and [[Robert Salmon]].  The [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminist]] [[Fitz Henry Lane]] (1804–1865) was the earliest of a number of artists who developed American styles based in landscape art; he painted small boats at rest in tranquil small bays. [[Martin Johnson Heade]] was a member of the [[Hudson River School]], and painted tranquil scenes, but also threatening storms of alarming blackness.  [[Winslow Homer]] increasingly specialized in marine scenes with small boats towards the end of the century, often showing boats in heavy swells on the open sea, as in his ''[[The Gulf Stream (painting)|The Gulf Stream]]''.[[Thomas Eakins]] often painted river scenes, including ''[[Max Schmitt in a Single Scull]]'' (1871).&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

[[File:HMS Pomone (retouched).jpg|thumb|260px|right|HMS ''Pomone'', a colour lithograph by [[Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton|T. G. Dutton]], after a painting by G.F. St.John]][[Thomas Goldsworthy Dutton]] (1820-1891) has the reputation of being one of the finest lithographers of 19th Century nautical scenes and ship portraits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blueworldwebmuseum.org/showall.php?id=64 T.G.Dutton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, as the coast became increasingly regarded as a place of pleasure rather than work, beach scenes and coastal landscapes without any shipping became prominent for the first time, often including cliffs and rock formations, which had earlier been mostly found in scenes of shipwreck.  Many later beach scenes became increasingly crowded, as holidaymakers took over the beaches of Europe.  [[Eugène Boudin]]'s scenes of the beaches of north France strike a familiar note to the modern viewer, despite the heavy clothing worn by the ladies sitting on chairs in the sand.  The [[Impressionist]]s painted many scenes of beaches, cliffs and rivers, especially [[Claude Monet]], who often returned to Courbet's themes, as in ''[[Stormy Sea in Étretat]]''.  It was his ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' (1872), a view over the waters of the harbour at [[Le Havre]], that had given the movement its name.  River scenes were very common among the Impressionists, especially by Monet and [[Alfred Sisley]].&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;
[[File:Dazzle-ships in Drydock at Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Painting of [[dazzle camouflage|Dazzle-ships]] in Drydock at [[Liverpool]]'', by [[Edward Wadsworth]], 1919]]
The Spanish painter [[Joaquín Sorolla]] painted many beach scenes, typically concentrating on a few figures seen close up, in contrast to the smaller figures of most beach paintings.  American artists who painted beaches and shores, typically less populated, include [[John Frederick Kensett]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Jonas Lie (painter)|Jonas Lie]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], who mainly painted rivers and the canals of [[Venice]]. Towards the end of the 19th century the [[United States|American]] painter [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] created moody and darkly visionary early modernist seascapes. The [[Fauvism|Fauve]] and [[Pointillism|Pointilliste]] groups included fairly tranquil waters in large numbers of their work, as did [[Edvard Munch]] in his early paintings.  In England the [[Newlyn School]] and the naive fisherman-artist [[Alfred Wallis]] are worth noting.

The rather traditional British marine artist Sir [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] was during [[World War I]] the inventor of [[dazzle camouflage]], by which ships were boldly painted in patterns, achieving results not dissimilar to [[Vorticism]], inspiring the naval ditty: "Captain Schmidt at the periscope / You need not fall or faint / For it’s not the vision of drug or dope / But only the dazzle paint".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/507 Article (see end) by] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206224810/http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/507 |date=2010-12-06 }} [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the American navy adopted the idea in 1918, [[Frederick Judd Waugh]] was put in charge of design.

Specialized marine painters concentrating on ship portraits continue to the present day, with artists such as [[Montague Dawson]] (1895–1973), whose works were very popular in reproduction; like many, he found works showing traditional sailing ships more in demand than those of modern vessels. Even in 1838 Turner's ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up]]'', still probably his most famous work, displayed nostalgia for the age of sail.  Marine subjects still  attract many mainstream artists,  and more popular forms of marine art remain enormously popular, as shown by the parodic series of paintings by [[Vitaly Komar]] and [[Alexander Melamid]] called ''America's Most Wanted Painting'', with variants for several countries, almost all featuring a lakeside view.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, 21, and [http://awp.diaart.org/km/painting.html Most Wanted and Least Wanted Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted above, a river with a small boat or two was a standard component of [[Chinese ink and brush painting]]s, and many featured lakes and, less often, coastal views. However the water was often left as white space, with the emphasis firmly on the land elements in the scene.  The more realist court school of Chinese painting often included careful depictions of the shipping on China's great rivers in the large horizontal scrolls showing panoramas of city scenes with the Emperors progressing across the Empire, or festivals like the one shown above.

The turning-away from long-distance maritime activity of both the Chinese and Japanese governments at the time of the Western Renaissance no doubt helped to inhibit the development of marine themes in the art of these countries, but the more popular Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] coloured [[woodblock print]]s very often featured coastal and river scenes with shipping, including ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' (1832) by [[Hokusai]], the most famous of all ukiyo-e images.

The [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] '''Museum Conservation Institute'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-conservation-institute Museum Conservation Institute Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; (MCI) aims to be the center for specialized [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and technical collection [[research]] for all of the Smithsonian museums&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/facts-about-smithsonian-institution Smithsonian Institution Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/fact-sheet-smithsonian-collections Smithsonian Collections Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; MCI's staff combine state-of-the-art instrumentation and scientific techniques with the knowledge of materials and the history of technology to provide technical research studies and interpretation of art, as well as historical and anthropological objects, to improve the conservation and collections storage capabilities at the Smithsonian. For the majority of the Smithsonian collections, MCI is the only Smithsonian resource for technical studies and analyses.

==History==

The Smithsonian's Board of Regents&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/smithsonian-board-regents Smithsonian Board of Regents Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; established the Conservation Research Laboratory of the United States National Museum in 1963 in response to a growing need to support conservation of the entire Institution's collections.

In 1965 the name of the laboratory was changed to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory (CAL). In 1983, the laboratory moved to the Museum Support Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/museum-support-center Museum Support Center Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; in Suitland, Maryland. Congress mandated a national conservation training program among other wider responsibilities including an expanded conservation science research program.

The Board of Regents approved a name change to the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) in 1998. SCMRE's mission was to serve all museum communities - national and international, and provide professional training and education programs.

In 2006 the Board of Regents approved the name change to the Museum Conservation Institute (MCI).

'''''Numbers''''' (stylized as '''''NUMB3RS''''')  is an American [[crime drama]] [[television series]] that ran on [[CBS]] from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by [[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], and follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Special Agent]] [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]) and his brother [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] produced ''Numbers''; its production companies are the Scott brothers' [[Scott Free Productions]] and [[CBS Television Studios]] (originally [[Paramount Network Television]], and later [[CBS Paramount Network Television]]).

The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and [[Mathematical modeling|mathematically modeled]] by Charlie, with the help of [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.

On May 18, 2010, CBS announced that ''Numbers'' had been canceled after six seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html "Report: CBS cancels 'Ghost Whisperer,' 'Numbers' and five more shows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111044100/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html |date=2010-11-11 }}.

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Numbers characters}}
The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.

* [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), Charlie's older brother, is the lead [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] at the Los Angeles Violent Crimes Squad.
* [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]) is a [[mathematician|mathematical genius]] who, in addition to teaching at CalSci, consults for the FBI and [[National Security Agency|NSA]].
* [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is a former [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Urban planner|city planner]], a widower, and the father of both Charlie and Don Eppes. Alan lives in a historic two-story house (filmed at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/2515+4th+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90018/@34.034002,-118.3238247,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2b869ec3fde99:0x627e93a3a95a80da 2525 4th Avenue]) furnished with period [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] furniture.
* [[David Sinclair (Numbers)|David Sinclair]] ([[Alimi Ballard]]) is an FBI [[field agent]] and was later made Don's second-in-command and promoted to supervisor.
* Terry Lake ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) is a forensic psychologist and FBI agent.
* Prof. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) is a [[theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] at CalSci. Charlie's former mentor and now best friend, he also frequently consults for the FBI.
* Prof. [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]) is a mathematician at CalSci and an FBI consultant. In season&amp;nbsp;2, she begins dating Charlie, to whom she is engaged and married in season&amp;nbsp;6. Charlie was her [[thesis advisor]]. Her name is a reference to influential autodidactic Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].
* [[Megan Reeves]] ([[Diane Farr]]) is an FBI [[behaviorist|behavioral specialist]]. She was involved romantically with Larry Fleinhardt and left the FBI to counsel troubled young women.
* [[Colby Granger]] ([[Dylan Bruno]]) is an FBI field agent. Once thought to have betrayed his colleagues, he is now back in their good graces and confidence.
* [[Liz Warner]] ([[Aya Sumika]]) is an FBI agent, formerly involved with Agent Eppes.
* [[Nikki Betancourt]] ([[Sophina Brown]]) is an FBI agent with four years' experience in the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]].

Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "[[List of Numbers episodes|In Plain Sight]]" (season&amp;nbsp;2, episode&amp;nbsp;8), one of the criminals is named [[Michel Rolle|Rolle]] and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named [[Julius Petersen|Robert Peterson]].

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes}}

'''Opening:''' (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.

===Season 1 (2005)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 1)}}
The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' [[List of FBI field offices#California|FBI field office]] and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and [[List of Numbers characters#Terry Lake|Terry Lake]], as well as [[List of Numbers characters#David Sinclair|David Sinclair]]. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student [[Amita Ramanujan]] provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. [[Sabrina Lloyd]] played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by [[Diane Farr]], who played Megan Reeves.

===Season 2 (2005–06)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 2)}}
The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: [[Megan Reeves (Numb3rs)|Megan Reeves]] and [[Colby Granger]]. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at [[Harvard University]], but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.

===Season 3 (2006–07)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 3)}}
''Numb3rs'' was renewed for a third season,&lt;ref name="season3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv.com/numb3rs/show/25043/story.html?story_id=3543&amp;tag=headlines;title;1 |title=Voila! CBS renews 14 shows at once |last=Mahan |first=Colin |publisher=TV.com |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began airing at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his [[leave of absence]]—he will be on the [[International Space Station]] for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his [[ethics]] and [[self-worth]], and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.

Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', but returned to ''Numbers'' for the 21st episode of season&amp;nbsp;3 ("[[The Art of Reckoning (Numb3rs)|The Art of Reckoning]]"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a [[Payload Specialist]] on the [[International Space Station]]. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for [[maternity leave]] in episode 18 ("[[Democracy (Numb3rs)|Democracy]]"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

===Season 4 (2007–08)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 4)}}
The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]].&lt;ref name="fall2007preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2007/ |title=CBS 2007 Fall Preview |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbsreturndates,0,7656374.story |title=CBS Sets Series Return Dates |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on May 16, 2008.

As this season starts, [[Colby Granger]] escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a [[triple agent]]. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season&amp;nbsp;2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends [[FBI Academy|FBI training camp]] because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in [[Pakistan]]. He is subsequently arrested and has his [[security clearance]] revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.

Several characters from previous seasons did not appear in season&amp;nbsp;4, most notably [[Mildred Finch]] and [[Ian Edgerton]].

===Season 5 (2008–09)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 5)}}
The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 presidential debates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114334-CBS_Sets_Fall_Premiere_Dates.php |title=CBS Sets Fall Premiere Dates |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Media |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season five opens three weeks after "[[When Worlds Collide (Numbers)|When Worlds Collide]]" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his [[security clearance]] back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore [[Judaism]]. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, [[Spree (Numbers)|"Spree"]] and "[[Two Daughters]]") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. [[DARPA]] tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.

Notes about Season Five:
[[Disturbed (Numbers)|"Disturbed"]] marked the 100th episode of ''Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/05/01/2009-05-01_hawking_counts_numb3rs_as_a_fave.html |title=Hawking counts 'Numb3rs' as a fave |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |last=Kinon |first=Cristina |date=May 1, 2009 |publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 6 (2009–10)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 6)}}
The sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-CBS-premieres-1007227.aspx |title=Fall TV: CBS Announces Premiere Dates |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.

The season starts with the [[engagement]] of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his [[401(k)]]. After some delay, Larry leaves [[Los Angeles]], only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brother/Big Sister]] program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to [[England]] to teach at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some [[vigilante]] murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a [[guest house]] so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for [[Washington, D.C.]], to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.

==Awards and nominations==
[[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the [[Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="carlsaganaward"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/ |title=Official Numb3rs website |accessdate=2006-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Board]]'s Public Service Award in 2007.&lt;ref name="publicserviceaward"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=108701 |title=The "Numb3rs" Add Up: Popular TV Show and Its Creators Receive Public Service Award |publisher=[[National Science Board]] |date=April 16, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the show's [[stunt coordinator]], Jim Vickers, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination|Outstanding Stunt Coordination]] in 2006 for episode 14 of Season&amp;nbsp;2, "[[Harvest (Numbers)|Harvest]]".&lt;ref name="imdb_awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/awards |title=Awards for "Numb3rs" |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation of mathematics==
{{cquote|We all use math every day; to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money. Math is more than formulas or equations; it's logic, it's rationality, it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.}}

Several mathematicians work as [[consultant]]s for each episode.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/the_mathematica_behind_televis.html?lid=title |title=The Math(ematica) behind Television's Crime Drama NUMB3RS |first=Eric |last=Weisstein |authorlink=Eric Weisstein |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywood_consulting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodmath.com/projects.htm |title=Hollywood Math and Science Film Consulting |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise |url=http://www.math.caltech.edu/USA%20Today.html |title=They're Calculatingly Cool |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants" /&gt;&lt;ref name="devlin"&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith |last=Devlin |url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_02_05.html |title=NUMB3RS gets the math right |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathgames"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed Jr. |last=Pegg |authorlink=Ed Pegg, Jr. |url=http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_01_21_05.html |title=Math Games – The NUMB3RS TV show |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=January 21, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics'' ({{isbn|0452288576}}; published August 28, 2007), written by [[Keith Devlin]] and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.&lt;ref name="devlin_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | ISBN=0-452-28857-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redhawke_books"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redhawke.org/content/view/347/89/ |title=NUMB3RS Books and DVDs |author=Lady Shelley |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/? |title=Numb3rs blog |publisher=Northeastern University |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040230/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/ |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfram Research]] (the developers of ''[[Mathematica]]'') is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind ''NUMB3RS''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numb3rs.wolfram.com |title=NUMB3RS Episode 412-Power-Wolfram Research Math Notes |publisher=Numb3rs.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding [[jargon]], rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.&lt;ref name="silverberg"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Silverberg | authorlink = Alice Silverberg
| first = Alice |date=November 2006 |title=Alice in NUMB3Rland |journal=FOCUS |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.math.uci.edu/~asilverb/bibliography/numb3rland.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between [[Charlie Eppes]] and his graduate student [[Amita Ramanujan]].&lt;ref name="silverberg" /&gt;

==Production==
The idea for ''Numbers'' was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by [[Bill Nye]], a popular [[Science education|science educator]].&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137661,00.html|title=The Numb3rs Guy |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jonas |first=Gerald|title=The Strange Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/bib/971005.rv102432.html | work=The New York Times |date=5 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the "[[Mathnet]]" segment on the children's television show ''[[Square One Television|Square One]]''.

[[Gabriel Macht]] was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes.&lt;ref name="Point of Origin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Cheryl Heuton (co-creator/co-executive producer), Nicolas Falacci (co-creator-executive producer), Ridley Scott (executive producer), Tony Scott (executive producer), David W. Zucker (co-executive producer), Mark Saks (casting director), Skip Chaissom (producer) |date=2006 |title=Point of Origin: Inside the Unaired Pilot |medium=DVD (Numb3rs: Season 1) |publisher=CBS Studios, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]];&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0433309/trivia |title="Numb3rs" (2005) Trivia |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech)&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia" /&gt; and the [[University of Southern California]]. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of [[:Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|Millikan Library]], including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/locations |title="Numb3rs" (2005) - Filming locations |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common location is the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman home]] of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,&lt;ref name="craftsmanhome"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/home/hm-numbers17 |title=Arts and Crafts by the 'Numb3rs' |first=Christy |last=Hobart |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[replica]] set was used from the second season onwards.&lt;ref name="setfilming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fanrush.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 |title=NUMB3RS.org forum |accessdate=2007-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title of the show===
The show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter "e".  In interviews with Tom Jicha of the ''[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' and with Alan Pergament of ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from [[leet]], a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=Doing the Math – CBS Hopes Its New Equation for the Crime Drama, Pairing a Detective and a Genius, Will Add up to a Hit |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=22 January 2005 | url= http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C960544014224?p=NewsBank |accessdate=26 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pergament |first=Alan |title='Numb3rs' Viewers Probably Won't Be Willing to Do the Math |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] | location=[[Buffalo, New York]]| publisher=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=20 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C908EC4021785?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Gary Lorden, a [[California Institute of Technology]] mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard.  Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Public Radio]] |title=The 'Numb3rs' Don't Lie |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=5 October 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15039360 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling.  Some reporters, such as Joanne Ostrow of the ''[[Denver Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ostrow |first=Joanne |title=Networks are busy, it must be midseason |work=[[Denver Post]] |location=[[Denver, Colorado]]| publisher=[[Denver Post]] |date=8 December 2004 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-12-08/features/0412080046_1_jonny-zero-midseason-northern-exposure |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the staff members of ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Report |title=Picks and Pans Review: Numb3rs |work=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |date=31 January 2005 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20146679,00.html |accessdate=26 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111543/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20146679,00.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the editors of [[The Futon Critic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Futon Critic Staff |title=Numb3rs' Add Up to a January Premiere |work=[[The Futon Critic]] |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]] |date=29 November 2004 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/11/29/numb3rs-add-up-to-a-january-premiere-17323/20041129cbs01/ |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the staff of the [[E.

Lynette Rice of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, "Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for [[sigma]], which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice|first=Lynette|title=Smart Throb|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 February 2005|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1026706,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[sigma]] (∑) stands for [[summation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=David J. |title=Review of Mathematical Symbols |work=Psy302: Statistical Methods |publisher=[[California State University, Los Angeles]] |date=21 September 2001 |url=http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/dweiss/Psy302/Symbols.htm |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Others used varying adjectives to describe the title.  The TV site [[Zap2it.com]] called it "their typographical silliness, not ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=dmason |title=CBS is counting on 'Numb3rs' |work=[[Ventura County Star]] |location=[[Camarillo, California]]| publisher=[[Ventura County Star]] |date=4 December 2004 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1076B5146BD80512?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brad Aspey of ''[[The Muskegon Chronicle]]'', stated, "No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aspey |first=Brad |title='Regular' TV finally getting the message from cable |work=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |location=[[Muskegon, Michigan]] |publisher=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |date=28 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11406B3D9777EDE5?p=NewsBank  |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Gray of ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', said, "Some of you may have noticed that in promoting "Numb3rs," which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the "e" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed "R" in Toys R Us.  So there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Ellen |title=Math Adds Up to Zero for 'Numb3rs' Star |work=[[The Philadelphia Daily News]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[Watertown Daily Times]] |date=22 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107CD076C5CB2884?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others had a more positive view of the title.  When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer [[Tony Scott]] originated the title.  Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was "kind of hokey" but later saw it as "brilliant" and a "catchy logo".&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  Jonathan Storm of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', in his review of the series stated, "You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves.  But the "3" substituting for the "e" is actually based on a real thing"….  He later said that the show was "written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Storm |first=Jonathan |title=Solving Crimes by the 'Numb3rs' |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=23 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107D72D2F66DE363?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Brooks of ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)]]'' devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |title=C4n y0u r34d 7h15?

'''''Out In South London''''' is a weekly arts and culture LGBT radio show broadcast on [[Resonance 104.4FM]] every Tuesday at 6.30pm. The show was devised and is presented by comedian [[Rosie Wilby]]. 

==History==
Out in South London was started by stand up comedian and musician, [[Rosie Wilby]], as a monthly show on [http://www.southcityradio.org/ South City Radio] in Peckham in December 2008. Rosie was inspired by shows like Out This Week on Radio 5 Live in the 1990s, where she once worked as a trainee reporter. The show transferred to Resonance 104.4FM in late 2009 as a weekly half hour show. The show was guest presented for two weeks in May 2012 by journalist and author [[Paul Burston]] who also appeared in the 2011 Christmas special. It is featured as an [[iTunes]] podcast under the category 'philosophy'. In 2013, the show went to a weekly full hour format, going out live each Tuesday between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. In March 2013 Out in South London was a 'community partner' of the [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].

== Early life ==
Adlon was born in [[Albany, New York]]. She is the daughter of Marina L. and Donald Maxwell "Don" Segall (1933–1994), who was a television comedy writer-producer, and author of comic books and science fiction pulp novels.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Mom-Actress-2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USPR-Father&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald M Segall, "United States Public Records"|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KT42-446|website=United States Public Records|publisher=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2013&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maron|first1=Marc|title=Episode 390 - Pamela Adlon|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_390_-_pamela_adlon|website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|accessdate=June 4, 2014|date=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father produced ''The [[Dave Garroway]] Show,'' which became ''[[AM New York]],'' and then ''[[The Today Show]].'' He was a [[NBC page|page at NBC]] with [[Gil Cates]], and wrote erotic fiction under various pseudonyms, including Troy Conway.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2013/&gt; Adlon's father was from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and her mother is English. Her father was born to a [[Jewish]] family, and her mother, originally an Episcopalian, [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]].&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/arts/television/pamela-adlon-better-things-tampons.html&lt;/ref&gt; Adlon has said that her parents met at the [[USO]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=NPR-FreshAir-Hill-Calif-2012 /&gt;

As a child, Adlon lived in the Carnegie House building at 100 West 57th Street.&lt;ref name=NYMag-Intelligencer-2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=StreetEasy-CarnegieHouse-2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Building: Carnegie House |url=http://streeteasy.com/building/carnegie-house|website=[[StreetEasy]]|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has said that she and her family lived bi-coastally, moving between Los Angeles and New York because her father was a journeyman writer and producer for TV. She started performing at age nine; one of her father's friends had a radio studio, so she would do voice-over work there. While in Los Angeles, she did TV and film acting work.&lt;ref name=NPR-FreshAir-Hill-Calif-2012 /&gt; She attended [[Sarah Lawrence College]] for a semester.&lt;ref name=WTF-Maron-2013 /&gt; After moving to [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles]], she shared a house with [[Anna Gunn]].&lt;ref name="fa"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/06/492811885/actress-pamela-adlon-says-better-things-is-dedicated-to-her-daughters |title=Actress Pamela Adlon Says ''Better Things'' Is Dedicated to Her Daughters |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |time=7:20 |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Adlon said voice-overs saved her career. As successful as her child-actress years had been, she struggled to find parts in her 20s.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Mom-Actress-2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rhodes|first1=Joe|title=Her Life as a Mom, an Actress and a Boy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/arts/television/23rhod.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=June 4, 2014|work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable live-action roles include Girl Joey in the 1984 teen film ''[[Bad Manners (film)|Bad Manners]]'', Kelly Affinado on ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', Marcy Runkle on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', and Pamela on FX's ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]'' (she is also a consulting producer for the show).&lt;ref name=Slate-CharStud-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haglund|first1=David|title=Character Studies: Pamela from Louie|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/02/02/pamela_adlon_the_second_most_important_actor_on_tv_s_best_comedy.html|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=June 4, 2014|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adlon was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for her role as Otto Osworth on Cartoon Network's ''[[Time Squad]]''. In 2006–07, she played the voice of Andy in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' animated series and co-starred with [[Louis C.K.]] as his wife in the short-lived [[HBO]] sitcom ''[[Lucky Louie]]''. She also stars as the friend of Louie (a fictional character based on himself, Louis C.K.) in his FX single-camera show, ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. She is in episodes of seasons 1, 2, 4, and 5.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-GrumpusMax-2011&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/magazine/inside-the-bald-angry-head-of-louis-ck.html |newspaper= [[New York Times]] | title= Grumpus Maximus | first= Andrew | last= Goldman | date= June 17, 2011 |accessdate= December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 5th season, she received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/67th-nominations-list-v2.pdf|title=67th Primetime Emmy Award Nominations|publisher=Emmys.com|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adlon voiced [[Pajama Sam]] in the video games ''[[Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside]]'', ''[[Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't so Frightening|Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening]]'', ''[[Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat from Your Head to Your Feet]]'', and ''Pajama Sam's Games to Play on Any Day''.

In 2015, [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] gave a pilot order for ''[[Better Things (TV series)|Better Things]]'', which is a comedy created by and starring Adlon. She plays an actress raising three daughters.

The '''Peix Nicolau''' ('''fish Nicolau''') is a creature that, just like [[mermaid]]s, is half man, half fish. The different legends and tales of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] contain diverse stories about enchantments and marine mysteries.

== The ''Rondalles Mallorquines'' version ==

Nicolau was a boy that always wanted to soak himself in the sea. His mother, tired of this, one day said a curse, which changed him from the waist down. The sea brought on Tresco every corner, which allowed him to create the letters to navigate. But he had never toiled the [[Saluet]] between Santa Margarita and Arta and although it was dangerous, he wanted to go and unfortunately was drowned. The story states the danger of this site, where a being so skillful in the matters of sea life was still strained.

More or less he is king of the water and of all who live there. He lives in the land that bathes the sea, and has a glimpsed ominous sign. He should be viewed, not caught and especially not more or you can not avoid the misfortune. According to the source, he is a single individual or an entire species.

== Other versions ==

Legend has it that the fish Nicolau was originally a small child that was very fond of the water. The child's family lived in a coastal town and spent the day swimming in the sea. He cursed himself to become a fish after becoming tired of being prevented by his mother to play in the water. And in the end, tired all the disadvantages of living on earth waist fish-instead of walking and had to crawl like fish, not to spoil it had to be in - Stay to live to the sea where it still is.

Every March he comes out of his lair to see if there is any new land since last year, so he can go for a walk and once he sees what he wants, he goes back to his palace under water.

'''Penguin Great Ideas''' is a series of largely [[non-fiction]] books published by [[Penguin Books]]. Titles contained within this series are considered to be world-changing, influential and inspirational. Topics covered include [[philosophy]], [[politics]], [[science]] and [[war]]. The texts for the series have been extracted from previously published [[Penguin Classics]] and Penguin Modern Classics titles and purged of all editorial apparatus so as to appear as stand-alone texts. The concept of re-purposed extracts was inspired by an earlier Penguin series produced in the mid-1990s, the [[Penguin's 60 Classics]], which were extracts of classic texts published in a small book format at the time of Penguin's 60th anniversary.

The overall series is divided into five series of twenty books, each about a hundred pages long. Every book contains a notable [[essay]], often by a very well known writer. Some of these are slightly shortened. The third series features additional works by the previous series' most popular writers: Albert Camus, Sigmund Freud, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, George Orwell and John Ruskin. The fourth series includes a third essay by Orwell, and additional works by Michel de Montaigne, Arthur Schopenhauer, Karl Marx and Virginia Woolf. The fifth series will be the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=The Penguin Blog, |date=1 September 2010 |title=Editor Simon Winder looks back on a curious attempt to make philosophy popular |url=http://thepenguinblog.typepad.com/the_penguin_blog/2010/09/glazed-shaky-politically-and-philosophically-confused-i-have-just-finished-up-editing-the-100th-and-last-penguin-great-ide.html |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026173659/http://thepenguinblog.typepad.com/the_penguin_blog/2010/09/glazed-shaky-politically-and-philosophically-confused-i-have-just-finished-up-editing-the-100th-and-last-penguin-great-ide.html |archivedate=October 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rough Waves''''' ({{Lang-ja|波濤 図 屏風}}) is a painting by the Japanese artist [[Ogata Kōrin]], on a two-panel ''[[byōbu]]'' (folding screen).  The work was created {{circa|1704|1709}}, and depicts a swirl of stormy sea waves.  It has been in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, since 1926, when it was acquired with financial support from the [[Isaac Dudley Fletcher|Fletcher Fund]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/44918|title=波濤図屏風 Rough Waves|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Throughout the history of [[Japanese art]], many artists have sought to convey in their works the fleeting state of rolling sea waves. The theme has been depicted not only on ''[[emakimono]]'' (handscrolls) and silk, but also on fans, ''byōbu'' and decor items.&lt;ref name=felt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feltmagnet.com/misc/japanese-wave-art|title=Japanese Wave Paintings|work=FeltMagnet|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Ogata's painting ''Rough Waves'' is the most important image of the unapproachable sea elements to be created in Japanese painting before [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=felt/&gt;  To create it, Ogata used an ancient Chinese technique of drawing with two brushes, held together in one hand.&lt;ref name=met/&gt; 

The materials Ogata used for the painting were [[Chinese ink|ink]], paint and [[gilding|gilded paper]].  He conveyed the threatening and dangerous nature of the waves with the help of elongated and contrastingly contoured, finger- or [[dragon]]-claw-like wave crests and sea foam.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;  The expressiveness of the work appears to be unusual for Ogata, with the main means of expression being the use of lines created by ink.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.histrf.ru/articles/article/show/ogata_korin|work=Энциклопедия «Всемирная история» / The World History Encyclopedia|title=Огата Корин|trans-title=Ogata Kōrin|lang=ru|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screen on which ''Rough Waves'' was painted bears the seal “Dōsū”, a pseudonym that Ogata used from 1704. Recent studies show that Ogata created the painting between 1704 and 1709, during the transitional period in his career when he lived in the city of Edo (now Tokyo).&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt; The works of the artist during this period are characterized by a strong influence of the creativity of representatives of the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

The direct source of inspiration for ''Rough Waves'' may have been the work of the artist [[Sesson Shukei]] ({{Circa|1504|1589}}), whose still-extant paintings include a number of dynamic and mysterious images of sea waves, among them ''Egret, Moon, and Wave'' and ''The Wind and the Waves''.&lt;ref name=met/&gt;&lt;ref name=felt/&gt;  ''Rough Waves'' also reflects the influence of [[Tawaraya Sōtatsu]], who specialized in gloomy landscapes, but is nevertheless an independent interpretation by Ogata of the frightening and violent force of the sea.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/design/rimpa-painters-at-japan-society-and-the-met.html|title=Boldest Color for Total Effect. Rimpa Painters at Japan Society and the Met|work=New York Times|date=September 27, 2012|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Rough Waves'' impressed Ogata’s follower [[Sakai Hōitsu]], who in 1805 created his work ''Waves'', in which he tried to convey a similar frightening atmosphere and a premonition of danger. At some time in the past, Hōitsu's family had commissioned work from Ogata, and so a collection of Ogata's pictures was available for Hōitsu to study in detail.  The images in ''Waves'', created in ink on silver-plated paper, were more abstract than those in Ogata's work, but retained their demonic character.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The '''Salon des Refusés''', French for "exhibition of rejects" ({{IPA-fr|salɔ̃ de ʁəfyze}}), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official [[Paris Salon]], but the term is most famously used to refer to the ''Salon des Refusés'' of 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boime"&gt;{{cite journal

Today by extension, ''salon des refusés'' refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

==Background of the Salon of 1863==
The [[Paris Salon]], sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art.  A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career;  winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions.  Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy;  history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the "genre scene", and the still life.  The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries.  In 1851, [[Gustave Courbet]] managed to get one painting into the Salon, ''Enterrement á Ornans'', and in 1852 his ''Baigneuses'' was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings.  As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors.  Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called ''Le Realism'', at a private gallery.  Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public.

In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of [[Gustave Courbet]],  [[Édouard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: "Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition.  His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry."&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863. Cited in Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial - La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist [[Émile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed  to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and the public ridiculed the ''refusés'', which included such now-famous paintings as [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting.

The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism.

Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés.&lt;ref name="Boime 2007 676"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' depicts the juxtaposition of a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the ''[[Bois de Boulogne]]'', a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musee D'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Bois de Boulogne'' is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

[[Émile Zola]] comments about ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape.  We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty.  There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air.  This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas.  My God!  What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men!  That has never been seen.  And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude.  But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized.  The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists.  Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh.  That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves.  It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Émile Zola]] incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' ''(The Masterpiece)'' (1886).

In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] painted his first famous work, ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. This portrait of his mistress and business manager [[Joanna Hiffernan]] was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'', a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Koval, pgs. 106, 119&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer.

Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was "an apparition with a spiritual content" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistler started working on ''The White Girl'' shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|annual exhibition]] of the [[Royal Academy]]. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April .&lt;ref name="Sp300"&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but in 1863 it was accepted at the Salon des Refusés in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for the exhibition of works rejected from the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm Whistler explained his purpose in making the painting, ''Symphony in White''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905065722/http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm |date=2013-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[George du Maurier]] in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting:

{{quote|... a woman in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain – but the figure receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture, barring the red hair, is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"&gt;Taylor (1978), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected.&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. [[Edwin Henry Landseer]]'s ''The Shrew Tamed'' showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, May 04, 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A&lt;/ref&gt; a noted equestrienne of the period,&lt;ref&gt;She offered her professional services to render ladies' horses "quiet, safe and pleasant to ride":''The Times'', Friday, Jun 20, 1856; pg. 2; Issue 22399; col A&lt;/ref&gt; however it was soon rumored that it was actually [[Catherine Walters]], the notorious London [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211:'"The Shrew Tamed" - a high-bred horse of soft silken coat, dappled with play of light and shade as on velvet, subdued by a "pretty horsebreaker", is certainly unfortunate as a subject. This picture has been made the more notorious by "The Belgravian Lament", which took the well-known rider as a text whereon to point a moral. We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of "pretty horsebreakers" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.'&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; ''White Girl'' was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson &amp; Koval (1994), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"/&gt; The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the ''Salon'' in Paris – the official art exhibition of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] – but it was rejected there as well.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;Craven (2003), pp. 342–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was accepted at the alternative ''Salon des Refusés'' – the "exhibition of rejects" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official ''Salon''.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (1974), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although others said while Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''.&lt;ref name="Craven"/&gt; The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in [[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton &amp; MacDonald (1978), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter [[Gustave Courbet]] and the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The art critic [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]] saw it in the tradition of [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Art historian [[Albert Boime]] wrote: "The Salon des Refusés introduced the democratic concept of a multi-style system (much like a multi-party system) subject to the review of the general jury of the public."&lt;ref name="Boime"/&gt;

The name of the hermitage, taken from the town Santo Tomás de las Ollas (St. Thomas of the [[Ollas]]), comes from the main occupation of that locality: pottery. They supplied to the [[Valle del Silencio]] zone.

The hermitage was donated to the community of [[San Pedro de Montes]] monastery by the [[Bishop of Astorga]].

Legal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject.

These debates are part of a larger discourse on [[societal views on intellectual property|intellectual property protection]] which also reflects differing perspectives on [[anti-copyright|copyright]].

==History==
Criticism of patents reached an early peak in Victorian Britain between 1850 and 1880, in a campaign against patenting that expanded to target [[copyright]] too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, "remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property", coming close to abolishing patents.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|247}} Its most prominent activists - [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], [[William Robert Grove]], [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] and [[Robert Andrew Macfie|Robert A. MacFie]] - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical [[laissez-faire]] economists ([[The Economist]] published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|249, 267, 270}}  Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|273}}&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Grove: ''Suggestions for Improvements in the Administration of the Patent Law'', [[The Jurist]] n.s. 6 (January 28, 1860) 19-25 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BWlMAAAAYAAJ online copy] at Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Sherman, L. Bently: ''The Making of Modern Intellectual Property Law'' (CUP 1999), 50-56 {{ISBN|9780521057134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[Patents] projected an artificial idol of the single inventor, radically denigrated the role of the intellectual commons, and blocked a path to this commons for other citizens — citizens who were all, on this account, potential inventors too. [...] Patentees were the equivalent of squatters on public land — or better, of uncouth market traders who planted their barrows in the middle of the highway and barred the way of the people.''
Similar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, [[Prussia]], Switzerland and the Netherlands (but not in the USA).&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with [[free trade]], the [[Netherlands]] abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912.&lt;ref name="kick"&gt;[[Ha Joon Chang|Chang, Ha-Joon]]. [http://www.paecon.net/PAEtexts/Chang1.htm "Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism"]. ''[[Post-Autistic Economics Review]]''. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="kick"/&gt;

==Contemporary arguments==
Contemporary arguments have focused on ways that patents can slow innovation by: blocking researchers' and companies' access to basic, enabling technology, and particularly following the explosion of patent filings in the 1990s, through the creation of "patent thickets"; wasting productive time and resources fending off enforcement of low-quality patents that should not have existed, particularly by "patent trolls"; and wasting money on patent litigation.  Patents on pharmaceuticals have been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.

===Blocking innovation===
The most general argument against patents is that "intellectual property" in all its forms represents an effort to claim something that should not be owned, and harms society by slowing innovation and wasting resources.&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt;

Law professors [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg have described an ongoing [[tragedy of the anticommons]] with regard to the proliferation of patents in the field of [[biotechnology]], wherein  intellectual property rights have become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments.&lt;ref name=anticommons/&gt;

Some public campaigns for improving access to medicines and [[genetically modified food]] have expressed a concern for "preventing the over-reach" of intellectual property protection including patent protection, and "to retain a public balance in property rights".&lt;ref name=sksell&gt;Susan K Sell (2003), ''Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights'', Cambridge, 2003 Cambridge University Press: [http://www.international-ul.com/pdf/ebook/1/_Uyz13PfFMbDE.pdf Cambridge Studies in International Relations: 88]; quoted from page 179, see also page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QjSOfWPo6V4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically&amp;f=false | title = Intellectual Property Rights and the Life Science Industries: A Twentieth Century History | isbn = 9780754621119 | author1 = Dutfield | first1 = Graham | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some economists&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt; and scientists&lt;ref name="Pearce J.

Others claim that patents have had no effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Robert |url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Publications/BriefingBook/Detail.aspx?id=2174 |title=Gene Patents |publisher=The Hastings Center |date= |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404034653/http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |archivedate=2011-04-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor patent quality and patent trolls===
Patents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails "to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system."&lt;ref name="lemley"&gt;Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.261400}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at [[patent prosecution]] stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand.&lt;ref name="lemley"/&gt;

Enforcement of patents – especially patents perceived as being overly broad – by [[patent trolls]], has brought criticism of the patent system,&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last1=Blumberg |first1=Alex |last2=Sydell |first2=Laura |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two |title=When Patents Attack... Part Two! |website=This American Life |publisher=Chicago Public Media |date=May 31, 2013 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.&lt;ref&gt;James F. McDonough III (2006) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=959945&amp;rec=1&amp;srcabs=980776 The Myth of the Patent Troll] accessed 2010-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some patents granted in Russia have been denounced as [[pseudoscientific]] (for example, health-related patents using lunar phase or religious icons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Litigation costs===
According to [[James Bessen]], the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bessen James | year = 2008 | title = The value of U.S. patents by owner and patent characteristics | url = | journal = Research Policy | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 932–945 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bessen and Meurer also note that software and business model litigation accounts for a disproportionate share (almost 40 percent) of patent litigation cost, and the poor performance of the patent system negatively affects these industries.&lt;ref name=BessenMeurer/&gt;&lt;ref name=WheelerAllworth&gt;Rob Wheeler and James Allworth for the Harvard Business Review.  Sept 15, 2011 [https://hbr.org/2011/09/the-america-invents-act-rearra U.S. Patent Overhaul Won’t Help Innovators]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different industries but one law===
[[Richard Posner]] noted that the most controversial feature of US patent law is that it covers all industries in the same way, but not all industries benefit from the time-limited monopoly a patent provides in order to spur innovation.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;  He said that while the pharmaceutical industry is "poster child" for the need for a twenty-year monopoly, since costs to bring to a market are high, the time of development is often long, and the risks are high, in other industries like software the cost and risk of innovation is much lower and the cycle of innovation is quicker, and obtaining and enforcing patents and defending against patent litigation is generally a waste of resources in those industries.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;

===Pharmaceutical patents===
Some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for medication that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people in the developed world, and developing world, cannot afford.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira L. (2002) [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=flr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp; Access to Affordable HIV/AIDS Drugs: The Human Rights Obligations of Multinational Pharmaceutical Corporations] Fordham Law Review 71(3):1133–79&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt; One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Barton J.H. and Emanuel, E.J. (2005) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16249422 The Patents-Based Pharmaceutical Development Process: Rationale, Problems and Potential Reforms] Journal of the American Medical Association 294(16): 2075–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) reached an agreement, which provides a developing country with options for obtaining needed medications under [[compulsory licensing]] or importation of cheaper versions of the drugs, even before patent expiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres03_e/pr350_e.htm Decision removes final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the government of Brazil declared [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]]'s [[efavirenz]] anti-retroviral drug a "public interest" medicine, and challenged Merck to negotiate lower prices with the government or have Brazil strip the patent by issuing a compulsory license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Health-and-Medicine-Week/2004-08-02/080220043339965W.html | title = Drugs give HIV patients longer lives in victory for anti-patent activists| publisher =Health &amp; Medicine Week | date = August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5027532.stm | last = Anderson | first = Tatum | title = Africa rises to HIV drug challenge| publisher =BBC News |date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gay&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/05/03/6
| title = Brazil’s HIV-drug break down| publisher =gay.com |date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]] have similar plans to produce generic antiviral drugs. [[Western world|Western]] pharmaceutical companies initially responded with legal challenges, but some have now promised to introduce alternative pricing structures for developing countries and NGOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gay /&gt;

In July 2008 Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir [[John Sulston]] called for an international biomedical treaty to clear up issues over patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7490384.stm | last = McGrath  | first = Matt  | title = Sulston argues for openmedicine| publisher =BBC News |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these criticisms, one review concluded that less than 5 percent of medicines on the [[essential drugs|World Health Organization's list of essential drugs]] are under patent.&lt;ref name="PoIP"&gt;Ghafele R (2008) [http://www.ip-institute.org.uk/pdfs/Perceptions%20of%20IP.pdf Perceptions of Intellectual Property: A Review] London: Intellectual Property Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed US$2 billion for healthcare in developing countries, providing HIV/AIDS drugs at lower cost or even free of charge in certain countries, and has used differential pricing and parallel imports to provide medication to the poor.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt; Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt;

Quoting a [[World Health Organization]] report, Trevor Jones (director of research and development at the Wellcome Foundation, as of 2006) argued in 2006 that patent monopolies do not create [[monopoly pricing]]. He argued that the companies given monopolies "set prices largely on the willingness/ability to pay, also taking into account the country, disease and regulation" instead of receiving competition from legalized generics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

==Proposed alternatives to the patent system==
Alternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is [[Joseph Stiglitz]]'s idea of [[Prizes as an alternative to patents|providing "prize money"]] (from a "prize fund" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.&lt;ref name=Stiglitz/&gt; Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere altogether, and to cover the costs with direct government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean. "The Reform of Intellectual Property". post-autistic economics review, issue no. 32, 5 July 2005, article 1, [http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue32/Baker32.htm Paecon.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, she served as a [[flight engineer]] on [[Expedition 32]] and then commander of [[Expedition 33]].

==Early life and education==
Sunita Williams was born in [[Euclid, Ohio]], to [[Indian American]] [[neuroanatomist]] [[Deepak Pandya]] and [[Slovene American]] Ursuline Bonnie (Zalokar) Pandya, who reside in [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]]. She is the youngest of three children. Her brother Jay Thomas is four years older and her sister Dina Annadj is 
three years older. Williams' paternal family is from [[Jhulasan]], [[Mehsana]] district in [[Gujarat]], India, while her maternal great-grandmother Mary Bohinc (originally Marija Bohinjec), born in [[Leše, Tržič|Leše]], Slovenia, immigrated to America as an eleven-year-old with her mother, 1891 [[Slovenes#Emigration|Slovene emigrant]] Ursula (Strajhar) Bohinac.&lt;ref name="Ancestry_Slovenia"&gt;[http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/sunita-williams-spet-v-svoji-pradomovini.html Sunita Williams in her maternal ancestors' homeland one more time], [[Delo]], March 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancestry_India"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-31/us-canada-news/38162229_1_sunita-williams-astronaut-gujarat-technical-university Sunita Williams to start her India trip from April 1], [[The Times of India]], March 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams graduated from [[Needham High School]] in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], in 1983. She received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[physical science]] from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1987, and a [[Master of Science]] degree in Engineering Management from [[Florida Institute of Technology]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

==Military career==
Williams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy in May 1987. After a six-month temporary assignment at the Naval Coastal System Command, she was designated a Basic Diving Officer. She next reported to the [[Naval Air Training Command]], where she was designated a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] in July 1989. She received initial [[H-46 Sea Knight]] training in Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 3 ([[HSC-3|HC-3]]), and was then assigned to Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 8 ([[HSC-8|HC-8]]) in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], with which she made overseas deployments to the Mediterranean, Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for [[Operation Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Provide Comfort]]. In September 1992, she was the Officer-in-Charge of an H-46 detachment sent to [[Miami, Florida]], for [[Hurricane Andrew]] relief operations aboard {{USS|Sylvania|AFS-2|6}}. In January 1993, Williams began training at the [[U.S. Naval Test Pilot School]]. She graduated in December, and was assigned to the Rotary Wing Aircraft Test Directorate as an H-46 Project Officer and [[V-22 Osprey|V-22]] chase pilot in the [[T-2 Buckeye|T-2]]. Later, she was assigned as the squadron Safety Officer and flew test flights in the [[SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B/F]], [[UH-1]], [[AH-1W]], [[Kaman SH-2 Seasprite|SH-2]], [[SH-3 Sea King|VH-3]], H-46, [[CH-53]], and the [[H-57 Sea Ranger|H-57]]. In December 1995, she went back to the Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor in the Rotary Wing Department and as the school's Safety Officer. There she flew the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60]], [[OH-6 Cayuse|OH-6]], and the [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]]. She was then assigned to {{USS|Saipan|LHA-2|6}} as the Aircraft Handler and the Assistant Air Boss. Williams was deployed on ''Saipan'' in June 1998 when she was selected by [[NASA]] for the astronaut program.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt; She has logged more than 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 aircraft types.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

==NASA career==
[[File:Sunita Williams astronaut spacewalk.jpg|thumb|250px|Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, STS-116 mission specialist, participates in the mission's third planned session of extravehicular activity (EVA)]]

Sunita Williams began her Astronaut Candidate training at the [[Johnson Space Center]] in August 1998.Following are the space mission undertaken by Sunita Williams&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;

===STS-116===
Williams was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) with [[STS-116]], aboard the Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']], on December 9, 2006, to join the [[Expedition 14]] crew. In April 2007, the Russian members of the crew rotated, changing to [[Expedition 15|Expedition]] .

===Expeditions 14 and 15===
[[File:ISS-14 Williams Marathon.jpg|thumb|250px|Williams became the first person to run a [[marathon]] from the space station on April 16, 2007]]
After launching aboard the Shuttle ''Discovery'', Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to [[Locks of Love]]. Fellow astronaut [[Joan Higginbotham]] cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was brought back to Earth by the [[STS-116]] crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-121906a.html |publisher=CollectSpace.com |author=CollectSpace.com |title=Astronaut cuts her hair in space for charity |date=2006-12-20 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams performed her first [[extra-vehicular activity]] on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with [[Michael López-Alegría]]. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the attaching device failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adorama.com/catalog.tpl?op=NewsDesk_Internal&amp;article_num=122206-1 |title=Astronaut's Camera is Lost In Space |publisher=Adoama.com |date=2006-12-22 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075451/http://www.adorama.com/catalog.tpl?op=NewsDesk_Internal&amp;article_num=122206-1 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astronauts Joan Higgrtdy work the controls of the [[Canadarm2]] in the [[International Space Station]]'s [[Destiny laboratory]]]]

On the third spacewalk, Williams was outside the station for 6 hours and 40 minutes to complete three spacewalks in nine days. She has logged 29 hours and 17 minutes in four spacewalks, eclipsing the record held by [[Kathryn C. Thornton]] for most spacewalk time by a woman.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;&lt;ref Name=Malik /&gt; On December 18, 2007, during the fourth [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] of [[Expedition 16]], [[Peggy Whitson]] surpassed Williams, with a cumulative EVA time of 32 hours, 36 minutes.&lt;ref name="records4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-121807a.html |title=Astronauts make 100th station spacewalk |access-date=December 18, 2007 |publisher=CollectSpace |year=2007 |author=CollectSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evarecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition16/exp16_eva_121807.html |title=Spacewalkers Find No Solar Wing Smoking Gun |access-date=December 18, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 2007, she received a tube of [[wasabi]] in a [[Progress spacecraft]] resupply mission in response to her request for more spicy food. When she opened the tube, which was packaged at one atmospheric pressure, the gel-like paste was forced out in the lower pressure of the ISS. In the free-fall environment, the spicy geyser was difficult to contain.&lt;ref name="spacestation"&gt;{{cite web |author=Schneider, Mike |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17421176/ |title=Space station suffers |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2007-03-02 |access-date=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2007, NASA decided to bring Williams back to Earth on the [[STS-117]] mission aboard [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. She did not break the U.S. single spaceflight record that was recently broken by former crew member Commander [[Michael López-Alegría]], but did break the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman.&lt;ref name="bio1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/?artid=7183 |title=Ham-astronauts setting records in space |publisher=Amateur Radio News |author=Amateur Radio News |date=2007-02-05 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17821426/ |title=Astronaut stuck in space&amp;nbsp;— for now |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |year=2007 |author=Mike Schneider for [[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams served as a mission specialist and returned to Earth on June 22, 2007, at the end of the STS-117 mission. Poor weather at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Cape Canaveral]] forced mission managers to skip three landing attempts there over previous 24 hours. They then diverted ''Atlantis'' to [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]], where the shuttle touched down at 3:49&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]], returning Williams home after a record 192-day stay in space.

===First marathon in space===

On April 16, 2007, she ran the first marathon by any person in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/exp14_boston_marathon.html |title=Race From Space Coincides with Race on Earth |author=Eldora Valentine |publisher=NASA |date=2007-04-06 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was listed as an entrant for the 2007 [[Boston Marathon]], and completed the distance in four hours and 24 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher=Zee News Limited |url=http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=366217&amp;ssid=27&amp;sid=ENV |title=Sunita Williams Runs Marathon in Space |date=2007-04-17 |access-date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="marathon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17862610/ |title=Astronaut to run Boston Marathon&amp;nbsp;— in space |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |year=2007 |author=Jimmy Golen for [[The Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2007/H07-078.html |title=NASA Astronaut to Run Boston Marathon in Space |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=NASA |year=2007 |author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other crew members cheered her on and gave her oranges during the race. Williams' sister, Dina Pandya, and fellow astronaut [[Karen L. Nyberg]] ran the marathon on Earth, and Williams received updates on their progress from Mission Control. In 2008, Williams participated in the Boston Marathon again, this time on Earth.

===Expeditions 32 and 33===
[[File:Expedition 32 Flight Engineer Sunita Williams exercises on COLBERT.jpg|thumb|250px|Williams exercises on [[Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization|COLBERT]] during ISS Expedition 32]]
[[File:ISS-32 American EVA b6 Sunita Williams.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunita Williams, Expedition 32 flight engineer, appears to touch the bright sun during a spacewalk conducted on September 5, 2012.]]

Williams launched from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] on July 15, 2012, as part of [[Expedition 32]]/[[Expedition 33|33]]. Her Russian spacecraft [[Soyuz TMA-05M]] docked with the ISS for a four-month stay at the orbiting outpost on July 17, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/sunita-williams-spacecraft-docks-with-iss/articleshow/15015460.cms |title=Sunita Williams' spacecraft docks with ISS |date=July 17, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The docking of the Soyuz occurred at 4:51 GMT as the ISS flew over [[Kazakhstan]] at an altitude of 252 miles. The hatchway between the Soyuz spacecraft and the ISS was opened at 7:23 GMT and Williams floated into the ISS to begin her duties as a member of the Expedition 32 crew. She was accompanied on the Soyuz TMA-05M spacecraft by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) astronaut [[Aki Hoshide]] and Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Malenchenko]]. Williams served as commander of the ISS during her stay onboard ISS Expedition 33, succeeding [[Gennady Padalka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-17/science/33901492_1_commander-gennady-padalka-joe-acaba-sergei-revin |title=Sunita Williams takes over command at International Space Station |date=2012-09-17 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the commander of the [[International Space Station]] on September 17, 2012, being only the second woman to achieve the feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/indianamerican-astronaut-sunita-williams-takes-over-command-at-space-station/1003686/ |title=Indian-American astronaut Sunita williams takes over command at space station |publisher=Indian Express |date= |access-date=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2012, she became the first person to do a triathlon in space, which coincided with the Nautica Malibu Triathlon held in Southern [[California]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/17643-space-triathlon-astronaut-sunita-williams.html|title=Space triathlon with Sunita}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used the [[International Space Station]]'s own treadmill and stationary bike, and for the swimming portion of the race, she used the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) to do weightlifting and resistance exercises that approximate swimming in microgravity. After 'swimming' half a mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km), 'biking' 18 miles (29&amp;nbsp;km), and 'running' 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km), Williams finished with a time of one hour, 48 minutes and 33 seconds, as she reported.&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt;

She returned to earth with fellow astronauts Flight Engineers [[Yuri Malenchenko]] and [[Aki Hoshide]] on November 19, 2012, touching down in the town of [[Arkalyk, Kazakhstan]]. Helicopters joined the search-and-recovery crew to assist them, as their capsule parachuted down some {{convert|35|km}} from the planned touchdown site due to a procedural delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/sunita-williams-returns-to-earth/1/229750 |title=Sunita Williams returns to Earth after 4 months in space |author=[[Staff writer]] |work=India Today |date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-walks===
{{As of|2012|8}}, Williams has made seven spacewalks totaling 50 hours and 40 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition32/exp32_eva3.html |title=Williams, Hoshide Complete MBSU Installation |author=NASA |publisher=nasa.gov |date=September 6, 2012 |access-date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting Williams in No. 9 on the [[List of cumulative spacewalk records|list of most experienced spacewalkers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/station/exp33/121101eva/ |title=Astronauts bypass station cooling system on spacewalk |author=William Harwood |date=November 1, 2012 |access-date=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2012, Williams and JAXA astronaut Hoshide ventured outside the ISS to conduct US EVA-18. They removed and replaced the failing Main Bus Switching Unit-1 (MBSU-1), and installed a thermal cover onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/07/soyuz-tma-05m-launch-trio-international-space-station/ |title=Soyuz TMA-05M launches trio to the International Space Station |publisher=NASAspaceflight.com |author=Pete Harding, Chris Bergin and William Graham |date=July 14, 2012 |access-date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial Crew program===
In July 2015, NASA announced Williams as one of the first astronauts for [[Commercial Crew Development|U.S. Commercial spaceflights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-astronauts-for-first-us-commercial-spaceflights-0 | title=NASA Selects Astronauts for First U.S. Commercial Spaceflights | author=NASA| publisher=nasa.gov|date=July 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, she has started working with [[Boeing]] and [[SpaceX]] to train in their commercial crew vehicles, along with other chosen astronauts. In August 2018 she was assigned to the first mission flight, [[CTS-1]], to the [[International Space Station]] of the Boeing [[CST-100 Starliner]].&lt;ref name=nasacc_crew&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-assigns-crews-to-first-test-flights-missions-on-commercial-spacecraft |title=NASA Assigns Crews to First Test Flights, Missions on Commercial Spacecraft |date=August 3, 2018 |access-date=August 4, 2018 |website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was a member of [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]].

Williams is married to Michael J. Williams, a [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|Federal police officer]] in [[Oregon]]. The two have been married for more than 20 years, and both flew [[helicopter]]s in the early days of their careers. She had a pet [[Jack Russell Terrier]] named Gorby (deceased) who was featured with her on the ''[[Dog Whisperer]]'' television show on the [[National Geographic Channel]] on November 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/dog-whisperer/4533/Overview Dog Whisperer: Astronaut Dogs &amp; Mongo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155714/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/dog-whisperer/4533/Overview |date=July 14, 2011 }}, National Geographic Channel, November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Williams expressed a desire to adopt a girl from [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/ahmedabad/32440687_1_sunita-williams-deepak-pandya-girl-child-campaign |title=Astronaut Sunita Williams to adopt Gujarati girl |date=June 27, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, Williams visited India. She went to the [[Sabarmati Ashram]] and her ancestral village [[Jhulasan]] in [[Gujarat]]. She was awarded the [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] Vishwa Pratibha Award by the World Gujarati Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/sunita-gets-vishwa-pratibha-award/219791/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130122173955/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/sunita-gets-vishwa-pratibha-award/219791/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-22 |title=Sunita Williams |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|person of Indian descent]] who was not an Indian citizen to be presented the award.

==Plot==
The film starts with a shabby old man living as a recluse near a famous temple.  When he ventures out into the village, he is beaten by the shepherds who believe that he is a thief. When they hand him over to the police, the officer in charge identifies him as a once-famous musician, Anantha Rama Sharma ([[Mammooty]]), hailed as Sangeeta Samrat (Emperor of music), who has been missing for four years. The inspector RadhaKrishna ([[Achyuth]]) informs his aunt ([[Jayanthi (actress)|Jayanthi]]), who teaches music in his native village, of this and the past of Anantha Sharma is narrated through flashback.

; Flashback begins
Anantha Rama Sharma is a widely respected Carnatic singer with a big ego. This is established when he rejects the ''[[Padma Shri]]'' bestowed upon him by the Government of India, as he believes that the other awardees are not worthy to be mentioned alongside him.

Gangadhar ([[Master Manjunath]]) lives in the same village. He rejects the society's norms (taking music classes and going to school) and spends his time sitting by the riverside. The river inspires him to sing many songs in different tunes. His music teacher, also the policeman's aunt, recognizes his talent and tries to nurture it. His school teacher (the music teacher's brother) is also fond of Gangadhar.

Gangadhar wants to become a great singer, like Ananta Sharma, and his father ([[Dharmavarapu Subrahmanyam]]) encourages him. His day comes when Anantha Sharma is honored in an auditorium. Gangadhar sings a song ("Aanathi Neeyara") in honor of Anantha Sharma, which many consider to be much better than any of Anantha Sharma's works. The boy is hailed as a child prodigy by everyone including Anantha Sharma's wife.

Anantha Sharma wants to imprison Gangadhar's talents. So he asks Gangadhar to stay in his house and learn music as one must be well-experienced to sing on stage. Anantha Sharma goes to the extent of copying one of Gangadhar's tunes and singing it on stage to win back his glory. But Gangadhar and Ananta's wife find this out. He now feels guilty and defends himself by saying that he did it as he was afraid this child would destroy his name and fame.

In this emotional moment, he suffers a heart-attack. To show his gratitude towards his adopted mother, Gangadhar kills himself so that there is no competition for Anantha Sharma. The incident shocks the villagers and they call Anantha Sharma a murderer. To escape their wrath and insults, he runs away and becomes a recluse.
;Flashback ends

Ananta Sharma is still unconscious while in the police station. When he awakes, he finds himself in the house of Gangadhar's music teacher. The music teacher's husband tells him that they have forgiven him and asks him to return to his house. At his house, he finds his wife giving music classes (an institute named "Gangadhar Music Academy") for young children.

He sits down amongst the children learning the music basics from his wife. The movie ends with a scene when a young girl next to him chides him gently by correcting his way of singing a basic song note.

The '''Sydney Opera House''' is a multi-venue [[Performing arts center|performing arts centre]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/sydney-opera-house/values|title=World Heritage Places – The Sydney Opera House – World Heritage values|last=Environment|first=Department of the|date=23 April 2008|website=www.environment.gov.au|language=en|access-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510212625/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/sydney-opera-house/values|archive-date=10 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by Danish architect [[Jørn Utzon]], the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973&lt;ref name="opened"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sydney Opera House history |publisher=Sydney Opera House Official Site |url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/house_history/1973_1981.aspx |access-date=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020095748/http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/house_history/1973_1981.aspx |archive-date=20 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The [[Government of New South Wales]], led by the [[Premier of New South Wales|premier]], [[Joseph Cahill]], authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Laureate|url=http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2003/bio|website=The Pritzker Architecture Prize|publisher=The Hyatt Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104832/http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2003/bio|archive-date=22 December 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building and its [[wikt:surrounds|surrounds]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this word without first discussing it on the article's talk page. --&gt; occupy the whole of [[Bennelong Point]] on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], between [[Sydney Cove]] and [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]], adjacent to the [[Sydney central business district]] and the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]], and close by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].

Though its name suggests a single venue, the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title = Sydney Opera House 2015 Annual Report – Performing Arts  |url = http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/uploadedFiles/About_Us_(new_nav)/Sydney_Opera_House/Annual_Report/Sydney%20Opera%20House%20Annual%20Report%20-%202014-2015%20-%20Performing%20Arts.pdf  |accessdate = 19 December 2015  }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: [[Opera Australia]], the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] and the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]]. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, more than eight million people visit the site annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do you value an icon?

On 28 June 2007, the Sydney Opera House became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Braithwaite |first=David |title=Opera House wins top status |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=28 June 2007 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/opera-house-wins-top-status/2007/06/28/1182624058781.html |accessdate=28 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701043939/http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/opera-house-wins-top-status/2007/06/28/1182624058781.html |archive-date=1 July 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; having been listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]] since 1980, the [[National Trust of Australia]] register since 1983, the [[City of Sydney]] Heritage Inventory since 2000, the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] since 2003, and the [[Australian National Heritage List]] since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5054880|Sydney Opera House|hr=01685|fn=H99/00168, H05/00022|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Opera House, 2 Circular Quay East, Sydney, NSW, Australia |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=place_name%3Dsydney%2520opera%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=105738 |work=[[Australian Heritage Database]] |publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy, [[Australian Government]] |accessdate=21 September 2017 |date=12 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The facility features a modern [[expressionist architecture|expressionist design]], with a series of large precast concrete "shells",&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis.html Shells of the Sydney Opera House], The Royal Society of New South Wales {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211933/http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each composed of sections of a [[sphere]]  of {{convert|75.2|m|ftin|1}} radius,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis_2.html "Roof Cladding of the Sydney Opera House", Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, Volume 106 Parts 1 and 2, pp. 18–32, issued 21 November 1973 (Note: The paper is contradictory, giving both radius and diameter as over 246 ft. It is unlikely to be the diameter as the building's height of 213 ft makes that illogical.)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927212007/http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis_2.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|1}} of land and is {{convert|183|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|120|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as {{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level.

Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as "shells" (as in this article), they are [[precast concrete]] panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream.  The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company [[Höganäs AB]] which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at [[Tarana, New South Wales|Tarana]]. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, [[Schizomeria ovata|Australian white birch]] [[plywood]] supplied from [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]] in northern New South Wales, and [[brush box]] [[glulam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.

===Performance venues and facilities===

==Construction history==

===Origins===
[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumbnail|Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s (top left-hand side of photograph)]]
[[File:Sydney Opera House - construction - phase 2 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Construction progress in 1966]]
Planning began in the late 1940s, when [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]], the Director of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|NSW State Conservatorium of Music]], lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the [[Sydney Town Hall]], was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] [[Joseph Cahill]], who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard Railway Station]] in the northwest of the [[Sydney central business district|CBD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |title=Sydney Architecture Images- Sydney Opera House |publisher=Sydneyarchitecture.com |accessdate=9 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224195120/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |archive-date=24 December 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The winner, announced in 1957, was [[Jørn Utzon]], a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish-American architect [[Eero Saarinen]] from a final cut of 30 "rejects". The runner-up was an entry by firm [[GBQC]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

===Design and construction===
The [[Fort Macquarie Tram Depot]], occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967–1973) interior design and construction.

====Stage I: Podium====
Stage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm [[Civil &amp; Civic]], monitored by the engineers [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup and Partners]].&lt;ref name=sa&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm Sydney Architecture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010222/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,&lt;ref name=sa/&gt; mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.&lt;ref name="PMurray"&gt;{{cite book

====Stage II: Roof====

[[File:Sydney Opera House construction 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Construction progress in 1968]]
The [[Thin-shell structure|shells]] of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Arup, Ove and Zunz, G.J.: Article in ''Structural Engineer'' Volume 47, March 1969&lt;/ref&gt; but, early in the design process, the "shells" were perceived as a series of [[parabola]]s supported by [[precast concrete]] ribs. However, engineers [[Arup Group|Ove Arup and Partners]] were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The [[formwork]] for using ''[[in-situ]]'' concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.

[[File:AUS NSW Opera House DSC05118.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Opera House shell ribs]]
[[File:Sydney Opera House Ceramic Tile Pattern.jpg|thumb|right|The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House]]
From 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and [[ellipsoids]]) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in [[structural analysis]], to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.&lt;ref name="PJones"&gt;Jones, Peter: ''Ove Arup: Masterbuilder of the Twentieth Century''. Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: "Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that "the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise [[Eureka effect|''eureka'' moment]] ... ; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house."

He goes on to claim that "the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres."&lt;ref name="PJones" /&gt; Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, ''Utzon's Sphere''.&lt;ref name="sphere"&gt;{{cite web| author=Bentley, Paul| date=September 2001| title=A Matter of Integrity – A Review of Yuzo Mikami's ''Utzon's Sphere''| publisher=The Wolanski Foundation| url=http://www.twf.org.au/research/mikami.html| accessdate=30 January 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102161608/http://www.twf.org.au/research/mikami.html| archive-date=2 January 2007| dead-url=no| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikami, Yuzo: ''Utzon's Sphere'', Tokyo: Shoku Kusha. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.&lt;ref name="findarticles"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hunt, Tony |date=October 2001 |title=Utzon's Sphere: Sydney Opera House—How It Was Designed and Built—Review |publisher=EMAP Architecture, Gale Group |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1256_210/ai_79759827 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219120138/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1256_210/ai_79759827 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=30 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Peter Murray (architectural writer)|Peter Murray]] states in ''The Saga of the Sydney Opera House'':&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt;

{{quote|... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.}}

The design of the roof was tested on scale models in [[wind tunnel]]s at [[University of Southampton]] and later [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/mob/collection/database/?irn=12041&amp;img=7593 |title=Model of Sydney Opera House, 1960 |work=Powerhouse Museum – Collection Database |year=2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212436/http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/mob/collection/database/?irn=12041&amp;img=7593 |archive-date=6 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/content/conWebDoc/8580 |title=Building the Sydney Opera House |work=npl.co.uk |year=2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506200203/http://www.npl.co.uk/content/conWebDoc/8580 |archive-date=6 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shells were constructed by [[Bilfinger Berger|Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/$FILE/bb_historie_en.html |title=Bilfinger Berger corporate history |publisher=Bilfingerberger.com |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324054618/http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/%24FILE/bb_historie_en.html |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt; The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed "erection arch" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.

====Stage III: Interiors====

Stage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new [[Robert Askin]] government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/About/The_Architect.aspx|title=Sydney Opera House – the Architect – Sydney Opera House|website=www.sydneyoperahouse.com|access-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513175048/http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/the_architect.aspx|archive-date=13 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).

The cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm Sydney Architecture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010222/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; less than a quarter of the final $102&amp;nbsp;million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.

The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.

Following Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the [[brief (architecture)|brief]] would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the "shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;page203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant changes to Utzon's design===

[[File:Sydney Opera House at Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Opera House at sunset]]
* The major hall, which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre "in the round". These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio respectively. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary ''Autopsy on a Dream'', which "chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Doug: [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/21/autopsy-on-a-dream-unflattering-national-psyche Review of rediscovered Sydney Opera House film ''Autopsy on a Dream''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064511/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/21/autopsy-on-a-dream-unflattering-national-psyche |date=5 March 2016 }} at ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).
* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood [[mullion]]s, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).
* Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient.&lt;ref name="PJones"/&gt; Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Morgan, Joyce |date=November 2006 |title=The phantoms that threaten the Opera House |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-phantoms-that-threaten-the-opera-house/2006/11/10/1162661901377.html |accessdate=13 March 2007 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055723/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-phantoms-that-threaten-the-opera-house/2006/11/10/1162661901377.html |archive-date=16 October 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading to a lack of early reflections onstage—[[perspex]] rings (the "acoustic clouds") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.

"Sam" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:
Stage I: podium Civil &amp; Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.
Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.
Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.
Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m.
Fees and other costs: $16.5m.

The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of [[Australian pound|£]]3,500,000 ($7&amp;nbsp;million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 ([[Australia Day]]).&lt;ref name="PJones"/&gt; In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% [[over budget]] in real terms.

==Utzon and his resignation==
[[File:Sydney Opera House - Dec 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The building illuminated at night]]
Before the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;page174&lt;/ref&gt; Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:

{{quote|The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.}}

For the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.

After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with [[Robert Askin]] becoming [[Premier of New South Wales]], the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a "vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office."&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |author=Farrelly, Elizabeth |author-link=Elizabeth Farrelly |title=High noon at Bennelong Point |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |access-date=3 December 2014 |date=30 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807212144/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |archive-date=7 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His new Minister for Public Works, [[Davis Hughes]], was even less sympathetic. [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:
{{quote|at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;}}
[[File:1 The Opera House in Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|The Opera House seen from the north]]
Differences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for [[procurement]] methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be [[Call for bids|put out to tender]].&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt;

Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;page 191&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, [[Harry Ingham Ashworth]]. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.

Utzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was "probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects"&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;page 209&lt;/ref&gt; and: "The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head."
[[File:Sydney Opera House, botanic gardens 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Opera House, backed by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], from the eastern [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens]]]]

In October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Utzon was at this time working closely with [[Ralph Symonds]], a manufacturer of [[plywood]] based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's "knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy" and that the technical advice was "elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes." Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having "other agendas".&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt; In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |title=High noon at Bennelong Point |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807212144/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |archive-date=7 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: "If you don't do it, I resign." Hughes replied: "I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;page224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sydney Opera House, vivid Sydey.JPG|thumb|right|The Sydney Opera House during [[Vivid Sydney]] (2013).]]
Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as "Malice in Blunderland". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as "design architect" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.

Following the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' initially opined: "No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other." On 17 March 1966, the ''Herald'' offered the view that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;page 228&lt;/ref&gt; "It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along."

The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of [[computer-aided design]] to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of [[Gehry]] and [[blobitecture]], as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use [[araldite]] to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.

It was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, [[Steensen Varming]], was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over {{convert|600000|cuft|m3}} of air per minute,&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Mail, 9 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt; using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.&lt;ref&gt;A. Building a masterpiece 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural design role of Peter Hall==
After the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{RP|45}}

Peter Hall (1931–1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in [[Hellebæk]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ABC, The Opera House Project, online&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1964.

Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.&lt;ref name="webber"&gt;{{cite book |author=Webber, Peter |title=Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House |publisher=The Watermark Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-949284-95-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=46}} Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would "never be his own".&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|42}} In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|53}} Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|49}} With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.

A former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book ''Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House'', concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|126}}

==Opening==
[[File:Tourists and Sydney Opera Hosue.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists observing the Opera House.]]
The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lewis, Wendy |author-link1=Wendy Lewis |author2=Balderstone, Simon |author3=Bowan, John |title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=239–243 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance firsts==
During the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist [[Paul Robeson]] the first artist to perform, in 1960.

Various performances were presented prior to the official opening:
* The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973, played by [[Romola Costantino]] to an invited audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bentley, Paul |url=http://www.twf.org.au/search/sohstory3.html |title=The Wolanski Foundation |publisher=Twf.org.au |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127144413/http://twf.org.au/search/sohstory3.html |archive-date=27 January 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first opera performed was [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]'', in what was then known as the Opera Theatre on 28 September 1973, conducted by the [[Opera Australia|Australian Opera]]'s Music Director, [[Edward Downes]]. (It had been intended that [[Peter Sculthorpe]]'s work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' would have this honour, but it was not ready on time. ''Rites of Passage'' was premiered almost exactly a year later, on 27 September 1974.)
* The first evening performance of an opera was [[Larry Sitsky]]'s ''The Fall of the House of Usher'', conducted by [[Rex Hobcroft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzukimusicwa.com.au/rexhobcroft.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230222722/http://www.suzukimusicwa.com.au/rexhobcroft.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 December 2012 |title=Suzuki Talent Education Association of Australia (WA) Inc |publisher=Suzukimusicwa.com.au |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and paired with ''Dalgerie'' by [[James Penberthy]], to a libretto by [[Mary Durack]]; it took place on 25 July 1973.&lt;ref name="GriffelBlock1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Margaret Ross Griffel]]|author2=Adrienne Fried Block|title=Operas in English: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxIKAQAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-25310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973. It was an all-[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] orchestral concert performed by the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Charles Mackerras]] and with [[Birgit Nilsson]] as the soprano soloist. The first music played was the Prelude to ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

After the opening:
* The first violin and piano recital was given by [[Wanda Wiłkomirska]], with pianist [[Geoffrey Parsons (pianist)|Geoffrey Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sigridharris.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/interview-with-a-famous-violinist-wanda-wilkomirska/ |title=Interview with Wanda Wilkomirska |publisher=Sigridharris.wordpress.com |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108092908/http://sigridharris.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/interview-with-a-famous-violinist-wanda-wilkomirska/ |archive-date=8 November 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment==
In the late 1990s, the [[Sydney Opera House Trust]] resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Sydney Opera House Media Release | date=August 1999 | title=Utzon Appointment: 'Reunites The Man and his Masterpiece' | url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/sections/media_room/media_releases/press_release.asp?idPressRelease=15&amp;sm=5&amp;ss=19 | accessdate=13 March 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118233459/https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/sections/media_room/media_releases/press_release.asp?idPressRelease=15&amp;sm=5&amp;ss=19 | archive-date=18 November 2006 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AUS NSW Opera House DSC05119.jpg|thumb|left|The Utzon Room: rebuilt to a design (and endowed with an original tapestry) by Utzon]]
In 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened, and renamed "The Utzon Room" in his honour. It contains an original Utzon [[tapestry]] (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called ''Homage to [[Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chiefengineer.org |title=The Sydney Opera House |url=http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/1823.htm |accessdate=13 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208055435/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/1823.htm |archivedate=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Matthew | last=Benns | title=Utzon wants to tear up floor of the Opera House | date=8 April 2007 | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/utzon-wants-to-tear-up-floor-of-the-opera-house/2007/04/07/1175366528643.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=12 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428162235/http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/utzon-wants-to-tear-up-floor-of-the-opera-house/2007/04/07/1175366528643.html | archive-date=28 April 2007 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Utzon died on 29 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2008/11/29/sydney-opera-house-designer-joern-utzon-dies-at-90/|title=Sydney Opera House designer Joern Utzon dies at 90|date=29 November 2008|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2016-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024153619/http://www.mercurynews.com/2008/11/29/sydney-opera-house-designer-joern-utzon-dies-at-90/|archive-date=24 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.

Refurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son [[Jan Utzon|Jan]], the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with [[Baby transport|prams]]. The prominent [[Paralympic Games|paralympian]] athlete [[Louise Sauvage]] was announced as the building's "accessibility ambassador" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/uploadedFiles/accessplan.pdf Sydney Opera House: Access Strategic Plan, 2013–2015]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2016, an original 1959 [[tapestry]] by [[Le Corbusier]] (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called ''Les Dés Sont Jetés'' (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled ''in situ'' after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.

In the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.

==Public and commemorative events==
In 1993, [[Constantine Koukias]] was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose ''Icon'', a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AusStage|url=http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/18737|website=www.ausstage.edu.au|access-date=29 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805013606/http://ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/18737|archive-date=5 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], the venue served as the focal point for the [[Triathlon at the 2000 Summer Olympics|triathlon]] events. The event had a {{Convert|1.5|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanical Gardens]] for the cycling and running portions of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.olympics.com/eng/ |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, a group of residents from the nearby [[Bennelong Apartments]] (better known as 'The [[Bennelong Apartments|Toaster]]'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/music/noise-fine-toaster-folks-first-win-over-opera-house-concerts/news-story/91362db275f0485a9ba4475525099de8|title=Noise fine: Toaster folks’ first win over Opera House concerts|first=Michaela|last=Boland|publisher=[[The Australian]]|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4625239.htm|title=Sydney Opera House fined $15,000 following 'Toaster' noise complaints|first=Al|last=Newstead|publisher=[[TripleJ]]|date=23 February 2017|accessdate=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617234407/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4625239.htm|archive-date=17 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work was at one time attributed to [[Joseph Haydn]], the third work in [[B-flat major]] so attributed.

The score is unusual for a number of reasons: the second movement contains an extended concerto-like solo for bassoon, and is subtitled "Concertino per il Fagotto”.  In addition to the normal complement of [[String section|strings]], two [[oboe]]s and two [[bassoon]]s, it calls for four 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s.  The third movement is, atypically, a [[Menuetto|minuet]] and trio, and in the subdominant [[E-flat major]] instead of the home key.

It is in three movements:

#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro molto]]
#[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Adagio ma non troppo]] ("Concertino per il Fagotto”),
#[[Menuetto]] e Trio

N.B. The recording on Olympia OCD 404 claiming to be of this Symphony is in fact that of P.9 Symphony 11.

'''The Grand''' (previously '''The Grand Theatre''') is a [[Grade II* listed buildings in London|Grade II]] [[listed building]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/1978-clapham-grand|title=Clapham Grand|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Theatres Trust|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on St Johns Hill, Clapham Junction. It was designed by Earnest Woodrow&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/1978-clapham-grand|title=Clapham Grand – The Theatres Trust|website=www.theatrestrust.org.uk|accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first opened in 1900 as '''The New Grand Theatre of Varieties'''.

The theatre was built for a consortium which was led by the well-known music hall artistes [[Dan Leno]], [[Herbert Campbell]], [[Harry Randall (actor)|Harry Randall]], and Fred Williams. Today, it is a nightclub, live music venue, theatre and event space.

==History==
The venue opened on Monday 26 November 1900 as "The New Grand Theatre of Varieties", with a [[music hall]] production featuring many well-known artistes of the time. When the theatre opened it had a capacity of 3,000 and a stage {{convert|68|by|28|ft}}.

The Grand continued to be a successful Music Hall and Variety venue for 40 years. In 1927, the theatre was fitted for cinema use and was known as The Grand Theatre, as it still mainly staged variety shows. From 8 May 1950, The Grand went on to become a full-time cinema after it was purchased by the Essoldo Cinema chain and was renamed Essoldo Cinema. The Essoldo Cinema closed on 31 August 1963 and became the Essoldo Bingo Club on 11 October 1963 which was later taken over by [[Classic Cinemas]] who renamed it Vogue Bingo Club. During this time, they built a false ceiling, cutting off the upper parts of the theatre. From 1972 until 1979, [[The Rank Group|Mecca Bingo]] took over as the final bingo operator.

[[File:Grand Theatre, Clapham 06.JPG|thumb|Building entrance]]
The building remained closed until 1989 when it was bought by The [[Mean Fiddler Music Group|Mean Fiddler]] group to be transformed into a live music venue. Due to licensing issues the venue did not open until 17 December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/57/clapham/grand.html|title=Clapham Grand PH – no thanks|website=www.ihbc.org.uk|accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 10-year closure, the false ceiling was removed and the building was restored and redecorated. Mean Fiddler closed on 20 July 1997 after being mostly unsuccessful as a music venue and was then purchased by pub chain [[Wetherspoons|J.D.Wetherspoon]]. J.D.Wetherspoon were refused a license after a public enquiry but refused to sell the property when actors [[Corin Redgrave|Colin]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] put forward plans to restore the building back to its original use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihbc.org.uk/context_archive/57/clapham/grand.html|title=Clapham Grand PH – no thanks|website=www.ihbc.org.uk|accessdate=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand is now an independently run venue which functions as a nightclub, live music venue, theatre and event space. Some of the acts to have performed at The Grand in recent years include; [[The Kinks]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[The Temptations]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen|Echo and the Bunnymen]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Jamiroquai]], [[Chip (rapper)|Chipmunk]], [[Paul Weller]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[The Verve]] and [[Jamie Cullum]], [[The Jam]] and [[Brian May]]. It was also used as the studio location for the TV show [[Taskmaster (TV_series)|Taskmaster]].
