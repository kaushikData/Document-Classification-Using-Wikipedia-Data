[[File:Acharya_KundaKunda.jpg|thumb|Image of ''Āchārya Kundakunda'' (author of [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Niyamasara]])]]
{{Jainism}}
'''''Āchārya''''' ({{IAST|Ācārya}}) means the Head of an order of ascetics. Some of the famous achāryas are [[Bhadrabahu]], [[Kundakunda]], [[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]], [[Umaswami]].

In [[Digambara]] Jainism, ''Āchārya'' has thirty-six primary attributes (''mūla guṇa'') consisting in:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=189-191}}
*Twelve kinds of austerities (''tapas'');
*Ten virtues (''dasa-lakṣaṇa dharma'');
*Five kinds of observances in regard to faith, knowledge, conduct, austerities, and power.
*Six essential duties (''Ṣadāvaśyaka''); and
*''Gupti''- Controlling the threefold activity of:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=125}}
**the body;
**the organ of speech; and
**the mind.

According to Jain text, ''[[Dravyasamgraha]]'', {{quote|Those who themselves practise the five-fold observances in regard to faith (''darśanācāra''), knowledge (''jñānācāra''), power (''vīryācāra''), conduct (''cāritrācāra''), and austerities (''tapācāra''), and guide disciples to follow these observances, are the Chief Preceptors (''Ācāryas''), worthy of meditation.” (52)|Dravyasamgraha (52){{sfn|Jain|2013|p=189}}}}

== Mūla Guṇa ==

===Twelve kinds of austerities (''tapas'')===
;External austerities 
The external austerities (''bāhya tapas'') are fasting (''anaśana''), reduced diet (''avamaudarya''), special restrictions for begging food (''vrttiparisamkhyāna''), giving up stimulating and delicious dishes (''rasaparityāga''), lonely habitation (''viviktaśayyāsana''), and mortification of the body (''kāyakleśa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Umasvami's Tattvārthsūtra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLmx9bvtglkC|year=2011|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-2-1|quote=Non-Copyright|p=133-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Internal austerities
Expiation (''prāyaścitta''), reverence (''vinaya''), service (''vaiyāvrttya''), study (''svādhyāya''), renunciation (''vyutsarga''), and meditation (''dhyāna'') are the internal austerities (''antarañg tapas'').

''Acharya [[Pujyapada]]'''s ''Sarvārthasiddhi'':{{quote|How are these internal? These are internal as the mind is restrained or subdued in these cases. The removal of sins committed by negligence or under the influence of passions is expiation. Reverence to the holy personages is ‘''vinaya''’. Service is the help rendered to the saints in difficulty by bodily activity or with things. Contemplation of knowledge or giving up sloth or idleness is study. The giving up of the attitude of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is renunciation. Checking the ramblings of the mind is meditation.{{sfn|Jain|1992|p=263}}}}

===  Five kinds of observances ===
Five kinds of observances in regard to faith, knowledge, conduct, austerities, and power. These are:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=190}}
#''Darśanācāra''- Believing that the pure Self is the only object belonging to the self and all other objects, including the karmic matter (''dravya karma'' and ''no-karma'') are alien; further, believing in the six substances (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravyas]]''), seven Realities (''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]]'') and veneration of [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]], Teachers, and the Scripture, is the observance in regard to faith (''darśanā'').
#''Jñānācāra''- Reckoning that the pure Self has no delusion, is distinct from attachment and aversion, knowledge itself, and sticking to this notion always is the observance in regard to knowledge (''jñānā'').
#''Cāritrācāra''- Being free from attachment etc. is right conduct which gets obstructed by passions. In view of this, getting always engrossed in the pure Self, free from all corrupting dispositions, is the observance in regard to conduct (''cāritrā'').
#''Tapācāra''- Performance of different kinds of austerities is essential to spiritual advancement. Performance of penances with due control of senses and desires constitutes the observance in regard to austerities (''tapā'').
#''Vīryācāra''- Carrying out the above mentioned four observances with full vigour and intensity, without digression and concealment of true strength, constitutes the observance in regard to power (''vīryā'').

=== Six essential duties ===

Six essential duties (''Şadāvaśyaka'') of the ''Ācārya'' are:{{sfn|Jain|2013|p=190-191}}

#''samatā'' (''[[sāmāyika]]'') – Equanimity; the state of being without inclination or aversion towards birth or death, gain or loss, glee or pain, friend or foe, etc.
#''vandanā'' – Adoration, salutation; of particular [[Tirthankara|Tīrthañkara]], or Supreme Being (Parameşthī).
#''stavan'' – Worshipping; making obeisance to the twenty-four ''Tīrthañkaras'' or the five Supreme Beings (''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi|Pañca Parameşthī]]'').
#''pratikramaṇa'' – Self-censure, repentance; to drive oneself away from the multitude of karmas, virtuous or wicked, done in the past.
#''kāyotsarga'' – Non-attachment to the body; contemplating on the pure Self, thereby disregarding the body.
#''svādhyāya'' – Contemplation of knowledge; study of the Scripture, teaching, questioning, reflection, reciting, and preaching.

An '''apsara''', also spelled as '''apsaras''' by the Oxford Dictionary (respective plurals '''apsaras''' and '''apsarases'''), is a female spirit of the clouds and waters in [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Culture of Buddhism|Buddhist culture]]. They figure prominently in the sculpture, dance, literature and painting of many [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/apsara&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are two types of apsaras; laukika (worldly), of whom thirty-four are specified, and daivika (divine), of which there are ten.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2018}} [[Urvasi]], [[Menaka]], [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]], [[Tilottama]] and [[Ghritachi]] are the most famous among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 68|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apsarās'' are known as ''vidhya dhari'' or ''tep apsar'' (ទេពអប្សរ) in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], ''accharā'' ([[Pāli]]) or ''a bố sa la tư'' ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), ''bidadari'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]]), ''biraddali''  ([[Tausūg language|Tausug]]), ''hapsari/apsari'' or ''widadari/widyadari'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]) and ''aapson'' ({{lang-th |อัปสร}}). English translations of the word "apsara" include "[[nymph]]", "[[fairy]]", "celestial nymph", and "celestial maiden".

In [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]], apsaras are beautiful, supernatural female beings. They are youthful and elegant, and superb in the art of dancing. They are often wives of the [[Gandharva]]s, the court musicians of [[Indra]]. They dance to the music made by the Gandharvas, usually in the palaces of the gods, entertain and sometimes seduce gods and men. As ethereal beings who inhabit the skies, and are often depicted taking [[flight]], or at service of a god, they may be compared to [[angel]]s.

Apsaras are said to be able to change their shape at will, and rule over the [[luck|fortunes]] of gaming and gambling.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Apsaras|volume=2|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apsaras are sometimes compared to the [[muses]] of ancient Greece, with each of the 26 Apsaras at Indra's court representing a distinct aspect of the performing arts. They are associated with [[fertility rite]]s. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] also states that the apsaras were born from [[Kashyapa]] and [[Muni (Hinduism)|Muni]].

==Etymology==
The origin of 'apsara' is the [[Sanskrit]] अप्सरस् ''apsaras'' (in the stem form, which is the dictionary form). NB The stem form ends in 's' as distinct from, e.g. the nominative singular ''Ramas/Ramaḥ (''the deity Ram in Hindi), whose stem form is ''Rama''. The nominative singular form is अप्सरास् ''apsarās'', or अप्सरा: ''apsarāḥ'' when standing alone, which  becomes अप्सरा ''apsarā'' in Hindi, from which in turn the English 'apsara' presumably is derived, the 'apsaras' form being the Sanskrit dictionary form. Monier-Williams Dictionary gives the etymology as: अप् + √सृ, "going in the waters or between the waters of the clouds".

==Literature and dance==
[[File:13. Khajuraho Devi Jgadambi apsara.jpg|thumb|Apsara, [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Devi Jagadambi temple]] at [[Khajuraho]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]], India.]]

===Rigveda===
The [[Rigveda]] tells of an apsara who is the wife of [[Gandharva]]; however, the Rigveda also seems to allow for the existence of more than one Apsara.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
The only apsara specifically named is [[Urvashi]].  An entire hymn deals with the [[Colloquy (religious)|colloquy]] between Urvashi and her mortal lover [[Pururavas]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rig Veda'', Book X, Hymn 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Hindu scriptures allow for the existence of numerous apsaras, who act as the handmaidens of [[Indra]] or as dancers at his celestial court.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
[[Image:Golden Celestial Nymph of Majapahit.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Golden apsara in [[Majapahit]] style, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

===Mahabharata===
In many of the stories related in the [[Mahabharata]], apsaras appear in important supporting roles.  The epic contains several lists of the principal Apsaras, which lists are not always identical.  Here is one such list, together with a description of how the celestial dancers appeared to the residents and guests at the court of the gods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ghritachi and Menaka and Rambha and Purvachitti and Swayamprabha and Urvashi and Misrakeshi and Dandagauri and Varuthini and Gopali and Sahajanya and Kumbhayoni and Prajagara and Chitrasena and Chitralekha and Saha and Madhuraswana, these and others by thousands, possessed of eyes like lotus leaves, who were employed in enticing the hearts of persons practising rigid austerities, danced there. And possessing slim waists and fair large hips, they began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep bosoms, and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive attitudes capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahabharata'', Book III: ''Vana Parva'', Section 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exploits of individual Apsaras====
[[File:Celestial fairies Apsaras on Hindu Temple at Banares 1913.jpg|thumb|Apsaras on Hindu Temple at [[Varanasi|Banares]], 1913]]
The Mahabharata documents the exploits of individual apsaras, such as [[Tilottama]], who rescued the world from the rampaging [[asura]] brothers [[Sunda (asura)|Sunda]] and [[Upasunda]], and [[Urvashi]], who attempted to seduce the hero [[Arjuna]].

====The Nymph and the Sage====
A story type or theme appearing over and over again in the Mahabharata is that of an Apsara sent to distract a sage or spiritual master from his ascetic practices.  One story embodying this theme is that recounted by the epic heroine [[Shakuntala]] to explain her own parentage.&lt;ref&gt;''Mahabharata'', Book I: ''Adi Parva'', Section 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once upon a time, the sage [[Vishvamitra|Viswamitra]] generated such intense energy by means of his asceticism that [[Indra]] himself became fearful.  Deciding that the sage would have to be distracted from his penances, he sent the apsara [[Menaka]] to work her charms. [[Menaka]] trembled at the thought of angering such a powerful ascetic, but she obeyed the god's order.  As she approached [[Vishvamitra|Viswamitra]], the wind god [[Vayu]] tore away her garments.  Seeing her thus disrobed, the sage abandoned himself to lust.  Nymph and sage engaged in sex for some time, during which Viswamitra's asceticism was put on hold.  As a consequence, Menaka gave birth to a daughter, whom she abandoned on the banks of a river.  That daughter was Shakuntala herself, the narrator of the story.

===Natya Shastra===
[[Natya Shastra]], the principal work of dramatic theory for Sanskrit drama, lists the following apsaras: Manjukesi, Sukesi, Misrakesi, Sulochana, Saudamini, Devadatta, Devasena, Manorama, Sudati, Sundari, Vigagdha, Vividha, Budha, Sumala, Santati, Sunanda, Sumukhi, Magadhi, Arjuni, Sarala, Kerala, [[Dhrti]], Nanda, Supuskala, Supuspamala and Kalabha.

===Cambodian culture===
[[File:Danseuses kmer (2).JPG|thumb|right|320px|[[Khmer classical dance|Khmer]] Apsara dancers]]
Apsaras represent an important motif in the stone [[bas-reliefs]] of the [[Angkor]]ian temples in [[Cambodia]] (8th–13th centuries AD), however all female images are not considered to be apsaras. In harmony with the Indian association of dance with apsaras, Khmer female figures that are dancing or are poised to dance are considered ''apsaras''; female figures, depicted individually or in groups, who are standing still and facing forward in the manner of temple guardians or custodians are called ''[[devata]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bas-reliefs of Angkorian temples has become an inspiration of [[Khmer classical dance]]. An indigenous ballet-like performance art of Cambodia, is frequently called "[[Robam Tep Apsara|Apsara Dance]]". The dance was created by the Royal Ballet of [[Cambodia]] in the mid-20th century under the patronage of Queen [[Sisowath Kossamak]] of Cambodia. The role of the apsara is played by a woman, wearing tight-fitting traditional dress with gilded jewelries and headress modelled after Angkor bas-reliefs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.roughguides.com/website/travel/destination/content/default.aspx?titleid=107&amp;xid=idbox_head33982200_0171&lt;/ref&gt; whose graceful, sinuous gestures are codified to narrate classical myths or religious stories.&lt;ref name=dig&gt;Di Giovine, Michael A. ''The Heritage-Scape''. 2008, page 293-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian and Malay culture===
[[Image:Apsara Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The Apsara of [[Borobudur]], the flying celestial maiden depicted in a bas-relief of the 9th-century Borobudur temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]
In Malay/Indonesian, apsaras are also known as 'bidadari', being conflated with the 'vidyadharis', the females of the vidyādharas, another class of celestial beings In Indian mythology.  'Vidyādhara' literally means 'possessed of science or spells', and refers to 'a kind of supernatural being ... possessed of magical power' or 'fairy' according to Monier-Williams Dictionary.  The bidadaris are heavenly maidens,&lt;ref name="Bidadari"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bidadari | website = KBBI | url = http://kbbi.web.id/bidadari}}&lt;/ref&gt; living in the [[svarga]]loka or in celestial palace of [[Indra]], described in [[Bali]]nese dedari (bidadari or apsara) dance.

Traditionally apsaras are described as celestial maidens living in [[Indra]]'s heaven (Kaéndran).  They are well known for their special task: being sent to earth by Indra to seduce [[ascetics]] who by their severe practices may become more powerful than the gods. This theme occurs frequently in Javanese traditions, including the ''[[Kakawin Arjunawiwaha]]'', written by mpu Kanwa in 1030 during the reign of king [[Airlangga]]. The story tells that [[Arjuna]], in order to defeat the giant Niwatakawaca, engaged in meditation and asceticism, whereupon Indra sent apsaras to seduce him.  Arjuna, however, managed to conquer his lust and then to win the ultimate weapons from the gods to defeat the giant.
[[File:Condong dancer DYK crop.JPG|thumb|left|The Balinese [[Legong]] dance depict celestial maidens, [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].]]
Later in the [[Java]]nese tradition the apsara was also called ''Hapsari'', also known as ''Widodari'' (from [[sanskrit]] word v''idhyadhari'', ''vidhya'': knowledge, ''dharya'': having, bearer, or bringer), and finally known as ''Bidadari'' in the modern [[Indonesian language]]&lt;ref name="Bidadari"/&gt; (the same form of the word is now present in the [[Malay language]], as well). The Javanese Hindu-Buddhist tradition also influenced [[Bali]]. In Balinese dance the theme of celestial maidens often occurred. Dances such as ''Sanghyang Dedari'' and ''[[Legong]]'' depicted divine maidens in their own way. In the court of [[Mataram Sultanate]] the tradition of depicting heavenly maidens in dances still alive and well. The Javanese court dances of [[Bedhaya]] portray apsaras.

However, after the adoption of [[Islam]], bidadari is equated with [[houri]], the heavenly maiden mentioned in the [[Quran]], in which God stated that the 'forbidden pearls' of heaven are for those men who have resisted temptation and borne life's trials. Islam spread in the Malay archipelago when Arabic traders came to trade spices with the Malays; at that time, Hinduism formed the basis of the Malay culture, but [[syncretism]] with the Islamic religion and culture spawned the idea of a Bidadari. It is usually seen as a prized offer to those who lived a lifestyle in service to and pleasing to God; after death, the Bidadari was the man's wife or wives, depending on what type of person he was. The worthiness of a man who was offered Bidadari depended upon his holiness: how often he prayed, how much he turned away from the 'outside world', and how little he heeded worldly desires.

[[File:Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 09.jpg|thumb|right|A male devata flanked by two apsaras, Vishnu temple, [[Prambanan]], Java.]]
Images of apsaras are found in several temples of ancient [[Java]] dating from the era of the [[Sailendra]] dynasty to that of the [[Majapahit]] empire. The apsara celestial maidens might be found as decorative motifs or also as integral parts of a story in bas-relief. Images of apsaras can be found on [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Prambanan]], [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]], and [[Penataran Temple|Penataran]].

At Borobudur apsaras are depicted as divinely beautiful celestial maidens, pictured either in standing or in flying positions, usually holding lotus blossoms, spreading flower petals, or waving celestial clothes as if they were wings enabling them to fly. The temple of [[Mendut]] near Borobudur depicted groups of [[devatas]], divine beings flying in heaven, which included apsaras. In Prambanan temple compound, especially in Vishnu temple, along the gallery, some images of male devata are found flanked by two apsaras.

===Cambodia===
[[File:Angkor SiemReap Cambodia Ankor-Wat-Relief-01.jpg|thumbnail|Depiction of Apsara in Angkor Wat]]
[[Angkor Wat]], the largest Angkorian temple (built AD 1116–1150), features both ''apsaras'' and ''devata'', however the devata type are the most numerous with more than 1,796 in the present research inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ Angkor Wat devata inventory - February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423123631/http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ |date=23 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40&amp;nbsp;cm as seen at left) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110&amp;nbsp;cm) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewelry and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. Some devatas appear with arms around each other and seem to be greeting the viewer. "The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance," wrote Marchal.&lt;ref&gt;Sappho Marchal, ''Khmer Costumes and Ornaments of the Devatas of Angkor Wat''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Champa===
Apsaras were also an important motif in the [[art of Champa]], medieval [[Angkor]]'s neighbor to the east along the coast of what is now central Vietnam.  Especially noteworthy are the depictions of apsaras in the [[Art of Champa#Tra Kieu Style|Tra Kieu Style]] of Cham art, a style which flourished in the 10th and 11th centuries AD.

===China===
Apsaras are often depicted as flying figures in the mural paintings and sculptures of Buddhist cave sites in China such as in the [[Mogao Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and the [[Yungang Grottoes|Yungang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes]].  They may also be depicted as dancers or musicians.  They are referred to as feitian (飞天) in Chinese.

The '''Association for Better Living and Education''' ('''ABLE''') is a [[non-profit]] organization headquartered in [[Los Angeles, California]], established by the [[Church of Scientology]]. It states that it is "dedicated to creating a better future for children and communities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.able.org ABLE website]&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes secular uses of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s works, and has been classified as a "[[Scientology]]-related entity". Founded in 1988, ABLE's main office is located at 7065 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], the former headquarters for the [[Screen Actors Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/hollywood-ups-and-downs/6981/ LA Weekly - News - Hollywood Ups and Downs - Madelynn Amalfitano - The Essential Online Resource for Los Angeles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630082629/http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/hollywood-ups-and-downs/6981/ |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Link/&gt;

==Programs==
ABLE acts as an umbrella organization for four entities:&lt;ref name=Link/&gt;
*[[Applied Scholastics]], educational programs based on [[Study Tech|study technology]]
*[[Criminon]], a rehabilitation program for prisoners
*[[Narconon]], a [[drug rehabilitation]] program
*[[The Way to Happiness]] Foundation, dedicated to disseminating Hubbard's "non-religious moral code", which consists of 21 precepts such as "Don't be promiscuous", "Do not harm a person of good will" and "Respect the religious beliefs of others"

==Criticism==
Although various Scientology groups are registered as legally separate corporations and entities, critics note this has no bearing on whether or not they are controlled by the [[Church of Scientology]]. Studytech.org, a Scientology watchdog site, notes: "Applied Scholastics is indeed a legally separate corporation. However, it has so many ties to the Church of Scientology and its corporate alter ego, the Church of Spiritual Technology, that it cannot be regarded as being anything other than a Scientology subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studytech.org/asi.php Scientology's Education Fronts - Applied Scholastics International] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418072517/http://studytech.org/asi.php |date=April 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanette Asimov, reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', in an article critical of ABLE and Narconon, summed it up this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A popular anti-drug program provided free to schools in San Francisco and elsewhere teaches concepts straight out of the Church of Scientology, including medical theories that some addiction experts described as "irresponsible" and "pseudoscience." As a result, students are being introduced to some beliefs and methods of Scientology without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=Link&gt;{{cite web| author=Nanette  Asimov| title=Scientology link to public schools| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/06/09/MNGO572ISD1.DTL| work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]| date=2004-06-09| accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ABLE and its groups were included in the 1993 closing agreement between the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and the Church of Scientology, and are classified as "Scientology-related entities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Scientology Settles With IRS| date=1997-12-30| newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The first mentions of the religion among Scandinavians happened in the era when Finland was [[Grand Duchy of Finland|politically united]] with the [[Russian Empire]]; the first mention of the [[Báb]], who Bahá'ís view as the herald to the founder of the religion, Bahá'u'lláh, was published in accounts of Persian travels by Scandinavians in 1869, and the first mentions of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] were made in 1896.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;

==Development==
Following this period of largely internal development, the Bahá'í Faith in Finland began to be involved in regional developments. In the 1970s and 80s Finland Bahá'ís helped translate Bahá'í literature into [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 05 | issue = 03 | year = 1993  | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland was among the national communities that responded to a survey on status of women in the community which was tabulated and summarized for the 1974 Statement to the 25th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author-link = Bahá'í International Community | contribution = Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | contribution-url = http://www.bic.org/statements-and-reports/bic-statements/74-0115.htm | title = Item 4 (A) of the provisional agenda: international instruments and national standards relating to the status of women: implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and related instruments | date = 1974-01-14 | place = New York, USA | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | id = BIC Document #74-0115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s in Alaska Angeline Giachery conceived of a plan to spread the religion across the circumpolar area and the idea received attention at the Intercontinental Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1976&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Universal House of Justice | author-link = Universal House of Justice | title = In Memoriam | journal = The Bahá'í World | volume = XVIII | publisher = Bahá'í World Centre | pages = 719 | year = 1986 | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/693-719.html | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also attended by [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Ugo Giachery]].&lt;ref name="1976 Conf"/&gt; Roma Raciulyte became a Bahá'í during a trip to Finland in the 1970s and is generally considered the first Lithuanian Bahá'í in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lietuvos bahajų bendruomenės istorinė apžvalga | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Lithuania | year = 2008 | url = http://bahai.lt/bahajai_Lietuvoje | accessdate = 2011-11-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111123180323/http://bahai.lt/bahajai_Lietuvoje | archive-date = 2011-11-23 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Since the 1980s the Bahá'ís of Finland have greatly diversified their endeavours.

== Early days ==

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ===

`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. Three of the tablets mentioned taking the Bahá'í Faith to Africa, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. These tablets were translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tablet says in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intention of the teacher must be pure, his heart independent, his spirit attracted, his thought at peace, his resolution firm, his magnanimity exalted and in the love of God a shining torch.… Consequently, a number of souls may arise … and hasten to all parts of the world, especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia ….
(and also offers a prayer that begins)
O God, my God! Thou seest how black darkness is enshrouding all regions, how all countries are burning with the flame of dissension, and the fire of war and carnage is blazing throughout the East and the West. Blood is flowing, corpses bestrew the ground, and severed heads are fallen on the dust of the battlefield.
O Lord! Have pity…&lt;ref name="tab1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first specific mention of Rwanda was from a telegram of [[Shoghi Effendi]] in May 1953, while he was head of the religion, in which he is suggesting the expanding community of the [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda]] and other areas look at sending [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to neighboring areas like Ruanda.&lt;ref name="fold" /&gt;

=== Beginnings ===

The first Bahá'í to travel through Rwanda may have been Marthe Molitor c. 1947 after joining the religion in Belgium though she moved on to the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Zaire | work = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url =http://bahai-library.com/asia-pacific/country%20files/zaire.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first settlers of the religion arrived in the region by July&lt;ref name="messg" /&gt; 1953 when Mary and Reginald (Rex) Collison from the United States and Dunduzu Chisiza, a young Bahá'í from [[Bahá'í Faith in Malawi|Malawi]] (then Nyasaland), arrived in Ruanda-Urundi (now the independent countries of Rwanda and Burundi) thus earning the title [[Knights of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="burundi50th"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Spiritual solace in a recovering land | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | pages = | date = 2005-01-02 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first local Bahá'í in Rwanda was Alphonse Semanyenzi.&lt;ref name="rwanda50th" /&gt; By 1963 there were three Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] in Burundi-Ruanda, though the host cities were not specified owing to difficulties of communication with [[Bahá'í administration]].&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt; Prominent early pioneers were Dr. Ataollah Taaid and his wife Zahereh came in 1966.&lt;ref name="rwanda50th" /&gt;

== Growth ==

The regional National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa was established in 1956, with its seat in Kampala, and embraced [[Bahá'í Faith in Uganda|Uganda]], Tanganyika, [[Bahá'í Faith in Kenya|Kenya]], Belgian Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on Central and East Africa | work = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url =http://bahai-library.com/asia-pacific/country%20files/central_and_east_africa.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Enoch Olinga]] represented the [[Universal House of Justice]] for the 1969 election of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Burundi and Rwanda&lt;ref name="xviii"&gt;{{Cite book

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Since the genocide and war, the religion has been involved in resolving tribal tensions based on its teachings of [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|principle of the oneness of humanity]]. In March 2000, the national assembly of Rwanda released a statement addressed to the National Commission for Unity and Reconciliation&lt;!-- not the Gacaca court, btw - see[http://www.ssrc.org/gsc/newsletter3/sebarenzi.htm] --&gt;, in which the Bahá'ís urged that consideration be given to making the principle of the oneness of humanity the basis for reconciliation in the country.&lt;ref name="burundi50th" /&gt; Some Bahá'ís from the United States have set up a non-profit organization, Orien Aid, to finding, empowering, and training youth for service, and also made a five-year commitment to work in Rwanda starting in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PROFILE: Orien Aid |work= |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |date=December 2005 |url=http://orienaid.com/Documents/BahaiYouth_12.05_FNL.pdf |format=pdf |doi= |accessdate=2009-01-12 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the recent conversions is Denyse Umutoni, an assistant director of [[Shake Hands with the Devil (2007 film)|Shake Hands with the Devil]],&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; national coordinator of a public awareness program on social issues called Cineduc (Youth Education Through Cinema), a project funded by DED and [[UNICEF]], she set up after she organized the retrieval of 3000 bodies, including her parents, from a mass grave in 2004. Umutoni was raised Catholic but experienced a crisis of faith but her study of the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith renewed her spirit.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; Rwandan Bahá'í youth were among those gathered for a five-day conference in 2006 in [[Bujumbura]] to discuss how youth can provide the means for peaceful social action and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | author-link = Bahá'í International Community | title = Youth conference in Burundi focuses on social transformation | newspaper = Bahá'í World News Service | pages = | date = 2006-09-19 | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/478?storyid=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===

There is an estimate the Bahá'í community was 40,000 before the genocide but more recently there appear to be about 10,000.&lt;ref name="recog" /&gt; The [[World Christian Encyclopedia|World Christian Database]] (WCD)&lt;ref name="WCE" /&gt; 2001.

The '''Belum Caves''' is the largest and longest cave system open to the public on the [[Indian subcontinent]], known for its [[speleothems]], such as [[stalactite]] and [[stalagmite]] formations. The Belum Caves have long passages, galleries, spacious caverns with fresh water and siphons. This natural cave system was formed over the course of tens of thousands of years by the constant flow of underground water. The cave system reaches its deepest point ( {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=on}} from entrance level) at the point known as ''Pataalaganga''.&lt;ref name="Dec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jan272008/sundayherald2008012648758.asp |title=Underground adventure in Belum caves|date=January 27, 2008|work=Deccan Herald |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602003524/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jan272008/sundayherald2008012648758.asp |archivedate = June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Telugu language]], it is called '' Belum Guhalu''. Belum Caves have a length of {{convert|3229|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, making them the second largest natural caves on the Indian Subcontinent after the [[Krem Liat Prah]] caves in [[Meghalaya]]. It is one of the centrally protected [[Monuments of National Importance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centrally Protected Monuments|url=http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/monuments.html|website=Archeological Survey of India|accessdate=27 May 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626104454/http://asihyd.ap.nic.in/monuments.html|archive-date=2017-06-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belum came to scientific attention in 1884 by a British surveyor, [[Robert Bruce Foote]] and from 1982 to 1984, a team of German [[speleology|speleologists]] headed by H. Daniel Gebauer conducted a detailed exploration of the caves. Thereafter in 1988, the [[Government of Andhra Pradesh|state government]] declared the site protected, and [[Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation]] ([[APTDC]]) developed the caves as a tourist attraction in February 2002. Today, {{convert|3.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} of the caves have been successfully explored, though only {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} is accessible to visitors.&lt;ref name="Dec"/&gt; There are 16 different pathways, including the main entrance and there are deposits of [[quartz]] in the caves. The caves consist of black [[limestone]].

== The site ==
The Belum Caves are located near Belum Village in [[Kolimigundla]] Mandal of [[Kurnool District]] in the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Kolimigundla is situated {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from Belum Caves.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, K. Thimma (1976) [http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/19200/AP-v20n2-206-227.pdf?sequence=1 Billasurgam: An Upper Palaeolithic Cave Site in South India]&lt;/ref&gt; The caves are an {{convert|8|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} drive from Petnikota village.

Belum is part of a larger complex of caves carved out of the limestone deposits in the ''Erramalai'' region. Other caves include the Billasurgam caves, Sanyasula caves, Yaganti caves, Yerrajari caves, and the Muchchatla Chintamanu caves (caves are called ''gavi'' in the local language).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travel.manoramaonline.com/travel/beyond-kerala/2018/08/30/real-location-bloody-feud-rakta-charitra.html|title=Real location of the bloody feud in 'Rakta Charitra'|work=OnManorama|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
Even though the ''Belum Caves'' were known to local people, the first records of site come from the expedition report of British geologist and archaeologist [[Robert Bruce Foote]], in 1884.  Thereafter, the Belum Caves remained unnoticed for almost a century until a German team headed by Herbert Daniel Gebauer conducted detailed exploration of the caves in 1982 and 1983. The German expedition was assisted by Mr Bacham Chalapathi Reddy (retd. Deputy superintendent of police), Mr Pothireddy Rama subba Reddy (retd.Headmaster), Mr Ramaswami Reddy, Mr Boyu Madduleti, Mr K. Padmanabhaiah, Mr K. Chinnaiah and Mr A. Sunkanna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2002/05/01/stories/2002050102240200.htm] The Hindu Business Line : Belum caves on the tourist map&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical importance ==
Belum Caves are geologically and historically important caves.  There are indications that [[Jainism|Jains]] and [[Buddhist]]s monks occupied these caves centuries ago.  Many [[Buddhist]]s relics were found inside the caves.  These relics are now housed in Museum at [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Ananthapur]].

Archaeological survey of India (ASI) also found remnants of vessels of the pre-Buddhism era and dated the remnants of these objects to 4500 years BCE.&lt;ref name=show&gt;[http://www.showcaves.com/english/in/showcaves/Belum.html] Show Caves of India: Belum Caves&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological importance ==

A new and second Indian cavernicolous (inhabiting caves) species of the genus ''Andhracoides'' was discovered in the Pataalaganga chamber. The organism is named ''Andhracoides gebaueri'' in honor of Herbert Daniel Gebauer who documented and mapped the complete cave &lt;ref&gt;[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1937240x-00002333] new species&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The caves were being used to dump wastes from nearby places until 1988. Local people of nearby settlements, notably Policemen and residents of Belum Village co-operated with the Government of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and developed the cave site as a tourist attraction. Finally, their almost two-decade long efforts resulted in the Government of [[Andhra Pradesh]] declaring the entire area to be a protected zone. Finally, in 1999, the [[Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation]] took over the task of beautifying and maintaining the caves. The [[Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|APTDC]] who has since been in charge of management, sanctioned Rs. 7,5&amp;nbsp;million to develop the caves.&lt;ref name=show /&gt; The [[Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|APTDC]] has also developed the pathways of around {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} length in and outside of the caves, provided illumination and has created fresh-air-shafts at the site. Inside the cave, APTDC has installed bridges and staircases, and a canteen, bathrooms and toilet facilities at the entry point. APTDC also has built a Haritha Hotel for accommodation in the vicinity.

There is a sizeable [[Buddha]] statue near on a hillock near the caves. One of the caverns at Belum is known as the "Meditation Hall", which was used by Buddhist monks. Relics of the Buddhist period were found here. These relics are now housed in a museum in [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Ananthapur]].

== Entrance to Caves ==
[[File:Map of Belum Caves.JPG|thumb|Map of Belum Caves engraved on a Board near entrance]]
The tourists are charged an amount of Rs. 65.00 for entrance. Foreign Tourists are charged Rs. 300.00 per person for entrance. APTDC has installed electronic [[cave gate|gates]] at entrance. After passing through the gates, one can reach the caves by a metal staircase installed by APTDC.

The entrance pit was originally smaller than what one sees today. It has been broadened as part of development of the caves to install the staircase to allow visitors to descend and ascend easily.

The entrance is like that of a [[Pit Cave]]. From the ground you can only see two pits side by side and third pit a little further away. After descending around 20 meters by the stairs from the entrance, the caves become horizontal. The first section one enters is called ''Gebauer Hall'' named after Speleologist Mr H. Daniel Gebauer, who had explored and mapped the caves in 1982-1983. The path to ''Gebauer Hall'' leads below the second opening, which lies next to the main entrance.

== Main Sections of Belum Caves ==
[[Image:MeditationHallinsideBelumCave.jpg|right|thumb|Meditation Hall inside Belum Caves]]
* pillidwaram&amp;nbsp;– pillidwaram means cats gate.  It is a natural arch of stalactites formed in the shape of a lion's head;
* Kotilingalu Chamber&amp;nbsp;– This section contains stalactite formations which are akin to Shiva lingams.  This section has thousands of such stalactite giving it a surrealistic look.  It has one huge pillar formed due to stalactite and stalagmite joining together.
* Patalaganga&amp;nbsp;– It is a small perennial stream which disappears into the depths of the earth. This stream flows from the southeast to northwest.  It disappears and is believed to be heading towards a well at the Belum village, located 2&amp;nbsp;km away from the caves.
* Saptasvarala Guha or Musical Chamber&amp;nbsp;– Saptasvarala Guha means chamber of seven notes.  The stalactite formations in this chamber reproduce musical sounds when these are struck with a wooden stick or knuckles.  This section was opened to the public in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080117064904/http://www.educationworldonline.net/eduworld/article.php?article_id=756&amp;choice=prev_art&amp;issueid=48 Educationworldonline.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dhyan Mandir or Meditation Hall&amp;nbsp;– This section is near to the entrance.  An interesting formation at Meditation hall looks like a bed with pillow to recline.  The local legend has it that in ancient times many sages used to live here.  This section was used by Buddhist Monks. Many relics of Buddhist period were found here which are now housed in museum at [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Ananthapur]].

The '''Bishop of Ferns''' ({{Lang-ga|Easpag Fhearna}})&lt;ref name="ainm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainm.ie/Bio.aspx?ID=1391|title=WADDING, Luke (1588–1657)|website=ainm.ie|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] title which takes its name after the village of [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]] in [[County Wexford]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] it remains a separate title, but in the [[Church of Ireland]] it has been united with other bishoprics.

==History==
The diocese of Ferns was one of the twenty-four dioceses established at the [[Synod of Rathbreasail]] in 1111. It comprised roughly with the ancient territory of the [[Uí Cheinnselaig]] with the bishop's seat ([[cathedra]]) located at [[Ferns Cathedral]]. During the later medieval period the church at [[New Ross]] enjoyed quasi-cathedral status.&lt;ref name=Fryde355/&gt;&lt;ref name=cotton331/&gt;

Following the [[Reformation in Ireland|Reformation]], there are parallel [[apostolic succession]]s. In the [[Church of Ireland]], Ferns was united with [[Bishop of Leighlin|Leighlin]] in 1597 to form the [[Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin|bishopric of Ferns and Leighlin]].&lt;ref name=Fryde393/&gt;&lt;ref name=cotton334/&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the bishopric of Ferns continues as a separate title.&lt;ref name=Fryde428/&gt;&lt;ref name=cathhierferns/&gt; The current Incumbent is the Most Reverend [[Denis Brennan]], Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns]], who was [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|appointed]] by the [[Holy See]] on 1 March 2006 and was [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|ordained bishop]] on 23 April 2006.&lt;ref name=bpbrennan/&gt;

== The Crow Deity ==
In the Crow language the Creator has many names, such as ''Akbaatatdia'' (One Who Has Made Everything/Maker of All Things Above), ''Iichíkbaalee'' (First Doer/Maker), and ''Isáahkawuattee'' (Old Man Coyote). All names refer to a singular, omnipotent god who the Crow believe to have created the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World of the Crow Indians: As Driftwood Lodges|last = Frey|first = Rodney|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Norman; London|pages = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This universe is believed to be made up of three worlds, the first is the physical world, thought to be the smallest of all the worlds, the second is the spirit world, and the third is where God alone lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Yellowtail: Crow Medicine Man and Sun Dance Chief|last = Yellowtail|first = Thomas|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Norman; London|pages = 103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crow creation stories ==
One of many Crow creation stories for the physical world recalls that Old Man Coyote (OMC) was alone in a large ocean when he saw two male ducks floating upon its surface. In conversation with the ducks the subject turns to what lies beneath the sea. Old Man Coyote encourages one of the ducks to dive, which he does, and after a nervous wait the duck finally surfaces with a root in its beak. Another dangerous dive brings up mud. With this soil Old Man Coyote builds first an island, and then all the lands of the Earth. However the Earth is empty, so Old Man Coyote uses the root to populate the planet with plants and trees. Despite this success the Earth was still not right, it was too flat, so OMC shaped the land to create the rivers, mountains and all geographical features. Again something was missing, Old Man Coyote and the ducks wanted friends, so he moulded Man out of the clay. But Old Man Coyote wanted Man to be happy so he created Women too so that they may be contented together and multiply. He then made female ducks so that ducks may be happy too. The story then develops where Old Man Coyote encounters another Coyote, and they decide to travel together, getting themselves into various situations that eventually creates all animals of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crow|last = Hoxie|first = Frederick E.|publisher = Chelsea House Publishers|year = 1989|isbn = |location = New York; Philadelphia|pages = 13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning it is believed that Crows were close to God, praying constantly to show their devotion, however as time progressed Crows forgot to pray and brought misfortune upon themselves. Crows believe that they must rekindle that bond through prayer if they are to be prosperous, many seeking a personal relationship with God to be individually successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crow religious belief ==
Crows will often use 'Grandmother Earth' as a way of expressing the physical things that God created, as God, although part of the physical world, transcends the first world. Because of this God is often referred to hierarchically as being 'Above,' as in superior, rather than physically in the heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; As God created everything Crows believe that the power of the Creator is in all things, and therefore, all things in nature are sacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Stars We Know|last = McCleary|first = Timothy P.|publisher = Waveland Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Long Grove|pages = xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As God created everything and is therefore omnipresent, Crows are in contact with God during every aspect of their daily lives. It is because of this omnipresence and omnipotence that Crows are religiously tolerant. One example of this tolerance is the overview of the world's religions provided by Thomas Yellowtail, a Crow medicine man and Sun Dance chief. Yellowtail used the metaphor of a wagon wheel to describe religious belief, noting that, each spoke represented a unique people and religion. If one spoke was removed, the wheel would not work, meaning all spokes must be present to form the circle of life. All spokes however are connected to the central beam, the Creator. Therefore, all religions and peoples are connected to God, and all equally valid as ways of establishing a spiritual relationship. As a result, Crows can participate in multiple religions, it is up to individuals to decide which methods they believe to be most effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is now considered traditional Crow religious practices were most likely developed sometime between 1725-1770, at a time of great cultural change after the Crow acquired their first horses from the Comanche tribe during the 1730s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of North American Indians, Vol. 13, Part 2 of 2|last = Sturtevant|first = William C.|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Washington DC|pages = 695–696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Baaxpée, Xapáaliia'' and spirits ==
The sacred power of God is called ''Baaxpée'', meaning "power transcending the ordinary." The physical manifestation of ''Baaxpée'' is called ''Xapáaliia'', often referred to as 'medicine,' which represents and acts as a conduit of ''Baaxpée'' given to a Crow by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a Crow to acquire ''Baaxpée'' they must be given it by a spirit, a ''Iilápxe,'' a super-natural patron from the spirit world. As the spirit world is between the physical and the third world where God dwells, spirits are believed to be intermediaries between man and God and are therefore able to bestow ''Baaxpée''. Crows believe that the world is full of spirits which often take the form of animals, with buffalos, birds and bears being especially revered. The stars, as created by God, are also considered highly sacred and their spirits can interact with humans in the same way as an animal patron. The manifestation of the spirit often defines the type of ''Baaxpée'' they gift, with an Elk spirit, as a strong and independent animal being associated with bestowing increased strength. A squirrel spirit, as it stores nuts for the winter to feed its family, is believed to do the same for humans, helping the tribe find food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual features of each spirit will also influence the type of ''Baaxpée'' given, for example a grey haired patron will indicate a gift of longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crow Indians|last = Lowie|first = Robert H.|publisher = Holt Rinehart &amp; Watson|origyear = 1936|year = 1966|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no set animal patron and ''Baaxpée'' for a Crow, each spirit is individual the person that received its vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Lowie|first = |publisher = |year = 1966|isbn = |location = |pages = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision quests ==
According to the Crows, in the pre-reservation world, there were two primary ways that a Crow may go about acquiring ''Baaxpée'', the first is by going on a [[vision quest]]. There are many reasons why a Crow would want to attain ''Baaxpée'' through a vision quest, some may be sick and wish to be cured, others may want to gain strength with which to defeat their enemies in battle, and many want to be blessed by God to guide them throughout their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From the Heart of Crow Country: The Crow Indian's Own Stories|last = Medicine Crow|first = Joseph|publisher = Orion Books|year = 1992|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the ''Baaxpée'' a Crow wishes to attain through a vision quest is personal and specific to the individual.

Before embarking upon the quest a Crow might visit a medicine man to help determine what type of ''Baaxpée'' would most aid them, and to go over the rites and prayers to ensure their endeavour follows the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the quest itself, a Crow will go alone to an isolated and prominent place, often the peak of a hill (Crows especially favour the Wolf Mountains), to gain complete solitude for their ritual prayer.

In Crow the ritual is called ''bilisshíissanne'', which translates as 'to fast from water,' as the participant vows not eat or drink for two to three days to show their devotion to God through their sacrifice. Self-mortification is also sometimes practiced, the most common being the removal of a finger, as an offering to God and as sign of their dedication. The purpose of these tortures is to show their willingness to give themselves completely to God and gain the pity of a spirit, a representative of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Medicine Crow|first = |publisher = |year = 1992|isbn = |location = |pages = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a spirit pities the participant they will induce a vision in which the patron adopts the Crow, bestowing ''Baaxpée''. The relationship between the spirit and a Crow is conceived as being paternal, where the spirit as a father guides the Crow child through life, hence spirits will often be referred to as 'Medicine Fathers.' However the ''Baaxpée'' the quester gains is loaned by the spirit, not given entirely, requiring the Crow to pray to their patron to confirm the bonds between them and keep the ''Baaxpée'' strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the quest is complete and ''Baaxpée'' gained, the Crow quester would return home, often visiting a medicine man to talk through their vision to fully understand its meaning. To commemorate their experience the quester will create a ''Xapáaliia'' to represent their patron, the power they have gained, and to help a Crow in channelling and maintaining their ''Baaxpée''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the individual the ''Xapáaliia'' can be anything they deem sufficient to represent the bond between them and their patron, for example if an eagle was their spirit a Crow may decide to take an eagle's feather as their ''Xapáaliia.'' For each Crow their ''Baaxpée'' and their vision is unique and cannot be transferred. However the ''Xapáaliia'' is a physical, powerful, and sacred object which can be passed between Crows, often bestowed upon death to family members, or given to Crows who cannot receive a vision of their own. If a Crow's ''Xapáaliia'' is known to be especially powerful, proven by its ability to influence life, they may find themselves inundated with requests to use it, the decision however it is ultimately up the owner as to who they give it to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Lowie|first = |publisher = |year = 1966|isbn = |location = |pages = 238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; The powers that ''Xapáaliia'' bestows to its owner usually reflect the pragmatic concerns of a Crow's daily life, whether this be to gain food, good health, wealth or to bring victory over one's enemies. To keep their ''Xapáaliia'' pure and their patron happy, it is vital that it does not come into contact with menstruates, if it does, this would offend their Medicine Father and bring disease upon the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Sturtevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 707–708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sun Dance ==
The second way in which nineteenth century Crows may attempted to gain ''Baaxpée'' was through a [[Sun Dance]] (aškišširissu-a). Unlike the vision quest the Sun Dance is performed by individuals in a public ceremony for the benefit of the whole tribe, performed to ensure the Crow's links to God remain strong, therefore bringing prosperity and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Spear believed that the Sun Dance ceremony most likely came from the Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Atsina tribes as these groups had the most complex Sun Dance ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Shoshoni-Crow Sun Dance|last = Voget|first = Fred W.|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = Norman; London|pages = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun Dance was banned on the Crow reservation in 1887 as part of the 'civilising' effort that the Indian Office embarked upon during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practise was revived in 1941 when William Big Day, after having attended a Shoshone Sun Dance where he felt an intense connection, performed the first Crow Sun Dance in fifty-four years, believing that its resurrection would bring happiness to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice grew so that by the 1990s an average of five Sun Dances were conducted each summer. In the late 1980s a Teton-Sioux version of Sun Dance was introduced to the reservation, resulting in some dances displaying a hybrid of Shoshone and Teton characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Sturevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 713–714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Sweat Lodge Ceremony ===
A smaller, but no less significant ritual, celebrated both in the pre-reservation world and in contemporary Crow society, is the [[sweat lodge]]. While this ritual is practiced alone, it is also an important prerequisite to the Sun Dance that tribal members believe purifies the body and prepares the soul for the Sun Dance. This connection is seen in that the Sweat Lodge is often referred to as the 'Little Lodge,' the smaller brother of the 'Big Lodge' in which the Sun Dance is performed. The Sweat Lodge itself in many ways mimics the Big Lodge, being made of twelve poles with the door facing east to welcome the Sun. In the centre of the lodge a 2&amp;nbsp;ft by 2&amp;nbsp;ft pit is dug into which hot rocks are placed, heated by a fire to the east of the lodge. An individual is given the duty of placing the rocks in the pit whilst the others sit and pray in silence. The first four rocks must be placed in cross, each to represent the four directions of the wind and the circle of life. Once all rocks are placed the ceremony begins, first an uncounted number of dips of water are placed on the rocks called 'April Showers' to build up the sweat in the lodge. Then the formal four quarters of the ceremony are conducted, with a break in-between each quarter. During the first quarter four dips are placed upon the rocks, the second seven, the third ten, and then the fourth an uncounted 'quarter of a million.' The ceremony is believed to purify the participants, preparing them for the Sun Dance ceremony, which, seen as a form of spiritual endurance and warfare, requires a Crow to be pure to give them spiritual armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 106–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact origin of the Sweat Lodge is unknown, it was believed by Thomas Yellowtail to have come from the story of the Seven Bison, their male companion, and their fight against the angry bison Bones Together. In the story each of the Seven Bison charges at Bones Together, but break their legs in their attempts due to Bones Together's pure bone armour. Finally it is the turn of the bison's human ally, who before attacking Bones Together prays to God and is blessed by an eagle, who gives him the ''Baaxpée'' to turn into a feather. With this power the man confronts Bones Together, who charges four times, each time missing the man as he turns into a feather and wafts unharmed out of the way as though caught in a breeze. After the fourth charge the man shots an arrow up the rectum of Bones Together, piercing his heart and killing him. Although victorious the man's friends are grievously injured, so together they perform the Sweat Lodge ceremony, which heals all the bison to full strength. Afterwards the Seven Bison transcend into the sky to create the Big Dipper, and the man the Little Dipper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sweat Lodge is also mentioned in the story of the Man and the Seven Rams, who, despite his immense ability, respects the Sweat Lodge, recognising its great power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = McClearly|first = |publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Sun Dance lodge: construction and symbolism ===
Following purification the Sun Dance ceremony can proceed. However first it is necessary to look at the building of the Big Lodge, the ''Ashé Isée,'' as this is vital if one is to understand the Dance in context and the complex symbolism involved in its construction. The Lodge acts as the closest building that the pre-reservation Crows had to a church, and is constructed by the community on land owned by the dance sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sponsor is usually an individual of repute who wishes to receive a particular blessing from God or because they have had a vision instructing them to dance. As sponsor it is their duty to gather all the materials required to build the lodge, to set the dance's overall agenda, and to ensure the dance itself is conducted properly by leading key rituals and songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important component of the lodge the central pole around which the whole ceremony revolves. A forked tree is chosen by the sponsor and cut down with respect and prayer, if the tree stump exudes sap it is seen as a good omen, and Crows will bless themselves with its excretion. The tree is then taken to the ceremonial site and hoisted into an upright position so that the crotch of the fork faces east. To one of the branches of the fork a white flag is tied, to the other blue, white to represent the earth and blue for the skies, an offering of tobacco is also attached to help Crows communicate with God. Onto the pole three rings are drawn in charcoal to symbolise the number of days in the dance and the three worlds of the Crow universe, the black of the charcoal representing victory. It is in this way that the post becomes a representation of God, a conduit for the ''Baaxpée'' to flow into the dancers. To the central pole are also hung the head of a buffalo and the body of an eagle, patrons who will come to life in the minds of the dancers during the ceremony. Around this totem are placed twelve posts of cottonwood, around forty feet from the centre, creating the boundaries of the lodge, with the doorway on the east side. The twelve poles are a physical manifestation of Crow spirituality, which when connected by rafters to the central post, represents the Crow's connection to God, like that of Thomas Yellowtail's wagon wheel. The twelve posts also represent the twelve months of the year in the Crow life cycle, and by forming a sphere, the circle of life itself. For contemporary Crows who believe both in traditional religious ideas and Christianity, the twelve posts symbolise the twelve apostles, and the three rings on the centre pole the three days that Christ spent in his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in these way that the Sun dance lodge is designed to focus and channel the ''Baaxpée'' of God, giving the Crow participants visions and blessing for the whole tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 144–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Sun Dance ceremony ===
Once the lodge is constructed the ceremony can begin. Similarly to the vision quest the purpose of the Sun Dance is for a Crow to show their devotion, displaying sacrifice by fasting, and torture by constant dancing, to physically exhaust themselves whilst praying to God, in a lodge heated all day by an intense sun. Traditionally the Sun Dance's primary purpose was to give a mourner God's blessing to take revenge on the tribe that had killed their kinsman, and specifically to enable the participant to harm those individuals responsible for their murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Lowie|first = |publisher = |year = 1966|isbn = |location = |pages = 297}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with imposed peace of the reservations the purpose of the ritual had to change, instead there are a variety of reasons for performing a Sun Dance including season renewal, to gain God's blessing, and in rare cases to attain sacred power to help Crows going to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the general aim of a particular Sun Dance may be to bring good luck on the tribe each dancer had their own personal agenda for participating. Some may have wish to receive ''Baaxpée'' through dance induced visions whilst others may have wished to cure illnesses, either for themselves or on behalf of a sick family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 199–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of their motivation all dancers before the ceremony pledge themselves to Sun Dance manikin, promising to dance for the full length of time that has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Sturtevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony the participant made sure to keep their eyes transfixed upon an idol on the pole, as a Crow continuously danced, becoming increasingly fatigued, the figures appear to come alive and dance with them, eventually causing the dancer to collapse and have a vision. If the dancer stared at the head of the Buffalo and danced long enough for the spirit to come alive, it is believed that the patron charged the participant, causing the Crow to have a 'hard fall,' inducing a vision. When a dancer collapsed and entered into a visionary state, other members of the tribe carefully removed them from the ceremony centre, allowing their vision to run its course. When the dancer woke up, they are reinvigorated and quickly re-joined the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help the dancers attain these visions the drummers play a vital role. Regular rhythms help the dancer to maintain their endeavour, with irregular beatings exhausting the participants. When the drummers see a dancer in the grips of a vision they will increase the strength of their drumming to help them have a 'hard fall.' The Drum chief will often pray for the dancers with the aid of tobacco smoke to help them endure their sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 259–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in the nineteenth century, the Sun Dance could extend for several days, today it typically lasts for three days. At the start of each day Crows gathered in the lodge just before dawn facing east to welcome the morning's sun. When the first rays appeared over the horizon Crows performed the Sunrise Ceremony, where the participants of the Sun Dance attempted to absorb the power of the sun whilst praying, dancing, blowing on eagle bone whistles, and singing the Sunrise song.  During the Sunrise ceremony it is taboo to walk across the entrance of the lodge as this breaks the connection between the dancers and the sun, if an individual has to move from one side of the lodge to the other the must walk around the rear of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 244}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first day of dancing participants dressed humbly in plain clothing to show their humility to God, on the second day however, as the dancers become increasingly tired, bright coloured clothes, face paint, and their strongest medicines were worn to help them in their spiritual warfare. To aid them through this difficult second day, and in recognition of their sacrifice, members of the tribe offered gifts and words of advice, as well as constructed willow structures in the lodge to shade and support the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 158–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willow is significant as it is associated with coolness, providing symbolic relief for the parched participants. The stalls were often painted in yellow ochre, a colour associated with the eagle which Crows believe to be a messenger to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Voget|first = |publisher = |year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at noon on the third day that the ceremony typically came to an end, with the breaking of the fast by the drinking of blessed water brought by the women of the tribe. After drinking, prayers were said to thank the dancers for their sacrifice and the whole tribe participated in a great feast. By renewing their connection with God the Sun Dance is believed to bestow God's blessing upon the tribe, bringing them good fortune and happiness for the coming year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Sun Dance was banned some Crows performed a particular type of self-mortification. Holes would be punctured into the pectoral muscles of the dancers through which rawhide rope would be laced and attached to the pole, the participant would then lean backwards, tightening the rope against their flesh in an act of self-torture. Freedom would only come when the rope had worked its way through the dancer's skin, showing their devotion to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the revival of the Sun Dance however this particular practice was not included, and yet it remains one of the enduring images of the Sun Dance to this day.

== ''Diakaashe'', 'he really did it' ==
Both in the past and the present, performing these rituals without the correct religious attitude would prevent the participant from having any benefit. The greatest gift to God is to do each ceremony with ''diakaashe'', 'he really did it,' that a Crow believed wholeheartedly in God's power, and therefore conducted themselves with sincerity and determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Frey|first = |publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = 83}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If a person expects to receive something great, then that person will probably never receive anything. The Medicine Fathers do not owe anything to anyone. We must realise this and dedicate our lives to living in accordance with the directions given to us from Above – not just once a year, but every day and year after year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tobacco ==
Tobacco is also an important component of Crow religion, the plant being honoured in a Crow sect called the Tobacco Society, the ''Bacu'sua''. Crows believe that tobacco was the first plant to grow on earth, the seed of which was created when Morning Star transformed himself from a human to the tobacco plant. According to Crow lore tobacco was discovered by Chief No Vitals at Devils Lake in eastern North Dakota, having been instructed to seek the plant by God, the worship of which would help Crows honour God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Surtevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this tobacco is perceived as being fundamental to the welfare of the tribe and has been describe by Crows themselves as their 'means of living.' As the plant is especially revered, the Tobacco Society ensures that all the rites and rituals are performed correctly, cultivating it so that the tribe may be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Lowie|first = |publisher = |year = 1966|isbn = |location = |pages = 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the sacred plant is smoked it is believed that the smoke aids in carrying prayers to God.

For those Crow who consider smoking especially holy there is the Sacred Pipe Society. In this society smoking is performed daily allowing is members to become closer to God. Once the pipe is lit the stem is pointed above as an offering to God, then down to Mother Earth, and finally in all four of the directions of the wind.  When the prayers are over the pipe is returned to its special place in the tipi. Thomas Yellow was a proponent of this method of honouring God as he believed it was a way praying as part of a Crow's daily life, which he consider especially important if God is to be properly respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 124–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellowtail used Black Elk's description of the sacred pipe to demonstrate what he believed to be the importance of scared pipe to Crows. "With this sacred pipe you will walk upon the Earth; for the Earth is your Grandmother and Mother, and she is sacred. Every step that has been taken upon Her should be as a prayer. The bowl of this pipe is of red stone; it is the Earth… The stem of this pipe is of wood, and this represents all that grows upon Earth… all things of the universe are joined to you who smokes the pipe – all send their voices to ''Wakan-Tanka'', the Great Spirit. When you pray with this pipe, you pray for and with everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Yellowtail|first = |publisher = |year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==
Today Crow religion includes more than traditional Crow beliefs. Over the past 100 years, several Christian sects have established themselves amongst the Crow people. The origins of Christianity among the Crows can be traced to the reservation era, when the Crow were confined to a relatively small tract and carefully supervised by white missionaries and government agents. The first and initially most successful Christian denomination were Catholic Jesuits, who established the St. Xavier mission in the Bighorn Valley in 1887 under the leadership of Pierpaolo Prando, after the Catholics had itinerantly preached to the Crow for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Parading Through History: The Making of the Crow Nation in America 1805-1935|last = Hoxie|first = Frederick E.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = Cambridge|pages = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prando was respected by Crows for his determination to learn their language, which allowed him to have conversations with them and enabled him to translate sermons into Crow so that they could understand the Christian God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1888 the Jesuits consolidated their mission with the building of a school, which further brought Crows round to their denomination. Key to the Catholics success was their ability to deal with Crows on their own terms, that the missionaries respected traditional Crow beliefs, even allowing Crow converts to make Christian ''Xapáaliia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestants were in the beginning less successful in converting Crows to Christianity. Although supported by the Indian Office in the belief that Protestantism would 'elevate' Crows, the first Unitarian mission established at the Little Bighorn in 1886 by Henry F. Bond failed to win support from the Crow community. Bond practiced a strict form of Protestantism, and therefore refused to acknowledge traditional Crow beliefs and culture, thereby alienating the tribe. The America Missionary Association's mission established in 1895 under James Gregor Burgess also suffered a similar fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success came in 1903 however when a Baptist mission was built at Lodge Grass, and a school constructed in 1904 under the leadership of Rev. William A. Petzoldt. This school proved especially popular as it was located in the heart of the Crow community, enabling students to study but stay at home, something which the far away boarding schools of the other Christian missions did not allow. This mission at Lodge Grass proved so successful that the Jesuits, weaken by the withdraw of Indian Office funding to their mission in 1895, established a school there too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these Christian groups met success in converting Crows they found it far harder to get their converts to worship the Christian God exclusively. This resistance was because of the Crow belief system, that Christianity was considered one of many ways to establish a relationship with God, allowing traditional Crow beliefs to coexist with Christian practices. This Crow reluctance was made all the more frustrating for the Christian missionaries with a Crow cultural and religious revival at the turn of the century, pushing what they saw as 'primitive' religion to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only successful Christians sect to get Crows to worship only God was Evangelicalism, which in the 1980s experienced a religious boom, establishing churches in districts throughout the reservation. Members of these churches rejected any form of traditional Crow religion, however this was the exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Sturtevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peyote and the Native American Church ==
Part of a wider spiritual reawakening was the growth of the peyote religion which reached the Crow reservation in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote ceremonies involve the consumption of the dried tips of the peyote Cactus, native to northern Mexico and the far south of the USA. Once eaten the peyote creates feelings of euphoria, visual distortions and a sense of timelessness. The use of peyote in ceremonies originates in pre-Columbian Mexico, with Seventeenth Century accounts by Catholic missionaries recording its use in all night ceremonies by the native peoples of that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Peyote Religion: A History|last = Stewart|first = Omer C.|publisher = University of Oklahoma|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally peyote is taken for many reasons, some being the desire for longevity and good health, to purify the body and soul, as well as to bring good luck and protection from harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Stewart|first = |publisher = |year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still debated by academics it is believed{{By whom|date=January 2017}} that peyote ceremonies were brought to the US by the nomadic Apache and Comanche Native Americans who would often travel south of the border to raid and graze their horses. It was the concentration of these native peoples into the reservations of Oklahoma that allowed this indigenous practice to endure and grow. For the first time many tribes were living in proximity, able to communicate with each other as they were forced to learn English to deal with the Indian Office. The US government then further helped peyote rituals by sending Native Americans to boarding schools. The schools were a melting pot of Native tribes, with students sharing their knowledge of the peyote ceremonies. These youths would then go on to be educated and influential members of their tribes, putting them in positions that would allow them to promulgate the use of peyote in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Stewart|first = |publisher = |year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of peyote spread so rapidly on the reservations of Oklahoma because it was an element of indigenous culture that had not yet been destroyed by whites, providing Native Americans with an invaluable link with their past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Peyote Cult|last = La Barre|first = Weston|publisher = The Shoe String Press|year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 peyote practitioners, facing a government crackdown, organised themselves into the [[Native American Church]], hoping that as a formal organisation the US would be forced to recognize peyote as a legitimate religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Stewart|first = |publisher = |year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Church, members consume peyote and then sing and pray to God throughout the night. The Comanche chief [[Quanah Parker]] commented on the difference between the Native American Church and mainstream Christianity, remarking that, "The White man goes into his church house and talks ''about'' Jesus, but the Indian goes into his tipi and talks ''to'' Jesus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = La Barre|first = |publisher = |year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Office, believing peyote to be addictive and harmful to 'civilisation', banned the plant's sale in Montana in 1923. When it was found that Crows were driving to Wyoming to get the cactus, a ban on peyote was enacted there in 1929. However, due the campaigning of Bird Above, who showed that peyote fostered virtue by encouraging monogamy, hard work and temperance, at a time when tests showed the plant not to be addictive, had the ban repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peyote religion proved popular, with despairing missionaries commenting in the 1930s that most of their members would attend Christian sermons and yet practice peyote beliefs.[64] At the turn of the millennium it is believed that around one hundred peyote ceremonies are performed on the Crow reservation each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Hoxie|first = |publisher = |year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Native-Christian religions are practiced among the Crow, including a Native form of Pentecostalism which was initially introduced on the reservation by Crow believers in the 1920s, but today has many adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = |last = Sturtevant|first = |publisher = |year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medicine and healing ==
The medicine people of the tribe are known as [[Akbaalia]] ("healer").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Frey| first = Rodney| title = The World of the Crow Indians As Driftwood Lodges| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pfsK9RcNhMUC| year = 1993| publisher = University of Oklahoma Press| isbn = 978-0-8061-2560-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mannegishi ==
The [[Mannegishi]], also called [[Little people (mythology)|little people]], are bald humanoids with large bulky, pretty eyes and tiny, tan bodies. They were [[trickster]]s and may be similar to [[fairies]].

The '''Detchana Puthumai''' tells us the situations of the South Land or [[Detchanam]] the center of Origin of Human Life according to [[Akilattirattu Ammanai]] the religious book of [[Ayyavazhi]].

In Tamil, a South Indian ancient language, "Puthumai" means Miracle. It also means Newness. "Detchana" stands for "of the South"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">'''Faderhuset''' (the Father's House) was a Danish [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] free church based in the [[Region Hovedstaden|Copenhagen capital region]]. Faderhuset was best known for acquiring the ownership of the building in central [[Copenhagen]] known as ''[[Ungdomshuset]]'', a building also claimed by young people from the Danish [[left-wing]] movement. Ungdomshuset figured prominently in world news the first week of March 2007 as riots broke out between the youth [[squatting]] in Ungdomshuset and the local police.&lt;ref name = "Independent"&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2083845.ece Copenhagen's calm broken by riots over eviction of squatters]&lt;/ref&gt;

Faderhuset was founded in 1990 by the married couple Knut and [[Ruth Evensen]] who were involved in its leadership until the church closed down on January 1, 2014. Both have been involved in Christian movements since the 1970s. They started their own religious community in the beginning of the 80s in the [[Nørrebro]] district of Copenhagen. As of January 2007 the church had 120 members and was an approved religious community by the Danish state.

The group had close ties to a Christian [[primary school]] known as Samuelsskolen, which was closed by the Danish [[Ministry of Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]] because they were concerned with some of the practices at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folketinget.dk/Samling/20021/udvbilag/UDU/Almdel_bilag22.htm ''Folketingets uddannelsesudvalg''] {{dk icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Samuelsskolen used [[Accelerated Christian Education]] material.  This is a curriculum developed in the [[United States]] by  evangelicals which teaches that the Christian Bible is the source of [[truth]] and that [[evolution]] undermines the notion of [[sin]] and the need for [[Christ]]. However, the ministry had other reasons to close Samuelsskolen, and have allowed other Christian schools to continue using this material {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

On 7 July 2007, Ruth Evensen started the [[Freedom Party (Denmark)|Freedom Party]] ({{lang-da|Frihedspartiet}}).&lt;ref name="Founding announcement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article338462.ece|title=Ruth Evensen starter nyt parti|publisher=[[Politiken]]|date=2007-07-06|accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ha-Melitz''''' or '''''HaMelitz''''' was the first [[Hebrew]] newspaper in the [[Russian Empire]]. It was founded by [[Alexander Zederbaum]] in [[Odessa]] in 1860.

==History==
''Ha-Melitz'' first appeared as a weekly, and it began to appear daily in 1886. From 1871, it was published in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Publication was suspended several times for lack of support or by order of the authorities. In 1893, [[Leon Rabinowitz]] succeeded Zederbaum as the editor.

''Ha-Melitz'' was a representative of the progressive or ''[[haskalah]]'' movement, and even so severe a critic as [[Abraham Kovner]] admitted that it had been "more useful to the Jews than have the other Hebrew newspapers" (''Ḥeḳer Dabar,'' p.&amp;nbsp;52 ff., Warsaw, 1866). While it was not so literary or scientific as some of its contemporaries, ''Ha-Melitz'' usually had more news and debates of interest, and was consequently more popular.

[[J. A. Goldenblum]] was for many years associated with Zederbaum in its publication. [[A. S. Friedberg]] and [[Judah Leib Gordon]] were the best known of its associate editors. Almost every prominent Hebrew writer of its times contributed to it.

Several collections of literary and scientific articles appeared as supplements to ''Ha-Melitz'' in Zederbaum's time: ''Ḳohelet'' (Saint Petersburg, 1881), ''Migdonot'' (1883), ''Melitẓ Aḥad Minni Elef'' (on the occasion of the appearance of No. 1,000; Saint Petersburg, 1884), ''Leḳeṭ Amarim'' (1889), and ''Arba'ah Ma'amarim'' (1893). Among similar publications issued by Zederbaum's successor were ''Ha-Yeḳev'' (Saint Petersburg, 1894), ''Ha-Osem'' and ''Ha-Gat'' (1897), and ''Ha-Gan'' (1899).

''Ha-Melitz'' was intermittently published until 1903.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1493">'''Hieromenia''' (sacred month's time), was the time of the month at which the sacred festivals of the Greeks began, and in consequence of which the whole month received the name of ''[[Wiktionary:μήν|men]] [[Wiktionary: ἱερός|hieros]] '' (sacred month). It was a part of the international law of Greece that all hostilities should cease  for the time between states who took part in these festivals, so that the inhabitants of the different states might go and return in safety. The Hieromeniae of the four great national festivals were the most important: they were proclaimed by heralds (spondophoroi or [[Theoroi]]), who visited the different states of Greece for the purpose. The suspension of hostilities was called  (''Ekecheiria'', Truce)

In 420 BC the [[Sparta]]ns were excluded from the Olympics, after they had failed to pay a fine imposed on them, when they invaded [[Lepreum]] in [[Elis]].

The '''historical Vedic religion''' (also known as '''Vedism''', '''Brahmanism''', '''Vedic Brahmanism''', and '''ancient Hinduism'''{{refn|group=note|Scholars such as Jan Gonda have used the term '''ancient Hinduism''', distinguishing it from "recent Hinduism". These terms are chronologically differentiated. According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from the Vedic religion emerged Brahmanism, a religious tradition of ancient India. It states, "Brahmanism emphasized the rites performed by, and the status of, the Brahman, or priestly, class as well as speculation about Brahman (the Absolute reality) as theorized in the Upanishads (speculative philosophical texts that are considered to be part of the Vedas, or scriptures)."&lt;ref name=britannicabrahmanism&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77141/Brahmanism Brahmanism], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}}) refers to the religious ideas and practices among [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]-speaking peoples of [[ancient India]] after about 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=britannicavedic&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vedic-religion Vedic religion], Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M. Sullivan|title=The A to Z of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xU4ZdatgRysC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-4070-6|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Samuel|2010|pp=97-99, 113-118}} These ideas and practices are found in the Vedic texts, and they were one of the major influences that shaped contemporary Hinduism.&lt;ref name=britannicavedic/&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', in the Hindu tradition and particularly in India, the Vedic religion is considered to be a part of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=britannicabrahmanism/&gt;

According to Heinrich von Stietencron, in the 19th century western publications, the Vedic religion was believed to be different from and unrelated to Hinduism. The Hindu religion was thought to be linked to the Hindu epics and the Puranas through sects based on Purohita, [[Tantra]]s and ''[[Bhakti]]''. In the 20th-century, a better understanding of the Vedic religion, its shared heritage and theology with contemporary Hinduism, has led scholars to gradually encompass Brahmanism and the Vedic religion into "Hinduism".{{sfn|Stietencron|2005|pp=231-237 with footnotes}} The [[Hindu reform movements]] and the [[Neo-Vedanta]] emphasized the Vedic heritage and "ancient Hinduism", and this term has been co-opted by some Hindus.{{sfn|Stietencron|2005|pp=231-237 with footnotes}} Vedic religion is now generally accepted to be a predecessor of [[Hinduism]], but they are not the same because the textual evidence suggests significant differences between the two.{{refn|group=note|[[Stephanie W. Jamison]] and Michael Witzel, Vedic Hinduism, 1992, "... to call this period Vedic Hinduism is a ''[[contradictio in terminis]]'' since Vedic religion is very different from what we generally call Hindu religion – at least as much as Old Hebrew religion is from medieval and modern Christian religion. However, Vedic religion is treatable as a predecessor of Hinduism".&lt;ref name=jamisonwitzelp2&gt;{{cite web|first1=Stephanie|last1=Jamison|first2= Michael|last2=Witzel |year=1992| url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf|title=Vedic Hinduism|publisher=Harvard University|pages=2–4|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Vedic religion is described in the [[Vedas]] and associated voluminous Vedic literature preserved into the modern times by the different priestly schools.&lt;ref name=jamisonwitzelp2/&gt; The Vedic religion texts are cerebral, orderly and intellectual, but it is unclear if the theory in diverse Vedic texts actually reflect the folk practices, iconography and other practical aspects of the Vedic religion.&lt;ref name=jamisonwitzelp2/&gt; The evidence suggests that the Vedic religion evolved in "two superficially contradictory directions", state Jamison and Witzel. One part evolved into ever more "elaborate, expensive, and specialized system of rituals", while another part questioned all of it and emphasized "abstraction and internalization of the principles underlying ritual and cosmic speculation" within oneself. Both of these traditions impacted Indic religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, and in particular Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jamisonwitzel&gt;{{cite web|first1=Stephanie|last1=Jamison|first2=Michael|last2=Witzel|year=1992| url= http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf |title=Vedic Hinduism| publisher=Harvard University|pages=1–5, 47–52, 74–77 with footnotes|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century|page=113|author=Geoffrey Samuel|publisher=Cambridge University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex Vedic rituals of [[Shrauta|Śrauta]] continue to be practiced in [[coastal Andhra]].{{sfn|Knipe|2015|p=1-50}}

Some scholars consider the Vedic religion to have been a composite of the religions of the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]]s, "a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian, new Indo-European elements",{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=462}} which borrowed "distinctive religious beliefs and practices"{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} from the [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex|Bactria–Margiana culture]],{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=32}} and the remnants of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] culture of the Indus Valley.&lt;ref name="White 2003 28"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The term Brahmanism is related to the metaphysical concept of [[Brahman]] that developed during the Vedic era.&lt;ref name="Maritain2005p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Maritain|title=An Introduction to Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9GnOWELyRYC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5053-7|pages=6–7 with footnote 1}}, Quote: "This [the primitive religion of the Vedas] resulted, after a period of confusion, in the formation of a new system, Brahmanism (or Hinduism), which is essentially a philosophy, a metaphysic, a work of human speculation, [...]; footnote 1: "[...] the neuter, Brahman, as the one impersonal substance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ| year=2002|publisher =Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-68918-7|pages=64–65}}, Quote: "The early Upanishads are primarily metaphysical treatises concerned with identifying the Brahman, the ground of the universe. [...] The essence of early Brahmanism is the search for the Absolute and its natural development is in Vedantin monism which claims that the soul is identical with the Absolute."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biardeau1994p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Madeleine Biardeau|title=Hinduism, the anthropology of a civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jS1aAAAAYAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=17–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Brahman is posited as that which existed before the creation of the universe, which constitutes all of existence thereafter, and into which the universe will dissolve into, followed by similar endless creation-maintenance-destruction cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=Brāhmanism and Hindūism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindūs|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-19bAAAAcAAJ |year=1891|publisher=J.

According to Indologist Jan Heesterman, the terms Vedism and Brahmanism are "somewhat imprecise terms". They refer to ancient forms of Hinduism based on the ideologies found in its early literary corpus.&lt;ref name=Heestermanv14/&gt; Vedism refers to the oldest version, states Heesterman, and it was older than Brahmanism. Vedism refers to the religious ideas of Indo-Europeans who migrated into the Indus River valley region of the subcontinent, whose religion relied on the Vedic corpus including the early Upanishads.&lt;ref name=Heestermanv14/&gt; Brahmanism, according to Heesterman, refers to the religion that had expanded to a region stretching from the northwest subcontinent to the Ganges valley.&lt;ref name=Heestermanv14/&gt; Brahmanism included the Vedic corpus and non-Vedic literature such as the ''Dharmasutras'' and ''Dharmasastras'', and was the version of ancient Hinduism that gave prominence to the priestly (Brahmin) class of the society.&lt;ref name=Heestermanv14&gt;{{cite book| author=Jan Heesterman|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd Edition|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor= Lindsay Jones|year =2005 |volume=14|pages=9552–9553|isbn=0-02-865733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Brahmanism refers to both the predominant position of the priests (Brahmans) and the importance given to Absolute reality (Brahman) speculations in the early Upanishads, as these terms are etymologically linked.&lt;ref name=britannicavedic/&gt;

The word Brahmanism was coined by Gonçalo Fernandes Trancoso (1520-1596) in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Županov2005"&gt;{{citation|last=Županov|first=Ines G.|title=Missionary Tropics: The Catholic Frontier in India (16th-17th Centuries)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nix4M4dy7nQC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-11490-5|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
Texts dating to the Vedic period, composed in [[Vedic Sanskrit]], are mainly the four Vedic [[Samhita]]s, but the [[Brahmana]]s, [[Aranyaka]]s and some of the older [[Upanishads]] ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Bṛhadāraṇyaka]], [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chāndogya]], [[Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana]]) are also placed in this period. The Vedas record the [[liturgy]] connected with the rituals and sacrifices. These texts are also considered as a part of the scripture of contemporary Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Goodall2001ix"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dominic Goodall|title=Hindu Scriptures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKUteclXOK8C|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1770-8|pages=ix–xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu rites of [[cremation]] are seen since the Rigvedic period; while they are attested from early times in the [[Cemetery H culture]], there is a late Rigvedic reference invoking forefathers  "both cremated (''agnidagdhá-'') and uncremated (''ánagnidagdha-'')".(RV 10.15.14)

The Devas ([[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Aryaman]], [[Bhaga]], Amsa, etc.) are deities of cosmic and social order, from the universe and kingdoms down to the individual. The [[Rigveda]] is a collection of hymns to various deities, most notably heroic [[Indra]], [[Agni]] the sacrificial fire and messenger of the gods, and [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the deified sacred drink of the Indo-Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haoma-i "Botany of Haoma"], from ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]''.

===Ethics — satya and rta===
{{See also|Asha|ṛta}}

Ethics in the Vedas are based on the concepts of ''[[satya]]'' and ''[[ṛta]]''. ''Satya'' is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Holdrege (2004:215)&lt;/ref&gt; Panikkar remarks:
{{quote|''Ṛta'' is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is "the supreme", although this is not to be understood in a static sense [...] It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything...."&lt;ref&gt;Panikkar 2001:350–351&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term is also found in the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], the religion of the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian peoples]].&lt;ref name="DG_1963_46"&gt;{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[dharma]]'' was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of ''ṛta''.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Terence P.

==Post-Vedic religions==
{{Main article|Indian religions|History of Hinduism}}

The Vedic period is held to have ended around 500 BCE. The period between 800 BCE and 200 BCE is the formative period for later Hinduism, [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Smart|2003}}{{sfn|Michaels|2004}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}{{sfn|Muesse|2003}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=82, 224–49}} According to Michaels, the period between 500 BCE and 200 BCE is a time of "ascetic reformism".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=36}} According to Michaels, the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE is the time of "classical Hinduism", since there is "a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} Muesse discerns a longer period of change, namely between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, which he calls the "Classical Period", when "traditional religious practices and beliefs were reassessed. The brahmins and the rituals they performed no longer enjoyed the same prestige they had in the Vedic period".{{sfn|Muesse|2003|p=115}}

According to Muesse, some of the fundamental concepts of Hinduism, namely karma, reincarnation and "personal enlightenment and transformation", which did not exist in the Vedic religion, developed between 800 BCE and 200 BCE:{{sfn|Muesse|2003}}{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

===Vedanta===

Vedic religion was followed by [[Upanishads]] which gradually evolved into [[Vedanta]], which is regarded by some as the primary institution of [[Hinduism]]. [[Vedanta]] considers itself "the purpose or goal [end] of the Vedas."&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Hume, Professor Emeritus of History of Religions at the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], wrote in [[Random House]]'s ''The American College Dictionary'' (1966): "It [Vedānta] is concerned with the end of the Vedas, both chronologically and teleologically."&lt;/ref&gt; There are some conservative schools which continue portions of the historical Vedic religion largely unchanged (see [[Śrauta]], [[Nambudiri]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kelkar, Siddharth. [http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/unescos-legup-for-city-veda-research/280908/ UNESCO’s leg-up for city Veda research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006002119/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/unescos-legup-for-city-veda-research/280908/ |date=6 October 2012 }}. Express India. Retrieved 16 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the continuation of the Vedic tradition in a newer sense, Jeaneane D. Fowler writes the following:
{{Cquote|Despite the radically different nature of the Upanishads in relation to the ''Vedas'' it has to be remembered that the material of both form the ''Veda'' or "knowledge" which is ''sruti'' literature. So the ''Upanishads'' develop the ideas of the ''Vedas'' beyond their ritual formalism and should not be seen as isolated from them. The fact that the Vedas that are more particularly emphasized in the Vedanta: the efficacy of the Vedic ritual is not rejected, it is just that there is a search for the Reality that informs it.&lt;ref&gt;P. 46 ''Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism'' By Jeaneane D. Fowler&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bhakti===

According to German Professor [[Axel Michaels]], the Vedic gods declined but did not disappear, and local cults were assimilated into the Vedic-brahmanic pantheon, which changed into the Hindu pantheon. Deities such as Shiva and Vishnu became more prominent and gave rise to [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}}

===Interpretations of Vedic Mantras in Hinduism===

The various Hindu schools and traditions give various interpretations of the Vedic hymns.

[[Mīmāṃsā]] philosophers argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious ruth|first=Robert|last=Neville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ThLR13JpCWsC|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīmāṃsā argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the ''[[mantra]]s'' that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The perfectibility of human nature in eastern and western thought |author-first=Harold |author-last=Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkE_8uch5P0C |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This then united Hinduism; (...)

:''{{IAST|ekaṃ sad viprā bahudhā vadantyaghniṃ yamaṃ mātariśvānamāhuḥ}}''
:"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garutmān.
:To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan".
Moreover, the verses of [[Nasadiya Sukta|10.129]] and 10.130, deal with the one being (Ékam sát). The verse 10.129.7 further confirms this (trans. [[Ralph T. H. Griffith|Griffith]]):
:''{{IAST| iyám vísṛṣṭiḥ yátaḥ ābabhūva / yádi vā dadhé yádi vā ná / yáḥ asya ádhyakṣaḥ paramé vyóman / sáḥ aṅgá veda yádi vā ná véda}}''

{{Islam by country}}
'''Islam in Liberia''' is practiced by an estimated 12.2% of the population.&lt;ref name=irfr&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148698.htm | title=International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Liberia | work=United States Department of State | date=November 17, 2010 | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Liberian Muslims are [[Maliki|Malikite]] [[Sunni]], with sizeable [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiyya]] minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=August 14, 2012 | date=August 9, 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary Muslim ethnic groups are the [[Vai (ethnic group)|Vai]] and [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]] but also [[Gbandi]], Kpelle and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Barbara|year=2001|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Liberian Muslims have followed a relaxed and liberal form of Islam that is heavily influenced by indigenous religions that were integrated into Islam when it came to Liberia in the 16th century with the collapse of the [[Songhai Empire]] in [[Mali]]. Islamic religious practices vary in cities and towns across the country. Younger Liberian Muslims, particularly in the cities along the coast, tend to be more secular but still practice Islam in everyday life. In rural areas, Liberian Muslims are more conservative in dressing modestly, performing prayers and attending religious studies. The practice of Islam in Liberia has been compared to Islam common in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], with strong orientation toward [[Sufism]]. The major Islamic holidays, [[Eid el Fitr]], [[Ramadan]] and [[Eid al Adha]], called Tabaski Day, are celebrated annually in Liberia. People have begun to go on [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]] in recent years. Joint English-Arabic language, Quranic, and Muslim universities and Islamic studies schools have opened and been rebuilt in the capital Monrovia, rural towns and other cities. Islam appears to be experiencing revival alongside Christianity in the country as a result of the [[First Liberian Civil War|Liberian Civil War]]. America-Liberian Methodists, the first [[Christian]]s in Liberia, arrived on January 7, 1822.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|last=Olukoju|first=Ayodeji|year=|title=Culture and Customs of Liberia|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles Taylor==
[[President of Liberia|President]] [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] promulgated Islam for political reasons. Taylor, an ally of [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], trained in Libya before returning to Liberia. Taylor's government sent 220 Muslims to [[Mecca]] to do [[Hajj]] in 2001 and gave the [[Liberia Muslim's council]] a prominent building in [[Monrovia]] and the designation of two hours of national broadcasting weekly for Islam-related programming.

==Destruction of mosques==
A consequence of the [[civil war]] in Liberia was destruction of religious buildings, schools and places of worship across the country. In both urban and rural areas, government and opposition rebel forces destroyed numerous mosques belonging to Liberian Muslims from what the government considered enemy ethnic groups. Several massacres were also committed near mosques and schools. One of the most well known, barbaric and gruesome was the Bakerdu Massacre in the mainly Mandingo/Muslim  Quardu Gboni District [[Lofa County]] on July 12, 1990. Over 400 civilians were killed (some by being burned alive) by [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). Destroyed buildings still stand on uneven foundations, raddled with bullet holes, demolished walls or simply blasted to skeletal buildings. Such destruction not only led to many faithful followers fleeing their hometowns, cities and villages for refugee camps in Sierra Leone, Ghana and other neighboring countries but also destroyed [[Islamic architecture]] that represented the blend between traditional [[Liberia]]n, [[West African]] and [[Arab]] architectural design and influences. In recent years, diaspora Liberians abroad who practice Islam and Liberians in Liberia have participated in joint projects to rebuild and finance the reconstruction of mosques in many towns in the countryside.

==2000s==
Countries such as Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, etc. have created Diplomatic relations with Liberia. Islamic organizations provide help to Liberian Muslims wanting to go on [[Hajj]] to Mecca. Rev. Dr. [[Laurence Konmla Bropleh]] Esq., Liberia's Information Minister and a reverend, attended as a guest speaker. Minister Bropleh called on the nation's legislature to designate non-Christian holidays as national holidays, specifically Hajj. He also suggested establishing a religious advisory board, representing all of the major religions practiced in Liberia, to advise the President. [[Methodist]] leaders condemned Bropleh's comments and accused him of fueling inter-religious tension.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|author=Konah L.

'''Michael James Whale''' (born 13 May 1951), known professionally as '''James Whale''', is an English radio personality, television presenter, podcast host and author. He gained initial prominence in the 1980s as the host of ''The James Whale Radio Show'' on [[Radio Aire]] in Leeds, which was simulcast on national television. From 1995 to 2008, Whale hosted a night time radio show on [[talkSPORT]], followed by stints on [[LBC 97.3]] and various BBC radio stations.

Whale is the current host of his podcast ''The James Whale Show'' and a night time radio show on [[Talkradio|talkRADIO]].

==Early life==
Michael James Whale was born on 13 May 1951 in [[Ewell]], Surrey into "an ordinary middle class family".{{sfn|Whale|2007|p=17}} His English father David worked in the family business S&amp;R Whale, which made dresses, aprons and overalls in a factory in [[Brixton]], London.{{sfn|Whale|2007|p=17}} His Welsh mother Anne (''[[née]]'' Price) was a professional ballet dancer.{{sfn|Whale|2007|p=18}} His parents later owned The Famous Green Man pub in Ewell.&lt;ref name=timeleisure&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeandleisure.co.uk/articles/local/4238-james-whale.html|title=Having a Whale of a time|work=Time &amp; Leisure|first=Chris|last=Wood|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whale has a younger brother, Keith.{{sfn|Whale|2007|p=17}} Whale did not enjoy his school life. After failing his [[eleven-plus]] exam, he attended Linton's Lane Secondary Modern School and Longmead County Secondary Boys School, both in Epsom.{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:00:48–00:01:33}}&lt;ref&gt;''Almost a Celebrity: A Lifetime of Night-Time'' Author: James Whale. Retrieved: 10 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

From fourteen to sixteen, Whale took up archery and became a Surrey junior champion.&lt;ref name=timeleisure/&gt; He relocated to the [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]] area of London where his parents ran a pub.&lt;ref name=timeleisure/&gt; He wanted to become an actor, but his mother advised him to "get a proper job".{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:02:43–00:04:01}} Among Whale's first jobs was as a trainee buyer for [[Harrods]].&lt;ref name=independent2008&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/my-life-in-media-james-whale-830556.html|title=My Life in Media: James Whale|date=19 May 2008|first=Jamie|last=Merrill|work=The Independent|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this job he came into contact with a DJ which influenced him to become one soon after, citing [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] and [[Kid Jensen]] as among his favourites.{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:04:01–00:06:47}} After learning that Watneys was to open a chain of discos, Whale took their DJ training course and landed his first gig at The Bird's Nest in [[Muswell Hill]], north London. He found the experience "dull", but realised he had an ability to introduce records and worked at a Watney's venue in Sweden for several months.{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:07:24–00:09:31}} Upon returning home Whale resumed DJ work, took acting lessons and worked as a rep, but earned little money.{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:09:31–00:10:12}}

==Career==
===1970–1995: Early career and ITV television show===
Whale began his broadcasting career in 1970 following a visit to a [[Topshop]] store on [[Regent Street]], London. He spoke to manager [[Ralph Halpern]] who initially declined to hire a DJ for the store, after which he worked as an assistant stage manager at a theatre in Oxford. Whale was soon invited back to Topshop and accepted work as one of the launch DJs of Radio Topshop, the in-house radio station.{{sfn|Conversations|2017|loc=00:10:12–00:11:20}}&lt;ref name=independent2008/&gt; In 1974, he became the host of an evening talk radio show at [[Metro Radio]],&lt;ref name=independent2008/&gt; serving northeast England from studios in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. He was the first presenter of the ''Nightowls'' program. During this time, Whale took up additional work as a voice over artist and acting roles in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Z-Cars]]''.&lt;ref name=independent2008/&gt; In 1980, he moved to [[Radio Derby]]&lt;ref name=independent2008/&gt; to host a morning phone-in, working with [[Terry Christian]] who later became a colleague at talkSPORT.

In 1982, Whale joined [[Radio Aire]] in [[Leeds]] to host the night talk show; by 1987 he moved to the morning slot before returning to evenings. In 1987, he released two singles: "The Whaley Rap"/"I Hear James (On the Radio)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/James-Whale-Co-The-Cigar-Store-Indians-Whaley-Rap/release/2269486|title=Whaley Rap!|others=James Whale and Co.|year=1987|id=AIRE 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Wrap it Up for Xmas". By late 1987, the radio show was simulcast on [[Red Rose Radio]] from [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. In 1989, Whale's third single, "Bimbo", entered the UK top 100 singles chart. An edited version of the B-side, "A Big Big Egg", was the closing theme for his TV show.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the late 1980s, Whale became influenced by American radio hosts, including "[[shock jock]]" [[Howard Stern]], and changed his style, having become tired of the "lovely phone-ins" that he had been accustomed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/260271051/|title=The rift of the gab|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 September 1989|page=23|first=Nigel|last=Fountain|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commencing on the night of Friday 18 November 1988, Whale's radio show at Radio Aire was simulcast with [[Yorkshire Television]] and was titled ''The James Whale Radio Show'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/260345468/|title=Television and Radio – Yorkshire|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 September 1988|page=40|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring live studio guests, music and listener phone calls. The show became a ratings success, and after several months it started to air nationally on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/258428232/|title=The James Whale Radio Show|newspaper=The Observer|date=2 October 1988|page=77|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative MP [[Jerry Hayes]] had a regular slot on the show and [[Steve Coogan]] would also make a regular appearance. By September 1989, the show attracted over one million viewers. It cost the television station £15,000 to run each hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259068049/|title=Whale of a time on the cheap|newspaper=The Observer|date=3 September 1989|page=63|first=Nicholas|last=Fraser|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993, Whale began a new ITV series, ''Whale On''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/260294002/|title=Television – ITV London|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 January 1993|page=28|accessdate=28 June 2018|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 he presented a weekend afternoon show on [[LBC]] in London. He also presented ''The Blue Whale'' on [[Men and Motors]].

===1995–2008: Talk Radio/talkSPORT===
From 1995 to 2008, Whale hosted a talk show on weekday nights on [[talkSPORT]] from 10pm to 1am. ''The James Whale Show'' featured as guests celebrities such as [[Jodie Marsh]], [[David Icke]], [[Nick Pope (journalist)|Nick Pope]], [[Alex Jones (radio)|Alex Jones]], [[David Shayler]], [[Lembit Öpik]], [[Myleene Klass]], [[Peter Stringfellow]] and [[Alistair McGowan]]. Another regular guest was the psychic [[Uri Geller]]. Whale's friend [[Bernard Manning]] would often telephone on his way from gigs. On two occasions, Whale and American talk host [[Tom Leykis]] co-hosted shows that ran simultaneously as episodes of both their programmes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Whale participated in a live ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme on 26 April 2007 on [[BBC Two]], broadcast simultaneously on [[talkSPORT]], in which he referred to two-week refuse pickup throughout the UK and the 'scandal' of [[global warming]]. Whale should have had a live link to the Newsnight studio, but due to a technical failure this was not possible. Whale announced he believed [[climate change denial|global warming was solely a natural phenomenon]]. He described [[recycling]] as a 'joke' and believed prisoners should sort rubbish and recyclable waste.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In May 2008, Whale was sacked because he twice called on listeners to vote for [[Boris Johnson]] before the [[London mayoral election, 2008|London mayoral election in 2008]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7385370.stm |title=Radio host James Whale is sacked |work=BBC News |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ofcom]] fined Talksport £20,000, saying he had "seriously breached the due impartiality rules at the time of an election".

'''Khalsa Bahadur''' is an [[epic poem]] written by Chuhar Singh describing the chivalry and sacrifice of Sikh soldiers at the [[Battle of Saragarhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurdev|editor=Harbans Singh|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|url=http://www.advancedcentrepunjabi.org/eos/KHALSA%20BAHADUR.html|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=Punjabi University, Patiala|location=Patiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is 55 pages long, written using the ''baint'' verse form, and written in the [[Punjabi language]]. It was completed on November 13, 1915 at Ballial in the [[Patiala district]] of [[Punjab (India)]] using information from Sikh soldiers on [[Leave (military)|leave]].

==Synopsis==
The poem begins with a supplication to God, the [[Sikh Gurus]] and the Sikh holy book, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. It narrates the raising of the [[36th Sikh Regiment]] and details the [[Pashtun people|Pathan]] tribes in the [[Northwest Frontier Province]]. It then tells the narrative of the [[Battle of Saragarhi]] and ends by describing monuments erected in their honor at [[Saragarhi]], [[Amritsar]], and [[Firozpur]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">The term '''Lasya''', in the context of [[Hindu mythology]], describes the dance performed by Goddess [[Parvati]] as it expresses happiness and is filled with grace and beauty. She is believed to have danced the Lasya in response to the male energy of the cosmic dance of [[Tandava]] performed by Lord Shiva. In a literal sense, Lasya means beauty, happiness and grace.

Professor [[Inayat Khan]] in his book "Munqar Musicar"(1912) wrote: "Women and men both perform this dance and there are a number of recognized masters ([[Ustad|ustad]]) of it in India. Lasya is accompanied by two sarangi players and a tabid, and sometimes a [[manjira]] (small indian cymbals). It is danced by one woman, or by two together"&lt;ref&gt;Hazrat Inayat Khan. «The Minqar-i Musiqar: Hazrat Inayat Khan's Classic 1912 Work on Indian Musical Theory and Practice». Omega Publications. 2016 ({{ISBN|1941810187}})&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lasya is an element which is graceful, delicate and expresses emotions on a gentle level. It is associated with the dance of women because  Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva taught it to Usha (daughter of Sage Banasura). Then she passed on this art to women. Lasya is mainly of four types: SHRINKALA, LATA, PINDI and BHEDYAKA&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend ({{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}) by Anna Dallapiccola&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Etymology==
The [[Indian classical music]] terminology [[Tala (music)|talam]] has been etymologically derived from the union of the dances of both Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati ('''Ta'''ndavam and '''La'''sya'''m'''). The expression of happiness and joy in dance is also termed as ''Lasyam''.lt means beauty and a graceful dance

'''Louis Nathaniel de Rothschild''' ({{lang-de|Ludwig Nathaniel Freiherr von Rothschild}}&lt;ref&gt;{{German title|Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Austrian [[baron]] from the famous [[Rothschild family]]. He was born in [[Vienna]] on 5 March 1882 and died of heart failure while swimming in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]] on 15 January 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baron Louis de Rothschild Dies; Freed by Nazis for $21. Million; Former Vienna Banker Held Prisoner in '38- 39 During Ransom Negotiations |work=New York Times |date=16 January 1955 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/01/16/archives/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dies-freed-by-nazis-for-21-million-former.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild]]. He owned a spectacular palace in Vienna, the [[Palais Rothschild]], that housed an exquisite art collection and [[antique]]s.

After the [[Anschluß]] of Austria to [[Nazi Germany]] in March 1938, he was arrested at the airport at [[Aspern]]&lt;ref&gt;MacDonogh, G. ''1938: Hitler's Gamble''. New York: Basic Books, 2009. p 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and taken into custody by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] because he was a distinguished member of the [[Jews|Jewish]] oligarchy. He was released only after lengthy negotiations between the family and the Nazis and upon payment of $21,000,000, believed to have been the largest ransom payment in history for any individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1955/01/17/archive/baron-louis-de-rothschild-dead-paid-21000000-ransom-to-nazis|title=Baron Louis De Rothschild Dead: Paid $21,000,000 Ransom to Nazis {{!}} Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While imprisoned he was visited by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Rothschild apparently impressed the [[SS]] leader, who subsequently ordered that Rothschild's prison conditions be improved with better furniture and sanitation facilities.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=61}} Despite appeals from [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] of the United Kingdom and possibly the [[Duke of Windsor]], Rothschild was held in Vienna's [[Hotel Metropole, Vienna|Hotel Metropole]] while the German government attempted to expropriate his business concerns.{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=69,71}} He was imprisoned at least through July 1938, and his property placed under control of a German "commissioner".{{sfn|MacDonogh|2009|p=137}} [[Felix Somary]], in his memoirs,&lt;ref&gt;F. Somary, Erinnerungen, Manesses Verlag, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; recalls that, soon before the Anschluss, he phoned to the baron repeatedly, in a desperate attempt to convince him to leave Austria. The day before the Anschluss, Louis's brother Alphons and his wife were visiting him in Switzerland, wanting to go back into Austria; he persuaded them to remain there, and to get his children Francesca de Rothschild and Heidi de Rothschild away from Austria to [[Netherlands]].

Finally allowed to leave Austria, Louis survived the [[Holocaust]] and [[Second World War]].

All of the Rothschild possessions were plundered and subsequently "[[Aryan]]ised". The city-palace of the family was destroyed after the war. The baron never received most of his former belongings back, since most of the paintings were taken over by the Austrian state, which did not allow the paintings to leave the country. In 1998, over 200 art works were returned to the Rothschild heirs by the Austrian Government, and were placed at Christie's in London for auction in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At $90 Million, Rothschild Sale Exceeds Goals |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/09/world/at-90-million-rothschild-sale-exceeds-goals.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he married the countess Hildegard Johanna von Auersperg (1895–1981) and lived in East Barnard, Vermont (United States) and England. He died childless in 1955.

'''Madalyn Murray O'Hair''' (''née'' '''Mays'''; April 13, 1919&amp;nbsp;– September 29, 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/J1HD-2J3 | title= United States Social Security Death Index: Madalyn M Ohair | publisher= [[FamilySearch]].org | access-date= June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Activism|activist]] supporting atheism and separation of church and state. In 1963 she founded [[American Atheists]] and served as its president to 1986, after which her son [[Jon Garth Murray]] succeeded her. She created the first issues of ''[[American Atheist Magazine]]''.

O'Hair is best known for the ''Murray v. Curlett'' lawsuit, which challenged the policy of mandatory prayers and Bible reading in Baltimore public schools, in which she named her first son [[William J. Murray]] as plaintiff. Consolidated with ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]'' (1963), it was heard by the United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], which ruled that official [[Bible]]-reading in American public schools was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had prohibited officially sponsored prayer in schools in '' [[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) on similar grounds. Through American Atheists, O'Hair filed numerous other suits on issues of separation of church and state.

In 1995, O'Hair, her second son [[Jon Garth Murray]] (known as "Garth"), and her adopted daughter Robin Murray O'Hair (daughter of [[William J. Murray]] and his high school girlfriend Susan), disappeared from [[Austin, Texas]]. Garth Murray withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars from American Atheists' funds, and there was speculation that the trio had absconded. David Roland Waters, a convicted felon and former employee of American Atheists, was convicted of murdering O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair. The bodies were not found until Waters led authorities to their burial place following his conviction.

==Early and personal life==
Madalyn Mays was born in the [[Beechview (Pittsburgh)|Beechview]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on April 13, 1919, the daughter of Lena Christina (née Scholle) and John Irwin Mays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reitwiesner |first=William Addams |authorlink=William Addams Reitwiesner |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/ohair.html |title=Ancestry of Madalyn Murray O'Hair |access-date = 2007-12-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811063056/http://www.wargs.com/other/ohair.html|archivedate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had an older brother, John Irwin Jr. (known as "Irv").&lt;ref name="freedomwriter"&gt;{{cite web| title =Woman, Atheist, Anarchist| work =Freedom Writer| date =March 1989| url =http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/madalyn.htm#OHAIR| format =reprint| access-date =2007-12-01| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071012072025/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/madalyn.htm#OHAIR| archivedate =October 12, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father was of Irish ethnicity and their mother was of [[Germans|German]] ancestry. At the age of four, Madalyn was [[Baptism|baptized]] into her father's [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church; her mother was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]].&lt;ref name="lebeau"&gt;{{cite book| last =Le Beau | first =Bryan F.| title =The Atheist: Madalyn Murray O'Hair| publisher =[[New York University Press]]| year =2003| location =New York| isbn = 0-8147-5171-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Ohio, and in 1936, Mays graduated from [[Rossford High School]] in [[Rossford, Ohio|Rossford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rossford HS Yearbook "Maroon and Gray" 1936|url=http://www.ohiomemory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15005coll25/id/1171/rec/12|website=Ohio Memory|access-date=17 May 2015|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Mays married John Henry Roths, a steelworker. They separated when they both enlisted for [[World War II]] service, he in the [[United States Marine Corps]], and she in the [[Women's Army Corps]]. In April 1945, while posted to a [[cryptography]] position in [[Italy]], she began a relationship with officer William J. Murray, Jr., a married [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. He refused to divorce his wife. Mays divorced Roths and adopted the name Madalyn Murray. She gave birth to her son with officer Murray after returning to Ohio, and named the boy  [[William J. Murray|William J. Murray III]] (nicknamed "Bill").&lt;ref name=lebeau /&gt;

In 1949, Murray completed a [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Ashland University]].&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt; She earned a  law degree from the [[South Texas College of Law]], but did not pass the [[bar exam]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bryce |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Bryce (writer) |title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair timeline |work =[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=1998-11-20 |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/1998-11-20/520649/ |access-date=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved with Bill to [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. On November 16, 1954, she gave birth to her second son, [[Jon Garth Murray]], fathered by her boyfriend Michael Fiorillo.&lt;ref name="zindler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zindler |first1=Frank |authorlink1=Frank Zindler |editor1-first=S.

It was rumored that Murray sought to defect to the [[Soviet Union]] at their embassy in [[Paris]] in 1960, but that the Soviets denied her entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitteriti|first= Joseph|title= Religion from the Public School to the Public Square|publisher= Princeton University Press |date=2009|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Epstein-Walker&gt;Lee Epstein, [[Thomas Walker (attorney)|Thomas G.

Murray III as plaintiff. She said that its practices of mandatory prayer and required reading of the Bible were unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court upheld her position by a ruling in 1963.

Because of hostility in Baltimore against her family related to this case, Murray left Maryland with her sons in 1963 and moved to [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Thackery. ''Justice Be Damned''. Associated Professional Services, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; She had allegedly assaulted five [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore City Police Department]] officers who tried to retrieve her son Bill's girlfriend Susan from her house; she was a minor and had run away from home. Susan gave birth to Bill's daughter, whom she named Robin. Murray later adopted Robin.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt;

In 1965, Murray married U.S. Marine Richard O'Hair, and changed her surname. He had belonged to a Communist group in Detroit during the 1940s. During investigations of the 1950s, he gave more than 100 names of other members to the FBI. Later he was investigated for falsely claiming to be an FBI agent.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Bates (2003) [http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2003/10/the_murdered_atheist_her_rotten_husband_and_the_fbi.html "The murdered atheist versus the FBI"] Slate.com, accessed 14 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Although the couple separated, they were legally married until his death in 1978.&lt;ref name="lebeau" /&gt;

==Activism==
{{Main|Abington School District v. Schempp}}
In 1960, Murray filed a lawsuit against the [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore City Public School System]] (''Murray v. Curlett''), naming her son William as plaintiff. She challenged the city school system's practice of requiring students to participate in [[Bible]] readings at the city's public schools. She said her son's refusal to participate had resulted in [[school bullying|bullying]] by classmates and that administrators condoned this behavior.&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt; After consolidation with ''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]],'' the lawsuit was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1963. The Court voted 8–1 in Schempp's favor, saying that mandatory public Bible readings by students were unconstitutional. Prayer in schools other than Bible-readings had been ruled as unconstitutional the year before by the Court in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962).

O'Hair filed a number of other lawsuits: one was against the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) because of the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading]].&lt;ref name = "prayer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Chaikin |title=A Man On The Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts |publisher=Viking |isbn=0-670-81446-6 |year=1994 |pages=623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=397&amp;invol=531 |title=O'Hair v. Paine, 397 U.S. 531|year=1970|publisher=Findlaw|access-date=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge had limited effect.

In the [[Apollo 11]] mission, NASA officials asked lunar module pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] to refrain from quoting the Bible in broadcasts. He was allowed to conduct the first [[Eucharist|communion]] service in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericmetaxas.com/writing/essays/buzz-aldrin-guideposts-article-full-text/ |title=An Astronaut Tells of a little-known but Significant Event on the Moon |year=1970 |publisher=Guideposts |access-date=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509052544/http://www.ericmetaxas.com/writing/essays/buzz-aldrin-guideposts-article-full-text/ |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-8-4.html|title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon: Chapter 8|year=|publisher=NASA|access-date=2012-04-25}} An urban legend claiming that NASA tried to keep the communion service secret has been disproven.{{cite web|url=http://www.hoax-slayer.com/communion-on-the-moon.shtml|title=First Communion on the Moon|year=2009|publisher=Christensen, B.M.|access-date=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Hair appeared on ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'' several times, including the first episode in 1967. Later  Donahue said that O'Hair was unpleasant in person and had mocked him off-camera for being a [[Catholicism|Catholic]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} She appeared on the show in March 1970 to debate Preacher Bob Harrington, "The Chaplain of Bourbon Street". 

O'Hair endorsed [[Jimmy Carter]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]] because of Carter's opposition to mandatory [[School prayer#United States|school prayer]], his support for [[sex education]] in public schools, and his stance on [[Ecology|ecological]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;"Atheist leader endorses Carter for President", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', [[Minden, Louisiana]], October 26, 1976, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Atheists==
{{Main|American Atheists}}
After settling in [[Austin, Texas]], O'Hair founded [[American Atheists]] in 1963. It identifies as "a nationwide movement which defends the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] of non-believers, works for the [[separation of church and state]] and addresses issues of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] public policy". She served as the group's first [[chief executive officer]] and president until 1986. She was the public voice and face of atheism in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. Although her son Garth Murray succeeded her officially as president, she retained most of the power and decisionmaking.

In a 1965 interview with ''[[Playboy]] Magazine'', she described religion as "a crutch" and an "irrational reliance on superstitions and supernatural nonsense".&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Madalyn |last2=Tregaskis |first2=Richard |authorlink2=Richard Tregaskis |title=Madalyn Murray |work=[[Playboy]] |date=October 1965 |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/quote-m4.htm |format=reprint |access-date=2007-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414174202/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/quote-m4.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same ''Playboy'' interview, O'Hair described numerous alleged incidents of harassment, intimidation, and death threats against her and her family. She read several letters she claimed to have received, including one that read (referring to the [[conversion of Paul the Apostle]] on the road to Damascus), "May Jesus, who you so vigorously deny, change you into a Paul." O'Hair told the interviewer, "Isn't that lovely? [[Christine Jorgensen]] had to go to [[Sweden]] for an operation, but ''me'' they'll fix with faith&amp;nbsp;— painlessly and for nothing."&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt; She said that she left Baltimore because of persecution from residents. She had received mail containing photos smeared with feces, her son Jon's pet kitten was killed, and her home was stoned. She said she thought such events were a catalyst for her father's fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;

She filed several lawsuits challenging governmental practices, based on upholding and defining the constitutional separation of church and state. Among these was one against the city of Baltimore's policy of classifying the Catholic Church as a tax-exempt organization in terms of property.&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;

O'Hair founded an atheist [[radio program]], in which she criticized [[religion]] and [[theism]]. She hosted a television show, ''American Atheist Forum'', which was carried on more than 140 [[cable television]] systems.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | last =Van Biema| first =David| title =Where's Madalyn?| work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date =1997-02-10| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985893-1,00.html| access-date =2007-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bryce |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Bryce (writer) |title=The Case of the Missing Atheists |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=1996-05-03 |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol15/issue35/pols.atheists.html |access-date=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrested for [[disorderly conduct]] in Austin in 1977,&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; O'Hair continued to be a polarizing figure into the 1980s. She served as "chief speechwriter" for [[Larry Flynt]]'s 1984 presidential campaign. She was regularly invited on to TV talk shows as a guest.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Her second son Garth Murray officially succeeded her as president of the American Atheists, but she was said to retain most of the power. Some chapters seceded from the main group at the time. But {{as of|2007|lc=y}}, American Atheists continued as an active organization with a growing membership.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

Her son [[William J. Murray]] became a [[Christian]] in 1980 and later a Baptist minister, publishing a memoir in 1982 about his spiritual journey. Murray O'Hair commented, "One could call this a postnatal abortion on the part of a mother, I guess; I repudiate him entirely and completely for now and all times&amp;nbsp;... he is beyond human forgiveness."&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://newrepublic.com/article/among-the-non-believers |title= Among the Non-Believers |author= Alan Wolfe |work= [[The New Republic]] |date= 12 April 2004 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dracos"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dracos |first1=Ted |authorlink1=Ted Dracos |title=Ungodly: The Passions, Torments, and Murder of Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair |year=2003 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=9781439119969 |page=138 |chapter=The Family Dysfunctional}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, O'Hair produced several issues of ''[[Truth Seeker]]'' under her [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] as part of an attempt to take over the publication. &lt;!-- Take it over from whom? AA? --&gt;But the courts ruled against her ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15303443792267349635|title=US District Court SD California: Jackson vs. Truth Seeker Inc.|work=google.com|access-date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, American Atheists staff consisted of O'Hair, her son Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair, her granddaughter and adopted daughter, and a handful of support personnel (Robin was the daughter of William J. Murray and his girlfriend). William was estranged from his mother, brother and daughter. They had not met nor spoken for many years. The trio lived in O'Hair's large home, worked in the same office, and took shared vacations.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

==Court cases==
O'Hair filed numerous lawsuits in which she argued the separation of church and state had been breached.
*''[[Abington School District v. Schempp|Murray v. Curlett]]'' (1963) Challenged Bible reading and prayer recitation in Maryland public schools.
*''Murray v. United States'' (1964) To force the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to extend the [[Fairness Doctrine]] so that Atheists could have equal time with religion on radio and television.

==Feminism==
During an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1965, O'Hair described herself as a "militant feminist" and expressed her dissatisfaction with women's inequality in America, stating during the interview:

{{quote|The American male continues to use her sexually for one thing: a means to the end of his own ejaculation. It doesn't seem to occur to him that she might be a worthwhile end in herself, or to see to it that she has a proper sexual release. And, to him, sex appeal is directly proportional to the immensity of a woman's tits. I'm not saying that all American men are this way, but nine out of ten are breast-fixated, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am cretins who just don't give a damn about anyone's gratification but their own. If you're talking about intellectual and social equality for women, we're not much better off. We're just beginning to break the ice. America is still very much a male-dominated society. Most American men feel threatened sexually unless they're taller than the female, more intellectual, better educated, better paid and higher placed statuswise in the business world. They've got to be the authority, the final word. They say they're looking for a girl just like the girl who married dear old dad, but what they really want, and usually get, is an empty-headed little chick who's very young and very physical&amp;nbsp;— and very submissive. Well, I just can't see either a man or a woman in a dependency position, because from this sort of relationship flows a feeling of superiority on one side and inferiority on the other, and that's a form of slow poison. As I see it, men wouldn't want somebody inferior to them unless they felt inadequate themselves. They're intimidated by a mature woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antitheists.co.uk/madalyn-murray-ohair-playboy-interview.php|title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair Playboy Interview - Antitheist Atheist|access-date=18 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121546/http://www.antitheists.co.uk/madalyn-murray-ohair-playboy-interview.php#|archive-date=November 10, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

She also expressed her discontent with the [[women's liberation movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fECcidFL5NU|title=Madalyn Murray O'Hair 1970 Short Film Part 6|access-date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping and murder==
On August 27, 1995, O'Hair, her son Garth Murray, and granddaughter Robin Murray O'Hair disappeared from their home and office.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; A typewritten note was attached to the locked office door, saying "The Murray O'Hair family has been called out of town on an emergency basis. We do not know how long we will be gone at the time of the writing of this memo." When police entered O'Hair's home, it looked as they had left suddenly.&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;{{cite web| last =Manning| first =Lona| title =The Murder of Madalyn Murray O'Hair: America's Most Hated Woman| work =Crime Magazine| date =2003-09-29| url =http://crimemagazine.com/ohair.htm| access-date =2007-12-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012112923/http://crimemagazine.com/ohair.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio said in phone calls that they were on "business" in [[San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Garth Murray ordered [[United States dollar|US$]]600,000 worth of gold coins from a San Antonio jeweler, but took delivery of only $500,000 worth of coins.&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web| last =MacCormack| first =John| title =Lucky Break| work =[[Dallas Observer]]| date =1999-07-29| url =http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-07-29/news/lucky-break/| access-date =2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until September 27, American Atheists employees received several phone calls from Robin and Jon, but neither  explained why they had left or when they would return; employees reported that their voices sounded strained and disturbed.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; After September 28, no further communication came from any of the three. American Atheists was facing serious financial problems because of the withdrawal of funds, and membership dwindled in the face of an apparent scandal. There was speculation that the trio may have disappeared to conceal assets or avoid creditors.&lt;ref name=Epstein-Walker/&gt;

===Investigation and arrests===

Ultimately, the investigation focused on [[David Roland Waters]], an ex-felon with a violent history, who had worked for American Atheists. He had pleaded guilty earlier that year to stealing $54,000 from the organization.&lt;ref name="preying"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bryce |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Bryce (writer) |title=Preying on Atheists |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=1999-06-04 |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/1999-06-04/522124/|access-date =2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his theft was discovered, O'Hair had published an article in the American Atheists newsletter exposing the theft and previous crimes.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt; O'Hair claimed that, at age 17, Waters had killed another teenager. Waters had been sentenced to prison for eight years.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="preying" /&gt;

Federal agents for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], along with the police, concluded that Waters and his accomplices had kidnapped all three Murray/O'Hair family members, forced them to withdraw the missing funds, gone on several shopping sprees with their money and credit cards, and killed and dismembered all three people.&lt;ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001&gt;{{cite news |title=Bodies Identified as Those of Missing Atheist and Kin |first=Ross E. |last=Milloy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/16/us/bodies-identified-as-those-of-missing-atheist-and-kin.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 16, 2001 |access-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waters' accomplices were Gary Paul Karr and Danny Fry.&lt;ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 /&gt; A few days after O'Hair and her family were killed, Waters and Karr killed Fry. His body was found on a riverbed with the head and hands missing. It was not identified for three and a half years.&lt;ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 /&gt;

A search warrant was executed for the apartment of Waters and his girlfriend. The search produced various calibers of ammunition. Waters, a convicted felon, was arrested, and the contents of his flat were seized.  At the same time, Gary Karr was contacted in [[Walled Lake, Michigan]], and interviewed. Having served the last 30 years in prison for kidnapping a judge's daughter, Karr would not talk. He was read his rights and asked to listen to the information being discussed. Karr decided to talk and implicated Waters in the deaths of Murray and the O'Hairs. Karr signed an affidavit and drew a map so that the police could find the bodies. Karr was arrested for possession of two firearms and taken to jail. He was held in [[Detroit]], awaiting trial. The weapon charge was dismissed, and Karr was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals in Austin to stand trial for the deaths of the O'Hairs.

After a three-week trial, Karr was found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion, traveling interstate to commit violent acts, money laundering, and interstate transportation of stolen property, all charges related to the O'Hair case. He was acquitted of charges of conspiring to kidnap, because the authorities had not yet located the bodies of the O'Hairs.&lt;ref name=Milloy_03_16_2001 /&gt; In August 2000, Karr was sentenced to two life sentences in prison by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks.&lt;ref name=Vertuno_01_25_2001&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=20010125&amp;id=n1IeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8scEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3789,2994716 Jim Vertuno (January 25, 2001), ''Times Daily'', "Judge closes hearing in O'Hair disappearance"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters was arrested and prosecuted; he was found guilty of kidnapping, robbery, and homicide in the O'Hair cases, and sentenced to 80 years in prison.&lt;ref name="mcanally"&gt;{{cite news|last=McAnally |first=Amber |title=Waters sentenced for role in O'Hair murder |work=[[The Daily Texan]] |date=2001-04-02 |url=http://tspweb02.tsp.utexas.edu/webarchive/04-02-01/2001040207_s03_Waters.html |access-date=2007-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118160820/http://tspweb02.tsp.utexas.edu/webarchive/04-02-01/2001040207_s03_Waters.html |archivedate=January 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also ordered to pay back a total of $543,665 to the United Secularists of America and to the estates of Madalyn Murray O'Hair, Jon Garth Murray, and Robin Murray O'Hair. It is unlikely that these debts were paid, because Waters had no ability to earn money while in prison. Waters died of [[lung cancer]] on January 27, 2003 at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Butner|Federal Medical Center]] in [[Butner, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt;

In January 2001, after his conviction and imprisonment, Waters told the federal agents that the O'Hairs were buried on a Texas ranch, and subsequently led them to the bodies.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mac" /&gt; When law enforcement excavated there, they discovered that the legs of the three people had been cut off with a saw. The remains had such extensive mutilation and [[decomposition]] that officials had to identify them through [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]], [[DNA]] testing and, in Madalyn O'Hair's case, records of a prosthetic hip from [[Brackenridge Hospital]] in Austin (the product number identified her body).&lt;ref name="giveaway"&gt;{{cite web| last =MacCormack| first =John| title =Dead Giveaway| work =[[Dallas Observer]]| date =2001-02-01| url =http://www.dallasobserver.com/2001-02-01/news/dead-giveaway/| access-date =2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head and hands of Danny Fry were also found at the site.

Waters and his girlfriend had put the gold coins extorted from the O'Hairs in an unsecured storage locker rented by the girlfriend. It had only a cheap [[Master Lock|Master]] padlock.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt; Waters had taken some coins and partied for a few days with Gary Karr and his former wife. When he returned to the locker, he discovered that the remaining gold coins ([[American gold eagle|American eagles]], [[Canadian Gold Maple Leaf|Maple Leafs]], and [[Krugerrand]]s) had been stolen. A group of thieves from San Antonio operating in that area had gained keys to the type of lock used by the girlfriend. In the course of their activities, the thieves had come across the locker, used a key, and found a suitcase full of gold coins. They returned to San Antonio, and with the help of friends, converted the gold coins to cash. The friends were taken to [[Las Vegas]] for a weekend. All but one coin, given as a pendant gift to an aunt, were spent by these thieves. That last coin was recovered by the FBI after a Memorial Day 1999 public appeal.&lt;ref name="manning" /&gt;

During the case, Austin reporter [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] criticized the relative lack of action by the [[Austin Police Department]]. He noted the investigation was being led by agents of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the Dallas County Sheriff's Office.&lt;ref name="preying" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

Murray's 1960 lawsuit against the Baltimore City School System was later consolidated with a similar one from a Pennsylvania, when these reached the US Supreme Court on appeal. The Court ruled in 1963 that the practice of compulsory Bible reading in public schools was unconstitutional. This decision gradually resulted in the end of religious activities sponsored by public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People &amp; Ideas: Madalyn Murray O'Hair|url=https://www.pbs.org/godinamerica/people/madalyn-murray-ohair.html|work=God In America|publisher=PBS|access-date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-religious students were expected to participate in such activities, and state-level policies varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Jean L.|editor2-last=Laborde|editor2-first=Cecile|title=Religion, Secularism, and Constitutional Democracy|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=2016|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the first atheist monument to be erected on American government property was unveiled at the [[Bradford County, Florida|Bradford County]] Courthouse in Florida, where other residents had installed a monument to religious ideals. It is a 1,500-pound granite bench and [[plinth]] inscribed with quotes by O'Hair, [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The [[American Atheists]] said they planned to build 50 more monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_f9a8713c-e2cf-11e2-b9d8-001a4bcf887a.html|title=First atheist monument on government property unveiled|work=The Independent Florida Alligator|access-date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/29/atheists-unveil-monument-in-florida-and-promise-to-build-50-more/|title=Atheists unveil monument in Florida and promise to build 50 more|publisher=|access-date=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
Persistent urban myths were told about Murray O'Hair threatening certain TV programs because of so-called religious content. These have been disproved. A 2009 variation of Petition 2493 claims that [[American Atheists]] want the "Removal of [[Joel Osteen]], [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Charles Stanley]], [[David Jeremiah]] and other pastors from the air waves". Purportedly [[James Dobson]] asks petitioners to send responses and donations to "Lisa Norman". Snopes.com says that it is an urban myth.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/fcc.asp |title=Petition to Ban Religious Broadcasting |last=Mikkelson |first=Barbara |date=2009-06-02 |publisher=snopes.com |access-date=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FF"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://family.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/489/~/ive-received-an-e-mail-about-prayers-and-signatures-needed-to-stop-petition | title=I've received an e-mail about prayers and signatures needed to stop Petition 2493.

A 2017 [[Netflix]] original movie, ''[[The Most Hated Woman in America]]'', is a loose dramatization of O'Hair's life. It focuses on the abductions and killings of O'Hair and two family members in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/20/the-most-hated-woman-in-america-melissa-leo-on-the-murder-of-atheist-madalyn-murray-o-hair.html|title='The Most Hated Woman in America': Melissa Leo on the Murder of Atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=2017-03-21|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magic sword pendants''' are rare and small finds, so people sometimes do not know how to interpret these finds. These finds are usually related to the Sarmatians and the Huns as magic pendants or sword decoration.

== Description ==
Magic sword pendants are small, round, discoid, semi-spherical or nearly spherical objects. They are about 50–70&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter; sometimes, they are flat on one side. Magic sword pendants are usually made of glass, semi-precious stones (e.g. [[jade]], [[chalcedony]], [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] or [[Rock-Crystal|rock crystal]]). There are also objects made of [[amber]]. Sword pendants were usually located near sword hilts. They may have been anchored or attached to the sword hilt.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biborski|first=Marcin|last2=Kaczanowski|first2=Piotr|date=2013|title=Magic sword pendants|url=|journal=Jamé|volume=|pages=423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dating and place of occurrence ==
These objects were used from the 2nd century to the 5th century AD, until the so-called [[Merovingian period]], and the area where these artifacts are found stretches from Western and Northern Europe to [[Western Siberia]]. Magic sword pendants were probably produced at Roman sites and in the environment of the [[Sarmatians]] and the [[Huns]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Examples of finds ==
Examples of finds from Barbaricum: Tiszalok, Dura-Europos, Vimose, Illerup, Thorsberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biborski|first=Marcin|last2=Kaczanowski|first2=Piotr|date=2013|title=Magic sword pendants|url=|journal=Jamé|volume=|pages=424|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(red.) Wielka Historia Polski, t. I, Kraków, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Find from Jakuszowice ===
Jakuszowice is a village located in southern Poland about 50&amp;nbsp;km northeast from Cracow. In 1911 people found a grave of a young man there, which was dated to the 5th century AD. In this grave, the following artifacts were found: a sword, a reflective arch, fittings and a belt buckle, horse harness and circle magic sword pendants made of amber with [[almandine]] mounted on top of it and set in gold binding. The buried man could have been a person belonging to the elite, because of rich equipment of the grave. He may have been connected with  Huns, which is suggested by a reflective arch motive of gold foil, characteristic of Huns’ graves.&lt;ref&gt;Kaczanowski P., (1998) ''Obraz kulturowy okresu wpływów rzymskich i wczesnej fazy okresu wędrówek ludów na ziemiach polskich i terenach ościennych'', (w) Pieszczachowicz J.

[[File:MedicineLkHighlands09272017-50.tif|250px|thumb|Medicine Lake Volcano, California, September 27, 2017, [[Sentinel-2]] true-color [[satellite image]], scale 1:50,000.]]

'''Medicine Lake Volcano''' is a large [[shield volcano]] in northeastern [[California]]  about {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1|disp=flip}} northeast of [[Mount Shasta]]. The [[volcano]] is located in a zone of east-west crustal extension east of the main axis of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]] and the [[Cascade Range]]. The {{convert|1|km|mi|1|disp=flip|adj=on}} thick shield is {{convert|35|km|mi|0|disp=flip}} from east to west and {{convert|45|to|50|km|mi|0|disp=flip}} from north to south, and covers more than {{convert|2000|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|disp=flip}}. The underlying rock has downwarped by {{convert|0.5|km|mi|1|disp=flip}} under the center of the volcano. The volcano is primarily composed of [[basalt]] and [[basaltic andesite]] lava flows, and has a {{convert|7|by|12|km|mi|1||disp=flip|adj=on}} [[caldera]] at the center.

The Medicine Lake shield rises about {{convert|1200|m|ft|sigfig=2|disp=flip}} above the [[Modoc Plateau]] to an elevation of {{convert|2376|m|ft|0|disp=flip}}. [[Lava]]s from Medicine Lake Volcano are estimated to be at least {{convert|600|km3|cumi|sigfig=2|disp=flip}} in [[volume]], making Medicine Lake the largest volcano by volume in the Cascade Range ([[Newberry Volcano]] in Oregon has the second largest volume). [[Lava Beds National Monument]] lies on the northeast flank of the volcano.

Medicine Lake Volcano has been active for 500,000 years. The eruptions were gentle rather than explosive like [[Mount St. Helens]], coating the volcano's sides with flow after flow of basaltic lava. Medicine Lake is part of the old caldera, a bowl-shaped depression in the mountain. It is believed that the Medicine Lake volcano is unique, having many small magma chambers rather than one large one.

==Caldera==
Medicine Lake is in the caldera of the volcano, which measures {{convert|7|by|12|km|mi|1|disp=flip}}. The caldera may have formed by collapse after a large volume of [[andesite]] was erupted from vents along the caldera rim. The distribution of late [[Pleistocene]] vents, mostly concentrated along the rim, suggests that ring faults already existed when most of the andesite erupted. No single large eruption has been related to caldera formation. The only eruption recognized to have produced [[Volcanic ash|ash]] flow [[tuff]] occurred in late Pleistocene time, and this eruption was too small to account for formation of the caldera. Later conclusions were that Medicine Lake caldera formed by collapse in response to repeated extrusions of mostly mafic lava beginning early in the history of the volcano (perhaps in a manner similar to the formation of [[Kilauea]] caldera in [[Hawaii]]). Several small differentiated magma bodies may have been fed by and interspersed among a plexus of [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[Sill (geology)|sill]]s. Late [[Holocene]] andesitic to rhyolitic lavas were derived by fractionation, assimilation, and mixing from high alumina basalt parental magma. The small lake from which Medicine Lake volcano derives its name lies within the central caldera.

==Eruptive history==

===Early history===
Medicine Lake Volcano began to grow about one million years ago in [[Pleistocene]] time, following the eruption of a large volume of tholeiitic high-[[alumina]] basalt. Similar high-alumina basalt has continued to erupt around the volcano throughout its history. Although [[mafic]] lavas predominate on the volcano's flanks, all lava compositions from basalt to [[rhyolite]] have erupted during Pleistocene time. The lower flanks consist of mostly basaltic and some andesitic lavas. Basalt is mostly absent at higher elevation, where andesite dominates and rhyolite and small volumes of dacite are present. During the past 11,000 years, eruptive activity at Medicine Lake Volcano has been episodic. Eight eruptions produced about {{convert|5.3|km3|cumi|1|disp=flip}} of basaltic lava during a time interval of a few hundred years about 10,500 years ago. That eruptive episode was followed by a hiatus that ended with a small andesitic eruption about 4,300 years ago. During the most recent eruptive episode between 3000 and 900 years ago, eight eruptions produced approximately {{convert|2.5|km3|cumi|1|disp=flip}} of lava ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite. Late Holocene lava compositions include basalt and andesite, but [[silica|silicic]] lavas dominate.

Eruptive activity during [[Holocene]] time has included numerous rhyolite and dacite lava flows erupted at high elevations inside and outside the caldera; cinder cones and associated lava flows of basalt and basaltic andesite have resulted from eruptions at vents on the flanks of the shield. Most vents are aligned along zones of crustal weakness that trend northeast to northwest.

=== Glass Mountain ===
[[Image:Glass Mountain.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Glass Mountain from Medicine Lake caldera rim. USGS photo by Julie Donnelly-Nolan.]]
The most recent eruption occurred around 1,000 years ago when [[rhyolite]] and [[dacite]] erupted at Glass Mountain and associated vents near the caldera's eastern rim.  Fitch cites reports that a light ash fall that occurred in 1910 may have come from a small eruption at Glass Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass Mountain consists of a spectacular, nearly [[tree]]less, steep-sided rhyolite and dacite [[obsidian]] flow that erupted just outside the eastern caldera rim and flowed down the steep eastern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano. Ten additional small domes of Glass Mountain rhyolite and rhyodacite lava lie on a N25degreesW trend to the north and one to the south. The age of Glass Mountain and its preceding pumice deposits has been a matter of discussion for some time. A [[radiocarbon dating]] age of 885±40 years before present (1990) was obtained on a dead [[incense-cedar]] tree without limbs or bark that is preserved in the edge of one of the distal tongues of the flow. The dated material consisted of a piece of exterior wood containing about 30 annual growth rings. This age may be too old, because some of the outside of the tree is missing. The [[tephra]] deposits that precede the flow and domes may be somewhat older but are constrained to be less than about 1050 years before present (1990) by the Little Glass Mountain and [[Lassen Peak]] data.

[[Image:Melchor Ocampo.jpg|thumb|220px|Melchor Ocampo]]

'''Melchor Ocampo''' (5 January 1814, [[Maravatío]], [[Intendancy of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Kingdom of Mexico|Mexico]], [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] – 3 June 1861, [[Tepeji del Río]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]) was a [[mestizo]] by birth, a radical [[Liberalism in Mexico|liberal]] Mexican lawyer, scientist, and politician. He was fiercely [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]], perhaps an [[atheist]], and his early writings against Roman Catholic Church in Mexico gained him a reputation as an articulate liberal ideologue.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', New York: HarperCollins 1997, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Ocampo has been considered the heir to [[José María Luis Mora]], the premier liberal intellectual of the early republic.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Bazant, "From Independence to the Liberal Republic, 1821-1867" in ''Mexico Since Independence'', [[Leslie Bethell]], ed. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the administration of [[Benito Juárez]] and negotiated a controversial agreement with the United States, the [[McLane-Ocampo Treaty]].  His home state was much later renamed [[Michoacán de Ocampo]] in his honor.

==Early life==
Melchor Ocampo was perhaps orphaned and left abandoned at the gate of a hacienda of wealthy woman, Doña Francisca Xaviera Tapia, who raised him as her own and bequeathed him her property.&lt;ref name=Krauze&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krauze|first1=Enrique|year=1997|title=Mexico: A Biography of Power|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|pages=152–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 213. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocampo studied at the Roman Catholic seminary in [[Morelia, Michoacán]], and later law at the Colegio Seminario de México (Universidad Pontificia). He began working in a law office in 1833. For unknown reasons, he left the practice of law and returned to his hacienda, perhaps because of its imminent bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Quirarte, "Melchor Ocampo" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1034. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, he traveled to France, where he was influenced by liberal and [[anticlericalism|anticlerical ideas]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and following the [[French Revolution]]. He returned after a year to Michoacán to work his lands, practice law, investigate the region's flora and fauna, and study the local [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, he entered politics in Michoacan, in opposition to [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].

Ocampo was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Mexico|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1842. In 1844, [[Manuel Gómez Pedraza]] became [[president of Mexico]] and appointed Ocampo [[Governor of Michoacán]]. during the [[US-Mexico War|U.S. Invasion]] (1846–48). He was an activist governor, reorganizing the state treasury, building roads, proposing the founding of schools, and improving the conditions of the national guard in Michoacán. During the Mexican–American War he recruited troops without conscription or increased taxes, but solely by persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Quirarte, "Melchor Ocampo", p. 1034.&lt;/ref&gt; Ocampo urged that the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the Mexican–American War be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 214. Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As governor, Ocampo appointed [[Santos Degollado]] the rector of the Colegio de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, where revolutionary [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] had served prior to his exile to the village of Dolores.  Degollado later was murdered seeking the murderers of his patron Ocampo.&lt;ref&gt;D.F. Stevens, "Santos Degollado" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, pp. 363-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocampo's beliefs were fiercely [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] and challenged the power of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Mexico]]. He viewed the church as sucking wealth from indigenous people with high clerical fees for ecclesiastical services, and impeding progress. He pointed to high clerical fees for ecclesiastical services and the proliferation of fiestas, which encouraged idleness and drunkenness. These provided income for local priests as well as further impoverishing indigenous people who bought candles, incense, and fireworks. Clerical fees for Christian sacraments meant that birth, marriage, and death generated income for priests who charged for baptism, holy matrimony, and burial. A vivid story he related about this practice concerned a peasant who could not afford the burial fees for his son and asked for a free burial. "The priest refused, contending that 'this was what he lived on.' The poor man had asked, 'Sir, what shall I do with my dead son?' and the priest had answered him, 'Salt him and eat him'."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 153-54, from Melchor Ocampo, ''Obras completas'', vol. 1, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The church had the responsibility for education in Mexico and like other aspects of the church's role in Mexico, access was based on the ability to pay.  Ocampo advocated free, public, secular education in Mexico. He believed that education had to be grounded on the basic postulates of [[liberalism]], [[democracy]], respect and tolerance for different beliefs, equality before the law, the elimination of privileges, and the supremacy of civil authority. Many of these ideas were later codified in the [[Reform laws]] and the liberal [[Constitution of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;Quirarte, "Melchor Ocampo", p. 1034.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began a published polemical debate with a priest or a group of priests in Michoacán about the reform of clerical fees. Historian [[Enrique Krauze]] suggests that the priest was probably Clemente de Jesús Mungía, the bishop of [[Morelia]], the state capital.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Ocampo was subsequently deposed as governor and was forced to flee the country by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], taking refuge first in [[Cuba]] and then in the U.S. city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. In New Orleans he met a group of fellow liberal exiles, including [[Benito Juárez]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo" p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Ocampo began to publish pamphlets to promote political change in Mexico. He returned to Mexico in 1855 following the successful ouster of Santa Anna under the [[Plan of Ayutla|Plan de Ayutla]]. The plan had called for the overthrow of Santa Anna and the installation of the liberal general [[Juan Álvarez]] as president of Mexico. With Álvarez's victory, Ocampo served briefly in his cabinet as foreign minister, but when Álvarez stepped down and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] became president, Ocampo returned to Michoacán.  He was then elected to the Constitutional Convention that drafted the liberal [[Constitution of 1857]], which included strong provisions for the [[separation of Church and State]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo," p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juárez Administration (1858-61)===
During Benito Juárez's administration during the civil war between liberals and conservatives, known as the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]], Ocampo served in various high posts, including Minister of the Interior, with responsibility also for foreign affairs, defense, and the treasury. Ocampo became embroiled in a bitter dispute about the implementation of the [[Lerdo Law]], which called for the sale of property of corporations, meaning the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities which was aimed at undermining the economic power of the church and creating a yeoman peasantry of small landowners. Ocampo charged that the law was counterproductive, strengthening the power of the church and preventing the acquisition of land by those of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo," p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most controversial act of Ocampo was negotiating the [[McLane-Ocampo Treaty]] in 1859, when he served the Liberal government of Benito Juárez. The regime was strapped for cash to pursue the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]] against conservatives. In the [[Veracruz, Veracruz|port of Veracruz]], on 14 December 1859, acting on Juárez's orders, he and [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico|U.S. Ambassador]] [[Robert Milligan McLane]] signed the treaty. This controversial treaty would have awarded the United States perpetual transit rights, for its armies and merchandise, through three zones of Mexico's territory: the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]; a corridor running from [[Guaymas, Sonora]], to [[Nogales, Arizona]]; and a second transoceanic route from  [[Mazatlán, Sinaloa]], on the Pacific to [[Brownsville, Texas]], on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The treaty was aimed at getting U.S. recognition for the [[Benito Juárez|Juárez]] government and gain the regime two million dollars in much needed funding. Ocampo did attach an appendix, attempting to protect Mexican sovereignty. Although presidents [[Benito Juárez|Juárez]] and [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] were both in favor of the arrangement, the [[U.S. Senate]] rejected it on 31 May 1860 on account of the impending [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Vicente Quirarte, "Melchor Ocampo" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1034. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocampo traveled to the U.S. to ascertain if that it would support the liberal cause if they were unable to defeat the conservatives on the battlefield. The treaty exacerbated the rancor between Ocampo and [[Miguel Lerdo de Tejada]] and Ocampo resigned from Juárez's cabinet in January 1860,.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo," p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Juárez rejected the treaty in November 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Hamnett, ''Juárez'', p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the defeat of the conservatives in the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]] in 1860, Mexican presidential elections were held. Ocampo might have been a candidate, but backed Juárez against his rival Miguel Lerdo. "Juárez may have needed the such help, for even though president, he was viewed by many as second rate in comparison to Ocampo and Lerdo."&lt;ref&gt;Bazant, "From Independence to the Liberal Republic," p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1861, both Miguel Lerdo and Ocampo were both dead, with Ocampo murdered by conservative guerrillas after he returned to civilian life.

== Death ==
Some months after retiring from public service, Melchor Ocampo was abducted from his hacienda in Michoacán by conservative guerrillas on orders from either [[Leonardo Márquez]] or [[Félix María Zuloaga]] or both (reports differ). Historian [[Enrique Krauze]] gives a vivid account of Ocampo's last days, saying that Ocampo's captors allowed him to write his will, where he recognized his natural daughters and identified their mother, information the children did not know. Ocampo was executed by firing squad on 3 June 1861 at the Hacienda of Tlaltengo, [[Tepeji del Río]], in what is today the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. After the firing squad, his execution included "the finishing bullet in the head, [and] they hung the body of Melchor Ocampo from a tree."&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: Harper Collins 1997, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; His loyal follower, [[Santos Degollado]], pursued Ocampo's executioners and "was [[himself]] ambushed, captured, and executed by the conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Santos Degollado", p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Ocampo's murder was a scandal, and Juárez's government took "more extreme measures" to repress the conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, "Melchor Ocampo," p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of Ocampo are interred in the [[Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres]] in Mexico City.

==Legacy==
He participated in writing new Civil Laws, that in the end would give sense to liberal politics and would end up amending the Constitution from 1857, in order to make civil and political matters independent from ecclesiastic ones. On July 23, 1859, D. Benito Juarez, interim president then, issues, at the Port of Veracruz, the "Civil Matrimony Law", which has 31 Articles. In Article 15, as a way of ceremonial formalization, the famous epistle, attributed to Melchor Ocampo, was included; and which reads as follows:

:::I declare on behalf of Law and Society that you are united in legitimate matrimony with all rights and privileges granted by law, and with the obligations imposed; and also declare:

:::“That this is the only moral mean to establish a family, to conserve the human species and to make up for the imperfections of an individual who cannot provide for itself to reach mankind’s perfection. This doesn’t exist in a single person, but in spousal duality. Those married must be and will be sacred to each other, even more than what they are to each self.

:::The man, whose main sexual attributes are courage and strength, must give and shall always give the woman protection, food, and direction, treating her always as the most delicate, sensible, and finest part of himself, and with magnanimity and generous benevolence that a strong being owes the weak, essentially when this weak delivers to himself, and also when Society has entrusted him.

:::The woman, whose main attributes are self denial, beauty, compassion, shrewdness and tenderness, must give and shall always give the husband obedience, pleasantness, assistance, comfort, and advice; treating him always with the veneration owed to the person supporting and defending us, and with the delicacy of whom doesn’t want to exasperate the abrupt, irritable and harsh part of him, which is of his nature.

:::One to another are owed and shall always give respect, deference, fidelity, trust, and tenderness; both will take care of what they were expecting from each other by joining together, and that this will not be contradicted by this union. That both shall be prudent and attenuate their faults. You shall never say insults to each other, because insults among the married dishonors the one saying them, and proves the lack of judgment or common sense of election; and much less shall physically mistreat each other, because it is vile and cowardly to use force.

:::Both shall prepare with the study, friendly and mutual correction of their defects, up to the supreme judgeship of being family parents, in order to when both become that, your children can find in you good example and good conduct to serve as role models. The doctrine that you inspire in these tender and loved bonds of affection will make your luck to prosper or to be adverse; and the happiness or misfortune of your children will be the parent’s reward or punishment, fortune or sadness.

:::Society blesses, believes, and praises good parents, for the great good they do to it, for giving them good and courteous citizens; and the same properly censures and despises those, that by abandonment, or misgiving affection, or by setting bad example, corrupt the sacred depot that nature trusted them with, for granting them such children.

:::And last, when Society sees that such said persons did not deserve to be elevated to have the honor to become parents, but merely should have lived subject to guardianship, incapable of conducting themselves with dignity, grieves for establishing with its authority the union of a man and a woman who have failed to be free and to conduct themselves towards good.”

This is Ocampo's best-known legacy from 1859, which is known as the [[epistle]] on marriage, still read out nowadays by judges presiding over civil weddings in many states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7590">'''Mir''' ({{lang|fa|{{nq|مير}}}}) (which is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] title ''[[Emir]]'' 'general, prince') is a rare ruler's title in princely states and an [[aristocratic]] title generally used to refer to a person who is a descendant of a commander in medieval [[Muslim]] tradition.

It was adopted in many languages under Islamic influence, such as [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]],&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;Zetterstéen (1986), p. 446&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sindhi language]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Kashmiri language]], [[language]] and [[Pashto language]] meaning leader of a group or tribe.
According to the book [[Persian Inscriptions on Indian Monuments]], ''Mir'' is most probably an Arabized form of ''Pir''. [[Pir (Sufism)|''Pir'']]  in [[Old Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]] means the old, the wise man, the chief and the great leader. Pir is a religious leader' title for [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Alevi]] and [[Yarsanism]] faith meaning old and wise spiritual leader. Amir, meaning "Lord" or "commander-in-chief", is derived from the Arabic root a-m-r, "command".

Today, some Pakistani grandparents call their grandson ''mir'', and some Pakistani babysitters call the child who they look after ''mir'' if the child is a boy.

== Title ==
=== Ruling princes ===
In Muslim [[princely state]]s of British India, few rulers were formally styled ''Mir'', notably in present [[Pakistan]], where only two of the six have actually reached the level of [[salute state]], becoming entitled to a gun salute and the attached form of address ''His Highness'':
* the Mir of [[Khairpur (princely state)|Khayrpur]] (Khairpur) (17 guns), a [[Rajputana]] part of present Pakistan's Sindh province, under a branch of the [[Talpur clan]]
* the [[Mir of Hunza]] (15 guns), senior among the many Pashtun Northwestern Frontier states

The following all remained non-salute states :
* the Mir of [[Mirpur State]], under a branch of the above Talpur clan, in Sind(h)
* the Mir of [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]]; from 1921, restyled Sardar Bahador Nawwab, till 1940 a vassal of the Khan and Wali of [[Khalat]] (the senior ruler in British/[[Pakistani Baluchistan]])
* petty [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] ''Northwestern Frontier states''
** the Mir of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb (Tanawal)]], capital Darband; from 1868, restyled [[Nawwab]]; from 1921 promoted Nawwab Bahador
** the Mir of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]], in the northern part of [[Gilgit–Baltistan]].
** the Mir of [[Jandala State]], a petty [[Rajput]] North Frontier state

=== Honorary title ===
''Mir'' was also used as an honor rank. (See: [[Mirza]])
In [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], ''mir'' is also an honorific title give to The [[Khan of Kalat]] and a ''[[sardar]]'' son or brother. When a ''mir'' has twelve ''mirs'' under him he becomes a [[sardar]]. It is given as well to people in religion. ''Sayyid'' sons or brothers remain as such until they fulfill the complete Islam requirement and hold the title of ''mir'' instead of ''sayyid''.

The title ''mir'' was also used by members of the chief clans of the [[Soomro]] and [[Talpur]] tribe before and after they became rulers of [[Sindh]]. Today, it is still used by their descendants.

== Compound titles ==
On the Indian subcontinent, since the Mughal period, various compounds were used in [[Urdu]] including:

* combined Indian princely styles, notably [[Sahibzada mir]]
*'''Mīr-tuzak''' or ''tǒzak'': Marshal, in the sense of an officer who maintains order in a march or procession; master of the ceremonies
*'''Mīr-dah''' or ''Mīr-daha'': Commander or superintendent of ten: decurion; a [[Tithingman]]
*'''Mīr-[[sāmān]]''': Head steward
*'''Mīr-[[shikār]]''': Master of the hunt, chief huntsman; also [[Falconry|Grand Falconer]]; hence bird-catcher, and (metaphorically) a pimp
*'''Mīr-ě-ātash''' or ''Mīr-ātish'': Chief of the fireworks; also Commandant of artillery, Master of the ordnance
*'''Mīr-ě-majlis''', shortened ''Mīr-majlis'': Master of the ceremonies or president, chairman of a [[majlis]] (assembly)
*'''Mīr-[[mahalla]]''': Headman of a ''mahal(la)'', i.e. quarter (of a town)
*'''Mīr-ě-manzil''', shortened ''Mīr-manzil'': Overseer of the halting-places; Quartermaster-general
*'''Mīr-[[munshī]]''': Chief secretary; Head (native) clerk of a (colonial) office.

In the [[Hindu]] kingdom of [[Nepal]]:
*'''Mir Munshi''', from the Arabic [[Amir-i-Munshi]], 'commander of the secretaries', is the Chief Secretary of the Foreign Office.
*'''Mir Umrao''', from the Arabic [[Amir ul-Umara]], 'commander of commanders': a senior military officer ranking below a [[Sardar]] and charged with the command of a fort and surrounding territories, the training and equipment of soldiers and the supply of material.

In the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] kingdom of [[Balochistan]] :
*'''[[Mir Chakar Rind]]''', Ruler of Balochistan in the 15th Century.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], ''mir-i miran'' was used as the Persian equivalent to the Turkish title ''[[beylerbey]]'' ("bey of beys"), alongside the Arabic equivalent ''[[amir al-umara]]'' ("emir of emirs").&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;

== See also ==
* There are several cities and towns in [[Pakistan]] named after this very princely title. These include [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]], in [[Kashmir]], and [[Mirpurkhas]], in [[Sindh]].
* In the tribal societies of South Asia, many people used this word with or as rather as part of their names e.g. Mir Murtaza Bhutto, as happens with many titles (especially [[Khan (title)|khan]]), not only those holding a position as tribal or other leader.
* [[Mir (tribe)|Mir]] is a prominent family name among people of Kashmiri origin in Punjab province of [[Pakistan]].
* [[Amir]] (later Amir Nawwab) of [[Bahawalpur]])

'''Nigrodhārāma''' was a [[Banyan]] [[Grove (nature)|grove]] near [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], where a residence was provided for the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he visited the city in the first year after his Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;MA.i.289&lt;/ref&gt; It belonged to a [[Sakya|Sākyan]] named Nigrodha, the monk who made Ashoka, the Mauryan Emperor a Buddhist; who gave it to the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Monastic Order]]. The Nigrodharama is located at the site of the modern Kudan village, about six kilometres south of [[Tilaurakot]], the citadel of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]].{{cn|date=June 2016}} The precise location of Nigrodharama is at the following coordinates: {{coord|27.528186|N|83.040757|E|type:landmark_region:NP|display=inline,title}}.

==Events at the Nigrodharama==

It was at the Nigrodharama that [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mahāpajāpati Gotamī]] first asked permission for women to enter the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Order]]. This was refused, and from there the Buddha went on to [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesāli]].&lt;ref&gt;Vin.ii.253; A.iv.274&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha stayed at the Nigrodhārāma on several occasions, and several Vinaya rules are mentioned as being first promulgated there.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Vin.iii.235, 244; iv.55, 101, 167, 181, 262, 314&lt;/ref&gt; Various Sākyans came to see the Buddha at the Nigrodhārāma, among them, Mahānāma, [[Godha]], [[Sarakani|Sarakāni]], [[Nandiya]] and [[Vappa]].&lt;ref&gt;S.v.369 78; 395 7, 403 4, 408; A.ii.196; iii.284; iv.220; v. 83, 328, 332, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha himself visited Kāligodhā during his residence there. It was during a discussion with Mahānāma that the Cula Dukkhakkhandha Sutta was preached. During one of the Buddha's residences in Nigrodhārāma, the Sākyans invited him to consecrate their new Mote Hall, which he did by preaching there far into the night and then asking Moggallāna to continue his discourse.&lt;ref&gt;S.iv.182ff.; also M.i.353, Sekha Sutta&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion the Buddha is mentioned as having spent a period of convalescence at Nigrodhārāma;&lt;ref&gt;A.i.219f&lt;/ref&gt; he was there also when the quarrel broke out between the [[Sakya|Sākyans]] and the [[Koliya]]ns regarding the water of the [[Rohini (river)|Rohinī]]&lt;ref&gt;SNA.i.357; but see J.v.413, where he is said to have been in Sāvatthi&lt;/ref&gt;). It seems to have been the Buddha's custom, when staying at Nigrodhārāma, sometimes to spend the noonday siesta in the Mahāvana (Great Forest) nearby.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., S.iii.91f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nigrodharama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The remains of a second (slightly smaller) stupa at the Nigrodharama]]
Among others mentioned as having stayed at Nigrodhārāma are [[Anuruddha]]&lt;ref&gt;DhA.iii.295&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lomasakangiya]];&lt;ref&gt;M.iii.200&lt;/ref&gt; a deva called [[Candana]] there taught him the [[Bhaddekaratta Sutta]]. This Lomasakangīya might be the same as Lomavangīsa, who is also mentioned&lt;ref&gt;S.v.327&lt;/ref&gt; as having lived in Nigrodhārāma?

Near Nigrodhārāma was once the site of the dwelling of a hermit (isi) called Kanha. The Buddha, remembering this, once smiled, and, when asked the reason for his smile, related the Kanha Jātaka (J.iv.6).

There is a tradition&lt;ref&gt;CypA.1,7; BuA.3&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Cariya Pitaka]] and the [[Buddhavamsa]] were preached by the Buddha to [[Sariputta]] during his first stay in Nigrodhārāma. It was probably there that Anuruddha's sister built, at his request, an assembly hall of two storeys for the Sangha.&lt;ref&gt;DhA.iii.295f&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhaghosa]] says&lt;ref&gt;MA.ii.906; M.iii.109f&lt;/ref&gt; that Kāla Khemaka, the Sākyan, built a special vihāra near Nigrodhārāma, on one side of the grounds.

==Current remains of the Nigrodharama==
The remains of the Nigrodharama are currently called Kudan, because it is located close to Kudan village. The remains consist of two (excavated) large stupas, and a third as yet unexcavated one. The third (unexcavated) stupa has a more recent (possibly [[Islamic]]) structure built on top of it.

The '''Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross''' (OTRC) was an early 20th century [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] group. It was founded in 1912 by leaders of the [[Theosophical Society]], including [[Annie Besant]], [[Marie Russak]] and [[James Ingall Wedgwood]].

According to Gregory Tillett, in ''Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854-1934'', both Russak and Wedgwood were [[medium (spirituality)|medium]]s who purportedly communicated messages from the Masters during Temple meetings.&lt;ref name="Tillett2007"&gt;{{cite thesis|location=Sydney|publisher=University of Sydney|last=Tillett|first=Gregory J.|title=Charles Webster Leadbeater 1854-1934: a biographical study|type=Ph.D.|year=1986|publication-date=2007|via=Sydney Digital Theses|oclc=220306221|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2123/1623}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=574}}{{efn|Tillett, who interviewed some members, noted the small number of published references to the Temple; he commented that references "in Theosophical publications tend to be vague" while "those outside the {{abbr|TS|Theosophical Society}} tend to be inaccurate."&lt;ref name="Tillett2007" /&gt;{{rp|page=1026}}}} Russak's understudy in the Temple was Lady Emily Lutyens,&lt;ref name="Tillett2007" /&gt;{{rp|page=574}} the English representative of the [[Order of the Star in the East]] and editor of its journal, ''Herald of the Star'', who was also in the society's esoteric section and "introduced wealthy converts" who financed the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=50654|title=Lutyens, Lady Emily (1874–1964)|last=Ridley|first=Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Vahan'', the {{abbr|OTRC|Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross}} was dedicated "to the study of the Mysteries, [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]], [[Kabbalah|Cabal]], [[Astrology]], [[Freemasonry|Masonry]], [[Symbol]]ism, Christian Ceremonial, Mystic Traditions and Occults of the West". And it added that: "To confide in that such work serves as preliminary for the restoration of the missing Mysteries of Europe with the decadence of Rome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|location=|publisher=|journal=The Vahan|issn=|volume=|issue=|date=Apr 1912|last=|first=|title=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sophia'' announced that "The Council of the Order is composed by 12 Brothers deeply interested in all that refers to the Ceremonial Occultism and Archaic Mysteries, and that they hope to form a useful instrument, under the inspiration of the [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Master Rákóczi]], to resuscitate the Old Mysteries and to prepare the arrival of the Master of the World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|location=|publisher=|journal=Sophia|issn=|volume=|issue=|date=Jun 1912|last=|first=|title=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Temple members wore white tunics and met biweekly in "Oratory" and "Laboratory".  
In the oratory, they expounded and discussed spiritual and philosophical texts. In the laboratory introspective work and ritual was practised. After the Order's dissolution, Russak entered the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] (AMORC) and actively collaborated with [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]] in creating rituals for {{abbr|AMORC|Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis}} in California, in the 1920s.

[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] disapproved of the Temple because he neither established nor controlled it, and mediums, other than Besant and Leadbeater, communicated messages from the Masters. He claimed that the rituals "produced 'adverse forces{{' "}} so Leadbeater unsuccessfully "tried to persuade" Lutyens "to have it reorganized along lines which he suggested." In 1914, Leadbeater communicated "a message from the Master ordering its dissolution."&lt;ref name="Tillett2007" /&gt;{{rp|page=574}}

Max Heindel in ''[[Rays from the Rose Cross]]'' printed in 1915, argued that there could be no connection between [[The Rosicrucian Fellowship]] and the {{abbr|OTRC|Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross}}, or any other Theosophical Society order because "the aim of The Theosophical Society and their subsidiary orders are diametrically opposed to The Rosicrucian Fellowship" which "espoused the Western Wisdom Religion" and believe in the "Western methods for Western people." The Rosicrucian Fellowship took the founding of the {{abbr|OTRC|Order of the Temple of the Rosy Cross}}, by leaders of the Theosophical Society, as "an indication that they had seen the true Christ Light, in the West, and were preparing to emulate the 'Wise Men of the East' who traveled westward following the Christ Star to Bethlehem." &lt;ref name="Heindel1915"&gt;{{Source-attribution|{{cite journal|location=Oceanside, CA|publisher=Rosicrucian Fellowship|journal=Rays from the rose cross: a magazine of mystic light|issn=0744-432X|volume=4|issue=2|date=Dec 1915|pages=15&amp;ndash;18|editor-last=Heindel|editor-first=Max|editor-link=Max Heindel|title=The Theosophical Temple of the Rosy Cross|url=http://www.rosicrucien.info/Echoes_Rays_1913_1919/pdf/1915_12_Dec%20Rays%20from%20the%20Rose%20Cross.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-24|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728234138/http://www.rosicrucien.info/Echoes_Rays_1913_1919/pdf/1915_12_Dec%20Rays%20from%20the%20Rose%20Cross.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-28|deadurl=no}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Order was resuscitated in 2016 by an elder brother based in England.

'''Panteón (Pantheon) Hill''' in one of the [[Hills of Valparaíso|42 hills]] of the city of [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]]. It is surrounded by Ecuador and Cumming Streets and it has its base on Condell Street. It is next to Cárcel (Jail) Hill and Panteón Hill is part of the central chain of Valparaíso's hills.

Panteón is Spanish for cemetery. It is named Cemetery Hill because three cemeteries of the city can be found on the hill: the Cemetery No. 1, the [[Dissidents Cemetery]] and the Cemetery No. 2.&lt;ref name=VM&gt;{{cite web|title=A place where death comes alive (in Spanish)|url=http://www.mercuriovalpo.cl/site/edic/20020115202934/pags/20020115223107.html|work=Cementerio de Disidentes|publisher=Valpariso Mercury (16 January 2002)|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 19th century, the people of Valparaíso used to bury their dead by letting them wash away in the ocean or on the tops of hills. These unsanitary practices eventually caused a health crisis. In 1825, the government bought some lands to found a cemetery on the hill on the periphery of the city. The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] originally created the cemetery nº1, and with the help of [[United Kingdom|British]] immigrants a second one was created to bury at those not of the Catholic faith, called Dissidents Cemetery. Cemetery nº2 was created in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cerros Cárcel/Panteón |url=http://www.ciudaddevalparaiso.cl/inicio/descripcion_historica.php?id_zona=6 |author=Ciudad de Valparaíso |accessdate=3 March 2011 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722044001/http://www.ciudaddevalparaiso.cl/inicio/descripcion_historica.php?id_zona=6 |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prayers of Pahery''' are the prayers to be said in the tomb of a man named Pahery who was alive in the XVIII&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; dynasty of Egypt.&lt;ref name="J.L. Foster"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcBWWi5qF1IC&amp;pg=PT240&amp;dq=Egyptian+prayers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBmoVChMIgZSwg6HZxgIVLQbbCh2Giw41#v=onepage&amp;q=Egyptian%20prayers&amp;f=false|author=J.L.

The prayers are the second oldest archaeological evidence for the existence of an after-life within ancient Egyptian culture apart from the oldest which is the [[Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="J.L. Foster"/&gt; The text within his tomb show :&lt;ref name="Miriam Lichtheim"/&gt;

1. A prayer which is present traditionally within tombs of Egypt, for the purposes of offerings.

2. A well-detailed description of the after-life.

3. A prayer attesting to the quality of the service of Paheri as an official.

4. An appeal for the purposes of having the living recite the prayer for offerings.

{{About|the Marian hymn|the Marian title|Queen of Heaven|the prison in Rome|Regina Coeli (prison)|the church in Mexico City|Regina Coeli Church and Convent}} 
[[Image:Coronation of Virgin Jacopo di mino Montepulciano.jpg|thumb|[[Coronation of the Virgin|Coronation of the Virgin of 1340-1350]], a Gothic depiction of [[Queen of Heaven|Mary's queenship]] by [[Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio]]]]

The '''Regina Cæli''' or '''Regina Cœli''' ("[[Queen of Heaven]]", pronounced {{IPA-la|reˈdʒina ˈtʃeli|}} in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]) is an ancient Latin [[Hymns to Mary|Marian Hymn]] of the Christian Church.

It is one of the four seasonal [[Marian antiphons]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], prescribed to be sung or recited in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] at the conclusion of the last of the hours to be prayed in common that day, typically night prayer ([[Compline]] or [[Vespers]]). Any one of these four or of other suitable antiphons may now be sung at any time of the liturgical year. The ''Regina Coeli'' is sung or recited in place of the ''[[Angelus]]'' during the [[Easter season]], from [[Easter Sunday]] until [[Pentecost]].

==Etymology==
As with many Christian prayers, it takes its name from its [[incipit]] or first word(s). The [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''coelum'', meaning "heaven" (hence the English word ''celestial''), was a common medieval and early modern spelling of ''caelum'', which was the only form in Classical Latin. In medieval Latin, ''ae'' and ''oe'' were both pronounced [eː]; the form was also influenced by an extremely dubious etymology from Greek ''koilos'', "hollow".{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==History==
While the authorship of the ''Regina Caeli'' is unknown, the hymn has been traced back to the 12th century. It was in [[Franciscan]] use, after Compline, in the first half of the following century. According to Catholic tradition, [[Pope Gregory I|St Gregory the Great]] heard angels chanting the first three lines one [[Easter]] morning in Rome, while following barefoot in a great religious procession of the icon of the Virgin painted by [[Luke the Evangelist]]. He was thereupon inspired to add the fourth line.&lt;ref name=Frisk&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/a/antiphons.php#anchor4 Frisk, M. Jean. “Antiphons: Regina Coeli.” All About Mary. International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settings==
There are [[plainsong]] melodies (a simple and an ornate form) associated with ''Regina Caeli'', the official or "typical" melody being found in the ''Vatican Antiphonary'', 1911, p.&amp;nbsp;126. The [[antiphon]]al strophes of ''Regina Caeli'' were often set by polyphonic composers of the 16th century. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s motet "Regina coeli, laetare" was written in 1684. There are three settings by the young [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (K.108, K.127, and K.276), and one by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] (Op. 37 #3). Settings continue to be written in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-PItkFqooA&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, the alternative translation ([[Regina Coeli#Alternate translation|see below]]) is in 7.7.7.7 [[meter (music)|metre]], and is usually sung to the [[hymn tune]] known as Easter Hymn, "[[Christ the Lord is Risen Today]]" or the hymn tune "Ave Virgo Virginum" (Hail Virgin of virgins).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the country's population adhering to [[Islam]]. The vast majority of [[Islam in Sudan|Muslims in Sudan]] are [[Sunni]] belonging to the [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]]. Protestants are about 5% of the population mainly in the south. Roman Catholics are 3.2%.




==Christianity==
{{main|Christianity in Sudan}}
[[File:Sudan Farras fresco of cathedral 22dez2005.jpg|thumb|right|A fresco showing the birth of Jesus, in [[Faras]] cathedral]]

Sudan was predominantly [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Christian]] at the time of the arrival of Islam in the seventh and eighth century. The indigenous [[Nubian people|Nubian]] [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Christians]] continued to compose a substantial portion of the regions' population up until the nineteenth century, when most were [[forced to convert to Islam]] under the Mahdist state (1881-1898). The conversion was accomplished by violence, ethnic cleansing, and the wholesale slaughter of Christians and Roman Catholics. Many who converted were then murdered by beheading, stonings, and other means. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]'s influence is still marginally present in Sudan, with several hundred thousand remaining adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Sheen J. ''Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report.'' Routledge, 1997. p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the predominantly Christian areas in South Sudan seceded to form a new country. Christians in the [[Nuba Mountains]], which the Sudanese government retained for the region's mineral wealth, remain particularly subject to persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brock |first=Laurie |url=http://50days.org/2013/05/the-martyrs-of-sudan-yesterday-today-tomorrow |title=The Martyrs of Sudan: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow &amp;#124; 50 Days of Fabulous |website=50days.org |date=2013-05-16 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sudanese government's military actions against the Nuba people have been labeled ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/crisis-in-sudan-allegations-of-ethnic-cleansing-in-the-nuba-mountains/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=Crisis in Sudan: Allegations of Ethnic Cleansing in the Nuba Mountains|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boswell |first=Alan |url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2077376,00.html |title=Darfur Redux: Is 'Ethnic Cleansing' Occurring in Sudan's Nuba Mountains? - TIME |website=Content.time.com |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
{{main|Roman Catholicism in Sudan}}
[[File:St. Matthew's Catholic Cathedral (Khartoum) 001.jpg|thumb|St. Matthew's Catholic Cathedral, Khartoum]]
There were approximately 1.1 million Catholics in (pre-partition) Sudan, about 3.2 percent of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David M. Cheney |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/qview5.html |title=Structured View of Dioceses in Africa [Catholic-Hierarchy&amp;#93; |website=Catholic-hierarchy.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan forms one ecclesiastical province, consisting of one archdiocese (the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Khartoum|Archdiocese of Khartoum]]) and one suffragan diocese (the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of El Obeid|diocese of El Obeid]]). The vast majority of Sudan's Catholics ended up in South Sudan after the partition.

==Indigenous religions==
Each indigenous religion is unique to a specific [[ethnic group]] or part of a group, although several groups may share elements of belief and ritual because of common ancestry or mutual influence. The group serves as the congregation, and an individual usually belongs to that faith by virtue of membership in the group. Believing and acting in a religious mode is part of daily life and is linked to the social, political, and economic actions and relationships of the group. The beliefs and practices of indigenous religions in Sudan are not systematized, in that the people do not generally attempt to put together in a coherent fashion the doctrines they hold and the rituals they practice.

The concept of a high spirit or divinity, usually seen as a creator and sometimes as ultimately responsible for the actions of lesser spirits, is common to most Sudanese groups. Often the higher divinity is remote, and believers treat the other spirits as autonomous, orienting their rituals to these spirits rather than to the high god. Such spirits may be perceived as forces of nature or as manifestations of ancestors. Spirits may intervene in people's lives, either because individuals or groups have transgressed the norms of the society or because they have failed to pay adequate attention to the ritual that should be addressed to the spirits.

The notions of sorcery are to be found in varying forms among peoples, including nomadic and other Arabs, who consider themselves Muslims. A specific belief widespread among Arabs and other Muslim peoples is the notion of the evil eye. Although a physiological peculiarity of the eye ([[Strabismus|walleye or cross-eye]]) may be considered indicative of the evil eye, any persons expressing undue interest in the private concerns of another may be suspected of inflicting deliberate harm by a glance. Unlike most witchcraft, where the perpetrator is known by and often close to the victim, the evil eye is usually attributed to strangers. Children are thought to be the most vulnerable.

Ways exist to protect oneself against sorcery or the evil eye. Many magico-religious specialists—diviners and sorcerers—deal with these matters in Sudanese societies. The diviner is able to determine whether witchcraft or sorcery is responsible for the affliction and to discover the source. He also protects and cures by providing amulets and other protective devices for a fee or by helping a victim punish (in occult fashion) the sorcerer in order to be cured of the affliction. If it is thought that an evil spirit has [[Spiritual possession|possessed]] a person, an [[exorcist]] may be called in. In some groups these tasks may be accomplished by the same person; in others, the degree of specialization may be greater. In northern Sudan among Muslim peoples, the faqih may spend more of his time as the diviner, dispenser of amulets, healer, and exorcist than as Qur'anic teacher, imam of a mosque, or mystic.

==Irreligion==
[[Sudan]] is reported by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' to be among the seven countries where [[atheism]] can attract [[Capital punishment in Iran|capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Sudan: A misconception of apostasy|publisher= [[Al Jazeera]]|date=|url= http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/05/sudan-woman-apostasy-2014517102213211469.html|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/world-view/2013/nov/25/shariah-sudan-v-women-and-religious-freedom/ |title=Sharia in Sudan v. women and religious freedom &amp;#124; Washington Times Communities |publisher=Communities.washingtontimes.com |date=2013-11-24 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|title=The seven countries where the state can execute you for being atheist|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/12/10/the-seven-countries-where-the-state-can-execute-you-for-being-atheist/|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 Dec 2012|quote=Though that list includes some dictatorships, the country that appears to most frequently condemn atheists to death for their beliefs is actually a democracy, if a frail one: Pakistan.

==Religious freedom==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Sudan}}
Although the 2005 Interim National Constitution (INC) provides for [[freedom of religion]] throughout the entire country of [[Sudan]], the INC enshrines [[Shari'a]] as a source of [[legislation]] in the north&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudan.net/government/constitution/draft_const/ |accessdate=March 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610192016/http://www.sudan.net/government/constitution/draft_const/ |archivedate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official laws and policies of the government favour [[Islam]] in that part of the country.

==Islam==
{{main|Islam in Sudan}}
Sudan has been forced to convert to Islam by conversation through violence. Some who have converted have been killed anyway. Up until 2010, the country was 80%, in 2018 it is 85% Islam.
Most [[Sudan|Sudanese]] Muslims are adherents of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of Islam, a vast majority following the [[Maliki]] rites, although [[Shafi]] and [[Hanafi]] rites are also present.

[[Shiaism]] and its related [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdist]] ideology have recently grown in popularity in Sudan. A growing number of [[Shias]], for example, have emerged in Khartoum and surrounding villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TktxvDN2QX4C&amp;pg=PA28 |title=A Necessary Engagement: Reinventing America's Relations with the Muslim World |author=Emile Nakhleh |page=28 |website=Books.google.com |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism and Shia Islam support Prophet Muhammad's bloodline, Ahl al-Bayt. Some Shias prefer to practice their faith under the umbrella of Sufism for the sake of safety as Sufism tends to be less socially and politically controversial in Sudan than Shia Islam. {{citation needed|reason=Please add an inline citation|date=September 2015}} However, [[Salafists]] and [[Jihadists]] have carried out bloody attacks on those belonging to Sufi, Shia, and other sects that they claim to be heretical. {{citation needed|reason=Citation #4 only details attacks on Sufis|date=September 2015}}

Sunni Islam in Sudan is not marked by a uniform body of belief and practice, however. Some Muslims opposed aspects of Sunni orthodoxy, and rites having a non-Islamic origin were widespread, being accepted as if they were integral to Islam, or sometimes being recognized as separate. A great majority of Muslims in Sudan adhere to [[Sufism]] or are heavily influenced by it, making Sudan one of the most tolerant Muslim majority countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/5193 |title=Salafis vs Sufis: A Simmering Conflict in Sudan |publisher=Al Akhbar English |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars===
[[File:Sudan Omdurman Main Mosque Main Entrance 1936.jpg|thumb|right|[[Omdurman]] Main Mosque in 1936]]
Sunni Islam requires of the faithful five fundamental obligations that constitute the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar, the [[shahadah]] or profession of faith is the affirmation "There is no deity but God, and [[Muhammad]] is His messenger." It is the first step in becoming a Muslim. The second obligation is [[salat|prayer at five specified times of the day]]. The third enjoins [[Zakat|almsgiving]]. The fourth requires [[Sawm|fasting during daylight hours]] in the month of [[Ramadan]]. The fifth requires a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] for those able to perform it, to participate in the special rites that occur during the twelfth month of the [[lunar calendar]]. 
Most Sudanese Muslims are born to the faith and meet the first requirement. Conformity to the second requirement is more variable. Many males in the [[List of cities in Sudan|cities]] and larger towns manage to pray five times a day: at dawn, noon, midafternoon, sundown, and evening. The well-to-do perform little work during Ramadan, and many businesses close or operate on reduced schedules. In the early 1990s, its observance appeared to be widespread, especially in urban areas and among sedentary Sudanese Muslims.

[[File:Minaret S.jpg|thumb|left|A [[minaret]] in [[Port Sudan]]]]

The [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca is less costly and arduous for the Sudanese than it is for many Muslims. Nevertheless, it takes time (or money if travel is by air), and the ordinary Sudanese Muslim has generally found it difficult to accomplish, rarely undertaking it before middle age. Some have joined pilgrimage societies into which members pay a small amount monthly and choose one of their number when sufficient funds have accumulated to send someone on the pilgrimage. A returned pilgrim is entitled to use the honorific title hajj or hajjih for a woman.

Another ceremony commonly observed is the great feast [[Eid ul-Adha|Id al Adha]] (also known as Id al Kabir), representing the sacrifice made during the last days of the pilgrimage. The centerpiece of the day is the slaughter of a sheep, which is distributed to the poor, kin, neighbors, and friends, as well as the immediate family.

Islam imposes a standard of conduct encouraging generosity, fairness, and honesty towards other Muslims. Sudanese Arabs, especially those who are wealthy, are expected by their coreligionists to be generous.

===Islam in Sudanese law===
In accordance with Islamic law most Sudanese Muslims do not eat [[Islamic dietary laws|pork]]. Conformity to the prohibitions on gambling and alcohol is less widespread. [[Usury]] is also forbidden by Islamic law, but [[Islamic banking|Islamic banks]] have developed other ways of making money available to the public.

In Sudan (until 1983) modern criminal and civil, including commercial, law generally prevailed. In the north, however, the sharia was expected to govern what is usually called family and personal law, i.e., matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In the towns and in some sedentary communities sharia was accepted, but in other sedentary communities and among [[nomads]] local custom was likely to prevail{{spaced ndash}}particularly with respect to inheritance.

In September 1983, [[Gaafar Nimeiry|Nimeiri]] imposed the sharia throughout the land, eliminating the civil and penal codes by which the country had been governed in the twentieth century. Traditional Islamic punishments were imposed for [[Hudud|theft, adultery, homicide]], and other crimes. The zealousness with which these punishments were carried out contributed to the fall of Nimeiri. Nevertheless, no successor government has shown inclination to abandon the sharia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Minority rights are severely restricted under Sharia. An example is the law on [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]]. Non-Muslim Sudanese are permitted to convert to Islam, but Muslims are forbidden by law to leave Islam or to change their beliefs. Article 126 of the 1991 Penal Code states that any Muslim who "...publicly declares his renouncement (of Islam) by an express statement or conclusive act..." is, upon failure to repent, to be [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheen J. ''Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report.'' Routledge, 1997. p.76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other influences ===
Islam is [[monotheistic]] and insists that there can be no intercessors between an individual and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in [[spirit]]s as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical ways of dealing with them. The [[imam]] of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a [[faqih]] (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as [[amulets]] and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with [[occult]] threats to health and well- being. The notion that the words of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of [[Demon|evil spirits]] or the [[evil eye]] is deeply embedded in popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.

In Sudan as in much of African Islam, the cult of the [[saint]] is of considerable importance, although some Muslims would reject it. The development of the cult is closely related to the presence of the religious orders; many who came to be considered saints on their deaths were founders or leaders of religious orders who in their lifetimes were thought to have [[barakah]], a state of blessedness implying an indwelling spiritual power inherent in the religious office. Baraka intensifies after death as the deceased becomes a [[wali]] (literally friend of God, but in this context translated as saint). The tomb and other places associated with the saintly being become the loci of the person's baraka, and in some views he or she becomes the guardian spirit of the locality. The intercession of the wali is sought on a variety of occasions, particularly by those seeking cures or by barren women desiring children. A saint's annual holy day is the occasion of a local festival that may attract a large gathering.

Better-educated Muslims in Sudan may participate in prayer at a saint's tomb but argue that prayer is directed only to God. Many others, however, see the saint not merely as an intercessor with and an agent of God, but also as a nearly autonomous source of blessing and power, thereby approaching "popular" as opposed to orthodox Islam.

===Movements and religious orders===
Islam made its deepest and longest lasting impact in Sudan through the activity of the Islamic religious brotherhoods or orders. These orders emerged in the Middle East in the twelfth century in connection with the development of [[Sufism]], a reaction based in [[mysticism]] to the strongly legalistic orientation of mainstream Islam. These orders first came to Sudan in the sixteenth century and became significant in the eighteenth. Sufism seeks its adherents a closer personal relationship with God through special spiritual disciplines. The exercises (or ''[[dhikr]]'') include reciting prayers and passages of the Qur'an and repeating the names, or attributes, of God while performing physical movements according to the formula established by the founder of the particular order. Singing and dancing may be introduced. The outcome of an exercise, which lasts much longer than the usual daily prayer, is often a state of ecstatic abandon.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A mystical or devotional way (sing. ''[[tariqa]]''; pl. ''turuq'') is the basis for the formation of particular orders, each of which is also called a tariqa. The specialists in [[religious law]] and learning initially looked askance at Sufism and the Sufi orders, but the leaders of Sufi orders in Sudan have won acceptance by acknowledging the significance of the sharia and not claiming that Sufism replaces it.

The principal turuq varies considerably in their practice and internal organization. Some orders are tightly organized in a hierarchical fashion; others have allowed their local branches considerable autonomy. There may be as many as a dozen Turuq in Sudan. Some are restricted to that country; others are widespread in [[Africa]] or the [[Middle East]]. Several Turuq, for all practical purposes independent, are offshoots of older orders and were established by men who altered in major or minor ways the tariqa of the orders to which they had formerly been attached.

The oldest and most widespread of the turuq is the [[Qadiriyah]] founded by [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]] in [[Baghdad]] in the twelfth century and introduced into Sudan in the sixteenth. The Qadiriyah's principal rival and the largest tariqa in the western part of the country was the [[Tijaniyah]], a sect begun by [[Sidi Ahmed al-Tidjani]] at [[Tijani]] in [[Morocco]], which eventually penetrated Sudan in about 1810 via the western [[Sahel]] (a narrow band of savanna bordering the southern Sahara, stretching across Africa). Many Tijani became influential in [[Darfur]], and other adherents settled in northern [[Kurdufan]]. Later on, a class of Tijani merchants arose as markets grew in towns and trade expanded, making them less concerned with providing religious leadership. Of greater importance to Sudan was the tariqa established by the followers of [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris]], known as [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Al Fasi]], who died in 1837. Although he lived in Arabia and never visited Sudan, his students spread into the Nile Valley establishing indigenous Sudanese orders which include the Majdhubiyah, the Idrisiyah, the Ismailiyah, and the Khatmiyyah.

Much different in organization from the other brotherhoods is the [[Khatmiyyah]] (or Mirghaniyah after the name of the order's founder). Established in the early nineteenth century by [[Muhammad Uthman al Mirghani]], it became the best organized and most politically oriented and powerful of the turuq in eastern Sudan (see [[Turkiyah]]). Mirghani had been a student of Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris and had joined several important orders, calling his own order the seal of the paths (Khatim at Turuq—hence Khatmiyyah). The salient features of the Khatmiyyah are the extraordinary status of the Mirghani family, whose members alone may head the order; loyalty to the order, which guarantees paradise; and the centralized control of the order's branches.

[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ahmad]]
The Khatmiyyah had its center in the southern section of [[Ash Sharqi]] State and its greatest following in eastern Sudan and in portions of the riverine area. The Mirghani family were able to turn the Khatmiyyah into a political power base, despite its broad geographical distribution, because of the tight control they exercised over their followers. Moreover, gifts from followers over the years have given the family and the order the wealth to organize politically. This power did not equal, however, that of the Mirghanis' principal rival, the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]], or followers of the Mahdi, whose present-day leader was [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], the great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who drove the Egyptian administration from Sudan in 1885.

Most other orders were either smaller or less well organized than the Khatmiyyah. Moreover, unlike many other African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not all seem to feel the need to identify with one or another tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of the true nature of Islam.

[[File:Mahdist in the Khalifa's house, Omdurman, Sudan.png|thumb|left|upright|A Mahdist in Omdurman, 1936]]
One of these movements, [[Ansar (Sudan)|Mahdism]], was founded in the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a religious order, but it is not a tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be [[Mahdi|al-Mahdi al-Muntazar]] ("the awaited guide in the right path"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for [[Second Coming|the second coming]] of the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was essential that the people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see [[Mahdist Sudan#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]]). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was, in fact, the Mahdi.

In the century since the Mahdist uprising, the neo-Mahdist movement, and the Ansar, supporters of Mahdism from the west, have persisted as a political force in Sudan. Many groups, from the [[Baggara|Baqqara]] cattle nomads to the largely sedentary tribes on the [[White Nile]], supported this movement. The Ansar were hierarchically organized under the control of Muhammad Ahmad's successors, who have all been members of the Mahdi family (known as the [[ashraf]]). The ambitions and varying political perspectives of different members of the family have led to internal conflicts, and it appeared that Sadiq al-Mahdi, the putative leader of the Ansar since the early 1970s, did not enjoy the unanimous support of all Mahdists. Mahdist family political goals and ambitions seemed to have taken precedence over the movement's original religious mission. The modern-day Ansar were thus loyal more to the political descendants of the Mahdi than to the religious message of Mahdism.

A movement that spread widely in Sudan in the 1960s, responding to the efforts to secularize Islamic society, was the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimin). Originally the Muslim Brotherhood, often known simply as the Brotherhood, was conceived as a religious revivalist movement that sought to return to the fundamentals of Islam in a way that would be compatible with the technological innovations introduced from the West. Disciplined, highly motivated, and well-financed the Brotherhood became a powerful political force during the 1970s and 1980s, although it represented only a small minority of Sudanese. In the government that was formed in June 1989, following a bloodless coup d'état, the Brotherhood exerted influence through its political wing, the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) party, which included several cabinet members among its adherents.

{{Slavic Native Faith}}
The '''Ringing Cedars''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Звенящие Кедры) or '''Anastasianism''' (Анастасианство, Анастасиизм) is a new [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[religion|religious]] movement{{sfn|Balagushkin|Shokhin|2006|p=passim}} that started in central [[Russia]] in 1997 and spread across neighboring countries as well as parts of Europe, America, Asia and Australia, {{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=442}} based on the series of ten books entitled ''The Ringing Cedars of Russia'' written by [[Vladimir Megre]].{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=442}} At the 2018 Frankfurt Book Fair, where the author drew a large crowd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Megre causes sensation at Frankfurt Book Fair 2018 |url=https://vmegre.com/en/events/39465/ |publisher=Vladimir Megre |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it was claimed the books have sold 20 million copies worldwide and has been translated in 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Megre speaks at Frankfurt Book Fair 2018 |url=https://vmegre.com/en/events/39457/ |publisher=Vladimir Megre |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family, tradition and [[environmentalism]] are core values for the Anastasians. {{sfnm|1a1=Andreeva|1y=2012a|1p=231|2a1=Lunkin|2y=2009}} The knowledge contained in the books is attributed to a woman named Anastasia who dwells in the Siberian [[Taiga]]. Ringing Cedars' Anastasians are sometimes categorisable as Rodnovers,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} as many of them are proponents of the return to a [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery) or other indigenous religion. Other scholars do not categorise them as Rodnovers, but as a distinct [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] movement.{{sfn|Gaidukov|2015|ps=: "Под более узким термином Родноверие подразумевается религиозная, обрядовая система, которая придерживается исключительно славянских традиций (русской, украинской, белорусской). Этот термин не включает в себя некоторые проявления неоязычества, такие как, например Инглиизм или Анастасиизм. / Under the narrower term Rodnovery it is meant a religious, ritual system adhering exclusively to Slavic traditions (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian). This term does not include other manifestations of Neopaganism, such as, for example, Ynglism or Anastasianism."}} The books that the movement relies upon offer a [[holism|holistic]] worldview teaching about humanity's relationship with nature, [[God]] and the universe, the creation of the world, the power of thought in modelling the future, cyclical [[eschatology]], relationships between men and women, and education.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=442}}

The name "Ringing Cedars" comes from Anastasians' beliefs about spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]]. Anastasianism has been classified as part of the broad spectrum of self-described "Vedic" religions arising in post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Russia. Anastasians propose a whole new model of social organisation, that of the "kinship homestead" or settlement (родовое поместье, ''rodovoye pomest'ye'').{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|pp=52–53}} The Ringing Cedars have become popular in Russia, and the movement has also spread to other [[Slavs|Slavic]] countries, broader [[Eastern Europe]], and communities have also been established in the West.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=444}} In Russia, Anastasians face the hostility of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=445}}

==Etymology==
The two names of the movement are explainable as follows: "Ringing Cedars" refers to the movement's beliefs about the spiritual qualities of the [[Pinus sibirica|Siberian cedar]], a kind of pine;{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=52}} "Anastasia" (Ἀναστασία, ''Anastasía''), from ''anástasis'' (ἀνάστασις), is a [[Greek language|Greek]] phenomenological word meaning "resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Anastasia |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anastasia |dictionary=Online Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the "singing tree" appears across various [[proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]]-originated cultures; Anastasians consider themselves the reintegrators (otherwise said, resurrectors) of the authentic Vedic spiritual culture, [[Slavic paganism|authentic Russian religion]] consisting in the cultivation of ''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'' (God as generation/nature), which has been preserved over the centuries by Russian settlers and ''[[volkhv]]''s (shamans) in [[Siberia]] who fled the Christianisation of [[Kievan Rus']]—a Christianisation which was decided by the ruling elites in order to disrupt the ties of society and of human society with the natural world (ancestors and gods of the environment as the direct link to ''Rod'') justifying the confiscation of all land and the [[serfdom in Russia|enslavement]] of the population.{{sfn|Sharashkin|2009}}

==Beliefs==
[[File:Flower of Life rosette (petals filled).svg|thumb|100px|''Rod'''s symbol, representing the attunement with the cycles of the Sun, the day and the year.{{sfn|Sharashkin|2009}}]]

===Theology===
The Ringing Cedars may be described as a [[nature religion]], since Anastasian spirituality emphasises the sacredness of nature or generation, conceived as a source of divinity and the mean of communication with God (''Rod''). Scholar Rasa Pranskevičiūtė characterises this vision as [[pantheism|pantheistic]], and notes how it is a fundamental influence in Anastasians' social project.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=446}} They stress the importance of [[harmony]], that is to say giving and receiving love and respect, appropriate reciprocal cultivation, to be put into practice among individual persons and between the community of individuals and the divinity of all nature.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=447}}

A Lithuanian Anastasian has defined God as follows:{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=451}}

{{Quote|God is Nature – a twitter of birds, the wind, a rustle of trees... everything that is in Nature is the living book of sensual information, and much more: He touches us through Nature.}}

Anastasians believe that nature is the "materialised thoughts of God". All living things are believed to be thoughts of God, and therefore by communicating with them humanity may communicate with God.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=451}}

===Morality===
The Ringing Cedars believe in the interconnectedness of all being, and therefore they greatly emphasise the moral responsibility of individuals and humanity towards the umbegoing world. They believe that human thoughts and feelings actively, magically influence the umbegoing world, having the power to affirm or disrupt natural harmony. Pranskevičiūtė reports the following excerpt from Megre's doctrine (1998):{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=450}}

{{Quote|When a man is full of love, he is entirely radiant. That energy of radiance reflects into the planets above him in a short particle of a second, comes back to earth again and gives life to everything that is alive... If a man is ful of anger, his disseminating radiance is dark; it cannot rise up and penetrated deeply into the Earth. After striking deep into the bowels [of the Earth], it comes back and manifests itself as a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, war.}}

In order to be respectful towards other forms of life, Anastasians try to eschew any form of killing, and therefore they adopt [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], [[veganism|vegan]], and [[raw foodism|raw food]] diets, and wear clothes made of natural materials.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=450}}

===Heaven on earth and reincarnation===
[[File:Lob Korenskie-rodniki-08.jpg|thumb|Buildings in the Korenskye kinship estate in the [[Shebekinsky District]] of Belgorod Oblast.]]
According to Megre, when a man lives in harmony with his own kin within a homestead of at least a hectare in size, a "love space" is established. A "love space" is where God is [[divine presence|present]], [[immanence|immanent]], and constitutes a "Heaven on earth", where kindred people grow together with the surrounding world. The concept of "love space" is not merely geographic, but includes anything good which an individual may create.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|pp=447–449}} A kinship homestead is also a web of natural relationship, between kindred people.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|p=102}}

In other words, the kinship homestead mirrors the modality of God's work through nature. In his hectare of land a man is capable of building a house with natural materials, growing plants and domesticating animals, creating an ecosystem.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|pp=97–98}} As such it is perceived as a holy land, a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm reflecting the macrocosm]], wherein individuals may "co-create" with kindred people and with God.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|pp=99–100}} According to Anastasians' own experiences reported by Andreeva and Pranskevičiūtė, the new social organisation represented by the kinship homesteads helps people to leave the unnatural and decaying urban technocratic system, which they conceive as a close system which smothers human creativity ensnaring it in meaningless behaviours.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|pp=98–99}}

A Russian Anastasian has described her experience of the kinship homestead as follows:{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|p=101}}
{{Quote|[It is] a way to open your inner potential – it is the place where every person can open his inner potential to the maximum – in other words, to live in accordance with the programs which have been put by God... Through Nature you can gain insight into God's purpose.}}

The "love space" always corresponds to a transcendental space where an individual may be reborn. Anastasians believe that [[reincarnation]] may be consciously planned, and it occurs in the lineage. Reincarnation occurs within the "love space", or the established kin, because the offspring remember their ancestors. The Ringing Cedars believe that humans and all of reality is fundamentally energy of thought, and ancestors may be reborn if they are thought by their descendants.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|pp=447–449}}

===Eschatology===
In the books, Anastasia teaches a cyclical eschatology, according to which time develops through three phases: a "Vedic" (of vision) period when humanity lives in harmony with Heaven; an "Imagic" (of image) period when knowledge starts to be codified and concentrates in the hands of progressively fewer holy men; and an "Occultic" (of hiding) period in which knowledge is totally "hidden" and humanity's consciousness severely downgrades. The contemporary epoch is considered to be one of the third type. Anastasians believe that they are at the forefront of the rebirth of a "Vedic" golden age, and their appeals to go "back to nature" imply to go back to the awareness which characterises humanity during such golden ages, which also equates to a reawakening of the ancestors. These ideas are expressed in Ringing Cedars' books as follows:{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=452}}

{{Quote|When we find our inner charms, how to awake our inner ancestors... we are born as young gods.}}

==Organisation==
The "Anastasia Foundation for Supporting Culture and Creativity" (''Владимирский фонд поддержки культуры и творчества «Анастасия»'') is a non-commercial organisation, a private foundation established in the city of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] by Vladimir Megre. It functions as an information and coordination center of the Ringing Cedars' movement. "LLC Megre" is, otherwise, a commercial organisation that produces cedar oil and other products under the brand name "Ringing Cedars of Russia".

The movement does not have a rigid structure, centralised organisation, hierarchy or authoritarian leaders.{{sfn|Lunkin|2009}} Independent associations of like-minded people arise spontaneously. The participants of the movement themselves, based on the ideas of books, have to develop applied organisational and ideological materials on their own.{{sfn|Andreeva|2012b|p=102}}

===Kinship homesteads===
The social ideal of the movement, upon which all its organisation relies, is the kinship homestead. It consists of a parcel of land of approximately one hectare owned by one family where its members and their descendants can live without having to rely on technical culture.{{sfn|Fedotova|2008|pp=223–224}}

The official website of the Anastasian Foundation gives the following definition of the kinship homestead:

{{Quote|text=The kinship homestead is a parcel of land of not less than one hectare (100×100m) for the permanent residence of one family, where the family can build a house with love, plant a family tree, own a forest, a garden, and equip a pond. The kinship homestead is enclosed by a hedge of forest cultures: cedar, coniferous and deciduous trees, shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;Definition found on the [http://anastasia.ru//news/detail/1753 international website of the Ringing Cedars].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ritual practice and pilgrimage==
[[File:Festival Ringing Cedars 2014 June 22 Колпаковы 04.JPG|thumb|Ringing Cedars' believers performing ritual circle-dances on [[Kupala Night|Kupala]] day.]]
Anastasians engage in nature-worshipping ceremonies and individual rituals. Rituals for hallowing the "love spaces" are crucial for most believers.{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|p=451}} The Ringing Cedars also organise pilgrimages to various sites which they consider to be holy, where they believe they may communicate with the ancestors through [[meditation]]. These sites include megalithic buildings like the [[dolmens of North Caucasus]], and sites on the [[Black Sea]] coast, especially [[Gelendzhik]] in the region of [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar]]. Lithuanian Anastasians make pilgrimage to a holy site in [[Tverai]].{{sfn|Pranskevičiūtė|2015|pp=449–450}}

==Social and political impact==
According to Andreeva and Pranskevičiūtė, Russian Anastasians tend to give a political meaning to their experience, feeling actively engaged in a movement which frees from the yoke of technocracy and evil Western forces.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|pp=101–102}} The 2000s–2010s [[Great Recession]] has contributed to the strengthening of Anastasians' eschatological beliefs.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|p=103}}

Russian Anastasians also tend to give [[nationalism|nationalist]] connotations to the concept of "love space", extending it to mean the "Russian nation" as an overarching concept, espouse traditionalist values, and Anastasianism for them represents an [[ethnocultural]] phenomenon. Otherwise, Anastasians in other countries, for instance Lithuania, tend to focus on spiritual beliefs and on the restoration of traditional rites.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|pp=102–103}} According to some observers, the Anastasian system of kinship homesteads is providing a solution to Russia's housing problems.{{sfn|Andreeva|Pranskevičiūtė|2010|p=98}}

The Buddha never wrote down his teachings. After the Saptaparni Caves meeting, Ananda created an [[oral tradition]] of Buddha's teaching from his memory, prefacing it with "[[Thus have I heard|Thus have I heard on one occasion]]". Upali is credited with reciting the ''[[Nikaya]]'' discipline or "rules for the Bhikshus".&lt;ref name="Gwynne2017"/&gt; This tradition is found in ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]'' II.284 through II.287 and ''Digha Nikaya'' II.154.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaykh ‘Adī spent much of his early life in [[Baghdad]]. To attain a [[sufism|sufi]] life and seclude himself he sought a quiet haven in [[Mespotamia]].

Despite his desire for seclusion, he impressed the local population with his [[asceticism]] and [[miracle]]s.&lt;ref name="Perfect"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yezidi Reformer: Sheikh Adi | work = The Truth about the Yezidis | publisher = YezidiTruth.org | year = 2007 | url = http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidi_reformer_sheikh_adi | accessdate = 2007-08-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320070927/http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidi_reformer_sheikh_adi | archivedate = 2008-03-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi was said to be very tanned and of middle stature. The Yazidis adopted him as their archetypal saint. Adi was celebrated on account of his saintly life. He founded a religious order named after himself, al-Adawiya. He resided in the mountains, alongside Hakkari [[Kurds]] in the region north of [[Mosul]]; and died at the age of 90 (1162 CE or 557 Hijra). According to others, he died in 1160 CE (555 Hijra) in the hermitage that he had built himself in the mountains, where his descendants lived after his demise. His sepulchre is indicated by three conical cupolas in the environs of the village of Baadri, 20 miles to the east of the Nestorian convent of Rabban-Hormuzd. His tomb still attracts a great number of people. Nightly processions by torch light include exhibitions of the green colored pall, which covers the tomb; and the distribution of large trays with smoking harisa (a ragout with coagulated milk). His followers believe that he was the incarnation of the divinity.&lt;ref name="EJ Brill"/&gt;

The '''Students' Islamic Movement of India''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''SIMI''') is a banned Islamist organisation that was formed in [[Aligarh]], Uttar Pradesh, in April 1977. The stated mission of SIMI is the "liberation of India" from Western materialistic cultural influence and to convert its Muslim society to live according to the Muslim code of conduct. The Indian government describes it as a [[terrorist organisation]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/simi.htm |title=Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) |accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and banned it in 2001, shortly after the [[9/11 attacks]]. The ban was lifted in August 2008 by a special tribunal, but was reinstated by [[K.G. Balakrishnan]], then [[Chief Justice of India|Chief Justice]], on 6 August 2008 on national security grounds.

==Background==
On 25 April 1977, SIMI was founded in [[Aligarh]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], with Mohammad Ahmadullah Siddiqi as its founding president.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2b&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/simi.htm |title=Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) |publisher=Satp.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Siddiqi currently serves as a Professor of English and Journalism at [[Western Illinois University]] in Macomb, IL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://directory.wiu.edu/display.php?M-Siddiqi |title= University Directory:  Western Illinois University |accessdate= 29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name='fair201001'/&gt; In 1981, SIMI activists protested against [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]]'s visit to India, and greeted him with black flags in New Delhi.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Young SIMI activists viewed Arafat as a Western puppet, while the senior JIH leaders saw Arafat as a champion of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause. The JIH also became uncomfortable with SIMI's support of the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]] and its communal orientation. After distancing itself from SIMI, JIH reverted to relying on the older student organization, SIO.&lt;ref name='fair201001'/&gt;

==Ideology==

SIMI maintains that concepts of [[secularism]], [[democracy]] and [[nationalism]], keystones of [[Indian Constitution]], are antithetical to [[Islam]]. Among its various objectives, SIMI aims to counter what it perceives as the increasing moral degeneration, sexual anarchy in Indian society and the 'in sensitiveness' of a 'decadent' [[Western world|West]]. They aim to restore the supremacy of Islam through the resurrection of the ''[[khilafat]]'', emphasis on the Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' and the waging of ''[[jihad]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

According to Sayeed Khan, a former president of SIMI, the group became more militant and extremist in the backdrop of communal riots and violence between Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twocircles.net/2007jun27/seeds_extremism_communal_riots_sayeed_khan.html|title=Ex-SIMI member talks about SIMI|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clashes with Hindu organisations==

SIMI organised violent protests against the demolition of the [[Babri Mosque]]. In the nationwide violence that followed the demolitions, SIMI activists clashed against the Police and the VHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raja Mohan |first=P. G. |title=TamilNadu: The Rise of Islamist Fundamentalism |journal=Faultlines |publisher=The Institute for Conflict Management |volume=16 |year=2005 |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume16/Article%205.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ban and aftermath==
The Government of India, by notification dated '''08-02-2006''' banned SIMI for the third time. SIMI was first banned on 26 September 2001 immediately following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States. SIMI remained banned from 27 September 2001 to 27 September 2003 during which period several prosecutions were launched against its members under the provisions of [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]], the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act ([[MCOCA]]), and the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] 1967.

SIMI was banned for the third time on 8 February 2006. The second ban of SIMI dated 27 September 2003 came to an end on 27 September 2005. Therefore, SIMI was in existence between 28 September 2005 and 7 February 2006 but was believed to be dysfunctional due to the fact that many of its members were demoralised or had crossed the age of 30 years; which automatically made them ineligible to continue as a member of SIMI -SIMI has an age limit of 30 years for membership. Many of its members had to fight cases registered against them by the Government.

However, on 27 July 2006, a spokesperson of the Indian Government told the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal held in New Delhi, that contrary to notions that SIMI's activities declined following its ban, the organisation "had stepped up its subversive activities and was involved in almost all major explosions, communal violence and circulation of inflammatory material across the country."

The ban notification and the background note stated that SIMI deserved to be banned for clandestine activities and links with around 20 organisations through whom SIMI was allegedly operating. The background note clearly says that there was no violent incident in which SIMI was involved in the last 2–3 years.

To prove its case against SIMI, the Government cited several cases under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] registered between 1998–2001.

The third ban on SIMI was lifted by the [[Delhi High Court]] Tribunal on 5 August 2008. "Material given by the home ministry is insufficient, so ban cannot be continued," Justice Geeta Mittal, a sitting Delhi High Court judge, said while lifting the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twocircles.net/2008aug05/tribunal_lifts_ban_simi.html |title=Tribunal lifts ban on SIMI |publisher=Twocircles.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the lifting of the ban was stayed by the supreme court of India on the next day itself(6 August 2008).

A special tribunal has upheld the ban imposed on SIMI by the Home Ministry under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The Tribunal's head confirming the ban held that SIMI has links with Pakistan-based terror outfits and its front, the Indian Mujahideen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3723854.ece |title= Tribunal upholds SIMI ban | date= 4 August 2012 | work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformation into Indian Mujahideen==
The exact nature of the relationship between SIMI and [[Indian Mujahideen]] (IM) is debated. Some analysts contend that IM is a militant branch of SIMI while others believe that the two groups are distinct although linked.&lt;ref name='fair201001'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Students Islamic Movement of India and the Indian Mujahideen: An Assessment | journal = Asia Policy | date = January 2010 | first = C.

In [[Ayyavazhi mythology]], the '''Nadutheerpu''' ({{lang-ta|நடுத்தீர்ப்பு}}) is the Final Judgement from which [[Kroni]], the primordial Manifestation of Evil was sentenced to hell. During this judgement, his unlawful activities of all the seven previous yugas are remained once again to him and was finally thrown into the hell.

After Ayya attained [[Vaikundam]], he sent a false deity who could perform so many miracles for testing the people for their faith. Then Vaikundar was crowned as a King and placed in the 'Thuthi Singasana' - the ''Lion-faced Throne'' by Narayana and all other devas to rule all the fourteen worlds under a ''Single-umbrella''. Being seated in the thrown Vaikundar, ordered the [[Sea]] to destroy the evil-beings of the world and contemplated the ''white-beings'' to enter the world. Then [[Kroni]] was brought before Vaikundar and was charged for his iniquitous activities.

'''''The Flying Nun''''' is an American [[sitcom]] produced by [[Screen Gems]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] based on the 1965 book ''[[The Fifteenth Pelican]],'' written by [[Tere Rios]]. It starred [[Sally Field]] as Sister Bertrille. The series originally ran on ABC from September 7, 1967, to September 18, 1970, producing 82 episodes, including a one-hour pilot episode.

==Overview==
{{Main|List of The Flying Nun episodes}}

Developed by [[Bernard Slade]], the series centered on the adventures of a community of nuns in the [[Convent]] San Tanco in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. The comic elements of the storyline were provided by the flying ability of a novice nun, Sister Bertrille.

In the hour-long series pilot, Chicago native Elsie Ethrington arrives in San Juan from New York City after her arrest for having been involved in a protest; she then adopts the name of Sister Bertrille. It is also later learned (in the episode "My Sister, The Sister") that Sister Bertrille comes from a family of physicians, and that she is the only member of that family who did not follow in their footsteps. She instead became a nun, joining the Convento San Tanco, after being impressed by the missionary work of her aunt, and broke up with her boyfriend of eight months, a toy salesman.

Sister Bertrille could be relied upon to solve any problem that came her way by her ability to catch a passing breeze and fly. This was generally attributed to her weighing under 90 pounds (41 kilograms), high winds at the Convent high on the ocean bluffs, and the large, heavily starched [[cornette]] that was the headpiece for her [[Religious habit|habit]]. (The cornette was based on one worn until the middle 1960s by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]], although Sister Bertrille was never said to belong to that order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicunderthehood.com/2010/09/18/today-in-catholic-history-the-last-episode-of-the-flying-nun/ "Today in Catholic History – The Last Episode of The Flying Nun"]. Catholic:Under The Hood. September 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the order which included the Convento San Tanco was never actually specified in the series.) Her flying talents caused as many problems as they solved. She explains her ability to fly by stating, "When lift plus thrust is greater than load plus drag, anything can fly." In one episode, she tries to gain weight so she could stay grounded, but the attempt fails. Additionally, in the first-season episode "Young Man with a Cornette," she specifically tells a young boy who intended to use her cornette to fly that there were many factors other than her weight (which was distributed differently than that of the boy) that made her flying possible. She was unable to take off only when heavy rains or storms caused her starched cornette to lose its shape, when she had to wear something that would keep her grounded at all times, or, on one occasion,when an inner ear infection caused her to lose her balance. (See the episode titled "The Flying Dodo.")

==Characters==
[[File:Sally Field Flying Nun 1967.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Marge Redmond|Redmond]], [[Alejandro Rey|Rey]], [[Shelley Morrison|Morrison]], and [[Sally Field|Field]]. Missing from picture: [[Madeleine Sherwood|Sherwood]].]]

* [[Sally Field]] as '''Sister Bertrille,''' real name '''Elsie Ethrington,''' a nun who only weighs 90 pounds, allowing her to fly while wearing her [[cornette]] and when the wind is right. This was Field's second situation-comedy role, following ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]].''
* [[Madeleine Sherwood]] as '''Reverend Mother Placido,''' the sober but gentle woman who runs the convent.
* [[Marge Redmond]] as '''Sister Jacqueline,''' a wise nun with a sense of humor and Sister Bertrille's friend. Her voice is also heard as the narrator, who sets up each episode.
* [[Shelley Morrison]] as '''Sister Sixto,''' a Puerto Rican nun who always misinterprets English slang.
* [[Linda Dangcil]] as '''Sister Ana,''' a younger nun who also attends to the convent.
* [[Vito Scotti]] as '''Captain Gaspar Fomento,''' the local police officer and the only regular character in the series who never knew about Sister Bertrille's ability to fly.
* [[Alejandro Rey]] as '''Carlos Ramirez,''' a local casino owner and playboy. Ramirez is an orphan raised by the nuns, and though his is a sinful life by comparison to their ideals, he still maintains his gratitude, helping them whenever he can. This constantly leads him to get swept, usually against his will, into Sister Bertrille's zany schemes, which she concocts with alarming frequency.

==Production==
After the cancellation of ABC's ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]],'' in which Sally Field starred in the title role, producers sought a way to keep Field on the air. As a result, ''The Flying Nun'' was developed.&lt;ref name="Oprah"&gt;{{cite web|last=Winfrey|first=Oprah|title=Oprah Talks to Sally Field|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Sally-Field/4|website=[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|accessdate=February 28, 2013|page=4|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field found the concept of the show silly and  refused the role at first, only to resettle on it after her stepfather, [[Jock Mahoney]], warned her that she might not work again in show business if she did not accept the role.&lt;ref name="Oprah" /&gt; [[Screen Gems]] dismissed its second choice, [[Ronne Troup]], who had already begun filming the pilot. Field recalled hanging from a crane and being humiliated by a parade of episodic television directors, one of whom actually grabbed her shoulders and moved her into position as if she were a prop. She credits co-star Madeleine Sherwood for encouraging her to enroll in acting classes.&lt;ref name=DVD&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Sally Field|date=March 21, 2006|title=The Flying Nun – The Complete First Season: Interview featurette with Sally Field|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]|asin=B000E3L7EQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field has commented that she has great affection for her young ''Gidget'' persona and was proud of her work on that show, but she has also admitted that she disliked and was embarrassed with ''The Flying Nun.''&lt;ref name=DVD/&gt;

Prior to the production of ''The Flying Nun,'' producers were concerned with how the series would be received by Catholics. In an effort to prevent religious criticism, the National Catholic Office for Radio and Television (NCORT), served as a series adviser with on-screen credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Richard|title=The Church on TV: Portrayals of Priests, Pastors and Nuns on American Television Series|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Continuum]]|isbn=1441157972|pages=39–40|date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The NCORT, like its motion-picture counterpart, the National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures, was ultimately absorbed into the United States Catholic Conference, and both were later merged into the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Office for Film and Broadcasting|Office for Film and Broadcasting]] of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], or USCCB.)
 
The San Juan convent courtyard exterior was actually the rear area of a house façade at the [[Movie ranch#Warner Brothers "Ranch"|Warner Brothers Ranch]]'s suburban street/backlot in [[Burbank, California]], along Hollywood Way north of West Oak Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PF Ranch Tour|url=http://www.cmongethappy.com/people/ranchtour4.html|publisher=C'mon, Get Happy|accessdate=February 27, 2013|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pilot episode and the series opening and closing credits were actually filmed on location in [[Puerto Rico]].  Serra Retreat Center, Malibu has photos in one of their conference rooms stating the exterior was shot there.

A soundtrack LP featuring songs from the series sung by Sally Field, titled ''Star Of "The Flying Nun,"'' was released by [[Colgems]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flying Nun – Soundtrack Details|url=http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/title/21229/Flying+Nun,+The|publisher=Soundtrack Collector|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series gradually changed comedic gears in its second season, focusing on [[slapstick]] and other forms of broad humor, which overzealous but bungling police Captain Gaspar Fomento, played by [[Vito Scotti]], usually fomented. Beginning in the show's third (and final) season, changes were made to revert the series to a "warm and slightly saccharine" tone as seen in the first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Cynthia|title=Many TV Series Being Overhauled|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZdxVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8uADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4471,2552745&amp;dq=tv+viewer+flying+nun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 27, 2013|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard]]|date=August 11, 1969|agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem the show's producers had to contend with during its last season was the fact that at the beginning of the filming schedule, Field was noticeably pregnant with her first child. This was a logistical nightmare for a series in which Field's character was supposed to be a religious celibate, and skinny enough to fly away in the wind. The producers solved the problem by using props and scenery to block view of Field's body below the chest, and using long shots of Field's stunt double for the flying sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bun in the Oven: A Flying, Not to Mention Pregnant, Nun|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1878293_1878320_1878372,00.html|periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=February 28, 2013|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the show ended, Field starred in another situation comedy, ''[[The Girl with Something Extra]].'' She later turned to doing drama and movies as she wanted to move from comedic roles to serious ones.

==Broadcast history==
During its first two seasons, ''The Flying Nun'' aired on Thursday nights at 8:00pm EST, where the series competed in the ratings with ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Complete Television Programs for Thursday|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hMYwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_WwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7310,843192&amp;dq=thursday+tv+programs&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 27, 2013|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|date=February 6, 1969|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was an instant hit, with high ratings and was declared the "hit of the season;" however, the ratings dropped as the season progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Laurent|first=Lawrence|title=Marge Gets Bigger In 'Flying Nun' Role|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K90yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oVoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3966,1052421&amp;dq=the+flying+nun&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 27, 2013|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=September 12, 1968|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its second year, the series was scheduled against ''Daniel Boone'' and ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]].'' During its final season, the series was moved to Wednesday nights at 7:30pm EST, scheduled opposite ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]].'' All of the competing shows ranked higher in the ratings than ''The Flying Nun,'' which eventually led to its cancellation. During its two-year run, the series was a part of a three-show comedy block on ABC that also consisted of ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[That Girl]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Cynthia|title=Nielson Ratings Smashing Several Television Shows|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RYc1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yqkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3077,4710348&amp;dq=the+flying+nun+tv+ratings&amp;hl=en|accessdate=February 27, 2013|newspaper=[[The Item|The Sumter Daily Item]]|date=November 15, 1968|agency=[[Associated Press]]|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its early popularity, the show's ratings never broke the Nielsen top thirty.

The '''''Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce''''' or simply '''''Una Voce''''' ([[Latin]] for "With One Voice"; from the [[Preface (liturgy)|preface]] to the [[Roman Canon]]) is an international federation of [[Catholic]] lay organizations attached to the [[Tridentine Mass]], colloquially known as "the Latin Mass" (though there are several rites, i. e., versions, of [[Latin Mass|Catholic Masses in Latin]]).&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/03/02/latin_mass_finds_home/?page=2|title=Latin Mass finds home Traditional service draws the faithful to Newton parish|last=Noonan |first= Erica |date=March 2, 2008 |work=[[Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-05-26-tridentinemass_N.htm|title=Pope overrides objections on traditional Mass|last= Winfield|first=Nicole|date= 27 May 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce'' (or FIUV) was founded on December 19, 1964 in Paris by Georges Cerbelaud-Salagnac in order to promote the Tridentine Mass from the Pre-Vatican II ''[[Missale Romanum]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="durufle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crouan"&gt;{{cite book|last= Crouan|first=Denis|author2=Sebanc, Mark  |title=The Liturgy After Vatican II: Collapsing Or Resurgent?|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2001|pages=29|isbn=978-0-89870-841-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTAtckR3Rd8C&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization argues that while the [[Second Vatican Council]] had introduced vernacular liturgies, it did not actually forbid the Latin Mass, and that regular weekday and Sunday Masses in Latin should be maintained.&lt;ref name="latin" /&gt; The organization also seeks to promote Latin [[Gregorian Chant]], sacred [[polyphony]] and sacred art.&lt;ref name="durufle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crouan" /&gt; Unlike some of the other [[Traditionalist Catholicism|Catholic traditionalist]] organizations, Una Voce seeks to remain faithful to the Pope within the Roman Catholic Church,&lt;ref name="durufle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crouan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buffalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unavoce.org/news/2006/Buffalo.htm |title=Catholic group requests church where all Masses are in Latin |accessdate=2009-02-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603144959/http://www.unavoce.org/news/2006/Buffalo.htm |archivedate=June 3, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts that the Tridentine and the vernacular masses should be allowed to co-exist.&lt;ref name="crouan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buffalo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Latin Mass is welcomed by traditionalists|last=Tu|first=Janet I. |date=17 September 2007 |work=The Seattle Times|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003888263_latinmass17m.html|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its prominent early members were the composers [[Maurice Duruflé]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]].&lt;ref name="durufle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frolich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frölich|first=Laurent |title=Les catholiques intransigeants en France |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2002|pages=90–91|isbn=978-2-7475-1619-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21ht68MzgSQC&amp;pg=PA90|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of national associations developed during 1964 and 1965, and in 1966 an international association, the ''Foederatio Internationalis Una Voce'' was formed. It currently has over two dozen national affiliates.&lt;ref name="durufle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latin"&gt;{{cite book|last= Waquet |first=Francois|title=Latin: A Symbol's Empire|publisher=Verso|year=2001|pages=75|isbn=978-1-85984-615-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVTr98xBsiQC&amp;pg=PA75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kocik|first=Thomas M. |title=The Reform of the Reform? |publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2003|pages=13|isbn= 978-0-89870-946-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zg8w_7k4k4wC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIUV members value the traditional Latin Mass as direct link with the early Church and for conveying the mystery and majesty of God,&lt;ref name="US" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt; but have been critiqued for elitism and for its emphasis on private religious devotion.&lt;ref name="Horgan" /&gt; The group has been described as an "arch-conservative" organization by [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] organist James E Frazier.&lt;ref name="durufle"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=James E|title=Maurice Duruflé |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|year=2007|pages=223–4, 331|isbn=978-1-58046-227-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EW4FfK2XhWoC&amp;pg=PA331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalist Catholics usually uphold orthodox Catholic moral teaching on [[abortion]], [[contraception]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref name="buffalo" /&gt; However, members of the FIUV reject comparisons to [[fundamentalism]].&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070617/25church.htm|title=A Return to the Latin Mass Clashes with congregants may erupt as a growing number of young priests push for a revival of pre-Vatican II customs|last=Ferkenhoff|first=Eric|date=June 25, 2007|work=[[US News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=2009-02-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201155652/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070617/25church.htm|archivedate=December 1, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
