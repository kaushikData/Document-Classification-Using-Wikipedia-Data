      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">'''Aesopian language''' is communications that convey an innocent meaning to outsiders but hold a concealed meaning to informed members of a conspiracy or underground movement. For instance, if Person X is known for exposing secrets in an organization, the organization leaders announce that "any members who have dirty talking habits will be dealt with" to warn Person X. It refers to the ancient Greek fabulist [[Aesop]].

The term "Aesopian language" was first used by the nineteenth-century Russian writer [[Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin]] to describe the writing technique he began using late in his career, which he compared to [[Aesop's Fables]]. His purpose was to satirize the social ills of the time but evade the harsh [[censorship]] of the late [[Russian Empire]] of which he was a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;Prozorov, V.V. (1990). [http://az.lib.ru/s/saltykow_m_e/text_0540.shtml "М.Е.Saltykov-Shchedrin"]. Russian Writers. Biobibliographical Dictionary. Vol 2. Ed. P.A.Nikolayev. Moscow, "Prosveshcheniye" Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-era writer [[Lev Loseff]] noted that the use of Aesopian language remained a favorite technique of writers (including himself) under Soviet censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Loseff, ''On the Beneficence of Censorship: Aesopian Language in Modern Russian Literature'', Munich: Otto Sagner, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Maliheh Tyrell defines the term in the Soviet context and observes that the use of Aesopian language extended to other national literatures under Soviet rule: 
:"In short, this form of literature, like Aesop's animal fables, veils itself in allegorical suggestions, hints, and euphemisms so as to elude political censorship. 'Aesopian language' or literature is a technical term used by Sovietologists to define allegorical language used by Russian or nationality [that is: non-Russian] nonconformist publicists to conceal antiregime sentiments. Under Soviet rule, this 'Aesopian' literature intended to confuse the Soviet authorities, yet illuminate the truth for native readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=h4N_dneMybQC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=literature+intended+to+confuse+the+Soviet+authorities,+yet+illuminate+the+truth+for+native+readers.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d8VHTCRPO9&amp;sig=9l5K0mKy1wMkHiMWTaxyCfWc8SQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif0omBq_zSAhXlZpoKHSw_Ah4Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=literature%20intended%20to%20confuse%20the%20Soviet%20authorities,%20yet%20illuminate%20the%20truth%20for%20native%20readers.&amp;f=false|title=Aesopian Literary Dimensions of Azerbaijani Literature of the Soviet Period, 1920-1990|last=Tyrrell|first=Maliheh S.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739101698|location=|pages=3–4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to one critic, "Censorship... had a positive, formative impact upon the Aesopian writers' style by obliging them to sharpen their thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Harry B. Weber, ed., ''The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet Literature'', Gulf Breeze, FL: Academic International Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German-American philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] uses the term in his book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' somewhat interchangeably with [[Orwellian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;see H. Marcuse, "One-Dimensional Man". Beacon Press, Boston. 1991 (1964) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, "Aesopian Language" refers to the idea that certain usages of language work to 'suppress certain concepts or keep them out of the general discourse within society'.&lt;ref&gt;H. Marcuse, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a technique is the use of abbreviations to possibly prevent undesirable questions from arising: "[[AFL-CIO]] entombs the radical political differences which once separated the two organizations."&lt;ref&gt;H. Marcuse, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of politics, a term with a very similar meaning is called [[dog-whistle politics]], which describes the use of coded language to address voters' interests. Certain sections of the electorate will react strongly to controversial content if spoken of overtly but may not be so attuned that they notice statements that appear neutral to outsiders.

'''''Against Equality of Opportunity''''' is a 2002 book by [[Matt Cavanagh]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/against-equality-of-opportunity-by-matt-cavanagh-660575.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Against Equality of Opportunity by Matt Cavanagh - Reviews}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The work is a critique of the doctrine of [[equal opportunity]]. Cavanagh argues against the conventional understanding of equal opportunity, in particular both meritocracy and most substantial interpretations of equality, including the idea of ‘equal life chances’. Instead, he argues for a more limited approach of trying to eliminate specific kinds of discrimination (including race discrimination), together with trying to provide enough opportunities, and help to access them, such that most people have some degree of control over their lives.&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/19930/part_2/more-like-a-beauty-contest.thtml ''Against Equality of Opportunity''] Review in ''The Spectator''  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504134943/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/19930/part_2/more-like-a-beauty-contest.thtml |date=May 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Allegations of racism===
The book caused some controversy when the author was appointed as an adviser to then Labour Minister [[David Blunkett]] when it was revealed that the book argued that it was sometimes rational (in an economic sense) for white employers to discriminate against black applicants&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Suroor, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/03/23/stories/2004032302561700.htm "Asian MPs protest `racist' remarks of Blunkett's adviser"], ''The Hindu'', 22 March 20045&lt;/ref&gt; which in some eyes amounted to effectively condoning racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1457399/Labours-black-and-Asian-members-demand-sacking-of-Blunkett-race-adviser.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Melissa | last1=Kite | first2=Rajeev | last2=Syal | title=Labour's black and Asian members demand sacking of Blunkett race adviser | date=21 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to widespread calls for Cavanagh to be sacked, with questions tabled in Parliament, and the affair rumbled on for a few days. ''The Guardian'''s letters page carried a balance of letters for and against Cavanagh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/22/immigrationpolicy | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Letters: Philosophy and the real world | date=22 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews and academic reaction===
The book received positive reviews in the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;John Dunn, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=169885&amp;sectioncode=5 "Why we should spurn equality and meritocracy"], ''Times Educational Supplement'', 21 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Spectator]]'',&lt;ref name=Spectator/&gt; and in academic journals including ''[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=10|title=The American Economic Review | volume=16 | pages=670–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Notre Dame Philosophical Review'',&lt;ref&gt;Louis Pojman, [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1041 Matt Cavanagh – Against Equal Opportunity – Review], ''Philosophical Reviews'', University of Notre Dame, 1 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Theory and Research in Education]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tre.sagepub.com/content/2/1/85.extract ] ''Theory and Research in Education'', vol '''2'''(1), (March 2004), pp. 85–96&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Contemporary Political Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowles | first1 = Dudley | year = 2003 | title = Against Equality of Opportunity review | url = http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpt/journal/v2/n1/abs/9300060a.html | journal = Contemporary Political Theory | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 131–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were more mixed, including the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n18/jeremy-waldron/deservingness "Deservingness"], ''London Review of Books'', Vol. '''24''', No. 18, 19 September 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; ''Philosophical Books''&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Cruft, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0149.2005.0357a.x/abstract "Against Equality of Opportunity"], ''Philosophical Books'', Volume '''46''', Issue 1, pp. 59–65, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Political Studies Association|Political Studies Review]]''&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Mason, [http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/PSR/R_1478_9299_1078_1003296.asp Against Equality of Opportunity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927225534/http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/PSR/R_1478_9299_1078_1003296.asp |date=September 27, 2011 }}, ''Political Studies Review'', Volume '''1''', Issue 3, pp. 346–82, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Utilitas]]'', the latter two arguing that the work does not adequately engage other scholarly literature relating to equality of opportunity by authors such as [[Joel Feinberg]] or [[George Sher]].

'''Analytica''' is a visual software package developed by Lumina Decision Systems for creating, analyzing and communicating quantitative decision models.&lt;ref&gt;Granger Morgan and Max Henrion (1998), [http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF Analytica:A Software Tool for Uncertainty Analysis and Model Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630125258/http://www.lumina.com/software/ch10.9.PDF |date=June 30, 2007 }}, Chapter 10 of ''Uncertainty: A Guide to Dealing with Uncertainty in Quantitative Risk and Policy Analysis'', second edition, Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a modeling environment, it is interesting in the way it combines hierarchical [[influence diagram]]s for visual creation and view of models, intelligent arrays for working with multidimensional data, [[Monte Carlo simulation]] for analyzing risk and uncertainty, and [[optimization]], including linear and nonlinear programming. Its design, especially its influence diagrams and treatment of uncertainty, is based on ideas from the field of [[decision analysis]]. As a computer language, it is notable in combining a declarative (non-procedural) structure for referential transparency, array abstraction, and automatic dependency maintenance for efficient sequencing of computation.

== Hierarchical influence diagrams ==
Analytica models are organized as [[influence diagram]]s.  Variables (and other objects) appear as nodes of various shapes on a diagram, connected by arrows that provide a visual representation of dependencies.  Analytica influence diagrams may be hierarchical, in which a single ''module'' node on a diagram represents an entire submodel.

Hierarchical influence diagrams in Analytica serve as a key organizational tool.  Because the visual layout of an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction, people are able to take in far more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is possible with less visual paradigms, such as [[spreadsheet]]s and [[mathematical expression]]s.  Managing the structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.

Influence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication.  Once a quantitative model has been created and its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed.  The ability of a target audience to understand these aspects is critical to the modeling enterprise.  The visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions or cell formulae.  When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by the visual depiction of the model's structure.

The existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of investing in quantitative model building.  When all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on "cross-talk", and therefore lead to more productive interactions within the organization.  The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels.

== Intelligent multidimensional arrays ==

Analytica uses index objects to track the dimensions of multidimensional arrays. An index object has a name and a list of elements.  When two multidimensional values are combined, for example in an expression such as

:&lt;code&gt;Profit = Revenue − Expenses&lt;/code&gt;

where ''Revenue'' and ''Expenses'' are each multidimensional, Analytica repeats the profit calculation over each dimension, but recognizes when same dimension occurs in both values and treats it as the same dimension during the calculation, in a process called ''intelligent array abstraction''.  Unlike most programming languages, there is no inherent ordering to the dimensions in a multidimensional array. This avoids duplicated formulas and explicit FOR loops, both common sources of modeling errors. The simplified expressions made possible by intelligent array abstraction allow the model to be more accessible, interpretable, and transparent.

Another consequence of intelligent array abstraction is that new dimensions can be introduced or removed from an existing model, without requiring changes to the model structure or changes to variable definitions.  For example, while creating a model, the model builder might assume a particular variable, for example ''[[discounted cash flow|discount_rate]]'', contains a single number.  Later, after constructing a model, a user might replace the single number with a table of numbers, perhaps ''discount_rate'' broken down by ''Country'' and by ''Economic_scenario''.  These new divisions may reflect the fact that the effective discount rate is not the same for international divisions of a company, and that different rates are applicable to different hypothetical scenarios.  Analytica automatically propagates these new dimensions to any results that depend upon ''discount_rate'', so for example, the result for ''[[Net present value]]'' will become multidimensional and contain these new dimensions.  In essence, Analytica repeats the same calculation using the discount rate for each possible combination of ''Country'' and ''Economic_scenario''.

This flexibility is important when exploring computation tradeoffs between the level of detail, computation time, available data, and overall size or dimensionality of parametric spaces. Such adjustments are common after models have been fully constructed as a way of exploring ''[[What-if analysis|what-if]]'' scenarios and overall relationships between variables.

== Uncertainty analysis ==

Incorporating uncertainty into model outputs helps to provide more realistic and informative projections. Uncertain quantities in Analytica can be specified using a [[probability distribution|distribution function]]. When evaluated, distributions are sampled using either [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercube]] or [[Monte Carlo simulation|Monte Carlo]] sampling, and the samples are propagated through the computations to the results.  The sampled result distribution and summary statistics can then be viewed directly ([[mean]], [[quantile|fractile bands]], [[probability density function]] (PDF), [[cumulative distribution function]] (CDF)), Analytica supports collaborative decision analysis and [[probability management]] through the use of the SIPMath(tm) standard.&lt;ref&gt;The SIPmath&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Standard
http://probabilitymanagement.org/standards.html
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Kaplan and Sam Savage (2011), [http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf Monte Carlo, A Lightbulb for Illuminating Uncertainty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150357/http://probabilitymanagement.org/library/IWM11MarApr_MonteCarlo.pdf |date=2017-03-07 }}, in Investments &amp; Wealth Monitor&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems dynamics modeling ==

[[System dynamics]] is an approach to simulating the behaviour of complex systems over time. It deals with feedback loops and time delays on the behaviour of the entire system. The Dynamic() function in Analytica allows definition of variables with cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops. It expands the [[influence diagram]] notation, which does not normally allow cycles. At least one link in each cycle includes a time lag, depicted as a gray influence arrow to distinguish it from standard black arrows without time lags.

== As a programming language ==

Analytica includes a general language of operators and functions for expressing mathematical relationships among variables. Users can define functions and libraries to extend the language.

Analytica has several features as a [[programming language]] designed to make it easy to use for quantitative modeling: It is a [[visual programming languages|visual programming language]], where users view programs (or "models") as [[influence diagrams]], which they create and edit visually by adding and linking nodes. It is a [[declarative programming language|declarative language]], meaning that a model declares a definition for each variable without specifying an execution sequence as required by conventional [[imperative programming language|imperative languages]]. Analytica determines a correct and efficient execution sequence using the dependency graph. It is a [[referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]] [[functional programming language|functional language]], in that execution of functions and variables have no side effects i.e. changing other variables. Analytica is an [[array programming]] language, where operations and functions generalize to work on multidimensional arrays.

== Applications of Analytica ==

== Editions ==

The Analytica software runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems.  Three editions (Professional, Enterprise, Optimizer) each with more functions and cost, are purchased by users interested in building models. A free edition is available, called Analytica Free 101, which allows you to build medium to moderate sized models of up to 101 user objects.. Free 101 also allows you to view models with more than 101 objects, change inputs, and compute results, which enables free sharing of models for review. A more capable but non-free Power Player enables users to save inputs and utilize database connections. The Analytica Cloud Player allows you to share models over the web and lets users access and run via a web browser.

The most recent release of Analytica is version 5.1, released in May 2018.

== History ==

Analytica's predecessor, called ''Demos'',&lt;ref&gt;
Neil Wishbow and Max Henrion, "Demos User's Manual", Department of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; grew from the research on tools for [[policy analysis]] by Max Henrion as a PhD student and later professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] between 1979 and 1990.  Henrion founded Lumina Decision Systems in 1991 with Brian Arnold.  Lumina continued to develop the software and apply it to environmental and public policy analysis applications.  Lumina first released Analytica as a product in 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">'''Atomism''' or '''social atomism''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] theory arising from the scientific notion ''[[atomic theory]]'', coined by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Democritus]] and the Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]].  In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or [[atom]]s. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the [[individual]] as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory refers to "the tendency for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society.  The individual is the ‘atom’ of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atomism|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/atomism|publisher=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Political implications==
Political theorists such as [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] extend social atomism to the political realm. They assert that human beings are fundamentally self-interested, equal and rational ''social atoms'' that together form an aggregate [[society]] of self-interested individuals. Those participating in society must sacrifice a portion of their individual [[rights]] in order to form a ''[[social contract]]'' with the other persons in society. Ultimately, although some rights are renounced, self-interested cooperation occurs for the mutual preservation of the individuals and for society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Social Contract and Constitutional Republics|url=http://constitution.org/soclcont.htm|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
==Critiques==
Those who criticize the theory of social atomism believe that it neglects the idea of the individual as unique.  Sociologist [[Elizabeth Wolgast]] asserts that,
“From the atomistic standpoint, the individuals who make up a society are interchangeable like molecules in a bucket of water--society a mere aggregate of individuals. This introduces a harsh and brutal equality into our theory of [[human behavior|human life]] and it contradicts our experience of [[human being]]s as unique and irreplaceable, valuable in virtue of their variety--in what they don't share--not in virtue of their common ability to [[reason]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolgast|first=Elizabeth|title=A World of Social Atoms|year=1994|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Those who question social atomism argue that it is unjust to treat all persons equally when individual necessities and circumstances are clearly dissimilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Atomism and the Old World Order |url=http://www.panix.com/~squigle/dcp/atomism.html |publisher=T.R.

'''Avoidance speech''' is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1980). "Speech and song styles: Avoidance styles". In ''The languages of Australia'' (Sections 3.3–3.4, pp. 58–68). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austronesian languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Gary. 1982. Word taboo and comparative Austronesian linguistics. ''Pacific Linguistics'' C–76:157–226.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[North American languages]], [[Highland East Cushitic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Treis, Yvonne. 2005. Avoiding their names, avoiding their eyes: How Kambaata women respect their in-laws. ''Anthrolological Linguistics'' 47.3:292–320&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert K. 1990. ''Hlonipha'' and the Ambiguous Woman. ''Anthropos'' 85:455–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles tend to have the same [[phonology]] and [[grammar]] as the standard language they are a part of. The [[lexicon]], however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.

==Australia==
Avoidance speech in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered [[taboo]]. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] or [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousins]] in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]. All relations are [[classificatory kinship|classificatory]] – more people may fall into the "mother-in-law" category than just a man's wife's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called '''mother-in-law languages''', although they are not actually separate languages but separate [[lexical set]]s with the same [[grammar]] and [[phonology]]. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, ''jijan'', for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]] the avoidance speech verb ''bali-l'' "travel" covers several everyday verbs meaning "go", "walk", "crawl", "paddle", "float, sail, drift", and "limp along". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980:  61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the older member may talk to the younger in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the [[Umpila language|Umpila]], in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 60&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a "secret language" or "mystic language", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
A special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking [[Highland East Cushitic languages]] in southwestern Ethiopia. In [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]] and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], this system is called ''ballishsha'', and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Anbessa Tefera. 1987. Ballissha : Women's Speech Among the Sidama, ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', vol. XX, pp. 44–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who practice ''ballishsha'' do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 292–294&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they may use [[paraphrase]], synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or [[loanword|borrowings]] from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 295&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hlonipha'', or ''isihlonipho'', is a traditional system of avoidance speech in [[Nguni languages|Nguni Bantu languages]] of southern Africa including [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Swazi language|Swazi]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 456&lt;/ref&gt; This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice ''hlonipha'' may not say the names of these men or any words with the same [[Root (linguistics)|root]] as their names.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990:457–459&lt;/ref&gt; They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The ''hlonipha'' system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 460–461&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2808">In [[financial mathematics]], the '''Black–Karasinski model''' is a [[mathematical model]] of the [[term structure]] of [[interest rate]]s; see [[short rate model]].  It is a one-factor model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by a single source of randomness.
It belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models, i.e. it can fit today's [[zero-coupon bond]] prices, and in its most general form, today's prices for a set of caps, floors or European [[swaption]]s. The model was introduced by [[Fischer Black]] and [[Piotr Karasinski]] in 1991.

==Model==

The main state variable of the model is the short rate, which is assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation (under the [[risk-neutral measure]]):

: &lt;math&gt; d\ln(r) = [\theta_t-\phi_t \ln(r)] \, dt + \sigma_t\, dW_t &lt;/math&gt;

where ''dW''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is a standard [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]]. The model implies a [[log-normal distribution]] for the short rate and therefore the [[expected value]] of the money-market account is infinite for any maturity.

In the original article by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski the model was implemented using a [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial tree]] with variable spacing, but a [[trinomial tree]] implementation is more common in practice, typically a lognormal application of the [[Hull–White model#Trees and lattices|Hull-White Lattice]].

==Applications==
The model is used mainly for the pricing of [[exotic option|exotic]] [[interest rate derivative]]s such as [[American option|American]] and [[Bermudan option|Bermudan]] [[bond option]]s and [[swaptions]], once its parameters have been calibrated to the current term structure of interest rates and to the prices or [[implied volatility|implied volatilities]] of [[Interest rate cap|caps]], [[Interest rate floor|floors]] or [[European option|European]] swaptions. [[Numerical method]]s (usually trees) are used in the calibration stage as well as for pricing.

[[File:Chabad5.jpg|thumb|[[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|chassidic Jews]] offer help with laying [[tefilin]] on the street]]
'''Chabad Hasidic outreach''' is a [[Kiruv]] phenomena, whereby [[Chabad]] [[Chasidim]] attempt to encourage Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance.

==History==
{{Jewish outreach}}
Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of [[Hasidic Judaism]], and then his successor, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] were responsible for focusing Chabad's activities on outreach. Each sent out large numbers of rabbinic emissaries, known as "[[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]]", to settle in places across the world for outreach purposes. The centers that these [[Shaliach (Chabad)|Shluchim]] established were termed "[[Chabad houses]]." Rabbi Schneerson was a pioneer in the field of [[Orthodox Judaism outreach]] (''Kiruv'').

[[Chabad]] has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues, and various forms of more direct outreach efforts. The organization has been recognized as one of the leaders in using free holiday services to reach out across denominations.&lt;ref&gt;Fishkoff, Sue. [http://www.texasjewishpost.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=2635&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1128&amp;hn=texasjewishpost&amp;he=.com "‘Praying without paying’ becoming a more popular option among shuls"], ''Texas Jewish Post''. Accessed September 22, 2007. "Many people credit Chabad-Lubavitch with spearheading the movement for free holiday services across the denominational spectrum."&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, had a core of dedicated Hasidim who maintained underground [[yeshivah|yeshivos]] and [[mikveh]]s, and provided [[shechitah]] and [[Brit milah|ritual circumcision]] services in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Chabad House==
Chabad, with its dozens of Chabad Houses throughout the world, where yeshiva programs for Israelis, Russians, French, and Americans, reach out to thousands.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Followers of Chabad can be seen attending to [[Tefillin campaign|tefillin booths]] at the [[Western Wall]] and [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] as well as other public places, and distributing [[Shabbat]] candles on Fridays.

Chabad rabbis and their families are sent to teach college students, to build day schools, and to create youth camps. Many of these efforts are geared towards secular or less religious [[Jews]].  Additionally, unmarried rabbinical students spend weeks during the summer in locations that do not yet have a permanent Chabad presence, making housecalls, putting up [[mezuza|mezuzot]] and teaching about Judaism. This is known as Merkos Shlichus.

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson also initiated a Jewish children's movement, called [[Tzivos Hashem]] (lit. "Army [of] God"), for under [[B'nai Mitzvah|bar/bat mitzvah]]-age children, to inspire them to increase in [[Torah study|study of Torah]] and observance of [[613 Mitzvot|mitzvot]].

Rabbi Schneerson also encouraged the use of modern technology in outreach efforts such as [[Mitzva tank]]s, which are mobile homes that travel a city or country.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The Chabad website, [[chabad.org]], a pioneer of Jewish religious outreach on the [[Internet]], was started by Rabbi Yosef Y. Kazen and developed by Rabbi D. Zirkind.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In June 1994, Rabbi Schneerson died with no successor. Since then, over two thousand couples have taken up communal leadership roles in outreach, bringing the estimated total number of "Shluchim" to over four thousand worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21935">'''Chess notations''' are various systems that have developed to [[notation|record]] either the moves made in a game of [[chess]] or the position of [[chess piece|pieces]] on a [[chessboard]]. The earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into terser notation systems. Currently [[algebraic chess notation]] is the accepted standard and is widely used. Algebraic notation has several variations. [[Descriptive chess notation]] was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late 20th century, but is now obsolete.  There are some special systems for international [[correspondence chess]]. [[Portable Game Notation]] is used when working with computer chess programs.  Systems also exist for transmission using [[Morse code]] over [[telegraph]] or radio.

==Recording moves==
Some move-recording notations are designed mainly for use by human players; others are designed for use by computers.

===Notation systems for humans===

In recognized competitions, all players are required to record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes about whether a player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, if there is a time limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, as there is in most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept.&lt;ref name="GijssenArbitersNotebook"&gt;{{cite web

* '''[[Algebraic chess notation]]''' is more compact than [[descriptive chess notation]], and is the most widely used method for recording the moves of a game of chess. In embryonic form it was used by [[Philip Stamma]] in the 1737 book ''Essai sur le jeu des echecs''. It was later adopted (in long form) by the influential ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' and became standard in German publications. It is more compact and less prone to error than the English descriptive system. Algebraic notation is the official notation of [[FIDE]] which must be used in all recognized international competition involving human players.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Schiller|Schiller, Eric]], ''The Official Rules of Chess'', 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-58042-092-1}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Chess Federation]] prefers the use of algebraic notation but still permits descriptive notation.&lt;ref name="USCF Rulebook ChangesAug2007"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rulebook Changes (as of August 2007) |url=http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7594/28/ |publisher=The United States Chess Federation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222821/http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7594/28/ |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:* ''Standard algebraic notation'' (SAN) is the notation standardized by FIDE.&lt;ref name="FIDERulesAppendices"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?view=article&amp;id=125 | title=FIDE Handbook: Rules - Appendices | publisher=[[Fédération Internationale des Échecs]] | accessdate=September 29, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003050537/http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=125&amp;view=article | archivedate=October 3, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It omits the starting [[file (chess)|file]] and [[rank (chess)|rank]] of the [[chess piece|piece]], unless it is necessary to disambiguate the move.
:* ''Figurine algebraic notation'' (FAN) is a widely used variation of standard algebraic notation that which replaces the letter that stands for a piece by its [[Chess symbols in Unicode|symbol]], e.g., '''♞c6'''  instead of '''Nc6''' or '''♖xg4''' instead of '''Rxg4'''. Pawns are omitted as in standard algebraic notation.  This enables the moves to be read independent of language. To display or print these symbols on a computer, one or more [[font]]s with good [[Unicode]] support must be installed, and the document (web page, word processor document, etc.) must use one of these fonts.&lt;ref name="alanwoodTestForUnicodeSuportInBrowser"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols.html |title=Test for Unicode support in Web browsers |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103134038/http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/miscellaneous_symbols.html |archivedate=2008-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For more information see [[Chess symbols in Unicode]].
:* ''Long algebraic notation'' (LAN) includes the starting file and rank of the piece, followed by a dash.
:* ''Minimal algebraic notation'' (MAN) is similar to SAN but omits the indicators for capture ("x") and check ("+"). It was used by ''Chess Informant''.&lt;ref name="Chess960"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chessville.com/reviews/PlayStrongerChessExaminingChess960.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622105629/http://chessville.com/reviews/PlayStrongerChessExaminingChess960.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-date=22 June 2006 | title=Not Your Father’s Chess | accessdate=29 September 2013 | author=Jeffreys, Michael | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Reversible algebraic notation'' (RAN) is based on LAN, but adds an additional letter for the piece that was captured, if any. The move can be reversed by moving the piece to its original square, and restoring the captured piece. For example, Rd2xBd6.&lt;ref name="Chess960" /&gt;
:* ''Concise reversible algebraic notation'' (CRAN) is like RAN, but omits the file or rank if it is not needed to disambiguate the move. For example, Rd2xB6. This notation is recommended by Gene Milener in ''Play Stronger Chess by Examining Chess 960: Usable Strategies for Fischer Random Chess Discovered''.&lt;ref name="Chess960" /&gt;
:* ''[http://www.castlelong.com/essay/Essay_HSym_fd47b_Doc_Prn.PDF Figurine concise reversible algebraic notation]'' (FCRAN) is a form of CRAN with non-Staunton figurines, used by Gene Milener during [[Chess960]] tournaments.
*'''[[Descriptive chess notation]]''', '''English notation''' or '''English descriptive notation'''. Until the 1970s, at least in English-speaking countries, chess games were recorded and published using this notation. This is still used by a dwindling number of mainly older players, and by those who read old books (some of which are still important&lt;ref name="McKimGreat Chess BooksAtSilman"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Chess Books |url=http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_gst_wrtrs/041004_great_chess_books.html |author=McKim, D.K. |publisher=Jeremy Silman |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219005645/http://www.jeremysilman.com/chess_gst_wrtrs/041004_great_chess_books.html |archivedate=2007-12-19 |df= }} Published by an International Master and prolific writer.&lt;/ref&gt;).
*'''[[ICCF numeric notation]]'''. In international correspondence chess the use of algebraic notation may cause confusion, since different languages have different names for the pieces. The standard for transmitting moves in this form of chess is ICCF numeric notation.&lt;ref name="ChessNotationICCFNumeric"&gt;{{cite web |title=ICCF Numeric Chess Notation |url=http://chessnotation.com/ICCFnumeric.htm |publisher=ChessNotation.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170105003412/http://chessnotation.com/ICCFnumeric.htm |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[https://www.chessclub.com/chessviewer/smith.html '''Smith notation'''] is a straightforward chess notation designed to be reversible and represent any move without ambiguity. The notation encodes the source square, destination square, and what piece was captured, if any.
* '''Coordinate notation''' is similar to algebraic notation except that no abbreviation or symbol is used to show which piece is moving. It can do this almost without ambiguity because it always includes the square from which the piece moves as well as its destination, but promotions must be disambiguated by including the promoted piece type, such as in parentheses. It has proved hard for humans to write and read, but is used internally by some chess-related computer software.

The following table lists examples of the same moves in some of the notations which may be used by humans. Each table cell contains White's move followed by Black's move, as they are listed in a single line of written notation.

In all forms of notation, the result is usually indicated at the conclusion of the game by either "1–0", indicating that White won, "0–1" indicating that Black won or "½–½", indicating a draw. Moves that result in checkmate can be marked with "#", "++", or "‡" or to indicate the end of game and the winner, instead of or in addition to "1–0" or "0–1".

Annotators commenting on a game frequently use question marks ("?") and exclamation marks ("!") to label a move as bad or praise the move as a good one (see [[Chess annotation symbols]]).&lt;ref name="ExeterCCCommentCodes"&gt;{{cite web

===Notation systems for computers===
The following are commonly used for chess-related computer systems (in addition to Coordinate and Smith notation, which are described above):
*'''[[Portable Game Notation]]''' (PGN). This is the most common of several notations that have emerged based upon algebraic chess notation, for recording chess games in a format suitable for computer processing.&lt;ref name="InternetChessClubPGNSpec"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Steno-Chess'''. This is another format suitable for computer processing. It sacrifices the ability to play through games (by a human) for conciseness, which minimises the number of characters required to store a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessvariants.com/problems.dir/steno-chess.html|title=Steno-Chess|first=Éric|last=Angelini|date=|website=www.chessvariants.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110114830/http://www.chessvariants.com/problems.dir/steno-chess.html|archivedate=10 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Forsyth–Edwards Notation]]''' (FEN).  A single line format which gives the current positions of pieces on a board, to enable generation of a board in something other than the initial array of pieces.  It also contains other information such as castling rights, move number, and color on move.  It is incorporated into the PGN standard as a Tag Pair in conjunction with the SetUp tag.
*'''Extended Position Description''' (EPD). Another format which gives the current positions of a board, with an extended set of structured attribute values using the ASCII character set. It is intended for data and command interchange among chessplaying programs. It is also intended for the representation of portable opening library repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechessdrum.net/PGN_Reference.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822185456/http://www.thechessdrum.net/PGN_Reference.txt |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is better than FEN for certain [[chess variant]]s, such as [[Chess960]].

===Notation for telegraph and radio===
Some special methods of notation were used for transmitting moves by telegraph or radio, usually using [[Morse Code]].  The Uedemann code and Gringmuth notation worked by using a two-letter label for each square and transmitting four letters – two letters for the origin square followed by two letters for the destination square.  Castling is shown as a king move.  Squares are designated from White's side of the board, files from left to right and ranks from nearest to farthest.  The Rutherford code first converted the move into a number and then converted the move number into a composite Latin word.  It could also transmit moves of two games at the same time.
&lt;!-- The codes below are in subsections so they can be linked from other articles --&gt;

====Uedemann code====
This code was devised by [[Louis Uedemann]] (1854–1912).  The method was never actually used, mainly because a transposition of letters can result in a valid but incorrect move.  Many sources incorrectly use this name for the Gringmuth code.

The files are labeled "A", "E", "I", "O", "O", "I", "E", and "A".  The ranks are labeled "B", "D", "F", "G", "H", "K", "L", and "P". A square on the [[queenside]] is designated by its file letter and then its rank letter.  A square on the [[kingside]] is designated by its rank letter then its file letter.&lt;ref name="Hooper"&gt;[[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper]] and [[Kenneth Whyld]], 1992, ''[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]]'', {{ISBN|0-19-280049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gringmuth notation====
This method was invented by Dmitry Alexeyevich Gringmuth but it is sometimes incorrectly called the Uedemann Code.  It was used as early as 1866.  Files were designated with one of two letters, depending on whether it was on White's side or Black's side.  These letters were: B and M, C and N, D and P, F and R, G and S, H and T, K and W, L and Z.  Ranks were labeled: "A", "E", "I", "O", "O", "I", "E", and "A".&lt;ref name="Hooper" /&gt;

====Rutherford code====
This code was invented in 1880 by Sir [[William Watson Rutherford]] (1853–1927).  At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or [[cipher]]s in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words.  This method also allowed moves for two games to be transmitted at the same time.  In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games.  The move number of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the move number of the second game.  Leading zeros were added as necessary to give a four-digit number.  The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots.  The third digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes.  The resulting word was transmitted.

After rules were changed so that ciphers were allowed in telegrams, this system was replaced by the Gringmuth Notation.&lt;ref name="Hooper" /&gt;

==Recording positions==
Positions are usually shown as diagrams (images), using the symbols shown here for the pieces.

There is also a notation for recording positions in text format, called the [[Forsyth–Edwards Notation|Forsyth–Edwards notation]] (FEN). This is useful for adjourning a game to resume later or for conveying chess problem positions without a diagram. A position can also be recorded by listing the pieces and the squares they reside on, for example: White: Ke1, Rd3, etc.

Written chess notation recording is often necessary when participating in chess tournaments. In many tournaments players are required to record their games' notation on a score sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Read and Write Chess Notation|url=https://chesswarehouse.com/blogs/news/chess-notation-how-to-read-write|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413155001/https://chesswarehouse.com/blogs/news/chess-notation-how-to-read-write|archivedate=2017-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame classification==
There are also systems for classifying types of endgames. See [[Chess endgame#Endgame classification]] for more details.

==History==
[[Image:ChessOldDN.jpg|tright|thumb|280px|Page from 1841 ''[[Chess Player's Chronicle]]'']]
The notation for chess moves evolved slowly, as these examples show. The last is in [[algebraic chess notation]]; the others show the evolution of [[descriptive chess notation]] and use spelling and notation of the period.

An exercise full of delight; fit for princes, or any person of what qualitie soeuer''. Published by A. S. Gent. 1614&lt;/ref&gt; The great 18th-century player [[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor]] used an almost equally verbose approach in his influential book "Analyse du jeu des Échecs", for example, "The king's bishop, at his queen bishop's fourth square."&lt;ref&gt;François-André Danican Philidor, ''Analysis of the Game of Chess (1777)'', Hardinge Simpole, 2005 (reprint), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Algebraic chess notation]] was first used by [[Philipp Stamma]] (c. 1705–1755) in an almost fully developed form before the now obsolete [[descriptive chess notation]] evolved.  The main difference between Stamma's system and the modern system is that Stamma used "p" for pawn moves and the original [[file (chess)|file]] of the piece ("a" through "h") instead of the initial letter of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

In London in 1747, Philidor convincingly defeated Stamma in a match. Consequently, his writings (which were translated into English) became more influential than Stamma's in the English-speaking chess world; this may have led to the adoption of a descriptive system for writing chess moves, rather than Stamma's coordinate-based approach. However, algebraic notation became popular in Europe following its adoption by the highly influential [[Handbuch des Schachspiels]], and became dominant in Europe during the 20th century. However, it did not become popular in the English-speaking countries until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="McCraryHistoryOfNotation"&gt;{{cite web

''Star Wars'' was introduced as a feature film, ''[[A New Hope (film)|A New Hope]]'' (1977). A novelization titled ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'', based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, ''Star Wars'' quickly grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

==Differences==
''Star Trek'' debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]], but evolved into an idealistic, [[utopia]]n prospect of future human society. Inspired by ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'',&lt;ref name="Simon1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Keller Simon|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOtvQHj1AdIC&amp;pg=PA139|date=23 November 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92442-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Clark|title=Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_lxVMh_5xwC&amp;pg=PT22|date=1 April 2012|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-963-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek''{{'}}s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. ''Star Trek'' occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] and [[Multiverse|interdimensional travel]]. The [[Earth in science fiction|Earth of the ''Star Trek'']] universe shares most of its history with the real world.

''Star Wars'' debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. ''Star Wars'' mainly belongs to the [[space opera]] [[subgenre]] of science fiction that follows [[The Hero's Journey]]&lt;ref&gt;Clive Williams, The Hero’s Journey: A Mudmap for Change, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, (002216781770549), (2017).
Crossref&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]], [[King Arthur]]&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. ''Star Wars'' Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucasfilm|title=Star Wars and History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=m81Bg4E_y_IC}}|date=15 October 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-28525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. ''Star Wars'' is set "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", although many characters are human, occasionally use [[Earth]] metaphors and exhibit human character traits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. ''Star Wars'' has not produced any live-action television series while ''Star Trek'' has produced seven live-action television series.

''Star Trek'' likewise has not produced any [[television film]]s; whereas ''Star Wars'' has produced at least three live-action television films outside the ''Star Wars'' film saga. The ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' are all live-action television spin-off films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but not considered part of the official ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars canon]]''.

===Runtime===
* ~513 hours (''Star Trek'' television) + ~25 hours (''Star Trek'' films)
* ~84 hours (''Star Wars'' films) + ''Star Wars'' canon series + expanded universe films and TV productions.

==Similarities and commonalities==
Aside from both having the word ''star'' in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the [[space western]] subgenre.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in ''Star Trek'' consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. ''Star Wars'' depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and was again later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] after a series of wars.

Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages.

The primary philosophies of ''Star Trek'' convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by [[morality play|morality tales]] such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="Simon1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"/&gt;

The primary philosophical messages of ''Star Wars'' are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref name="Decker2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin S. |last=Decker|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pDMRdxLocsUC}}|date=1 October 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-0101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' preaches against [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] systems and favors societies that offer equality.&lt;ref name="Redmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sean |last=Redmond|title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ha5O_0BCCrgC|page=303}}|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-87-1|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the ''Star Wars'' 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, [[Patrick Stewart]] stated "A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of ''Star Wars'' is a very very positive one."

There have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''Seaquest''.

Both franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]. Many planets and alien species in ''Star Trek'', for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various ''Star Trek'' television series, such as "[[Who Mourns for Adonais]]", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.&lt;ref name="Kapell2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew Wilhelm |last=Kapell|title=Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hWS7v3pGynUC}}|date=1 March 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also make references to [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]] and its [[Babylonian religion|mythic folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksarchive.com/viewstory.php?sid=4899|title=Star Trek as Myth Through an Analysis of the Similarities and Differences Between the Gilgamesh/Enkidu and Kirk/Spock Relationships|publisher=The Kirk/Spock fanfiction archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klingon]]s and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/startrek/startrek1.htm|title=Star Trek And the New Myth of the Machine as Seen in the Talosians, Trelane, and the Organians|work=Ken Sanes|publisher=Transperancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Star Wars''{{'}} story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including [[Classical antiquity|classical Greece and Rome]], such as the fall of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] in ''Star Wars'', followed by the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which parallels the fall of the ancient [[Roman Republic]] followed by the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

A 1983 documentary on the making of ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' was hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-2-20/leonard-nimoy-hosts-1983-return-jedi-set-visit-awesome-long-lost-clip|title=Leonard Nimoy hosts 1983 Return of the Jedi set visit in this awesome, long-lost clip|work=Trent Moore|publisher=SyFyWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abrams era ===
[[J. J. Abrams]], director and producer of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and producer of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), directed and produced ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] starred in both series.

''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) was poorly received and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.

The newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/star-wars-abu-dhabi-the-worthy-zinzana-rattle-the-cage-justice-1201677541/|title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens Helps Abu Dhabi Build Road To Somewhere - Deadline|author=Ali Jaafar|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scenes for cities in the film ''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/star-trek-beyond-descends-on-dubai-jlt-difc-raided-2015-10-13-1.606444|title='Star Trek Beyond' descends on Dubai: JLT, DIFC 'raided'|work=Emirates 24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.

==Estimated financial comparisons==
Despite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the ''Star Wars'' film series exceed the profit of the ''Star Trek'' film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.

==Critique and commentaries==
Science fiction writer [[David Brin]] criticized ''Star Wars'' at the time of the release of ''The Phantom Menace'', arguing that while the ''Star Wars'' movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with ''Star Wars'' and George Lucas, whom he accused of "having an agenda", is that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy is too "elitist", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the [[Galactic Civil War]] as part of the "same genetically superior royal family".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists|first=David|last=Brin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the ''Star Wars'' universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that [[Luke Skywalker]] killing [[Palpatine]] would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Among the many other flaws he sees with ''Star Wars'' is that [[Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a hero in the ending of ''Return of the Jedi'' simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, ''Star Trek'' is "democratic" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[William Shatner]] argues that ''Star Trek'' is superior to ''Star Wars''. According to him, "''Star Trek'' had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Shatner believes that ''Star Wars'' was only better than ''Star Trek'' in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, ''Star Trek'' was able to "supersede ''Star Wars'' on every level".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/william-shatner-star-trek-star-wars_n_964530.html|title=William Shatner: 'Star Wars Is Derivative Of Star Trek'|first1=Gazelle Emami Deputy Features|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=15 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Russ]], who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that ''Star Trek'' reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. ''Star Wars'' in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the [[Eastern philosophy]] of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, ''Star Trek'' comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in "our" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas ''Star Wars'' takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] is best known for his role as [[Boba Fett]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. He is a huge fan of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. He argued that while both franchises are popular, ''Star Wars'' comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

Contrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued, "''Trek'' fandom revolves around technology because the ''Star Trek'' universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. [[Physics and Star Wars|The science in ''Star Wars'']] is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because ''Star Wars'' isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second [[Death Star]] works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html|title='Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor|date=29 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenzel of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlighted two differences in approach, noting the "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style of ''Star Wars'' compared with ''Star Trek''{{'}}s "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity" and that the spiritual aspect of ''Star Wars'' contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101|title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe|author=John Wenzel|date=11 October 2009|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire [[Peter Thiel]] told Dowd "I'm a capitalist. ''Star Wars'' is the capitalist show. ''Star Trek'' is the communist one". He further stated "There is no money in ''Star Trek'' because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of ''Star Wars'' starts with [[Han Solo]] having this debt that he owes and so the plot in ''Star Wars'' is driven by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/peter-thiel-star-trek-communist-star-wars-capitalist/|title=Peter Thiel Thinks 'Star Trek' Is 'Communist' While 'Star Wars' Is 'Capitalist'|date=11 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archived footage in ''[[Trek Nation]]'' showed [[Gene Roddenberry]] saying, "I like ''Star Wars''. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;[[Trek Nation]] [2010 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on each other==
{{see also|Star Wars sources and analogues}} 
The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits ''Star Wars'' for launching the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name="dominguez19990517"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 ''Star Trek'' fan convention in [[Las Vegas]] by stating "''Star Wars'' created ''Star Trek''". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope''), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A ''Star Trek'' relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/07/william-shatner-says-star-wars-created-star-trek/|title=William Shatner Says Star Wars Created Star Trek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was ''Star Wars'' that thrust ''Star Trek'' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" Shatner stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/06/media/william-shatner-star-wars-star-trek/index.html|title=Captain Kirk thanks Star Wars!|first=Jose|last=Pagliery|date=6 August 2016|website=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/star-trek-star-wars-shatner/|title=William Shatner: 'Star Trek' owes a big thanks to 'Star Wars'|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; He explained that while both franchises were so "far out", ''Star Trek'' produced a fanbase that "softened up the entertainment arena" so that ''Star Wars'' could "come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/26348/george-lucas-on-how-star-trek-helped-star-wars|title=George Lucas on how Star Trek helped Star Wars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call ''Star Wars'' a "derivative" of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A few references to ''Star Wars'' have been inserted into ''Star Trek'' films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from ''Star Wars'' in both ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/10/star-wars-r2d2-star-trek-into-darkness|title=Star Wars droid R2D2 spotted in Star Trek Into Darkness|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2013-09-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Star Trek'' films and television episodes used the ''Star Wars'' animation shop, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], for their special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilm.com/archive/|title=Archive|newspaper=Industrial Light &amp; Magic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roddenberry was honored at a ''Star Trek'' convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as [[Darth Vader]]. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of ''Star Wars'' and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Comic relief==
William Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2013/4/film-exclusive|title=Shatner Honors Lucas|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a live concert, Shatner dressed as an [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|imperial stormtrooper]] singing "[[Girl Crush]]" alongside [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Brad Paisley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753087/william-shatner-star-wars-stormtrooper-girl-crush-cmas|title=William Shatner Dresses as 'Star Wars' Stormtrooper, Sings 'Girl Crush' at CMAs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Shatner and [[Carrie Fisher]] posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

In a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Princess Leia]] eloping and running off into the sunset would be the "perfect union" between ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Shatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his [[Twitter]] account mocking ''Star Wars''. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received ''Star Wars Holiday Special''. It was then that ''Star Wars'' actor [[Peter Mayhew]] posted a "retaliation" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', another poorly received film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/03/22/william-shatner-cant-stop-trolling-star-wars-fans/|title=William Shatner can't stop trolling Star Wars fans|publisher=The Telegraph}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.

''Star Trek'' was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' reboot]] (2009), which was followed by ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on [[CBS All Access]], an online streaming platform, in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/new-star-trek-series-premieres-january-2017|title=Star Trek New Star Trek Series Premieres January 2017|work=StarTrek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' picked up from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off, with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' the first in the new trilogy, and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', a television series set in between the ''Star Wars'' prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone ''Star Wars'' films, starting with ''[[Rogue One]]'', which was released in December 2016, and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' following in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Upcoming-Star-Wars-Movies-List-Titles-Release-Dates-100467.html|title=Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates - CINEMABLEND|date=2015-12-16|newspaper=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan works===
{{further|Star Trek fan productions|Star Wars fan films}}
Aside from official works by the producers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'', many [[fan film]]s and [[webisode]]s set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in relation to either franchise.

A '''countdown''' is a sequence of backward counting to indicate the time remaining before an event is scheduled to occur. [[NASA]] commonly employs the terms "L-minus" and "T-minus" &lt;ref name=L-Minus&gt;{{web cite|title=@NASA_LSP|author=NASA's Launch Services Program|url=https://twitter.com/nasa_lsp/status/561519037591846912|date=2015-01-31&lt;!-- 13:39:05 UTC--&gt;|via=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch, and even "E-minus" for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space, where the "T" could stand for "Test" or "Time", and the "E" stands for "Encounter", as with a comet or some other space object.&lt;ref name=E-Minus&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA Mission 'E-Minus' One Month to Comet Flyby|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/epoxi/epoxi20101004.html|accessdate=2013-09-13|newspaper=NASA Mission News|date=2010-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive, the start of a race, the start of the [[New Year]], or any anxiously anticipated event.

A countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with the ignition of a rocket's engine. Depending on the type of vehicle used, countdowns can start from 72 to 96 hours before launch time.

During countdown:
* Aerospace personnel bring the rocket vehicle to the launch site and load it with payload and propellants;
* Launch-center computers communicate with sensors in the rocket, which monitor important systems on the launch vehicle and payload;
* Launch personnel monitor the weather and wait for the [[launch window]];
* Security personnel prevent unauthorized persons from entering the "keep-out" area.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo, Joseph A. ''Space Technology.'' 2003, [[Greenwood Publishing Group]]; {{ISBN|1-57356-335-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57356-335-2}}, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedures for each launch are written carefully. For the [[Space Shuttle]], a five-volume set, Shuttle Countdown (KSC S0007), often referred to as "S0007", was used. Rosie Carver, a [[technical writer]] for [[United Launch Alliance]], has created at least 15,000 procedures for more than 300 missions since the [[Solar Maximum Mission]], which launched Feb. 14, 1980. These documents are living documents, which reflect new issues and solutions as they develop. Each mission requires approximately 100 procedure books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/carver.html NASA, "Launching by the Book"], April 30, 2007. [[NASA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeding with the countdown depends on several factors, such as the proper launch window, weather that permits a safe launch, and the rocket and payload working properly.

[[File:Countdown clock at NASAs Kennedy Space Center on 28 April 2011 (5665401600).jpg|thumb|Countdown clock at NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]] at L-11 hours (28 April 2011) of STS-134, [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]].]]
The launch weather guidelines involving the Space Shuttle and expendable rockets are similar in many areas, but a distinction is made for the individual characteristics of each. The criteria are broadly conservative and assure avoidance of possibly adverse conditions. They are reviewed for each launch. For the Space Shuttle, weather "outlooks" provided by the U. S. Air Force Range Weather Operations Facility at Cape Canaveral began at Launch minus 5 days in coordination with the NOAA National Weather Service Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These include weather trends and their possible effects on launch day. A formal prelaunch weather briefing was held on Launch minus 1 day, which is a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kennedy Space Flight Center Release 39-99: Space Shuttle weather launch commit criteria and KSD end of mission weather landing criteria |date=May 20, 1999 |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm |publisher=Nasa.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626180630/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/release/1999/39-99.htm |archivedate=June 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch window is a precise time during which aerospace personnel launch a rocket so the payload can reach the proper orbital destination.&lt;ref name="Angelo 2003: 144"&gt;Angelo 2003: 144&lt;/ref&gt;

A hold is the suspension of the normal countdown process. This can be done to investigate a technical process that has gone wrong, or because of marginal weather at the launch pad.

Some holds are planned: they are done so the launch-support computers can run automatic checks on the rocket.

Under some circumstances, a countdown may be recycled to an earlier time. When that happens, launch personnel begin following the countdown checklist from the earlier point.&lt;ref name="Angelo 2003: 144"/&gt;

During communications for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open as much as possible. All Firing Room console positions are assigned unique 'call signs' that are used by the team for quick and positive identification of who is talking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/countdown/launch-team.html |title=NASA, "The Space Shuttle launch team" |publisher=Science.ksc.nasa.gov |date=1967-11-09 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dialogue heard during the launch of a [[Delta II]] rocket carrying the [[Kepler Space Telescope]] on March 8, 2009, included:

In the context of a rocket launch, the "L minus Time" is the physical time before launch, e.g. "L minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds". "T minus Time" is a system to mark points at which actions necessary for the launch are planned - this time stops and starts as various hold points are entered, and so doesn't show the actual time to launch. The last ten seconds are usually counted down aloud "Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one." After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show [[Mission Elapsed Time]], which is typically shown as "T plus."  The adjacent picture shows "+ 00:00:07", approximately seven seconds after liftoff.

In [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[film]] ''[[Frau im Mond]]'', after each number the phrase "seconds to go" was repeated.

When counting down to the launch of an [[explosive]], e.g. when testing a new model of gun, it is customary to omit "5" from the countdown sequence because "five" sounds too similar to 'Fire!'{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

== Film ==
[[File:Eight (film start) cropped2.jpg|thumb|Newer (1959) SMPTE countdown on the head leader of a film reel]]
At the start of films, a countdown sequence is printed on the [[Film leader|head leader]], and is used to synchronize film reel changeovers (switching between reels of film). In film (but not television) the 'Academy Leader' countdown first used in 1930 is in units of feet rather than time units; it starts at 11 and ends at 3 where it cuts to black for the last few feet. In 1959, SMPTE leader was created and measures seconds, not feet. It starts at 8 and cuts to black on the first frame of 2, which is accompanied by a 'pop.  This leader eventually displaced the older Academy and was the only leader used by the end of the optical projection era.

==New Year's Eve==
{{Main|New Year's Eve}}
In many [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations, there is a countdown during the last seconds of the old year until the beginning of the new year.

In Times Square on New Year's Eve, besides the 60-Second Countdown at 11:59 P.M., there are six 20-second hourly countdowns in which people can practice their countdown skills from 5:59 P.M. to 10:59 P.M. The aforementioned countdowns are also the countdowns to the end of each hour.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13247">Joachim Bodamer created the term [[prosopagnosia]] in 1947, which is a disorder where individuals have an inability to recognize faces of people.  Individuals with this disorder do not have the ability to overtly recognize faces, but discoveries have been made showing that people with this disorder have the ability to covertly recognize faces.  '''Covert facial recognition''' is the unconscious recognition of familiar faces by people with prosopagnosia.  The individuals who express this phenomenon are unaware that they are recognizing the faces of people they have seen before.&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simon, Stéphane R., Asaid Khateb, Alexandra Darque, François Lazeyras, Eugene Mayer, and Alan J. Pegna | year = 2011 | title =When the Brain Remembers, but the Patient Doesn’t: Converging FMRI and EEG Evidence for Covert Recognition in a Case of Prosopagnosia.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945210001978 | journal = Cortex | volume = 47 | issue =7 | pages = 825–838| doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2010.07.009 | pmid=20850714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of prosopagnosia, congenital and acquired.  Congenital prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize faces without a history of brain damage; while acquired prosopagnosia is caused by damage to the right occipital-temporal region of the brain.  In the 1950s it was theorized that the right cerebral hemisphere was involved in facial recognition and in the 1960s this theory was supported by many experiments.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt;

Although the ability for overt facial recognition is inhibited in patients with prosopagnosia, there have been many studies done which show that some of these individuals may have the ability to recognize familiar faces covertly.  These experiments have used behavioral and physiological measures in order to demonstrate covert facial recognition.  A common physiological measure that is used is the measure of autonomic activity by using skin-conductance responses (SCR) which show a larger response in individuals with prosopagnosia who are shown pictures of familiar faces compared to pictures of unfamiliar faces.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt;

==Theories and reasoning==
Many theories reside in the topic of cognitive facial recognition. First, the theory of contradiction between prosopagnosia and covert recognition. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces but is believed to stem from damage to the ventral route of the [[visual system]]. Whereas covert recognition is shown in people that lost their ability to recognize faces, implying an intact ventral limbic structure projecting to the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref name=Bate&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bate, S. |author2=Cook, S.J. | year = 2012 | title =Covert recognition relies on affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia: Evidence from skin conductance response.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945208001159 | journal = Neuropsychology | volume = 26 | issue =6 | pages = 670–674 | doi=10.1037/a0029443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory two states that it cannot be observed in developmental cases of prosopagnosia, which was proposed by Grueter. Developmental prosopagnosia is a severe face processing impairment without brain damage and visual or thinking dysfunction but can sometimes run in families (some indications that there may be a genetic reason for the disorder). This theory is thought to rely on the activation of face representations created during the time of normal processing.&lt;ref name=Farah&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farah, Martha J. |author2=Randall C. O'reilly |author3=Shaun P. Vecera.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 1993 | title =Dissociated Overt and Covert Recognition as an Emergent Property of a Lesioned Neural Network.| url = http://psych.colorado.edu/~oreilly/papers/FarahOReillyVecera93_psyrev.pdf| journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue =4 | pages = 571–588 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradicting the last theory, the affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia theory states that individuals may be processing faces on affective dimensions, feelings and emotions, rather than familiarity dimensions, previous occasions and when they met.&lt;ref name=Bate /&gt;

Next is the dual-route models theory, proposed by Bauer, and states covert recognition can be seen in people that endured a time of normal face processing before actually getting the condition. With this, there are two different types of covert recognition: behavioral and physiological. Behavioral covert recognition is measured by reaction time and occurs within a cognitive pathway consisting of face recognition units (FRUs), personality identity units (PINs) and semantic information units. Physiological covert recognition is measured by SCR and is the second route that mediates reactions to familiar faces. This theory can be explained by the disconnection of FRUs or that it may be that the face recognition system is intact but has been disconnected from a higher system enabling their conscious awareness.&lt;ref name=Bate /&gt;

The parallel distributing process is a theory that proposes it would be easier to relearn previous known faces rather than to learn new ones. This process has three steps: the distributed information is represented, memory and knowledge for some things are not stored explicitly but are connected between nodes, learning can occur with gradual changes to the connections. Damaged networks are less effective by zeroing the weight of the connection. Each connection is embedded and is still faintly there, making it easier to relearn.&lt;ref name=Eimer&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eimer, M. |author2=A. Gosling |author3=B. Duchaine  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2012 | title =Electrophysiological Markers of Covert Face Recognition in Developmental Prosopagnosia. | url =http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/135/2/542 | journal = Brain | volume = 135 | issue =2| pages = 542–554 | doi=10.1093/brain/awr347 | pmid=22271660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories include one proposed by Bauer, states that neurological routes mediate overt recognition. His theory went with Bruce and Young’s theory that when using these three sequential stages in order, each stage will affect the next with overt mediation. The three stages are familiarity, occupation and name retrieval.&lt;ref name=Young1&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Young, A.W. |author2=Perrett, D.I. | year = 1992 | title =Face Recognition Impairments [and Discussion] | url =http://classic.rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/335/1273/47.short | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 335 | issue =1273 | pages = 47–54 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1992.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
One of the very first studies into the diversion of pathways of overt and covert facial processing was done by Bauer in 1984.&lt;ref name=Young1 /&gt; This study has been the basis for most of the other studies and literature that has been conducted on the topic of prosopagnosia and covert processing. Three other larger studies were performed. [[Event-related potential]] studies were done with 20 subjects who were clear of psychological disorders.  This was a face study using 315 faces and a string of characters. In each trial 30 of the faces were familiar and 90 novel faces were shown. Then, the 315 faces were shown and subjects were asked which were familiar. The faces were shown again from the first trial but without a string of letters. This resulted in higher load results for overt recognition with longer reaction time.  High load tasks led to the ability to recall far fewer faces when the task was performed.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rodriguez, Y.S. |author2=Fuster, J.I. |author3=Leon, M.A.B |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2008 | title =Covert and Overt face processing in healthy subjects: an ERP study. | url =http://www.ijbem.org/volume10/number4/100404.pdf| journal =  International Journal of Bioelectromagnetism | volume = 10 | issue =4 | pages = 246–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study was directly into covert facial recognition in prosopagnosia. In this study faces were taken from a set of 166 faces, hair and background were removed.  In the first task, 36 pictures were shown, half actors and have politicians.  When the face was shown the subject was asked if it was a politician or actor.  Both the control and prosopagnosia patients were able to identify which faces were which therefore reaction time was compared. The second task was to say which of the faces were famous in a set of forty famous and forty non-famous. Prosopagnosia subjects had little ability to make this distinction. Further, the third task also showed forty famous faces but instead of a random string written names were used. The faces remained until one was decided upon to match the name. The covert recognition was only present in two tasks.  This was not on the first task which was meant to prime and lead to the fact that the prime may be the impairment of prosopagnosia.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt; SCR tests are often used to test covert facial processing but none of the experiments displayed significant results&lt;ref name=Sosa&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valdés-Sosa, M. |author2=Bobes, M. A. |author3=Quiñones, I. |author4=Garcia, L. |author5=Valdes-Hernandez, P. |author6=Iturria, Y. |author7=Asencio, J. | year = 2011 | title =Covert face recognition without the fusiform-temporal pathways. | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911004745 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 57 | issue =3 | pages = 1162–1176 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.057 | pmid=21570471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facial recognition in disorders==
There are several problems that may damage the ability to properly perceive faces, many of these don’t have effects on both the covert and overt recognition of faces. Many of these problems only have an effect on the overt recognition of faces and leave the covert recognition intact.

Prosopagnosia is a disorder which causes the inability to use overt facial recognition.&lt;ref name=Groome&gt;{{cite book |last=Groome |first=David |date=2014 |title=An Introduction to Cognitive Psychology |location=27 Church Road, Hove, East Sussex BN3 2FA |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=126–134|isbn=9781848720923  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While people suffering from prosopagnosia often cannot identify whose face they are looking at they usually show signs of covert recognition. This can be seen in their ability to accurately guess information during forced choice tasks.&lt;ref name=Rivolta&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rivolta, Davide, Romina Palermo, Laura Schmalzl, and [[Max Coltheart]] | year = 2012 | title = Covert Face Recognition in Congenital Prosopagnosia: A Group Study.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211000190 | journal = Cortex | volume = 48 | issue =3 | pages = 344–352 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2011.01.005 | pmid=21329915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who are unable to identify faces of people that they know are still able to accurately guess information on the owners of the faces such as their professions and names.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fox, C. |author2=G. Iaria, J. Barton  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2008 | title =Disconnection in Prosopagnosia and Face Processing.| url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945211000190 | journal = Cortex | volume = 44 | issue =8 | pages = 996–1009 | doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how confident of their answers the patients were, they would often give low ratings of confidence despite their high accuracy during the tests.&lt;ref name=Rivolta /&gt; This shows that they are unable to overtly recognize the face but they are still able to recall information on the owners despite the fact that they can’t identify the owner.&lt;ref name=Young2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young, Garry | year = 2009 | title =In What Sense ‘familiar’?

While prosopagnosia patients are unable to overtly recognize faces, patients with [[Capgras delusion]] are unable to covertly recognize faces. People suffering from Capgras delusion are able to properly identify a face, but lack the covert recognition that is normally evoked by a familiar face. Before the delusion set in patients would normally have a sensation of familiarity and have a heightened response to faces that they recognize. Once the delusion has set in the patients no longer feel that the face they are looking at is familiar to them and they can’t access the feelings they normally held for the owner of the face despite the fact that they can properly identify who the face belongs to. This condition causes patients with Capgras delusion to believe that the person has been replaced with a look-alike imposter.&lt;ref name=Young2 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments. 

== Overview ==
Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

The dual-sector model is a model in [[Development economics|developmental economics]]. It is commonly known as the '''Lewis model''' after its inventor [[W. Arthur Lewis]]. It explains the growth of a developing economy in terms of a [[labour (economics)|labour]] transition between two sectors, the capitalist sector and the subsistence sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Hunt |chapter=W. A. Lewis on ‘Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour’ |title=Economic Theories of Development: An Analysis of Competing Paradigms |location=New York |publisher=Harvester Wheatsheaf |year=1989 |isbn=0-7450-0237-4 |pages=87–95 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocO-QgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially the dual-sector model as given by W. Arthur Lewis was enumerated in his article entitled "Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor" written in 1954, the model itself was named in Lewis's honor. First published in ''The Manchester School'' in May 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=W. Arthur |year=1954 |title=Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor |journal=[[The Manchester School (journal)|The Manchester School]] |volume=22 |issue= |pages=139–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.1954.tb00021.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the article and the subsequent model were instrumental in laying the foundation for the field of developmental economics. The article itself has been characterized by some as the most influential contribution to the establishment of the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gollin |first=Douglas |title=The Lewis Model: A 60-Year Retrospective |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=71–88 |jstor=23800576 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.3.71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
# The model assumes that a developing economy has a surplus of unproductive labor in the agricultural sector.
# These workers are attracted to the growing manufacturing sector where higher wages are offered.
# It also assumes that the wages in the manufacturing sector are more or less fixed.
# Entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector make profit because they charge a price above the fixed wage rate.
# The model assumes that these profits will be reinvested in the business in the form of fixed capital.
# An advanced manufacturing sector means an economy has moved from a traditional to an industrialized one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lewis dual sector model |url=http://teacherweb.com/IND/AmericanInternationalSchoolChennai/MsIndraniVerma/Lewis-Dual-Sector-Model_Vivek-and-Krishna.pptx |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075347/http://teacherweb.com/IND/AmericanInternationalSchoolChennai/MsIndraniVerma/Lewis-Dual-Sector-Model_Vivek-and-Krishna.pptx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
W. A. Lewis divided the economy of an underdeveloped country into 2 sectors:

===The capitalist sector===
Lewis defined this sector as "that part of the economy which uses reproducible capital and pays capitalists thereof". The use of capital is controlled by the capitalists, who hire the services of labour. It includes manufacturing, plantations, mines etc.
The capitalist sector may be private or public.

===The subsistence sector===
This sector was defined by him as "that part of the economy which is not using reproducible capital". It can also be adjusted as the indigenous traditional sector or the "self employed sector". The per head output is comparatively lower in this sector and this is because it is not fructified with capital. The "Dual Sector Model" is a theory of development in which surplus labor from traditional agricultural sector is transferred to the modern industrial sector whose growth over time absorbs the surplus labour, promotes industrialization and stimulates sustained development.

In the model, the subsistence agricultural sector is typically characterized by low wages, an abundance of labour, and low [[productivity (economics)|productivity]] through a labour-intensive production process. In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing sector is defined by higher wage rates as compared to the subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist sector is assumed to use a production process that is [[capital (economics)|capital]] intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing sector are possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the marginal productivity of labour in the agricultural sector is assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector.

===Relationship between the two sectors===
The primary relationship between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the output per head of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited.
This gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the '''existing wage rate'''.
A large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in disguised unemployment in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth.

The agricultural sector has a limited amount of land to cultivate, the marginal product of an additional farmer is assumed to be zero as the [[diminishing returns|law of diminishing marginal returns]] has run its course due to the fixed input, land. As a result, the agricultural sector has a quantity of farm workers that are not contributing to agricultural output since their marginal productivities are zero. This group of farmers that is not producing any output is termed surplus labour since this cohort could be moved to another sector with no effect on agricultural output. (The term surplus labour here is not being used in a [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] context and only refers to the unproductive workers in the agricultural sector.) Therefore, due to the wage differential between the capitalist and subsistence sector, workers will tend to transition from the agricultural to the manufacturing sector over time to reap the reward of higher wages.
However even though the marginal product of labor is zero, it still shares a part in the total product and receives approximately the average product.

If a quantity of workers moves from the subsistence to the capitalist sector equal to the quantity of surplus labour in the subsistence sector, regardless of who actually transfers, general welfare and productivity will improve. Total agricultural product will remain unchanged while total industrial product increases due to the addition of labour, but the additional labour also drives down marginal productivity and wages in the manufacturing sector. Over time as this transition continues to take place and investment results in increases in the capital stock, the marginal productivity of workers in the manufacturing will be driven up by capital formation and driven down by additional workers entering the manufacturing sector. Eventually, the wage rates of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors will equalize as workers leave the agriculture sector for the manufacturing sector, increasing marginal productivity and wages in agriculture whilst driving down productivity and wages in manufacturing.

The end result of this transition process is that the agricultural wage equals the manufacturing wage, the agricultural marginal product of labour equals the manufacturing marginal product of labour, and no further manufacturing sector enlargement takes place as workers no longer have a monetary incentive to transition.&lt;ref name="Misra Puri 263"&gt;{{cite book |author=S. K. Misra |author2=V. K. Puri |title=Economics Of Development And Planning — Theory And Practice |year=2010 |location=Mumbai |publisher=Himalaya Publishing House |isbn=81-8488-829-5 |edition=12th |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surplus labour and the growth of the economy==

[[Surplus labour]] can be used instead of capital in the creation of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the subsistence wage, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient.
Although labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities.
The utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a compensatory payment determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average subsistence wage, '''WW1''' in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by '''N'''; '''OW''' is the industrial wage. Given the [[profit maximization]] assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. '''OM'''.

[[File:Lewisgraph.jpg|thumb|right|450px]]

Since the wages in the capitalist sector depend on the earnings of the subsistence sector, capitalists would like to keep down productivity/wages in the subsistence sector, so that the capitalist sector may expand at a fixed wage. In the capitalist sector labor is employed up to the point where its marginal product equals wage, since a capitalist employer would be reducing his surplus if he paid labor more than he received for what is produced. But this need not be true in subsistence agriculture as wages could be equal to average product or the level of subsistence. The total product labor '''ONPM''' is divided between the payments to labor in the form of wages, '''OWPM''', and the capitalist surplus, NPW. The growth of the capitalist sector and the rate of labor absorption from the subsistence sector depends on the use made of capitalist surplus. When the surplus is reinvested, the total product of labor will rise. The marginal product line shifts upwards to the right, that is to '''N1'''. Assuming wages are constant, the industrial sector now provides more employment. Hence employment rises by '''MM1'''. The amount of capitalist surplus goes up from '''WNP''' to '''WN1P''''. This amount can now be reinvested and the process will be repeated and all the surplus labor would eventually be exhausted. When all the surplus labor in the subsistence sector has been attracted into the capitalist sector, wages in the subsistence sector will begin to rise, shifting the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, and causing wages in the capitalist sector to rise. Capital accumulation has caught up with the population and there is no longer scope for development from the initial source, i.e. unlimited supplies of labor. When all the surplus labor is exhausted, the supply of labor to the industrial sector becomes less than perfectly elastic. It is now in the interests of producers in the subsistence sector to compete for labor as the agricultural sector has become fully commercialized. It is the increase in the share of profits in the capitalist sector which ensures that labor surplus is continuously utilized and eventually exhausted. Real wages will tend to rise along with increases in productivity and the economy will enter into a stage of self-sustaining growth with a consistent nature.&lt;ref name="Ghatak 80-83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghatak |first=Subrata |title=Development Economics |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-582-44873-5 |pages=80–83}}&lt;!--much newer versions exist--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital accumulation==
The process of economic growth is inextricably linked to the growth of capitalist surplus, that is as long as the capitalist surplus increases, the national income also increases raising the growth of the economy. The increase in capitalist surplus is linked to the use of more and more labor which is assumed to be in surplus in case of this model. This process of capital accumulation does come to an end at some point.

This point is where capital accumulation catches up with population so that there is no longer any surplus labor left. Lewis says that it the point where capital accumulation comes to a stop can come before also that is if real wages rise so high so as to reduce capitalists' profits to the level at which profits are all consumed and there is no net investment.

This can take place in the following ways:
# If the capital accumulation is proceeding faster than population growth which causes a decline in the number of people in the agricultural or subsistence sector.
# The increase in the size of the capitalist or industrial sector in comparison to the subsistence sector may turn the [[terms of trade]] against the capitalist sector and therefore force the capitalists to pay the workers/laborers a higher percentage of their product in order to keep their real income constant.
# The subsistence sector may adopt new and improved methods and techniques of production, this will raise the level of subsistence wages in turn forcing an increase in the capitalist wages. Thus both the surplus of the capitalists and the rate of capital accumulation will then decline.
#Even though the productivity of capitalist sector remains unchanged, the workers in the capitalist sector may begin to imitate the capitalist style and way of life and therefore may need more to live on, this will raise the subsistence wage and also the capitalist wage and in turn the capitalist surplus and the rate of capital accumulation will decline.&lt;ref name="Misra Puri 263"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The Lewis model has attracted attention of underdeveloped countries because it brings out some basic relationships in dualistic development. However it has been criticized on the following grounds:

# Economic development takes place via the absorption of labor from the subsistence sector where opportunity costs of labor are very low. However, if there are positive opportunity costs, e.g. loss of crops in times of peak harvesting season, labor transfer will reduce agricultural output.
# Absorption of surplus labor itself may end prematurely because competitors may raise wage rates and lower the share of profit. It has been shown that rural-urban migration in the Egyptian economy was accompanied by an increase in wage rates of 15 per cent and a fall in profits of 12 per cent. Wages in the industrial sector were forced up directly by unions and indirectly through demands for increased wages in the subsistence sector, as payment for increased productivity. In fact, given the urban-rural wage differential in most poor countries, large scale unemployment is now seen in both the urban and rural sectors.
# The Lewis model underestimates the full impact on the poor economy of a rapidly growing population, i.e. its effects on agriculture surplus, the capitalist profit share, wage rates and overall employment opportunities. Similarly, Lewis assumed that the rate of growth in manufacturing would be identical to that in agriculture, but if industrial development involves more intensive use of capital than labor, then the flow of labor from agriculture to industry will simply create more unemployment.
# Lewis seems to have ignored the balanced growth between agriculture and industry. Given the [[wikt:linkage|linkages]] between agricultural growth and industrial expansion in poor countries, if a section of the profit made by the capitalists is not devoted to agricultural development, the process of industrialization would be jeopardized.
# Possible leakages from the economy seem to have been ignored by Lewis. He assumes boldly that a capitalist's marginal propensity to save is close to one, but a certain increase in consumption always accompanies an increase in profits, so the total increment of savings will be somewhat less than increments in profit. Whether or not capitalist surplus will be used constructively will depend on the consumption- saving patterns of the top 10 percent of the population. But capitalists alone are not the only productive agents of society. Small farmers producing cash crops in Egypt have shown themselves to be quite capable of saving the required capital. The world's largest [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] industry in [[Ghana]] is entirely the creation of small enterprise capital formation.
# The transfer of unskilled workers from agriculture to industry is regarded as almost smooth and costless, but this does not occur in practice because industry requires different types of labor. The problem can be solved by investment in education and skill formation, but the process is neither smooth nor inexpensive.

The model assumes rationality, [[perfect information]] and unlimited capital formation in industry. These do not exist in practical situations and so the full extent of the model is rarely realised. However, the model does provide a good general theory on labour transitioning in developing economies.&lt;ref name="Ghatak 80-83"/&gt;

==Empirical tests and practical application of the Lewis model==
# Empirical evidence does not always provide much support for the Lewis model. [[Theodore Schultz]] in an empirical study of a village in [[India]] during the influenza epidemic of 1918–19 showed that agricultural output declined, although his study does not prove whether output would have declined had a comparable proportion of the agricultural population left for other occupations in response to economic incentive. Again disguised unemployment may be present in one sector of the economy but not in others. Further, empirically it is important to know not only whether the marginal productivity is equal to zero, but also the amount of surplus labor and the effect of its withdrawal on output.
# The Lewis model was applied to the Egyptian economy by Mabro in 1967 and despite the proximity of Lewis's assumptions to the realities of the Egyptian situation during the period of study, the model failed firstly because Lewis seriously underestimated the rate of population growth and secondly because the choice of capital intensiveness in Egyptian industries did not show much labor using bias and as such, the level of unemployment did not show any tendency to register significant decline.
# The validity of the Lewis model was again called into question when it was applied to Taiwan. It was observed that, despite the impressive rate of growth of the economy of Taiwan, unemployment did not fall appreciably and this is explained again in reference to the choice of capital intensity in industries in Taiwan. This raised the important issue whether surplus labor is a necessary condition for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gary S. Fields |title=Dualism in the Labor Market: a Perspective on the Lewis Model after Half a Century |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/directory/downloads/fields/fields,manchesterschool.pdf |journal=The Manchester School |volume=72 |issue=6 |date=December 2004 |pages=724–735 |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9957.2004.00432.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model has been employed quite successfully in [[Singapore]]. Ironically however it has not been employed in Sir Arthur Lewis' home country of [[St. Lucia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4725">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic topology]], the '''Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms''' are properties that [[homology theory|homology theories]] of [[topological space]]s have in common. The quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is [[singular homology]], developed by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Norman Steenrod]].

One can define a homology theory as a [[sequence]] of [[functor]]s satisfying the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. The axiomatic approach, which was developed in 1945, allows one to prove results, such as the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]], that are common to all homology theories satisfying the axioms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0245/survey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If one omits the dimension axiom (described below), then the remaining axioms define what is called an [[extraordinary homology theory]]. Extraordinary cohomology theories first arose in [[K-theory]] and [[cobordism theory|cobordism]].

==Formal definition==

The Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms apply to a sequence of functors &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[topological pair|pairs]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') of topological spaces to the category of abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, together with a [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;\partial : H_{i}(X, A) \to H_{i-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; called the '''boundary map''' (here ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a shorthand for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'',∅)). The axioms are:

# '''Homotopy''': Homotopic maps induce the same map in homology. That is, if  &lt;math&gt;g:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt; is [[homotopic]] to &lt;math&gt;h:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt;, then their induced [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] are the same.
# '''[[Excision theorem|Excision]]''': If (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') is a pair and ''U'' is a subset of ''X'' such that the closure of ''U'' is contained in the interior of ''A'', then the inclusion map &lt;math&gt;i : (X-U, A-U) \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt; induces an [[isomorphism]] in homology.
# '''Dimension''': Let ''P'' be the one-point space; then &lt;math&gt;H_n(P) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Additivity''': If &lt;math&gt;X = \coprod_{\alpha}{X_{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;, the disjoint union of a family of topological spaces &lt;math&gt;X_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H_n(X) \cong \bigoplus_{\alpha} H_n(X_{\alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Exactness''': Each pair ''(X, A)'' induces a [[long exact sequence]] in homology, via the inclusions &lt;math&gt;i: A \to X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j: X \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt; \cdots \to H_n(A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! i_*} H_n(X) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! j_*} H_n (X,A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\!\partial} H_{n-1}(A) \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is the one point space then  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') is called the '''coefficient group'''. For example, singular homology (taken with integer coefficients, as is most common) has as coefficients the integers.

==Consequences==

Some facts about homology groups can be derived directly from the axioms, such as the fact that homotopically equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups.

The homology of some relatively simple spaces, such as ''n''-[[sphere]]s, can be calculated directly from the axioms. From this it can be easily shown that the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere is not a [[retract]] of the ''n''-disk. This is used in a proof of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

==Dimension axiom==

A "homology-like" theory satisfying all of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the dimension axiom is called an '''[[extraordinary homology theory]]''' (dually, '''[[extraordinary cohomology theory]]'''). Important examples of these were found in the 1950s, such as [[topological K-theory]] and [[cobordism theory]], which are extraordinary ''co''homology theories, and come with homology theories dual to them.

In [[mathematics]], the '''exterior product''' or '''wedge product''' of vectors is an algebraic construction used in [[geometry]] to study [[area]]s, [[volume]]s, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors ''u'' and&amp;nbsp;''v'', denoted by {{nowrap|''u'' ∧ ''v''}}, is called a [[bivector]] and lives in a space called the ''exterior square'', a [[vector space]] that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the magnitude depends on some additional structure, namely that the vectors be in a [[Euclidean space]].  We do not generally assume that this structure is available, except where it is helpful to develop intuition on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; of {{nowrap|''u'' ∧ ''v''}} can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides ''u'' and&amp;nbsp;''v'', which in three dimensions can also be computed using the [[cross product]] of the two vectors. Like the cross product, the exterior product is [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]], meaning that {{nowrap|1=''u'' ∧ ''v'' = −(''v'' ∧ ''u'')}} for all vectors ''u'' and ''v'', but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is [[associative]].  One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of [[parallelograms]] all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]&amp;mdash;a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise.

When regarded in this manner, the exterior product of two vectors is called a [[blade (geometry)|2-blade]].  More generally, the exterior product of any number ''k'' of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a ''k''-blade.  It lives in a space known as the ''k''th exterior power.  The magnitude of the resulting ''k''-blade is the volume of the ''k''-dimensional [[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] whose edges are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the [[scalar triple product]] of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped generated by those vectors.

The '''exterior algebra''', or '''Grassmann algebra''' after [[Hermann Grassmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Grassmann|1844}} introduced these as ''extended'' algebras (cf. {{harvnb|Clifford|1878}}). He used the word ''äußere'' (literally translated as ''outer'', or ''exterior'') only to indicate the ''produkt'' he defined, which is nowadays conventionally called ''exterior product'', probably to distinguish it from the ''[[outer product]]'' as defined in modern [[linear algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product.  The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions.  For instance, blades have a concrete geometric interpretation, and objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not only ''k''-blades, but sums of ''k''-blades; such a sum is called a [[Multivector|''k''-vector]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''k-vector'' is not equivalent to and should not be confused with similar terms such as ''[[4-vector]]'', which in a different context could mean a 4-dimensional vector. A minority of authors use the term ''k''-multivector instead of ''k''-vector, which avoids this confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''k''-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra.  The ''rank'' of any ''k''-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum.  The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra.  Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an [[associative algebra]], which means that {{nowrap|1=''α'' ∧ (''β'' ∧ ''γ'') = (''α'' ∧ ''β'') ∧ ''γ''}} for any elements ''α'', ''β'', ''γ''.  The ''k''-vectors have degree ''k'', meaning that they are sums of products of ''k'' vectors.  When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials.  This means that the exterior algebra is a [[graded algebra]].

The definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as [[vector field]]s or [[function (mathematics)|functions]].  In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[commutative ring]], and for other structures of interest in [[abstract algebra]].  It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of [[differential forms]] that is fundamental in areas that use [[differential geometry]].  Differential forms are mathematical objects that represent [[infinitesimal]] areas of infinitesimal parallelograms (and higher-dimensional bodies), and so can be [[integral|integrated]] over surfaces and higher dimensional [[manifold]]s in a way that generalizes the [[line integral]]s from calculus.  The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself.  The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of [[functor]] on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a [[bialgebra]], meaning that its [[dual space]] also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of [[alternating multilinear form]]s,  and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the [[interior product]].

==Motivating examples==
&lt;!--The purpose of this section is to motivate the skewness of the exterior product on vectors in ''V''--&gt;

===Areas in the plane===
[[Image:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of a parallelogram in terms of the determinant of the matrix of coordinates of two of its vertices.]]

The [[Cartesian plane]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a vector space equipped with a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] consisting of a pair of [[unit vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf e}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix},\quad {\mathbf e}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v} = \begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix} = a {\mathbf e}_1 + b {\mathbf e}_2, \quad {\mathbf w} = \begin{bmatrix}c\\d\end{bmatrix} = c {\mathbf e}_1 + d {\mathbf e}_2&lt;/math&gt;

are a pair of given vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having '''v''' and '''w''' as two of its sides. The ''area'' of this parallelogram is given by the standard [[determinant]] formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{Area} = \left| \det \begin{bmatrix} {\mathbf v} &amp; {\mathbf w} \end{bmatrix} \right| = \left| \det \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; c \\ b &amp; d \end{bmatrix} \right| = \left| ad - bc \right| .&lt;/math&gt;

Consider now the exterior product of '''v''' and '''w''':

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{\mathbf v}\wedge {\mathbf w} &amp; = (a{\mathbf e}_1 + b{\mathbf e}_2) \wedge (c{\mathbf e}_1 + d{\mathbf e}_2) \\
&amp; = ac{\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_1+ ad{\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2+bc{\mathbf e}_2 \wedge {\mathbf e}_1+bd{\mathbf e}_2 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2 \\
&amp; = \left ( ad - bc \right ){\mathbf e}_1 \wedge {\mathbf e}_2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the first step uses the distributive law for the [[#Formal_definitions_and_algebraic_properties|exterior product]], and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is alternating, and in particular {{nowrap|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. (Note that the fact that the exterior product is alternating also forces &lt;math&gt; \mathbf e_1 \wedge \mathbf e_1 = \mathbf e_2 \wedge \mathbf e_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix {{nowrap|1=['''v''' '''w''']}}. The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that '''v''' and '''w''' may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the ''signed area'' of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation.

The fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if {{nowrap|1=A('''v''', '''w''')}} denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors '''v''' and '''w''' form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties:
# {{nowrap|1=A(''j'''''v''', ''k'''''w''') = ''jk''A('''v''', '''w''')}} for any real numbers ''j'' and ''k'', since rescaling either of the sides rescales the area by the same amount (and reversing the direction of one of the sides reverses the orientation of the parallelogram).
# {{nowrap|1=A('''v''', '''v''') = 0}}, since the area of the [[degenerate (mathematics)|degenerate]] parallelogram determined by '''v''' (i.e., a [[line segment]]) is zero.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''w''', '''v''') = −A('''v''', '''w''')}}, since interchanging the roles of '''v''' and '''w''' reverses the orientation of the parallelogram.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''v''' + ''j'''''w''', '''w''') = A('''v''', '''w''')}}, for real ''j'', since adding a multiple of '''w''' to '''v''' affects neither the base nor the height of the parallelogram and consequently preserves its area.
# {{nowrap|1=A('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1}}, since the area of the unit square is one.
With the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any "standard" chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). In other words, the exterior product provides a ''basis-independent'' formulation of area.&lt;ref&gt;This axiomatization of areas is due to [[Leopold Kronecker]] and [[Karl Weierstrass]]; see {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Historical Note}}. For a modern treatment, see {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Theorem IX.2.2}}. For an elementary treatment, see {{harvtxt|Strang|1993|loc=Chapter 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross and triple products===
[[Image:Exterior calc cross product.svg|250px|thumb|The cross product ('''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;''' vector) in relation to the exterior product ('''&lt;span style="color:#779ECB;"&gt;light blue&lt;/span&gt;''' parallelogram). The length of the cross product is to the length of the parallel unit vector ('''&lt;span style="color:#CC0000;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''') as the size of the exterior product is to the size of the reference parallelogram ('''&lt;span style="color:#CC4E5C;"&gt;light red&lt;/span&gt;''').]]

For vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the exterior algebra is closely related to the [[cross product]] and [[triple product]]. Using the standard basis {{nowrap|{'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} the exterior product of a pair of vectors

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} = u_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + u_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + u_3 \mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = v_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + v_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + v_3 \mathbf{e}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} = (u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1) (\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2) + (u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3) (\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge \mathbf{e}_1) + (u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) (\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3) &lt;/math&gt;

where {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} is the basis for the three-dimensional space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the [[cross product]] of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a 2-vector.

Bringing in a third vector

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{w} = w_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + w_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + w_3 \mathbf{e}_3, &lt;/math&gt;

the exterior product of three vectors is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} \wedge \mathbf{w} = (u_1 v_2 w_3 + u_2 v_3 w_1 + u_3 v_1 w_2 - u_1 v_3 w_2 - u_2 v_1 w_3 - u_3 v_2 w_1) (\mathbf{e}_1 \wedge \mathbf{e}_2 \wedge \mathbf{e}_3) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space Λ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The scalar coefficient is the [[triple product]] of the three vectors.

The cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product {{nowrap|'''u''' × '''v'''}} can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both '''u''' and '''v''' and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the [[minor (mathematics)|minors]] of the matrix with columns '''u''' and '''v'''. The triple product of '''u''', '''v''', and&amp;nbsp;'''w''' is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns '''u''', '''v''', and&amp;nbsp;'''w'''. The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations: it, too, can be identified with oriented areas or volumes spanned by the two or three vectors involved. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented [[orthonormal basis]], the exterior product generalizes these geometric notions to higher dimensions.

==Formal definitions and algebraic properties==
The exterior algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}} of a vector space {{math|''V''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}} is defined as the [[Quotient ring|quotient algebra]] of the [[tensor algebra]] {{math|''T''(''V'')}} by the two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{math|''I''}} generated by all elements of the form {{math|1=''x'' ⊗ ''x''}} for {{math|1=''x'' ∈ ''V''}} (i.e. all tensors that can be expressed as the tensor product of a vector in {{math|''V''}} by itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = T(V)/I .&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior product {{math|∧}} of two elements of {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is the product induced by the tensor product {{math|⊗}} of {{math|''T''(''V'')}}. That is, if
:&lt;math&gt;\pi:T(V)\to \Lambda(V) = T(V)/I&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[canonical projection map|canonical surjection]], and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are in {{math|Λ(''V'')}}, then there are &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} such that &lt;math&gt;a=\pi(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\pi(\beta),&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;a\wedge b = \pi(\alpha\otimes\beta).&lt;/math&gt;
It results from the definition of a quotient algebra that the value of &lt;math&gt;a\wedge b&lt;/math&gt; does not depend of a particular choice of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta.&lt;/math&gt;

As {{math|1=''T''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''K''}}, {{math|1=''T''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''V''}}, and &lt;math&gt;\left(T^0(V)\oplus T^1(V)\right)\cap I= \{ 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;, the inclusions of {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''V''}} in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} induce injections of {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''V''}} into {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. These injections are commonly considered as inclusions, and called ''natural embeddings'', ''natural injections'' or ''natural inclusions''. The word ''canonical'' is also commonly used in place of ''natural''.

===Alternating product===
The exterior product is by construction [[Alternating algebra|''alternating'']] on elements of ''V'', which means that {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∧ ''x'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}}, by the above construction.  It follows that the product is also [[anticommutative]] on elements of ''V'', for supposing that {{nowrap|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''V''}},

:&lt;math&gt;0 = (x+y)\wedge (x+y) = x\wedge x + x\wedge y + y\wedge x + y\wedge y = x\wedge y + y\wedge x&lt;/math&gt;

hence

:&lt;math&gt; x \wedge y = - ( y \wedge x ) .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if ''σ'' is a [[permutation group|permutation]] of the integers {{nowrap|[1, ..., ''k'']}}, and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''V'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;x_{\sigma(1)}\wedge x_{\sigma(2)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(k)} = \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)x_1\wedge x_2\wedge\cdots \wedge x_k,&lt;/math&gt;

where sgn(''σ'') is the [[signature of a permutation|signature of the permutation]] ''σ''.&lt;ref&gt;A proof of this can be found in more generality in {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for some {{nowrap|''i'' ≠ ''j''}}, then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds:
:&lt;math&gt;x_{1}\wedge x_{2}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{k} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Exterior power===

The ''k''th '''exterior power''' of ''V'', denoted Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), is the [[vector subspace]] of Λ(''V'') [[linear span|spanned]] by elements of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x_1\wedge x_2\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k,\quad x_i\in V, i=1,2,\ldots, k.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then ''α'' is said to be a '''[[p-vector|''k''-vector]]'''. If, furthermore, ''α'' can be expressed as an exterior product of ''k'' elements of ''V'', then ''α'' is said to be '''decomposable'''. Although decomposable ''k''-vectors span Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), not every element of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is decomposable. For example, in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, the following 2-vector is not decomposable:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = e_1\wedge e_2 + e_3\wedge e_4.&lt;/math&gt;
(This is a [[symplectic form]], since {{nowrap|''α'' ∧ ''α'' ≠ 0}}.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Sternberg|1964|loc=§III.6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Basis and dimension====

If the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' is ''n'' and {{nowrap|{''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}{{void}}}} is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of ''V'', then the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k} \mid 1\le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \le n\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''). The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form
:&lt;math&gt;v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k ,&lt;/math&gt;
every vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis ''k''-vectors can be computed as the [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]]s of the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] that describes the vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

By counting the basis elements, the dimension of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is equal to a [[binomial coefficient]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\dim \Lambda^k(V) = \binom{n}{k} .&lt;/math&gt;
In particular, {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = {0}{{void}}}} for {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; ''n''}}.

Any element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of [[p-vector|''k''-vector]]s. Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = \Lambda^0(V)\oplus \Lambda^1(V) \oplus \Lambda^2(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus \Lambda^n(V)&lt;/math&gt;
(where by convention {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = ''K''}} and {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') = ''V''}}), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Rank of a ''k''-vector====

If {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then it is possible to express ''α'' as a linear combination of decomposable [[p-vector|''k''-vector]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \alpha^{(1)} + \alpha^{(2)} + \cdots + \alpha^{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where each ''α''&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt; is decomposable, say

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{(i)} = \alpha^{(i)}_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha^{(i)}_k,\quad i=1,2,\ldots, s.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''rank''' of the ''k''-vector ''α'' is the minimal number of decomposable ''k''-vectors in such an expansion of ''α''. This is similar to the notion of [[tensor rank]].

Rank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors {{harv|Sternberg|1974|loc=§III.6}} {{harv|Bryant|Chern|Gardner|Goldschmidt|1991}}. The rank of a 2-vector ''α'' can be identified with half the [[rank of a matrix|rank of the matrix]] of coefficients of ''α'' in a basis. Thus if ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a basis for ''V'', then ''α'' can be expressed uniquely as

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \sum_{i,j}a_{ij}e_i\wedge e_j&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = −''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the matrix of coefficients is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]). The rank of the matrix ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form ''α''.

In characteristic 0, the 2-vector ''α'' has rank ''p'' if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{p}{\underbrace{\alpha\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha}}\not= 0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\underset{p+1}{\underbrace{\alpha\wedge\cdots\wedge\alpha}} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Graded structure===
The exterior product of a ''k''-vector with a ''p''-vector is a {{nowrap|(''k'' + ''p'')}}-vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = \Lambda^0(V)\oplus \Lambda^1(V) \oplus \Lambda^2(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus \Lambda^n(V)&lt;/math&gt;

gives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a [[graded algebra]], that is

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V)\wedge\Lambda^p(V)\sub \Lambda^{k+p}(V).&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if {{math|''K''}} is the basis field, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^0(V)=K&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^1(V)=V.&lt;/math&gt;

The exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''β'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\wedge\beta = (-1)^{kp}\beta\wedge\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra, {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989}} studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a [[graded module]] (a module that already carries its own gradation).

===Universal property===
Let {{math|''V''}} be a vector space over the field {{math|''K''}}. Informally, multiplication in {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a [[distributive law]], an [[associative law]], and using the identity {{math|1=''v'' ∧ ''v'' = 0}} for {{math|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}. Formally, {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is the "most general" algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative {{math|''K''}}-algebra containing {{math|''V''}} with alternating multiplication on {{math|''V''}} must contain a homomorphic image of {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. In other words, the exterior algebra has the following [[universal property]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=§III.7.1}}, and {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Theorem XVI.6.8}}. More detail on universal properties in general can be found in {{harvtxt|Mac Lane|Birkhoff|1999|loc=Chapter VI}}, and throughout the works of Bourbaki.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em"&gt;
Given any unital associative {{math|''K''}}-algebra {{math|''A''}} and any {{math|''K''}}-[[linear map]] {{math|1=''j'' : ''V'' → ''A''}} such that {{math|1=''j''(''v'')''j''(''v'') = 0}} for every {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}}, then there exists ''precisely one'' unital [[algebra homomorphism]] {{math|1=''f'' : Λ(''V'') → ''A''}} such that {{math|1=''j''(''v'') = ''f''(''i''(''v''))}} for all {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}} (here {{math|''i''}} is the natural inclusion of {{math|''V''}} in {{math|Λ(''V'')}}, see above).
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:ExteriorAlgebra-01.png|center|Universal property of the exterior algebra]]

To construct the most general algebra that contains {{math|''V''}} and whose multiplication is alternating on {{math|''V''}}, it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains {{math|''V''}}, the [[tensor algebra]] {{math|''T''(''V'')}}, and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable [[quotient ring|quotient]]. We thus take the two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] {{math|''I''}} in {{math|''T''(''V'')}} generated by all elements of the form {{math|''v'' ⊗ ''v''}} for {{math|''v''}} in {{math|''V''}}, and define {{math|Λ(''V'')}} as the quotient

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V) = T(V)/I\ &lt;/math&gt;

(and use {{math|∧}} as the symbol for multiplication in {{math|Λ(''V''))}}. It is then straightforward to show that {{math|Λ(''V'')}} contains {{math|''V''}} and satisfies the above universal property.

As a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space {{math|''V''}} its exterior algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}} is a [[functor]] from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of vector spaces to the category of algebras.

Rather than defining {{math|Λ(''V'')}} first and then identifying the exterior powers {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces {{math|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} first and then combine them to form the algebra {{math|Λ(''V'')}}. This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section.

===Generalizations===

Given a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' and an ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'', we can define the exterior algebra Λ(''M'') just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra '''T'''(''M''). It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of Λ(''M'') also require that ''M'' be a [[projective module]]. Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that ''M'' be [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in {{harv|Bourbaki|1989}}.

Exterior algebras of [[vector bundle]]s are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the [[Serre–Swan theorem]]. More general exterior algebras can be defined for [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of modules.

==Duality==

===Alternating operators===

Given two vector spaces ''V'' and ''X'', an '''alternating operator''' from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' is a [[multilinear map]]

:&lt;math&gt; f: V^k \to X &lt;/math&gt;

such that whenever ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[linearly dependent]] vectors in ''V'', then

:&lt;math&gt; f(v_1,\ldots, v_k)=0&lt;/math&gt;

The map

:&lt;math&gt; w: V^k \to \Lambda^k(V) &lt;/math&gt;

which associates to ''k'' vectors from ''V'' their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding ''k''-vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the "most general" alternating operator defined on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;: given any other alternating operator {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''}}, there exists a unique [[linear map]] {{nowrap|''φ'' : Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') → ''X''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f'' = ''φ'' ∘ ''w''}}. This [[universal property]] characterizes the space Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') and can serve as its definition.

=== Alternating multilinear forms ===
&lt;!-- Alternating form redirects here --&gt;

[[File:N-form.svg|thumb|125px|Geometric interpretation for the '''exterior product''' of ''n'' [[1-form]]s ('''ε''', '''η''', '''ω''') to obtain an ''n''-form ("mesh" of [[coordinate surface]]s, here planes),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R. Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1, 2, 3}}. The "circulations" show [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|pages=58–60, 83, 100–109, 115–119|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The above discussion specializes to the case when {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''K''}}, the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function
:&lt;math&gt;f : V^k \to K\ &lt;/math&gt;
is called an '''alternating multilinear form'''. The set of all [[Alternating map|alternating]] [[Multilinear form|multilinear forms]] is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree ''k'' on ''V'' is [[natural transformation|naturally]] isomorphic with the [[dual vector space]] (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic to  Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;). In particular, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''K'' is [[binomial coefficient|''n'' choose ''k'']].

Under this identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose {{nowrap|''ω'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''K''}} and {{nowrap|''η'' : ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''K''}} are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of [[tensor product]]s of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. It is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Some conventions, particularly in physics, define the exterior product as

:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=\operatorname{Alt}(\omega\otimes\eta).&lt;/math&gt;

This convention is not adopted here, but is discussed in connection with [[Exterior algebra#Alternating tensor algebra|alternating tensors]].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\omega\wedge\eta=\frac{(k+m)!}{k!\,m!}\operatorname{Alt}(\omega\otimes\eta),&lt;/math&gt;

where the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the [[permutation]]s of its variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(\omega)(x_1,\ldots,x_k)=\frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_k}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\omega(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(k)}).&lt;/math&gt;

This definition of the exterior product is well-defined even if the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' has [[characteristic of a field|finite characteristic]], if one considers an equivalent version of the above that does not use factorials or any constants:

:&lt;math&gt;{\omega \wedge \eta(x_1,\ldots,x_{k+m})} = \sum_{\sigma \in Sh_{k,m}} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\,\omega(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(k)}) \eta(x_{\sigma(k+1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(k+m)}),&lt;/math&gt;

where here {{nowrap|Sh&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊂ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the subset of [[(p,q) shuffle|(''k'',''m'') shuffles]]: [[permutation]]s ''σ'' of the set {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''k'' + ''m''}{{void}}}} such that {{nowrap|''σ''(1) &lt; ''σ''(2) &lt; ... &lt; ''σ''(''k'')}}, and {{nowrap|''σ''(''k'' + 1) &lt; ''σ''(''k'' + 2) &lt; ... &lt; ''σ''(''k'' + ''m'')}}.

===Bialgebra structure===
There is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra Λ(''V'') and alternating multilinear forms on ''V''. The exterior algebra (as well as the [[symmetric algebra]]) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a [[Hopf algebra]] structure, from the [[tensor algebra]]. See the article on [[tensor algebra]]s for a detailed treatment of the topic.

The exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a [[coproduct]] defined on Λ(''V''), giving the structure of a [[coalgebra]]. The '''coproduct''' is a linear function {{nowrap|Δ : Λ(''V'') → Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'')}} which is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v) = 1 \otimes v + v \otimes 1&lt;/math&gt;

on elements ''v''∈''V''. The symbol 1 stands for the unit element of the field ''K''. Recall that {{nowrap|''K'' ⊂ Λ(''V''),}} so that the above really does lie in {{nowrap|Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'').}} This definition of the coproduct is extended to the full space Λ(''V'') by (linear) homomorphism. That is, for ''v'',''w''∈''V'', one has, by definition, the homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(v\wedge w)= \Delta(v) \wedge \Delta(w)&lt;/math&gt;

The correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the [[coalgebra]] article.  In this case, one obtains
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta(v \wedge w) = 1 \otimes (v \wedge w) + v \otimes w - w \otimes v + (v \wedge w) \otimes 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Extending to the full space Λ(''V''), one has, in general,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = \Delta(x_1) \wedge\cdots \wedge \Delta(x_k)&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = \sum_{p=0}^k \; \sum_{\sigma\in Sh(p+1,k-p)} \; \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) (x_{\sigma(0)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(p)})\otimes (x_{\sigma(p+1)}\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{\sigma(k)}).&lt;/math&gt;

where the second summation is taken over all [[(p,q) shuffle|{{nowrap|(''p''+1, ''k''−''p'')}}-shuffles]].  The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write &lt;math&gt;x_0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles.  The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; is ''preserved'' in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.

Observe that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. That is, one has that
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta:\Lambda^k(V) \to \bigoplus_{p=0}^k \Lambda^p(V) \otimes\Lambda^{k-p}(V)&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is ''not'' the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product.  Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object {{nowrap|Λ(''V'') ⊗ Λ(''V'').}} Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities {{nowrap|1=(1 ⊗ ''v'') ∧ (1 ⊗ ''w'') = 1 ⊗ (''v'' ∧ ''w'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''v'' ⊗ 1) ∧ (1 ⊗ ''w'') = ''v'' ⊗ ''w''}}, which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on [[tensor algebra]]s. Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product Λ clearly corresponds to multiplication in the bialgebra, leaving the symbol ⊗ free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of ⊗ by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from ⊗, with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the ''dual space'' can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the [[tensor algebra]] article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra.

In terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct:

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha\wedge\beta)(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k) = (\alpha\otimes\beta)\left(\Delta(x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_k)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, {{nowrap|1=''α'' ∧ ''β'' = ''ε'' ∘ (''α'' ⊗ ''β'') ∘ Δ}}, where ''ε'' is the counit, as defined presently).

The '''counit''' is the homomorphism {{nowrap|1=''ε'' : Λ(''V'') → ''K''}} that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a [[bialgebra]] on the exterior algebra.

With an '''antipode''' defined on homogeneous elements by &lt;math&gt;S(x)=(-1)^{\binom{\text{deg}\,  x\, +1}{2}}x&lt;/math&gt;, the exterior algebra is furthermore a [[Hopf algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, the exterior algebra of ''V'' is the [[Universal enveloping algebra|enveloping algebra]] of the abelian [[Lie superalgebra]] structure on ''V''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior product===
{{See also|Interior product}}
Suppose that ''V'' is finite-dimensional. If ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[dual space]] to the vector space ''V'', then for each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it is possible to define an [[derivation (abstract algebra)|antiderivation]] on the algebra Λ(''V''),

:&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha:\Lambda^k V\rightarrow\Lambda^{k-1}V.&lt;/math&gt;

This derivation is called the '''interior product''' with ''α'', or sometimes the '''insertion operator''', or '''contraction''' by ''α''.

Suppose that {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}}. Then '''w''' is a multilinear mapping of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to ''K'', so it is defined by its values on the ''k''-fold [[Cartesian product]] {{nowrap|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × ... × ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt; are {{nowrap|''k'' − 1}} elements of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, then define

:&lt;math&gt;(i_\alpha {\mathbf w})(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_{k-1})={\mathbf w}(\alpha,u_1,u_2,\ldots, u_{k-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, let {{nowrap|1=''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = 0}} whenever ''f'' is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to Λ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''V'').

====Axiomatic characterization and properties====
The interior product satisfies the following properties:

# For each ''k'' and each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}},
#::&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha:\Lambda^kV\rightarrow \Lambda^{k-1}V.&lt;/math&gt;
#:(By convention, {{nowrap|1=Λ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' = {0}.}})
# If ''v'' is an element of ''V'' (= Λ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''V''), then {{nowrap|1=''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''v'' = ''α''(''v'')}} is the dual pairing between elements of ''V'' and elements of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.
# For each {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[graded derivation]] of degree −1:
#::&lt;math&gt;i_\alpha (a\wedge b) = (i_\alpha a)\wedge b + (-1)^{\deg a}a\wedge (i_\alpha b).&lt;/math&gt;

These three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case.

Further properties of the interior product include:
:* &lt;math&gt;i_\alpha\circ i_\alpha = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;i_\alpha\circ i_\beta = -i_\beta\circ i_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--
It may be worth saying something about this, but has already been mentioned in passing above.

===The duality isomorphism===
In general, there are two different kinds of alternating structures defined via duality:
* The structure of alternating multilinear forms on Λ(''V''). The space of all such forms is the graded dual Λ(''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and the product of such forms dualizes the coproduct on the exterior algebra.
* The exterior algebra of the dual vector space Λ(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;).
If ''V'' is finite-dimensional, then these two exterior algebras are naturally isomorphic.
--&gt;

===Hodge duality===
{{main article|Hodge star operator}}
Suppose that ''V'' has finite dimension ''n''. Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V^*) \otimes \Lambda^n(V) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V) &lt;/math&gt;
by the recursive definition
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha \wedge \beta} = i_\beta \circ i_\alpha .&lt;/math&gt;

In the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a '''[[volume form]]''' (or '''orientation form''', although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). Relative to a given volume form ''σ'', the isomorphism is given explicitly by

:&lt;math&gt; \Lambda^k(V^*) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V) : \alpha \mapsto i_\alpha\sigma .&lt;/math&gt;

If, in addition to a volume form, the vector space ''V'' is equipped with an [[inner product]] identifying ''V'' with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, then the resulting isomorphism is called the '''Hodge star operator''', which maps an element to its '''Hodge dual''':

:&lt;math&gt;\star : \Lambda^k(V) \rightarrow \Lambda^{n-k}(V) .&lt;/math&gt;

The composition of &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; with itself maps {{nowrap|Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') → Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''V''. In this case,
:&lt;math&gt;\star \circ \star : \Lambda^k(V) \to \Lambda^k(V) = (-1)^{k(n-k) + q}\mathrm{id}&lt;/math&gt;
where id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has [[metric signature]] {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} — ''p'' pluses and ''q'' minuses.

===Inner product===
For ''V'' a finite-dimensional space, an [[inner product]] on ''V'' defines an isomorphism of ''V'' with ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, and so also an isomorphism of Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' with (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'')&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product.  On decomposable ''k''-vectors,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k, w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge w_k\right\rangle = \det(\langle v_i,w_j\rangle),&lt;/math&gt;
the determinant of the matrix of inner products.  In the special case {{nowrap|1=''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the inner product is the square norm of the ''k''-vector, given by the determinant of the [[Gramian matrix]] {{nowrap|({{langle}}''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;{{rangle}})}}.  This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''.  If ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, {{nowrap|1=''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n''}}, form an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''V'', then the vectors of the form
:&lt;math&gt;e_{i_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k},\quad i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k,&lt;/math&gt;
constitute an orthonormal basis for Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'').

With respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint.  Specifically, for {{nowrap|'''v''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, and {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''V''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x\wedge\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, i_{x^\flat}\mathbf{w}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the linear functional defined by
:&lt;math&gt;x^\flat(y) = \langle x, y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|''y'' ∈ ''V''}}.  This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra.

Indeed, more generally for {{nowrap|'''v''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;minus;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, {{nowrap|'''w''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, and {{nowrap|'''x''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, iteration of the above adjoint properties gives
:&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{x} \wedge\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\rangle = \langle \mathbf{v}, i_{\mathbf{x}^\flat}\mathbf{w}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where now {{nowrap|'''x'''&lt;sup&gt;♭&lt;/sup&gt; ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) ≃ (Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''))&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the dual ''l''-vector defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}^\flat(\mathbf{y}) = \langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{nowrap|'''y''' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}.

==Functoriality==
Suppose that ''V'' and ''W'' are a pair of vector spaces and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is a [[linear transformation]]. Then, by the universal construction, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f) : \Lambda(V)\rightarrow \Lambda(W)&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f)\left|_{\Lambda^1(V)}\right. = f : V=\Lambda^1(V)\rightarrow W=\Lambda^1(W).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, Λ(''f'') preserves homogeneous degree. The ''k''-graded components of Λ(''f'') are given on decomposable elements by
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(f)(x_1\wedge \cdots \wedge x_k) = f(x_1)\wedge\cdots\wedge f(x_k).&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(f) = \Lambda(f)\left|_{\Lambda^k(V)}\right. : \Lambda^k(V) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(W).&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the transformation Λ(''f'') relative to a basis of ''V'' and ''W'' is the matrix of {{nowrap|''k'' × ''k''}} minors of ''f''. In particular, if {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}} and ''V'' is of finite dimension ''n'', then Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'') is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space Λ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the [[determinant]] of ''f''.

===Exactness===
If

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U\rightarrow V\rightarrow W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces, then

:&lt;math&gt;0\to \Lambda^1(U)\wedge\Lambda(V) \to \Lambda(V)\rightarrow \Lambda(W)\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is an exact sequence of graded vector spaces&lt;ref&gt;This part of the statement also holds in greater generality if ''V'' and ''W'' are modules over a commutative ring: That Λ converts epimorphisms to epimorphisms. See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Proposition 3, §III.7.2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is
:&lt;math&gt;0\to \Lambda(U)\to\Lambda(V).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This statement generalizes only to the case where ''V'' and ''W'' are projective modules over a commutative ring. Otherwise, it is generally not the case that Λ converts monomorphisms to monomorphisms. See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Corollary to Proposition 12, §III.7.9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct sums ===
In particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(V\oplus W)\cong\Lambda(V)\otimes\Lambda(W).&lt;/math&gt;

This is a graded isomorphism; i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k(V\oplus W)\cong\bigoplus_{p+q=k} \Lambda^p(V)\otimes\Lambda^q(W).&lt;/math&gt;

Slightly more generally, if

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U\rightarrow V\rightarrow W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is a [[short exact sequence]] of vector spaces then Λ''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;(V)'' has a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]]

:&lt;math&gt;0 = F^0 \subseteq F^1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F^k \subseteq F^{k+1} = \Lambda^k(V)&lt;/math&gt;

with quotients :&lt;math&gt;F^{p+1}/F^p = \Lambda^{k-p}(U) \otimes \Lambda^p(W)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if ''U'' is 1-dimensional then

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow U \otimes \Lambda^{k-1}(W) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(V)\rightarrow \Lambda^k(W)\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is exact, and if ''W'' is 1-dimensional then

:&lt;math&gt;0\rightarrow \Lambda^k(U) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(V)\rightarrow \Lambda^{k-1}(U) \otimes W\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;

is exact.&lt;ref&gt;Such a filtration also holds for [[vector bundle]]s, and projective modules over a commutative ring. This is thus more general than the result quoted above for direct sums, since not every short exact sequence splits in other [[abelian category|abelian categories]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternating tensor algebra==
If ''K'' is a field of characteristic 0,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=§III.7.5}} for generalizations.&lt;/ref&gt; then the exterior algebra of a vector space ''V'' can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of T(''V'') consisting of [[antisymmetric tensor]]s. Recall that the exterior algebra is the quotient of T(''V'') by the ideal ''I'' generated by {{nowrap|''x'' ⊗ ''x''}}.

Let T&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree ''r''. This is spanned by decomposable tensors

:&lt;math&gt;v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r,\quad v_i\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''antisymmetrization''' (or sometimes the '''skew-symmetrization''') of a decomposable tensor is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Alt}(v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_r) = \frac{1}{r!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_r} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) v_{\sigma(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is taken over the [[symmetric group]] of permutations on the symbols {{nowrap|{1, ..., ''r''}.}} This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by Alt, on the full tensor algebra T(''V''). The image Alt(T(''V'')) is the '''alternating tensor algebra''', denoted A(''V''). This is a vector subspace of T(''V''), and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on T(''V''). It carries an associative graded product &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\otimes}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;t~\widehat{\otimes}~s = \operatorname{Alt}(t\otimes s).&lt;/math&gt;

Although this product differs from the tensor product, the kernel of ''Alt'' is precisely the ideal ''I'' (again, assuming that ''K'' has characteristic 0), and there is a canonical isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt;A(V)\cong \Lambda(V).&lt;/math&gt;

===Index notation===
Suppose that ''V'' has finite dimension ''n'', and that a basis {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of ''V'' is given. then any alternating tensor {{nowrap|''t'' ∈ A&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') ⊂ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} can be written in [[index notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;t = t^{i_1i_2\cdots i_r}\, {\mathbf e}_{i_1}\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_r},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''i''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is [[antisymmetric tensor|completely antisymmetric]] in its indices.

The exterior product of two alternating tensors ''t'' and ''s'' of ranks ''r'' and ''p'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;t~\widehat{\otimes}~s = \frac{1}{(r+p)!}\sum_{\sigma\in {\mathfrak S}_{r+p}}\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)t^{i_{\sigma(1)}\cdots i_{\sigma(r)}} s^{i_{\sigma(r+1)} \cdots i_{\sigma(r+p)}} {\mathbf e}_{i_1}\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_2} \otimes \cdots\otimes {\mathbf e}_{i_{r+p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product {{nowrap|''s'' ⊗ ''t''}}, denoted by square brackets on the indices:

:&lt;math&gt;(t~\widehat{\otimes}~s)^{i_1\cdots i_{r+p}} = t^{[i_1\cdots i_r}s^{i_{r+1}\cdots i_{r+p}]}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--For the interior product--&gt;
The interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;t = t^{i_0i_1\cdots i_{r-1}}&lt;/math&gt; be an antisymmetric tensor of rank ''r''. Then, for {{nowrap|''α'' ∈ ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''i''&lt;sub&gt;''α''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'' is an alternating tensor of rank {{nowrap|''r'' − 1}}, given by

:&lt;math&gt;(i_\alpha t)^{i_1\cdots i_{r-1}}=r\sum_{j=0}^n\alpha_j t^{ji_1\cdots i_{r-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the dimension of ''V''.

==Applications==

===Linear algebra===
In applications to [[linear algebra]], the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the [[determinant]] and the [[minor (matrix)|minors]] of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].  For instance, it is well known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix.  This suggests that the determinant can be ''defined'' in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors.  Likewise, the {{nowrap|''k'' × ''k''}} minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen ''k'' at a time.  These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to [[linear transformation]]s as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope.  So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power.  The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a [[basis of a vector space|basis]]-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.

====Technical details: Definitions====
Let&lt;ref&gt;S.Winitzki, ''Lineaer Algebra via Exterior Products'', https://sites.google.com/site/winitzki/linalg&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be an ''n''-dimensional vector space over field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; with basis &lt;math&gt;\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
* For &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^k V) &lt;/math&gt; on simple tensors by

:: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A(v_1 \wedge\cdots\wedge v_k)=Av_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_k &lt;/math&gt;

:and expand the definition linearly to all tensors. More generally, we can define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^p A^k \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^p V), (p \geq k) &lt;/math&gt; on simple tensors by

:: &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^p A^k)(v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_p)=\sum_{0 \leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_k \leq p} v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_p&lt;/math&gt;

:i.e. choose ''k'' components on which ''A'' would act, then sum up all results obtained from different choices. If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;k&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^pA^k=0 &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n V &lt;/math&gt; is 1-dimensional with basis &lt;math&gt;e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n&lt;/math&gt;, we can identify &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k &lt;/math&gt; with the unique number &lt;math&gt;\kappa \in K &lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:: &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k (e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n) = \kappa (e_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge e_n) .&lt;/math&gt;

* For &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^p V)&lt;/math&gt;, define the '''exterior transpose''' &lt;math&gt;\varphi^\mathrm{T} \in \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^{n-p} V)&lt;/math&gt; to be the unique operator satisfying

:: &lt;math&gt;\forall \omega_p \in \Lambda^p V, \omega_{n-p} \in \Lambda^{n-p}V, (\varphi^\mathrm{T}\omega_{n-p})\wedge\omega_p=\omega_{n-p}\wedge(\varphi \omega_p)&lt;/math&gt;

* For &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\det A=\Lambda^n A^n, \operatorname{Tr}(A)=\Lambda^n A^1, \operatorname{adj} A=(\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-1})^\mathrm{T} &lt;/math&gt;. These definitions is equivalent to the other versions.

====Basic Properties====
All results obtained from other definitions of the determinant, trace and adjoint can be obtained from this definition (since these definitions are equivalent). Here are some basic properties related to these new definitions:
* &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-linear.
* &lt;math&gt;(AB)^\mathrm{T} = B^\mathrm{T} A^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;.
* We have a canonical isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi:\operatorname{End}(\Lambda^k V) \cong \operatorname{End}(\Lambda^{n-k} V), A \mapsto A^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;. (However, there is no canonical isomorphism between &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-k} V&lt;/math&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k A) = \Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt;. The entries of the transposed matrix of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^k A&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;k \times k&lt;/math&gt;-minors of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall k \leq n-1, p \leq k, A \in \operatorname{End}(V), \sum_{q=0}^p (\Lambda^{n-k} A^{p-q})^\mathrm{T} (\Lambda^k A^q) = (\Lambda^n A^p) \operatorname{Id} \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular,
::&lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^{p-1})^\mathrm{T} A + (\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^\mathrm{T} = (\Lambda^n A^p) \operatorname{Id}&lt;/math&gt;
:and hence
::&lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{adj} A)A = (\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-1})^\mathrm{T} A = (\Lambda^n A^n) \operatorname{Id} = (\det A)\operatorname{Id}&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^T = \sum_{q=0}^p (\Lambda^n A^{p-q})(-A)^q = \sum_{q=0}^p \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^{p-q} A)(-A)^q&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, 
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{adj} A = \sum_{q=0}^{n-1} (\Lambda^n A^{n-q-1})(-A)^q&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k \operatorname{adj} A) = \Lambda^n (\operatorname{adj} A)^k = (\det A)^{k-1} (\Lambda^n A^{n-k}) = (\det A)^{k-1} \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^{n-k} A)&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}((\Lambda^{n-1} A^k)^\mathrm{T})=(n-k) \Lambda^n A^p=(n-k) \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^p A)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The characteristic polynomial &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_A(t)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A \in \operatorname{End}(V)&lt;/math&gt; can be given by
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_A(t)=\sum_{k=0}^n \operatorname{Tr}(\Lambda^k A)(-t)^{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^n (\Lambda^n A^k)(-t)^{n-k} .&lt;/math&gt;
:Similarly,
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ch}_{\operatorname{adj} A}(t)=\sum_{k=0}^n (\Lambda^n(\operatorname{adj} A)^k)(-t)^{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^n (\det A)^{k-1}(\Lambda^n A^{n-k})(-t)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt;

====Leverrier's Algorithm====
&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;(-t)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; term in the characteristic polynomial. They also appear in the expressions of &lt;math&gt;(\Lambda^{n-1} A^p)^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n (\operatorname{adj} A)^k&lt;/math&gt;. Leverrier's Algorithm&lt;ref&gt;W.Kahan (2009), ''Jordan's normal form''. https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/MathH110/jordan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is an economical way of computing &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^k&lt;/math&gt;:

::Set &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;;

::For &lt;math&gt;k=n-1,n-2,\ldots,1,0&lt;/math&gt;,

:::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^n A^{n-k} = \frac{1}{n-k} \operatorname{Tr}(A \circ \Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k-1})&lt;/math&gt;;

:::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k} = \Lambda^n A^{n-k} \cdot \operatorname{Id} - A \circ \Lambda^{n-1} A^{n-k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Physics===
In physics, many quantities are naturally represented by alternating operators. For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields.

===Linear geometry===
The decomposable ''k''-vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector {{math|''u'' ∧ ''v''}} represents the plane spanned by the vectors, "weighted" with a number, given by the area of the oriented [[parallelogram]] with sides ''u'' and ''v''. Analogously, the 3-vector {{math|''u'' ∧ ''v'' ∧ ''w''}} represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented [[parallelepiped]] with edges ''u'', ''v'', and ''w''.

===Projective geometry===
Decomposable ''k''-vectors in Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' correspond to weighted ''k''-dimensional [[linear subspace]]s of ''V''. In particular, the [[Grassmannian]] of ''k''-dimensional subspaces of ''V'', denoted ''Gr''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V''), can be naturally identified with an [[algebraic variety|algebraic subvariety]] of the [[projective space]] '''P'''(Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''V''). This is called the [[Plücker embedding]].

===Differential geometry===
The exterior algebra has notable applications in [[differential geometry]], where it is used to define [[differential form]]s. A [[differential form]] at a point of a [[differentiable manifold]] is an alternating multilinear form on the [[tangent space]] at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree ''k'' is a [[linear functional]] on the ''k''-th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry.

In particular, the [[exterior derivative]] gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a [[differential algebra]]. The exterior derivative commutes with [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a [[natural transformation|natural]] [[differential operator]]. The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a [[cochain complex]] whose cohomology is called the [[de Rham cohomology]] of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the [[algebraic topology]] of differentiable manifolds.

===Representation theory===
In [[representation theory]], the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental [[Schur functor]]s on the category of vector spaces, the other being the [[symmetric algebra]]. Together, these constructions are used to generate the [[irreducible representation]]s of the [[general linear group]]; see [[fundamental representation]].

===Superspace===
The exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a [[superalgebra]], which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to [[fermion]]s and [[supersymmetry]]. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a '''supernumber'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryce DeWitt]], ''Supermanifolds'', (1984) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-42377-5}}. ''(See Chapter 1, page 1.)''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Grassmann number]]. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional [[superspace]]: it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the [[weak topology]], the [[open sets]] being the [[cylinder set]]s.  An {{math|''n''}}-dimensional superspace is just the {{math|''n''}}-fold product of exterior algebras.

===Lie algebra homology===
Let ''L'' be a Lie algebra over a field ''K'', then it is possible to define the structure of a [[chain complex]] on the exterior algebra of ''L''. This is a ''K''-linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\partial : \Lambda^{p+1}L\to\Lambda^pL&lt;/math&gt;
defined on decomposable elements by
:&lt;math&gt;\partial (x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{p+1}) = \frac{1}{p+1}\sum_{j&lt;\ell}(-1)^{j+\ell+1}[x_j,x_\ell]\wedge x_1\wedge\cdots\wedge \hat{x}_j\wedge\cdots\wedge\hat{x}_\ell\wedge\cdots\wedge x_{p+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[Jacobi identity]] holds if and only if {{nowrap|1=∂∂ = 0}}, and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra ''L'' to be a Lie algebra.  Moreover, in that case Λ''L'' is a [[chain complex]] with boundary operator ∂.  The [[homology theory|homology]] associated to this complex is the [[Lie algebra homology]].

===Homological algebra===
The exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the [[Koszul complex]], a fundamental object in [[homological algebra]].

== History ==
The exterior algebra was first introduced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1844 under the blanket term of ''Ausdehnungslehre'', or ''Theory of Extension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Kannenberg|2000}} published a translation of Grassmann's work in English; he translated ''Ausdehnungslehre'' as ''Extension Theory''.&lt;/ref&gt;
This referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a [[vector space]]. [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]] also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann.&lt;ref&gt;J Itard, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970–1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

The algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester's theory of multivectors. It was thus a ''calculus'', much like the [[propositional calculus]], except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms.&lt;ref&gt;Authors have in the past referred to this calculus variously as the ''calculus of extension'' ({{harvnb|Whitehead|1898}}; {{harvnb|Forder|1941}}), or ''extensive algebra'' {{harv|Clifford|1878}}, and recently as ''extended vector algebra'' {{harv|Browne|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, this new development allowed for an ''axiomatic'' characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view.

The import of this new theory of vectors and [[multivector]]s was lost to mid 19th century mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1989|p=661}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
until being thoroughly vetted by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888. Peano's work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Élie Cartan]], and [[Gaston Darboux]]) who applied Grassmann's ideas to the calculus of [[differential form]]s.

A short while later, [[Alfred North Whitehead]], borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his [[universal algebra]]. This then paved the way for the 20th century developments of [[abstract algebra]] by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9522">'''Freiling's axiom of symmetry (''AX'')''' is a [[set theory|set-theoretic]] axiom proposed by [[Chris Freiling]].  It is based on intuition of Stuart Davidson
but the mathematics behind it goes back to [[Wacław Sierpiński]].

Let ''A'' be the set of functions mapping real numbers in the unit interval [0,1] to countable subsets of the same interval.  The axiom ''AX'' states:

:For every ''f'' in ''A'', there exist ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'') and ''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'').

A theorem of Sierpiński says that under the assumptions of ZFC set theory,
''AX'' is equivalent to the negation of the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH). Sierpiński's theorem answered a question of [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and was proved long before the independence of CH had been established by
[[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

Freiling claims that probabilistic intuition strongly supports this proposition
while others disagree.  There are several versions of the axiom, some of which
are discussed below.

==Freiling's argument==

Fix a function ''f'' in ''A''.  We will consider a thought experiment that involves throwing two darts at the unit interval.  We aren't able to physically determine with infinite accuracy the actual values of the numbers ''x'' and ''y'' that are hit.  Likewise, the question of whether "''y'' is in ''f''(''x'')" cannot actually be physically computed. Nevertheless, if ''f'' really ''is'' a function, then this question is a meaningful one and will have a definite "yes" or "no" answer.

Now wait until after the first dart, ''x'', is thrown and then assess the chances that the second dart ''y'' will be in ''f''(''x'').  Since ''x'' is now fixed, ''f''(''x'') is a fixed countable set and has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. Therefore, this event, with ''x'' fixed, has probability zero.  Freiling now makes two generalizations:

* Since we can predict with virtual certainty that "''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'')" after the first dart is thrown, and since this prediction is valid no matter what the first dart does, we should be able to make this prediction before the first dart is thrown.  This is not to say that we still have a measurable event, rather it is an intuition about the nature of being predictable.
* Since "''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'')" is predictably true, by the symmetry of the order in which the darts were thrown (hence the name "axiom of symmetry") we should also be able to predict with virtual certainty that "''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'')".

The axiom ''AX'' is now justified based on the principle that what will predictably happen every time this experiment is performed, should at the very least be possible.  Hence there should exist two real numbers ''x'', ''y'' such that ''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'') and ''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'').

==Relation to the (Generalised) Continuum Hypothesis==
Fix &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; an infinite cardinal (''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}.\,&lt;/math&gt; be the statement: ''there is no map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; from sets to sets of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;(\forall{x,y\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)})\,&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;x\in f(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Claim:''' &lt;math&gt;\texttt{ZFC}\vdash 2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\leftrightarrow\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}.\,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
''Part I'' (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\,&lt;/math&gt;):

Suppose &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then letting &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\kappa^{+}\to\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; a bijection, we have &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;:\sigma(\alpha)\mapsto \{\sigma(\beta):\beta\preceq\alpha\}\,&lt;/math&gt; clearly demonstrates the failure of Freiling's axiom.

''Part II'' (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow\,&lt;/math&gt;):

Suppose that Freiling's axiom fails. Then fix some &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; to verify this fact. Define an order relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;A\leq_{f} B&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;A\in f(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is total and every point has &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; many predecessors. Define now a strictly increasing chain &lt;math&gt;(A_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa))_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; as follows: at each stage choose &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\setminus\bigcup_{\xi&lt;\alpha}f(A_{\xi})&lt;/math&gt;. This process can be carried out since for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\xi&lt;\alpha}f(A_{\xi})\,&lt;/math&gt; is a union of &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; many sets of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;; thus is of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;2^{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt; and so is a strict subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt;. We also have that this sequence is ''cofinal'' in the order defined, ''i.e.'' every member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\leq_{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; some &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}\,&lt;/math&gt;. (For otherwise if &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;\leq_{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; some &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then since the order is total &lt;math&gt;(\forall{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}})A_{\alpha}\leq_{f} B\,&lt;/math&gt;; implying &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\geq\kappa^{+}&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; many predecessors; a contradiction.) Thus we may well-define a map &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;B\mapsto\operatorname{min}\{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}:B\in f(A_{\alpha})\}&lt;/math&gt;.
So &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)=\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}g^{-1}\{\alpha\}=\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}f(A_{\alpha})\,&lt;/math&gt; which is union of &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; many sets each of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}\leq\kappa^{+}\cdot\kappa=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; and we are done.
{{NumBlk|1=|2=|3=&lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; (Claim)|RawN=.}}

Note that &lt;math&gt;|[0,1]|=|\mathcal{P}(\aleph_{0})|\,&lt;/math&gt; so we can easily rearrange things to obtain that &lt;math&gt;\neg\texttt{CH}\Leftrightarrow\,&lt;/math&gt; the above-mentioned form of Freiling's axiom.

The above can be made more precise: &lt;math&gt;\texttt{ZF}\vdash(\texttt{AC}_{\mathcal{P}(\kappa)}+\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa})\leftrightarrow \texttt{CH}_{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This shows (together with the fact that the continuum hypothesis is independent of choice) a precise way in which the (generalised) continuum hypothesis is an extension of the axiom of choice.

==Objections to Freiling's argument==

Freiling's argument is not widely accepted because of the following two problems with it (which Freiling was well aware of and discussed in his paper).

* The naive probabilistic intuition used by Freiling [[tacit assumption|tacitly assumes]] that there is a well-behaved way to associate a probability to any subset of the reals.  But the mathematical formalization of the notion of "[[probability]]" uses the notion of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], yet the axiom of choice implies the existence of non-measurable subsets, even of the unit interval.  Some examples of this are the  [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] and the existence of [[Vitali set]]s.
*A minor variation of his argument gives a contradiction with the axiom of choice  whether or not one accepts the continuum hypothesis, if one replaces countable additivity of probability by additivity for cardinals less than the continuum. (Freiling used a similar argument to claim that [[Martin's axiom]] is false.) It is not clear why Freiling's intuition should be any less applicable in this instance, if it applies at all. {{harv|Maddy|1988|p=500}} So Freiling's argument seems to be more an argument against the possibility of well ordering the reals than against the continuum hypothesis.

==Connection to graph theory==
Using the fact that in ZFC, we have &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\Leftrightarrow\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry#Relation to the (Generalised) Continuum Hypothesis|above]]), it is not hard to see that the ''failure'' of the axiom of symmetry&amp;nbsp;— and thus the success of &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;— is equivalent to the following combinatorial principle for graphs:

:* The [[complete graph]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; can be so directed, that every node leads to at most &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;-many nodes.
:* In the case of &lt;math&gt;\kappa=\aleph_{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;, this translates to: The complete graph on the unit circle can be so directed, that every node leads to at most countably-many nodes.

Thus in the context of ZFC, the failure of a Freiling axiom is equivalent to the existence of a specific kind of choice function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25368">'''{{Lang|de|Gutmensch}}''' (literally ''good human'' in German) is an [[ironic]], [[sarcastic]] or disparaging cultural term similar to "do-gooder". Those who use the term are implying that ''Gutmenschen'' have an overwhelming wish to be good and eagerly seek approval. Further suggesting a supposed [[morality|moralising]] and proselytising behaviour and being [[dogmatic]]. In political [[rhetoric]] ''Gutmensch'' is used as a [[polemic|polemic term]]. See also [[Stereotype]] or [[Personality]].

==Context==

Users of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour.&lt;ref name="knobloch"&gt;Clemens Knobloch: ''Moralisierung und Sachzwang. Politische Kommunikation in der Massendemokratie''. Duisburg 1998 (künftig: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'').&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, [[altruistic]], but also religious and human goals in life higher than [[utilitarian]] ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;

The term ''Gutmensch'' is also connected to the term [[political correctness]] and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in "a nice way" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying "to have a heart of gold", in generosity or in an extreme form of [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf "'Political Correctness' – Ideologischer Code, Feindbild und Stigmawort der Rechten."] (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB). In: ''[[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]]''. Volume 31, Nr. 3, 2002, pp. 291–303, especially p. 294; further: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'';{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}} Gesa von Leesen: "'Das sagt man nicht!' Political Correctness zwischen Moral und Kampfbegriff". In: ''Das Parlament''. 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also hints at the possible difference between "meant well" and "well done". ''Gutmenschen'' have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term ''Gutmensch'' in a negative way evaluate the actions of ''Gutmenschen'' as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary [[Duden]], which included the term in 2000, defines ''Gutmensch'' as "a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Gutmensch] in duden.de, accessed 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and use ==
According to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term ''Gutmensch'' was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the "generation 1989", such as [[Matthias Horx]] and [[Klaus Bittermann]]. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the [[protests of 1968]]. These dictionaries were written in the style of ''Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch'' dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the ''Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen'' (dictionary of the ''Gutmensch''):

{{quote|Literary scientist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] wrote at the end of his commentaries, in which he argued against the "terror of conciliation exerted by the provinciality of the Federal Republic of Germany": 'Maybe it would be best, if the [[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]] established a little dictionary of the ''Gutmensch'', including entries like ''tearing down the wall in our minds'', ''constructive debates'', ''weird thinking'' or ''stubbornness''. We have long been waiting for that to happen, in vain as it turns out. Since things have not improved, we feel like we have to take care of that matter ourselves.'|ref=&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bittermann (Hrsg.): ''Das Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen. Betroffenheitsjargon und Gesinnungskitsch''. München 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid 1990s, ''Gutmensch'' has been used alongside [[political correctness]]&lt;ref&gt;Z.&amp;nbsp;B. von [[Reinhard Günzel (general)|Reinhard Günzel]], siehe dort.&lt;/ref&gt; in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294; Brigitta Huhnke: "'political correctness' – ein Mantra nationaler Erweckung". In: ''ZAG'' 30, 1999 (also in: ''[http://www.zag-berlin.de/antirassismus/archiv/30politicalcorrectness.html ZAG Online]''); Brigitta Huhnke: "'pc' – Das neue Mantra der Neokonservativen". In: Andreas Disselnkötter u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Evidenzen im Fluß. Demokratieverluste in Deutschland''. Duisburg 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]]'' publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the editor by Karl Scheel in the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 19 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Herberg u.&amp;nbsp;a.: ''Neuer Wortschatz: Neologismen der 90er Jahre im Deutschen.'' Berlin 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwzq-xXllkAC&amp;pg=PA148 pp. 148 ''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutmensch'' was considered the "latest critical chic" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of [[neologism]]s referring to [[political correctness|PC]] and accompanying the appearance of ''Gutmensch''. Some of them can roughly be translated as ''Gutmensch language'', ''bleeding-heart language'', ''attitudinal kitsch'', ''attitudinal language'' or ''chatter jargon''.

In 2006, the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|German Journalists Association]] claimed that the term ''Gutmensch'' had its origins in [[Nazi Germany]]. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum"&gt;Jürgen Hoppe/[[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |title=Memorandum zur "Initiative Journalisten gegen Rassismus" |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101946/http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}, 27 March 2006 (accessed 26 October 2007; PDF; 27&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]]. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between ''Gutmensch'' and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diss-duisburg.de/2011/11/das-stigma-gutmensch/#footnote_1_1036 DISS-Journal] des Duisburger Instituts für Sprach- und Sozialforschung&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that ''Gutmensch'' had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Cardinal von Galen]], who had openly opposed the [[Action T4|Nazi programme of forced euthanasia]]. According to the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]], ''Gutmensch'' was derived from the [[Yiddish]] expression "a gutt Mensch" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was [[Adolf Hitler]], who in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had repeatedly used the prefix "gut" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Adolf Hitler: ''Mein Kampf''. Dort als die "Gutmeinenden" oft synonym für "die Juden", aber auch für Deutsche, die sich nicht eindeutig für oder gegen die nationalsozialistische "Bewegung" entscheiden können. Wie im Falle Nietzsches konnte jedoch auch hier keine Verwendung des Wortes "Gutmensch" dokumentiert werden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widespread opinion on where ''Gutmensch'' originates, is that it was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who coined it.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt; There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the "good human", albeit not as a fixed expression. The [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest [[IG Metall|metalworker's union]], is called a ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref name="gfds"&gt;Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache zum ersten Aufscheinen des Begriffs im Deutschen: [http://gfds.de/gutmensch/ ''Fragen und Antworten: Gutmensch''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive link may be [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'' ({{lang-de|Der gute Mensch von Sezuan|links=no}}) whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaterbremen.de/de_DE/spielplan/der-gute-mensch-von-sezuan.1090429 Theaterbremen: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan] (accessed 2 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Die Welt]]'' journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book "Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics", published in 1859, he writes about naive ''Gutmenschen'' as follows: "Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible ''Gutmensch'' will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?"&lt;ref name=mh /&gt;

It is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian ''buonismo'',  with meanings all referring to the ''Gutmensch''.

===In areas critical of society===

Occasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term ''Gutmensch'' sees criticism of [[racism]] as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for "victims". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Susan Arndt: ''Weißsein. Die verkannte Strukturkategorie Europas und Deutschlands'' und ''Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus''. In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 24–29 and p. 340–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "friend of foreigners", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to [[humanism|humanistic]] approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their "own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals" on him (''jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen'') Sabine Forschner).&lt;ref&gt;See also Susan Arndt: "Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus". In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 340–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Bolz]] ([[TU Berlin]]), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station [[Deutschlandfunk]] on 11 August 2014:

{{quote|''Gutmenschen'' are people who have oral presentation techniques that have been given a name in the last couple of decades, i.e. political correctness. This political correctness can be described precisely and therefore also the ''Gutmensch'' is described; it is composed of political moralisation, from a kind of hygiene of speech, with a vast amount of speech taboo and furthermore, also from a kind of frigidly puritan attitude.|ref=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eben mal die Welt retten!|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/gutmenschen-eben-mal-die-welt-retten.976.de.html?dram:article_id=294305|format=|accessdate=2015-05-2015|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} Deutschlandfunk, 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In political debates==

The term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a "political correctness", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In political rhetoric===

The [[political right]] use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading "left" ideals to "do-goodism", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the ''Gutmensch'' are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak [[Human self-reflection|reflecting capacity]], an unrealistic and high claim or [[Utopia|utopian ideas]].&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Leesen: ''"Das sagt man nicht!"''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Klonovsky]], for example, chief executive at German news magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', accused:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klonovsky: [http://www.focus.de/wissen/bildung/theologie/debatte-das-gott-wort-der-guten_aid_536776.html ''Das Gott-Wort der Guten.''] In: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 31, 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ''Gutmensch'' finds the fact outrageous that there is an unproductive lower class, a benefit-scrounging scum, that there is [[plebs]]. Therefore, he declares everyone of being bad who points it out to someone. If it is, on top of everything, an economic migrant, the popular accusation of racism and xenophobia is coming very likely into practice in the same way as the user of the term settles far from social inner cities.}}

People who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for [[humanism]], [[solidarity]] and [[social equity]]. Seeing the counterpart as ''Gutmensch'' took the discussion to a personal (''[[argumentum ad hominem]]'' = "ad personam") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

The term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, [[Homophobia|homophobic]], anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or [[sexism|sexual]] violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

===Moralistic strategy===

In political discussions the usage of the term ''Gutmensch'' gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. [[Social stigma|Stigmatizations]] of political opponents by using terms like "[[political correctness|pc]]" (political correctness) or ''Gutmensch'' moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed [[taboos]]. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like ''Gutmensch'' or "moralizing prig" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say "my opinion or the tabooed view". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. [[Clemens Knobloch]] ([[Universität Siegen]]) refers to this relationship.

===As "ideological code"===

According to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the [[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft|Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]] (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the [[cipher]] "pc" (the term coming up usually because of ''Gutmenschen'') of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the "terror of ''Gutmenschen''". ''Gutmenschen'' thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about "moralizing prig", "racist prig", "fascist prig", "Auschwitz prig" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and [[anti-Semitic]] comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term ''Gutmensch'' functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word "Jew" by the term ''Gutmensch'' in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.&lt;ref&gt;Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf ''Political Correctness.''], pp. 294, 300 (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==

===Until 20th century===
''Gutmenschen'', then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as [[Catharism|Cathars]], but for themselves they used the name ''veri christiani'' (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term ''bonhomme'' (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term ''[[gentleman]]'' does. On the other hand, it was non other than [[Karl Marx]] who used ''bonhomme'' in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about "Jacque le bonhomme", which was a disguise for mocking [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels: ''Marx-Engels-Werke.'' 3, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harald Martenstein ===
German author and journalist [[Harald Martenstein]] developed his own definition of ''Gutmensch'' after repeatedly having dealt with the term ''[[wikt:shitstorm|shitstorm]]'' (in German exclusively referring to an [[internet meme]]) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using ''Gutmensch'' to describe people who act aggressive and [[Self-righteousness|self-righteous]] when fighting for what they think is the ''good cause'', unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. ''Gutmenschen'', in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence.&lt;ref name="smü"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über die Sehnsucht nach moralischer Überlegenheit|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2015/12/harald-martenstein-moral-gutmensch|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''Zeit-Magazin'', 6 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was [[Die Welt]] journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning ''Gutmensch'' into an unusable word for those being of sound mind.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;Matthias Heine: {{cite web|title=Wer Gutmensch sagt, verdient sich seinen Shitstorm|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article138678946/Wer-Gutmensch-sagt-verdient-sich-seinen-Shitstorm.html|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''[[Die Welt]]'', 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, one year earlier, German writer [[Akif Pirinçci]] had called Martenstein a ''Gutmensch'' in his [[polemic]] ''Deutschland von Sinnen'' (Germany unhinged).&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über Kritik von allen Seiten|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2014/21/harald-martenstein-kritik|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} ''Zeit-Magazin'', 17 May 2014; Akif Pirinçci: ''Deutschland von Sinnen. Der irre Kult um Frauen, Homosexuelle und Zuwanderer.'' Manuscriptum, Waltrop 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-944872-04-9}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M.'' (The New Suffering of Old M.): "As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian."&lt;ref name="nlam"&gt;Harald Martenstein: ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M.

== Wordmark ''Gutmensch'' ==
In 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]], registered the [[wordmark]] ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/tote-hosen-sichern-sich-rechte-am-unwort-gutmensch-a-1072085.html Deutungshoheit: "Tote Hosen" sichern sich Rechte am Unwort "Gutmensch"], spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled "Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.

==''Unwort des Jahres''==

Germany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called "[[Un-word of the year|Unwort des Jahres]]" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.

''Gutmensch'' was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprachkritik: ''Gutmensch'' ist Unwort des Jahres|trans-title=|periodical=Spiegel Online|publisher=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-2015-a-1071545.html|accessdate=2016-01-12|last=|date=2016-01-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the jury stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term "Wutbürger" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term ''Gutmensch'' violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf "Pressemitteilung: Unwort des Jahres 2011"], 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf Pressemitteilung der Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahl des 25.

The term ''Gutmensch'' was selected because "readiness to help others" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/-gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-1.2814403 ''"Gutmensch" ist Unwort des Jahres 2015.''] ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 12 Januar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term "Gutmensch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-01/unwort-des-jahres-2015-gutmensch ''Gutmensch ist Unwort des Jahres''], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Historicism''' is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or [[relativism|relativist]], because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Kahan, Jeffrey. "Historicism." ''Renaissance Quarterly'', vol. 50, no. 4 December 22, 1997, p. 1202&lt;/ref&gt; The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]], which neglect the role of [[tradition]]s.

The term "historicism" (''Historismus'') was coined by German philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leiter, Michael Rosen (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Continental Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 175: "[The word 'historicism'] appears as early as the late eighteenth century in the writings of the German romantics, who used it in a neutral sense. In 1797 Friedrich Schlegel used 'historicism' to refer to a philosophy that stresses the importance of history..."; Katherine Harloe, Neville Morley (eds.), ''Thucydides and the Modern World: Reception, Reinterpretation and Influence from the Renaissance to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 81: "Already in   Friedrich Schlegel's ''Fragments about Poetry and Literature'' (a collection of notes attributed to 1797), the word ''Historismus'' occurs five times."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher [[G. B. Vico]] (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the [[dialectic]] of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Georg Hegel]] (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of [[Karl Marx]], influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of [[Franz Boas]].

Historicism may be contrasted with [[reductionism|reductionist]] theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in [[economic determinism]])—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.

The Austrian-English philosopher [[Karl Popper]] condemned historicism along with the [[determinism]] and [[holism]] which he argued formed its basis. In his ''[[Poverty of Historicism]]'', he identified historicism with the opinion that there are "inexorable laws of historical destiny", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. [[Talcott Parsons]] criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in ''The Structure of Social Action'' (1937).

[[Post-structuralism]] uses the term "[[New Historicism]]", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.

The [[#Christian historicism|theological use]] of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.

==Variants==

===Hegelian===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|right|thumb|G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831)]]

Hegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the "spirit" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence "through the activity of finite agents." Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Cambridge University PRess|year=1993|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=289–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Karl Popper in his book ''The Poverty of Historicism'' interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this "Hegelian" philosophy of history as ''Historicism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poverty of Historicism|last=Popper|first=Karl Popper|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1957|isbn=|location=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's historicism also suggests that any human [[society]] and all human activities such as [[science]], [[art]], or [[philosophy]], are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis, antithesis, and synthesis]]".  (Hegel did not use these terms, although [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johann Fichte]] did.) Hegel's famous [[aphorism]], "Philosophy is the history of philosophy," describes it bluntly.

Hegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an ''ad hoc'' basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a [[social contract]].  Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by [[philosophy of language|language]], and language is based on [[etymology]] and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten [[metaphor]]s.  To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it.  The ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the "Spirit of the Age," is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a [[tabula rasa]], or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.

These ideas can be interpreted variously.  The [[Right Hegelians]], working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions.  Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century [[romantic nationalism]] and its twentieth-century excesses.  The [[Young Hegelians]], by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of [[social progress]], and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various  results.  Karl Marx's doctrine of "historical inevitabilities" and [[historical materialism]] is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought.  Significantly, Karl Marx's [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]] argues that [[capitalism]] disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.

Hegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]] and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the "modern" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.&lt;ref name=LecturesOnTheHistoryOfPhilosophyVolume3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Lectures_on_the_History_of_Philosophy.html?id=ik05WhN4ga0C&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Volume 3"], By Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Translated by E. S. Haldane and Frances H. Simson, M. A., ''University of Nebraska Press'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality.  It would be considered by [[Nietzsche]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Michel Foucault]] directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.

===Anthropological&lt;!--'Anthropological historicism'--&gt;===
In the context of [[anthropology]] and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. '''Anthropological historicism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Kaldis (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the Social Sciences'', SAGE Publications, 2013, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with the work of [[Franz Boas]]. His theory used the [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusionist]] concept that there were a few "cradles of civilization" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called [[historical particularism]]. The school of historicism grew in response to [[Classical social evolutionism|unilinear theories]] that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by [[Charles Darwin]] and many of his students, their application as applied in [[social Darwinism]] and [[general evolution]] characterized in the theories of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Leslie White]], historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. [[Julian Steward]] refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the [[cultural ecology]], by [[specific evolution]]. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.

The primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named "historicism."

This opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.

===New===
{{main|New Historicism}}
Since the 1950s, when [[Jacques Lacan]] and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many [[post-structuralist]]s have used ''historicism'' to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question.  This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of ''New Historicism''.

The same term, ''new historicism'' is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a [[poem]], [[drama]], etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. [[Stephen Greenblatt]] is an example of this school.

===Modern===
Within the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, "what you see is what you get" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of [[Benedetto Croce]]. Recent historians using this tradition include [[Thomas Kuhn]].

===Christian===
{{main|Historicism (Christian eschatology)}}

====Eschatological====
In [[Christianity]], the term ''historicism'' refers to the confessional [[Protestantism|Protestant]] form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of [[Bible|biblical]] [[prophecy]] has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.

====Dogmatic and ecclesiastic====
There is also a particular opinion in [[ecclesiastical history]] and in the [[History of Catholic dogmatic theology|history of dogmas]] which has been described as historicist by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]''. "They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |title=Humani generis, 15 |publisher=[[Vatican.va]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=2012-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==

===Karl Marx===
The social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as "vulgar" Marxism.

Marx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his [[Theses on Feuerbach]]:
{{quote|The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing, and that, therefore, changed men are products of changed circumstances and changed upbringing, forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstveränderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary [[praxis (process)|practice]].&lt;ref name="Theses on Feuerbach"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/index.htm | title = Theses on Feuerbach | website = | publisher = | accessdate = February 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Karl Popper===

[[Karl Popper]] used the term ''historicism'' in his influential books ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' and ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', to mean: "an approach to the social sciences which assumes that ''historical prediction'' is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history".&lt;ref name = "Poverty 3"&gt;POPPER, Karl, p. 3 of ''The Poverty of Historicism'', italics in original&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Popper wrote with reference to [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[history]], which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of "historicism" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the [[Western world|West]], as well as theories such as [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper attacks "historicism" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out [[Plato]] and [[Marx]]—calling them all "enemies of the open society".  The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the [[democracy|democratic]] responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to [[totalitarianism]].

Another of his targets is what he terms "moral historicism", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that "history is the world's court of justice".  This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe "that success proves anything or that history is our judge".&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', vol. 2 p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.

He also attacks what he calls "[[Historism]]", which he regards as distinct from historicism.  By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits.  In Popperian terms, the "[[New Historicism]]" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.

===Leo Strauss===
[[Leo Strauss]] used the term ''historicism'' and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of "natural right" or "right by nature").  Strauss argued that historicism "rejects political philosophy" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that "all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch." Strauss further identified [[R. G. Collingwood]] as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language.  Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or "subjectivize") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or "objective" "value." Similarly, Strauss criticized [[Eric Voegelin]]'s abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.

In his books, ''[[Natural Right and History]]'' and ''[[On Tyranny]]'', Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and [[Heidegger]]. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in [[Edmund Burke]], [[Tocqueville]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of [[Progress (history)|progress]] that results from it, expose us to [[tyranny]], totalitarianism, and [[Ochlocracy|democratic extremism]]. In his exchange with [[Alexandre Kojève]] in ''On Tyranny'', Strauss seems to blame historicism for [[Nazism]] and [[Communism]]. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled ''[[Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity]]'',  he argues that [[Islam]], traditional [[Judaism]], and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny.  Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a "radical historicist" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.

"'''Honour thy father and thy mother'''" is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in [[Deuteronomy]] (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics count this as the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;‘’Ten Commandments,’’ ''New Bible Dictionary'', Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174–1175&lt;/ref&gt;

These commandments were enforced as law in many jurisdictions, and are still considered enforceable law by some.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard A., ''How Judges Think'', Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W., ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1988, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J.

{{quote|Honour your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land [[YHWH|the {{LORD}}]] your God is giving you.|Exodus 20:12 (NIV)}}
In the [[Torah]], keeping this commandment was associated with individual benefit&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=2&amp;c=20 read online] and on Ephesians 6:1–4 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=49&amp;c=6 read online] (both accessed 31 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:12, ''The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation'', Berlin, Adele; Brettler, Marc Zvi, and Fishbane, Michael, eds.

See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and so the clause "so that you may live long" could be interpreted as "so that you are not put to death".  In the [[Talmud]], the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim,  Mamrim 6:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:1&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God makes the analogy himself:
{{quote|
"A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is the honour due me? If I am a master, where is the respect due me?" says the LORD Almighty. "It is you, O priests, who show contempt for my name. But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'"|Malachi 1:6 (NIV)}}

==Judaism==
{{quote| What constitutes "honour?" One must provide them with food and drink and clothing. One should bring them home and take them out, and provide them with all their needs cheerfully. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:7}}

The commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for human owes his existence to his father and his mother.

{{quote|...Honor the body that bore thee, and the breasts that gave thee suck, maintain thy parents, for thy parents took part in thy creation." For man owes his existence to God, to his father, and to his mother, in that he receives from each of his parents five of the parts of his body, and ten from God. The bones, the veins, the nails, the brain, and the white of the eye come from the father. The mother gives him skin, flesh, blood, hair, and the pupil of the eye. God gives him the following: breath, soul, light of countenance, sight, hearing, speech, touch, sense, insight, and understanding...but if people do not honor their parents, God say: "It is good that I do not dwell among men, or they would have treated Me superciliously, too."&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20OTHER%20COMMANDMENTS%20REVEALED%20ON%20SINAI Vol III : The Other Commandments Revealed On Sinai]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt; | ''Legends of the Jews'' Vol. III}}

The Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Kiddushin 31&lt;/ref&gt; It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated:
{{quote| Our Rabbis taught: It says, 'Honour your father and your mother' (Exodus 20:12), and it says, 'Honor God with your wealth' (Proverbs 3:9). By using the same terminology, the Torah compares the honour you owe your father and mother to the honour you have to give to the Almighty. It also says, 'Every person must respect his mother and his father' (Leviticus 19:3), and it says, 'God your Lord you shall respect, Him you shall serve' (Deuteronomy 10:20). Here the same word, respect, is used. The Torah equates the respect you owe your parents with the respect you must show God. Furthermore it says, 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death' (Exodus 21:17). And furthermore it says, 'Anyone that curses God shall bear his sin' (Leviticus 24.–15). By using the same terms the Torah compares cursing of parents with cursing the Almighty.&lt;ref&gt;(see also Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:1 and Sefer Maalot ha Middot)&lt;/ref&gt; | Talmud Kiddushin 31 }}

Because honouring parents is part of honouring God, the [[mitzvah]] does not depend on the worthiness of the parent:"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father." (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25)

It also requires honour to one's [[stepparent]]s&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzor Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 143:19&lt;/ref&gt; or an older sibling who is raising one,&lt;ref&gt;Plaut, W.

The commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:11; Deuteronomy 5:16; Leviticus 19:3;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical beliefs===
Keeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="See also Deuteronomy 6:3-4"/&gt; According to the [[Torah]], striking or cursing one’s father or mother was punishable by immediate death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17, Leviticus 20:9.  See also Deuteronomy 27:16 and Proverbs 20:20.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Deuteronomy]], a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21. Note that the reference to the son being a drunkard would suggest that he is not a small child.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Exodus 20:12, ''The Jewish Study Bible: Tanakh Translation''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Jeremiah]], God refers to himself as Father to Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 31:9&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the prophet [[Isaiah]], God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 43:6&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prophet [[Malachi]], God calls for similar honour.&lt;ref&gt;Malachi 1:6 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of [[Rechabite|Rechab]]&lt;ref&gt;This family is first introduced in 2 Kings 10:15–31&lt;/ref&gt; for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods:  {{quote|"Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?" declares the LORD. "Jonadab son of Recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather's command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me.  Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, 'Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your fathers.' But you have not paid attention or listened to me. The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me." |Jeremiah 35:12–16 (NIV)}}

===Precedence===
According to the [[Mishneh Torah]] this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.&lt;ref&gt;Mishneh Torah, Shoftim, Mamrim 6:2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 240:14&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents:
{{quote| It is the duty of both men and women to honour their parents. However, a married woman, who owes devotion to her husband, is exempt from the precept of honouring her parents. Yet, she is obliged to do for the parents, all she can, if her husband does not object. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:17}}

===Requirements===
The commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey.  Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a [[halakha|law of the Torah]], s/he must refuse to obey.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
{{quote| Everything that your father says to you, you are obliged to obey.  But if he says to you: "Let us bow down to idols", you must not obey him, lest you become an apostate. | Midrash, Yalkut Shimoni, Proverbs 960}}

{{quote| I am the Lord your God, and both you and your parents are equally bound to honour Me, therefore, you must not hearken to them to disregard My word. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:15}}

A child is not required to obey if a parent says that s/he must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person s/he wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, ''The Jewish Book of Etiquette'' (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donin, Hayim Halevy.

A child who is travelling has an obligation to communicate with his/her parents to let them know s/he is safe in order to prevent them from worrying.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Chassidim 542 in Finkel, Avraham Yaakov. 1997 ''Sefer Chasidim: The Book of the Pious'' Jason Aaronson {{ISBN|1-56821-920-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A child must continue to honour his/her parent after their deaths. This can be done by reciting [[kaddish]] for 11 months and on the [[yarzeit]] (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}}

A child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent.{{sfn|Donin, p. 129}} A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that.

In the gospels, [[Jesus]] affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1–9, Matthew 19:17–19, Mark 10:17–19, Luke 18:18–21) [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesus]]:
{{quote|Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. "Honour your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise), "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land." (Ephesians 6:1–2, ESV. See also Colossians 3:20)| Ephesians 6:1–2 (ESV)}}

In his letters to the [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29–31, 2 Timothy 3:2).

The words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the [[Gospel of John]], when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

According to the gospel of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does ''not'' include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary on Exodus 20:12–17 [http://www.christnotes.org/commentary.php?com=mhc&amp;b=2&amp;c=20 read online] (accessed 31 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NIV Study Bible. 1999. Zondervan. Note on Colossians 3:20 with reference to Acts 5:29&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following:
{{quote|But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.|1 Timothy 5:4 (NIV)}}

==Christian==

===Catholicism===
The import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role:
{{quote|The divine fatherhood is the source of human fatherhood. (Ephesians 3:14) This is the foundation of the honour owed to parents. ... It is required by God's commandment. (Exodus 20:12) Respect for parents (filial piety) derives from gratitude toward those who, by the gift of life, their love and their work, have brought their children into the world and enabled them to grow in stature, wisdom, and grace.{{sfn|CCC §§2214–2215}}}}

According to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity – first God, then parents, then others.{{sfn|CCC §2197}} Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society.{{sfn|CCC §2200}} The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society:
{{quote|The family is the original cell of social life. ...Authority, stability, and a life of relationships within the family constitute the foundations for freedom, security, and fraternity within society. The family is the community in which, from childhood, one can learn moral values, begin to honour God, and make good use of freedom. Family life is an initiation into life in society.{{sfn|CCC §2207}}}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching.{{sfn|CCC §2217}} "Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'" (Proverbs 6:20–22){{sfn|CCC §2216}}

The Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing "material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress".{{sfn|CCC §2218}} This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure.{{sfn|CCC §2215}}

The principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers.{{sfn|CCC §2199}} The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as "a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'."{{sfn|CCC §2212}} Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father.

===Orthodox Church===
Father Seraphim Stephens sees "Honor" defined as "Love and Respect", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. "It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roca.org/OA/142/142m.htm Stephens, Seraphim. "Honor thy Father and thy Mother", Orthodox America, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; Richard D. Andrews points out that, "Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles7/AndrewsParents.php Andrews, Richard Demetrius. "Honor thy Father and Mother", ''Orthodoxy Today'', June 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[John Calvin]] describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood.  Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. ''Harmony of the Law, Part III'', Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Since, therefore, the name of Father is a sacred one, and is transferred to men by the peculiar goodness of God, the dishonouring of parents redounds to the dishonour of God Himself, nor can any one despise his father without being guilty of an offence against God, (sacrilegium.) If any should object that there are many ungodly and wicked fathers whom their children cannot regard with honour without destroying the distinction between good and evil, the reply is easy, that the perpetual law of nature is not subverted by the sins of men; and therefore, however unworthy of honour a father may be, that he still retains, inasmuch as he is a father, his right over his children, provided it does not in anywise derogate from the judgement of God; for it is too absurd to think of absolving under any pretext the sins which are condemned by His Law; nay, it would be a base profanation to misuse the name of father for the covering of sins.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | John Calvin, commentary on Exodus 20:12 and Deuteronomy 5:16}}

The commentary of [[John Wesley]] on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, John. Notes on the Bible: Notes on the Second Book of Moses, commentary on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/notes.ii.iii.xxi.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible, comments on Exodus 20:12 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc1.Ex.xxi.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, "Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.&lt;ref&gt;Galatians 6:6 and 1 Timothy 5:17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew Henry]] explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of [[Esther]] honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai:
{{quote|Mordecai being Esther's guardian or pro-parent, we are told ... How respectful she was to him. Though in relation she was his equal, yet, being in age and dependence his inferior, she honoured him as her father—did his commandment, v. 20. This is an example to orphans; if they fall into the hands of those who love them and take care of them, let them make suitable returns of duty and affection. The less obliged their guardians were in duty to provide for them the more obliged they are in gratitude to honour and obey their guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry's Commentary on Esther Chapter 2 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc2.xvii.iii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt; | Matthew Henry, commentary on Esther 2}}

[[File:Esther Mordechai Purim.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Esther and Mordecai writing the second letter of Purim. Arent de Gelder, ca. 1685. Oil on canvas, RISD Museum of Art, Providence RI]]

The commandment itself encourages obedience "so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you".&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 5:16&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual.

In his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 21:15,17 and Leviticus 20:9&lt;/ref&gt; Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Deuteronomy 21:18–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, John. Harmony of the Law, Part III. Commentary on Exodus 21:15, 17 and Leviticus 20:9 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom05.ii.i.ii.html read online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose.&lt;ref name="ccel.org"/&gt; As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 6:20–22&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul specified  that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, “which is pleasing to God.”&lt;ref&gt;1 Timothy 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as "honor" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance.&lt;ref name=erlc&gt;[http://erlc.com/resource-library/articles/honor-your-father-and-mother "Honor your father and mother", The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Respect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.&lt;ref name=erlc/&gt;

==Rewards for compliance==
This commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: "...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you."&lt;ref&gt;Plaut and Stein,''The Torah: A Modern Commentary''(p. 504)&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: "...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jba.gr/Articles/jba2004_06.htm Kioulachoglou, Anastasios. "Honor your father and mother", ''Journal of Bible Accuracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of disobedience==
As with most terms of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience:
{{quote | Just as the reward for honouring father and mother is very great, the punishment for transgressing it is very great. And the one who afflicts his parents causes the shechinah [presence of God] to separate from him and harsh decrees fall upon him and he is given many sufferings. And even if life smiles on him in this life, he will surely be punished in the World to Come. | Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:4}}

{{Individualism sidebar}}
An '''individual''' is that which exists as a distinct [[entity]]. '''Individuality''' (or [[wikt:selfhood|selfhood]]) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing his or her own [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|needs]] or [[Personal goal setting|goals]], [[right]]s and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of [[biology]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]].

From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]]) ''individual'' meant "[[divisible|indivisible]]", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person". From the 17th century on, ''individual'' indicates separateness, as in [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a [[sanity|sane]] adult [[human|human being]] is usually considered by the [[State (polity)|state]] as an "individual person" in law, even if the person denies individual [[culpability]] ("I followed instructions"). An individual person is [[accountability|accountable]] for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to [[prosecution]] in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached [[age of majority]], often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of [[voting right]]s, [[tax]] and [[military duty|military duties]]/ individual [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] (protected only under certain constitutions). In line with [[hierarchy]], ultimate individual human reward for [[Social status|success]] and responsibility for [[failure]] is nonetheless found at the top of [[society|human society]].

==Law==
in [[International law]]:
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

in [[Law of the United States|American law]]:
:A natural person is a human being. A legal person is an entity such as a company, which is regarded in law as having its own 'legal personality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon Rush|author2=Michael Ottley|title=Business Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2gFZhuB5boC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law'' states: A "natural person" is "A human being as distinguished from person (as a corporation) created by operation of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, Inc|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYs74quLWLIC&amp;pg=PA323|year=1996|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1910 legal dictionary states: "Individual: As a noun, this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Campbell Black|title=A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions of the Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern. 2nd edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNQgVoT2_aQC&amp;pg=PA618|year=1910|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]], the concept of the individual lies in [[anatman]], or "no-self." According to anatman, the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that, working together, give the appearance of being a single, separated whole. In this way, anatman, together with [[anicca]], resembles a kind of [[bundle theory]]. Instead of an atomic, indivisible self distinct from reality, the individual in Buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing, impermanent universe (see [[Interdependence]], [[Nondualism]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocity]]).

===Empiricism===
Early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[Ibn Tufail]]&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  in early 12th century Islamic Spain, and [[John Locke]] in late 17th century England, [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan#Empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture|introduced the idea]] of the individual as a [[tabula rasa]] ("blank slate"), shaped from birth by experience and education. This ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual, society as a [[social contract]] between [[Rationality|rational]] individuals, and the beginnings of [[individualism]] as a doctrine.

===Hegel&lt;!--linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] regarded history as the gradual evolution of Mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Each time the mind applies its concepts to the world, the concept is revealed to be only partly true, within a certain context; thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). The individual comes to rise above his or her own particular viewpoint,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and grasps that he or she is a part of a greater whole{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} insofar as he or she is bound to family, a social context, and/or a political order.

===Existentialism===
With the rise of [[existentialism]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of [[the will to power]] and the heroic ideal of the [[Übermensch]]. The individual is also central to [[Sartre]]'s philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and [[free will]]. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]), the individual is called upon to create his or her own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality.

===Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] regards every human as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his or her own life, a right derived from his or her nature as a rational being. Individualism and Objectivism hold that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of [[individual rights]]&amp;nbsp;— and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. Since only an individual man or woman can possess rights, the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in today's intellectual chaos), but the expression "[[collective rights]]" is a contradiction in terms. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority]] has no right to vote away the rights of a [[minority group|minority]]; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual).&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualism.html ''"Individualism"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1961), [http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html ''"Individual Rights"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology&lt;!--Linked from 'Extraterrestrial life'--&gt;==
In [[biology]], the question of the individual is related to the definition of an [[organism]], which is an important question in biology and [[philosophy of biology]], despite there having been little work devoted explicitly to this question.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = R | title = The biological notion of individual | journal = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | year = 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-individual/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a "unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]]".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; [[Gene]]s, [[genome]]s, or groups may function as individual units.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

[[Asexual reproduction]] occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical. Such a colony is called a [[genet (biology)|genet]], and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. The colony, rather than the individual, functions as a unit of selection. In other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of [[sexual reproduction]].

'''''Kerala Gauthameeyam''''' is a book on [[Tarka sastra]] written in [[Malayalam]] language by [[Kurissery Gopala Pillai]]. First published in 1959, it is the pioneering work on Tarka sastra in Malayalam. Another significant effort in this direction is Kaikkulangara Rama Variar's ''Mukthaavali''. Authorship of this book gave the title 'Kerala Gauthaman' to Gopala Pillai who was a poet, researcher and scholar of Malayalam and [[Sanskrit]] languages.

It was the need of book on [[Nyaya]] in Malayalam that prompted the author to work on Kerala Gauthameeyam. It deals with the themes and topics of ''Tarka Samgraham'' by Annam Bhatan and ''Kaarikaavali'' by Vishvanatha Panchananan.&lt;ref&gt;Darshanika Nighandu. Sky Book Publishers.2010. Page:95&lt;/ref&gt; The foreword was written by [[N. Gopala Pillai]], the then principal of The Maharaja's Sanskrit College, [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. The book did not see a second edition during the author's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dr. N.P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">In [[robotics]] and [[motion planning]], '''kinodynamic planning''' is a class of problems for which [[velocity]],  [[acceleration]], and force/torque bounds must be satisfied, together with kinematic constraints such as avoiding obstacles.  The term was coined by [[Bruce Donald]], Pat Xavier, John Canny, and John Reif.&lt;ref name=Donald1993&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald et al. developed the first [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]]s (PTAS) for the problem. By providing a  provably [[polynomial-time]] [[ε-approximation algorithm]], they resolved a long-standing open problem in optimal control. Their first paper considered time-optimal control  ("fastest path") of a point mass under Newtonian dynamics, amidst polygonal (2D) or polyhedral  (3D) obstacles, subject to  state  bounds on position, velocity, and acceleration. Later they extended the technique to many other cases, for example, to 3D open-chain kinematic robots under full Lagrangian dynamics. More recently, many  practical [[heuristic algorithm]]s  based on stochastic optimization and iterative sampling were developed, by a wide range of authors, to address the kinodynamic planning problem. These techniques for kinodynamic planning have been shown to work well in practice. However,  none of these heuristic techniques can guarantee the optimality of the computed solution (i.e., they have no performance guarantees), and  none can be mathematically proven to be faster than the original PTAS algorithms (i.e., none have a provably lower computational complexity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">In mathematics, especially in [[topology]], a '''Kuranishi structure''' is a smooth analogue of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] structure. If a topological space is endowed with a Kuranishi structure, then locally it can be identified with the zero set of a smooth map &lt;math&gt; (f_1, \ldots, f_k): {\mathbb R}^{n+k} \to {\mathbb R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, or the quotient of such a zero set by a finite group. Kuranishi structure was introduced by Japanese mathematicians [[Kenji Fukaya]] and Kaoru Ono in the study of [[Gromov–Witten invariants]] in symplectic geometry and named after [[Masatake Kuranishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fukaya |first=K. |last2=Ono |first2=K. |title=Arnold Conjecture and Gromov–Witten Invariant |journal=[[Topology (journal)|Topology]] |volume=38 |year=1999 |issue=5 |pages=933–1048 |doi=10.1016/S0040-9383(98)00042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be a compact [[metrizable]] topological space. Let &lt;math&gt; p \in X &lt;/math&gt; be a point. A '''Kuranishi neighborhood''' of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; (of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;) is a 5-tuple

:::&lt;math&gt; K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) &lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; U_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth [[orbifold]];
* &lt;math&gt; E_p \to U_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth orbifold vector bundle;
* &lt;math&gt; S_p: U_p \to E_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth section;
* &lt;math&gt; \psi_p: S_p^{-1}(0) \to X &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map and is homeomorphic onto its image &lt;math&gt; F_p \subset X &lt;/math&gt;.

They should satisfy that &lt;math&gt; \dim U_p - \operatorname{rank} E_p = k &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; p, q \in X &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_q = (U_q, E_q, S_q, \psi_q, F_q) &lt;/math&gt; are their Kuranishi neighborhoods respectively, then a '''coordinate change''' from &lt;math&gt; K_q &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt; is a triple

:::&lt;math&gt; T_{pq} = ( U_{pq}, \phi_{pq}, \hat\phi_{pq}) &lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; U_{pq} \subset U_q &lt;/math&gt; is an open sub-orbifold;
* &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq}: U_{pq} \to U_p &lt;/math&gt; is an orbifold embedding;
* &lt;math&gt; \hat\phi_{pq}: E_q|_{U_{pq}} \to E_p &lt;/math&gt; is an orbifold vector bundle embedding which covers &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq} &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, they must satisfy the compatibility condition:

* &lt;math&gt; S_p \circ \phi_{pq} = \hat\phi_{pq} \circ S_q|_{U_{pq}} &lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt; \psi_p \circ \phi_{pq}|_{S_q^{-1}(0) \cap U_{pq}} = \psi_q|_{S_q^{-1}(0)\cap U_{pq}} &lt;/math&gt;.

A '''Kuranishi structure''' on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is a collection

::: &lt;math&gt; \Big( \{ K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) \ |\ p \in X \},\ \{ T_{pq} = (U_{pq}, \phi_{pq}, \hat\phi_{pq} ) \ |\ p \in X,\ q \in F_p\} \Big)&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt; is a Kuranishi neighborhood of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt; T_{pq} &lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate change from &lt;math&gt; K_q &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, the coordinate changes must satisfy the '''cocycle condition''', namely, whenever &lt;math&gt; q\in F_p,\ r \in F_q &lt;/math&gt;, we require that

::: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq} \circ \phi_{qr} = \phi_{pr},\ \hat\phi_{pq} \circ \hat\phi_{qr} = \hat\phi_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;

over the regions where both sides are defined.

==History==

In [[Gromov–Witten invariant|Gromov–Witten theory]], one needs to define integration over the moduli space of stable maps &lt;math&gt; \overline{\mathcal M}_{g, n} (X, A) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;McDuff, D and Salamon, D. "J-holomorphic curves and symplectic topology", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications'', 52. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, {{isbn|0-8218-3485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are maps &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; from a nodal Riemann surface with genus &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; marked points into a [[symplectic manifold]] &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, such that each component satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation

::: &lt;math&gt; \overline\partial_J u  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

If the moduli space is a smooth, compact, oriented manifold or orbifold, then the integration (or a [[fundamental class]]) can be defined. When the symplectic manifold &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is '''semi-positive''', this is indeed the case (except for codimension 2 boundaries of the moduli space) if the [[almost complex structure]] &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; is perturbed generically. However, when &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is not semi-positive, the moduli space may contain configurations for which one component is a multiple cover of a holomorphic sphere &lt;math&gt; u: S^2 \to X &lt;/math&gt; whose intersection with the first [[Chern class]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is negative. Such configurations make the moduli space very singular so a fundamental class cannot be defined in the usual way.

The notion of Kuranishi structure was a way of defining a '''[[virtual fundamental cycle]]''', which plays the same role as a fundamental cycle when the moduli space is cut out transversely. It was first used by Fukaya and Ono in defining the Gromov–Witten invariants and Floer homology, and was further developed when Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, Ono studied the [[Floer homology|Lagrangian intersection Floer theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, K., Oh, Y.-G., Ohta, H. and Ono, K., "Lagrangian intersection Floer theory: anomaly and obstruction, Part I and Part II", ''AMS/IP Studies in Advanced Mathematics'', 46, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI; International Press, Somerville, MA, 2009. {{isbn|978-0-8218-4836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9510">'''Land footprint''' is the real amount of [[land]], wherever it is in the world, that is needed to produce a product, or used by an organisation or by a nation.&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/resource_efficiency/pdf/FootRev_Report.pdf Giljum, S., Lutter, S., Bruckner, M., Aparcana, S., Heinke, J., Gerten, D. et al. (2013, May 3). State-of-Play of National Consumption-Based Indicators: A review and evaluation of available methods and data to calculate footprint-type (consumption-based) indicators for materials, water, land and carbon.] Vienna: Sustainable Europe Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Land footprint is a [[resource consumption|consumption]]-based indicator, i.e. it looks at the [[natural resources|resources]] needed to create a final product, or by an organisation or country, wherever they are in the world. This is in contrast to production-based indicators, which just look at resource use within a country.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} For example, cows will require land to graze on within a country, but may also be fed by feed grown on land in another country. This production vs consumption approach is extensively discussed in [[greenhouse gas emissions accounting]], where [[carbon footprint]] is the consumption-based indicator.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Related concepts ==

Land footprint is closely linked to a number of other concepts, including:

* ''Ghost acres'' (or ghost hectares), a term that started to be in use in the 1960s, for example by Georg Borgström in his book "The Hungry Planet: The modern world at the edge of Famine" in 1965, refers to the area of land abroad that is used to grow feed for animals within a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI8wAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the+hungry+planet%3A+the+modern+world+at+the+edge+of+famine&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ghost |title=The hungry planet: the modern world at the edge of famine - Georg Borgström - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Embedded land'' or "Virtual land", is the land that is effectively embedded in an imported product; i.e. the land used to produce the product (including any [[supply chain]], such as [[soybean|soya]] feed for [[meat production|beef]]).
* ''Global cropland'', as used in the [[International Resource Panel]] report on global [[land use]], is part of the total land footprint, but doesn't include e.g. [[Built-up area|built-up land]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/AreasofAssessment/AssessingGlobalLandUseBalancingConsumptionw/tabid/132063/Default.aspx International Resource Panel. (2014). Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|Indirect land use change]]'', used in the debate on [[biofuels]], is a related concept, that looks at the land needed to grow biofuels, then considers the indirect impacts that this use of land may have on other land use in the country concerned.

[[Ecological footprint]] is measured using a different approach, with two key differences to land footprint:

* Ecological footprint adds together both real land use and an calculated (but not really existing) area of forest to absorb CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; emissions, to incorporate part of the impacts of climate change. In contrast, land footprint looks only at real land use, and is often used in association with [[carbon footprint]] to cover all climate changing emissions.
* Ecological footprint adjusts land areas to [[global hectares]], while land footprint is based on real land area - or an estimate of it.

==Research==
The International Resource Panel has produced a detailed report on land, "Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; which establishes a [[planetary boundary]] for cropland, and proposes a potential safe operating space target of 0.2 ha of cropland per person per year. This is in contrast to the current EU use of cropland of around 0.31 ha per person per year.

The most detailed study of Europe's land footprint (including forestry) and how this is traded with the rest of the work was published by Sustainable European Research Institute (SERI) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Europe Research Institute. (2011). Europe’s global land demand: A study on the actual land embodied in European imports and exports of agriculture and forestry products. http://seri.at/en/global-responsibility/2011/10/19/europes-global-land-demand-a-study-on-the-actual-land-embodied-in-european-imports-and-exports-of-agricultural-and-forestry-products/&lt;/ref&gt; A briefing on this study is available from [[Friends of the Earth Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531011838/http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Germany's land balance&lt;ref&gt;Meier, T., Christen, O., Semler, E., Jahreis, G., Voget-Kleschin, L., Schrode, A. et al. (2013). Balancing virtual land imports by a shift in the diet. Using a land balance approach to assess the sustainability of food consumption. Germany as an example. Appetite, 74C, 20-34.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled the impact of changes in diet and consumption of stimulants (e.g. coffee, wine etc.) on Germany's land balance. It found that a switch to a healthier diet, with less meat and with reduced stimulants, could lead to no net land imports, while a switch to vegetarian or vegan diets would lead to Germany being a net exporter of land.

Sustainable Europe Research Institute have also examined potential scenarios for reducing Europe's land footprint, including dietary changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/seri_land_footprint_scenario_nov2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In policy==

The EU's 7th Environmental action plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32013D1386:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex - 32013D1386 - EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for examination of land (and other) footprints:

:"To set a framework for action to improve resource efficiency aspects beyond GHG emissions and energy, targets for reducing the overall lifecycle environmental impact of consumption will be set.. Indicators and targets for land, water, material and carbon footprints as well as their role within the European Semester should also be considered in this regard."

The European Parliament's own initiative report on "Resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=European Parliament|title=European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2015 on resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2015-0266&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|accessdate=29 July 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was voted on 9 July 2015, includes the following text calling for action from the European Commission on land and other footprints:
:"Urges the Commission to propose, by the end of 2015, a lead indicator and a dashboard of sub-indicators on resource efficiency, including ecosystem services; points out that the use of these harmonised indicators should be legally binding as of 2018, and they should measure [[resource consumption]], including imports and exports, at EU, Member State and industry level and take account of the whole lifecycle of products and services and should be based on the footprint methodology, measuring at least land, water and material use and carbon;"

A study of the four resource footprint indicators, carried for the European Commission&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; examined what data was available to measure the land footprint, carbon footprint, water footprint &amp; material footprint at economy level. This study concluded that Land Footprint needed methodological improvement and harmonisation, and that a common, international, multi-regional input output database would make it easier to calculate all four footprints.

[[Friends of the Earth Europe]], together with a wider Land Footprint Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foeeurope.org/Groups-unite-Europe-cut-use-world-land-180313 |title=Groups unite to call for Europe to cut its use of world’s land &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Europe |publisher=Foeeurope.org |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been advocating for Land Footprint to be used to measure resource consumption, as part of a wider project that argues that four footprints - land, [[Water footprint|water]], [[Carbon footprint|carbon]] &amp; material (equivalent to either RMC or TMC, see [[Material Flow Accounting]]) - are an effective way of measuring &amp; managing Europe's resource use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_SERI_measuring_europes_resource_use_0609.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition, which includes [[Slow Food|Slow Food Europe]] and [[Birdlife]], are also calling for Europe to reduce its land footprint.

'''Malaise''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z}} {{respell|mə|LAYZ}}) is a feeling of general [[suffering|discomfort]], uneasiness or pain, often the first indication of an [[infection]] or other disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003089.htm|title=Malaise: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|author=|date=|website=medlineplus.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916154928/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003089.htm|archivedate=2016-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/section/well|title=Well|author=|date=|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424040459/https://www.nytimes.com/section/well|archivedate=2018-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has existed in the French language since at least the 12th century.

The term is also often used figuratively in other contexts; for example, "[[economic malaise]]" refers to an economy that is stagnant or in recession (compare [[Depression (economics)|depression]]). The term is particularly associated with the US [[1973–75 recession]].&lt;ref&gt;One example can be found in ''The Next 200 Years: A Scenario for America and the World'', by [[Herman Kahn]] et al., published in 1976, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; A speech made by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1979 is commonly referred to as the [[Malaise speech|"malaise" speech]], although the term was not in the speech.

== Cause ==
Malaise is a [[non-specific symptom]] and can be present in the slightest ailment, such as an [[emotion]] (causing fainting, a [[vasovagal response]]) or hunger (light [[hypoglycemia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/2/390|title=Short-Term, Delayed, and Working Memory Are Impaired During Hypoglycemia in Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes|first1=Andrew J.|last1=Sommerfield|first2=Ian J.|last2=Deary|first3=Vincent|last3=McAulay|first4=Brian M.|last4=Frier|date=1 February 2003|publisher=|journal=Diabetes Care|volume=26|issue=2|pages=390–396|via=care.diabetesjournals.org|doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2.390|pmid=12547868|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913150624/http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/26/2/390|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to the most serious conditions ([[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[heart attack]], [[internal bleeding]], etc.).

Malaise expresses a patient's uneasiness that "something is not right" that may need a medical examination to determine the significance.

Malaise is thought to be caused by the activation of an immune response, and the associated pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dantzer|first1=Robert|title=Cytokine, Sickness Behavior, and Depression|journal=Immunology and allergy clinics of North America|date=1 December 2016|volume=29|issue=2|pages=247–264|doi=10.1016/j.iac.2009.02.002|pmc=2740752|issn=0889-8561|pmid=19389580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8969">{{sociology}} 
'''Manifest and latent functions''' are [[social concept|social scientific concepts]] created by anthropologist, Bronislaw Malinowski in 1922 while studying the Trobiand Islanders in the Western Pacific. It was later modified for [[sociology]] by [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diligio.com/notes26.htm Diligio, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Merton appeared interested in sharpening the conceptual tools to be employed in a [[Structural functionalism|functional analysis]].  

Manifest [[Structural functionalism|function]]s are conscious, deliberate and beneficial, the latent ones the unconscious, unintended and beneficial, and [[Dysfunction (sociology)|dysfunctions]] are unconscious, unintended and harmful. &lt;ref name=B63&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/or/sociologyshop/manlat.html Berger, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; While functions are intended (manifest) or unintended (latent), and have a positive effect on [[society]], dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized (latent) and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004&gt;[Brinkerhoff et al. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify| reason=The ideas in the paragraph are hard to follow|date=July 2016}}

==Functions==
Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the consequences that people observe or expect. It is explicitly stated and understood by the participants in the relevant action. The manifest function of a [[rain dance]], used as an example by Merton in his 1967 '' [[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'', is to produce [[rain]], and this outcome is intended and desired by people participating in the ritual.&lt;ref name=M57&gt;[http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/TheoryWeb/Merton.htm Merton, 1957]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M2001&gt;[http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/ecologic.htm M.D. Murphy, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latent functions are those that are neither recognized nor intended. A latent function of a behavior is not explicitly stated, recognized, or intended by the people involved. Thus, they are identified observers.&lt;ref name=M2001/&gt; In the example of rain ceremony, the latent function [[reinforce]]s the [[group identity]] by providing a regular opportunity for the members of a [[group (sociology)|group]] to meet and engage in a common activity.&lt;ref name=M57/&gt;

[[Peter L. Berger]] describes a series of examples illustrating the differences between manifest functions and latent dysfunctions:
{{cquote|"...the “manifest” function of antigambling legislation may be to suppress gambling, its “latent” function to create an illegal empire for the gambling syndicates. Or Christian missions in parts of Africa “manifestly” tried to convert Africans to Christianity, “latently” helped to destroy the indigenous tribal cultures and this provided an important impetus towards rapid social transformation. Or the control of the Communist Party over all sectors of social life in Russia “manifestly” was to assure the continued dominance of the revolutionary ethos, “latently” created a new class of comfortable bureaucrats uncannily bourgeois in its aspirations and increasingly disinclined toward the self-denial of Bolshevik dedication (''nomenklatura''). Or the “manifest” function of many voluntary associations in America is sociability and public service, the “latent” function to attach status indices to those permitted to belong to such associations.” "&lt;ref name=B63/&gt;}}

While [[Talcott Parsons]] tends to emphasize the manifest functions of [[social behavior]], Merton sees attention to latent functions as increasing the understanding of society: the distinction between manifest and latent forces the [[sociologist]] to go beyond the reasons individuals give for their actions or for the existence of [[Tradition|customs]] and [[institution]]s; it makes them look for other [[social consequence]]s that allow these practices’ survival and illuminate the way society works.

== Dysfunctions ==
[[Dysfunction (sociology)|Dysfunction]]s can also be manifest or latent. While functions are intended or recognized (manifest), and may have a positive effect on society, dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized, and have a negative effect on society.&lt;ref name=Betal2004/&gt;

Manifest dysfunctions are anticipated disruptions of social life. For example, a manifest dysfunction of a [[festival]] might include disruptions of transportation and excessive production of garbage.&lt;ref name=f2005&gt;[Ferrante, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Latent dysfunctions are unintended and unanticipated disruptions of order and stability. In the festival example, they would be represented by people missing work due to the traffic jam.&lt;ref name=f2005/&gt;

== Medical science model ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2013}}
Broadly stated and here relying on the systems model first developed in medical science, an interrelated bundle of [[social structure]]s (e.g., [[Zulu culture]]), treated as a [[social system]], involves the parts (structural elements) acting in such a fashion so as to help maintain the [[homeodynamic]] equilibrium of the system of which they are an element. Manifest [[Structural functionalism|functions]] are the obvious and intended consequences a structural feature displays in the maintenance of the steady state of the system of which it is a part. Latent functions are less obvious or [[unintended consequence]]s. Both manifest and latent functions contribute to the social system’s unchanging ongoingness or stasis. In this very specific sense both may be interpreted as useful and positive.

In conducting a functional analysis, '''dysfunctions''' are consequences of structural elements that produce changes in their environing social system. The flame of the candle system flickers. The structural cause would be labeled dysfunctional. The candle’s steady state has been disturbed or changed. The concept affords the only relief to structural-functionalism’s inherent conservative bias. Dysfunction signifies the mechanism by which social change is evidenced within a social system.  Whether that change is manifest or latent is a relatively simple empirical question. Whether that change is good or bad would seem to require interpretative criteria not afforded by a social scientific paradigm for functional analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">The '''marginal product of capital (MP&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;)''' is the additional [[Output (economics)|output]] resulting, [[ceteris paribus]] &lt;sup&gt;("all things being equal")&lt;/sup&gt;, from the use of an additional unit of [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]]. It equals the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[incremental capital-output ratio]]. Mathematically, it is the [[partial derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to capital. If production output &lt;math&gt;Q = f(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;MP_K = \frac{\text{change in }Q}{\text{change in }K} = \frac{\partial f(K, L)}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

One of the key assumptions in economics is [[diminishing returns]], that is the marginal product of capital is positive but decreasing in the level of capital stock, or mathematically

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial K} MP_K = \frac{\partial^2 f(K, L)}{\partial K^2} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a [[Perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] market, the marginal product of capital is equal to the rental rate of capital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30342">[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right| [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] argued that idealized numbers containing [[infinitesimal]]s be introduced.]]

The [[history of calculus]] is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of [[fluxion]]s or [[infinitesimal]] numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|epsilon–delta]] procedures rather than infinitesimals. '''Non-standard analysis'''&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis in Practice. Edited by [[Francine Diener]], [[Marc Diener]]. Springer, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis, Axiomatically. By [[V. Vladimir Grigorevich Kanovei]], [[Michael Reeken]]. Springer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nonstandard Analysis for the Working Mathematician. Edited by [[Peter A. Loeb]], [[Manfred P. H. Wolff]]. Springer, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of [[infinitesimal]] numbers.

Non-standard analysis was originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician [[Abraham Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Non-standard Analysis. By [[Abraham Robinson]]. Princeton University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcps.umn.edu/philosophy/11_7dauben.pdf Abraham Robinson and Nonstandard Analysis]: History, Philosophy, and Foundations of Mathematics. By [[Joseph W. Dauben]]. www.mcps.umn.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the idea of infinitely small or ''infinitesimal'' quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection [...] that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were ''to possess the same properties as the latter''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson argued that this [[law of continuity]] of Leibniz's is a precursor of the [[transfer principle]]. Robinson continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;[[Abraham Robinson|Robinson, A.]]: Non-standard analysis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robinson continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is shown in this book that Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and that they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary [[model theory]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, [[Intuitionism|intuitionist]] [[Arend Heyting]] praised non-standard analysis as "a standard model of important mathematical research".&lt;ref&gt;Heijting, A. (1973) Address to Professor A. Robinson. At the occasion of the Brouwer memorial lecture given by Prof. A.Robinson on the 26th April 1973. Nieuw Arch. Wisk. (3) 21, pp. 134—137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
A non-zero element of an [[ordered field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; is infinitesimal if and only if its [[absolute value]] is smaller than any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called [[non-Archimedean ordered field|non-Archimedean]]. More generally, non-standard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on [[non-standard model]]s and the [[transfer principle]]. A field which satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is a [[hyperreal field]], and non-standard real analysis uses these fields as ''non-standard models'' of the real numbers.

Robinson's original approach was based on these non-standard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject ''Non-standard Analysis'' was published in 1966 and is still in print.&lt;ref name="NSA2"&gt;{{cite book| last=Robinson |first=Abraham|title=Non-standard analysis|year=1996|edition=Revised|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-04490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On page 88, Robinson writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The existence of non-standard models of arithmetic was discovered by [[Thoralf Skolem]] (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the [[ultrapower]] construction [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article on [[hyperreal number]]s for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.

==Basic definitions==
In this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be the field of real numbers, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[semiring]] of natural numbers. Denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; the set of sequences of real numbers. A field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as a suitable quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows. Take a nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] &lt;math&gt;F \subset P(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[Fréchet filter]]. Consider a pair of sequences

:&lt;math&gt;u = (u_n), v = (v_n) \in \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices which is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:

:&lt;math&gt;\{n \in \mathbb{N} : u_n = v_n\} \in F&lt;/math&gt;

The quotient of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, a situation summarized by the formula &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R} = {\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}}/{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Motivation==
There are at least three reasons to consider non-standard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.

===Historical===
Much of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as ''infinitesimal number'' and ''vanishing quantity''. As noted in the article on [[hyperreal number]]s, these formulations were widely criticized by [[George Berkeley]] and others. It was a challenge to develop a consistent theory of analysis using infinitesimals and the first person to do this in a satisfactory way was Abraham Robinson.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt;

In 1958 Curt Schmieden and [[Detlef Laugwitz]] published an Article "Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung"&lt;ref&gt;Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz: ''Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung'', Mathematische Zeitschrift 69 (1958), 1-39&lt;/ref&gt; - "An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus", which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.

===Pedagogical===
[[H. Jerome Keisler]], [[David Tall]], and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|"epsilon-delta" approach]] to analytic concepts.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;H. Jerome Keisler, ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''. First edition 1976; 2nd edition 1986: [http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html full text of 2nd edition]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon-delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:

::infinitesimal × bounded = infinitesimal

::infinitesimal + infinitesimal = infinitesimal

together with the transfer principle mentioned below.

Another pedagogical application of non-standard analysis is [[Edward Nelson]]'s treatment of the theory of [[stochastic processes]].&lt;ref name="Ele"&gt;Edward Nelson: ''Radically Elementary Probability Theory'', Princeton University Press, 1987, [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/rept.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical===
Some recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from non-standard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. [[Sergio Albeverio]] et al.&lt;ref name="Alb"&gt;Sergio Albeverio, Jans Erik Fenstad, Raphael Høegh-Krohn, Tom Lindstrøm: ''Nonstandard Methods in Stochastic Analysis and Mathematical Physics'', Academic Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss some of these applications.

==Approaches to non-standard analysis==
There are two very different approaches to non-standard analysis: the [[semantic]] or [[model-theoretic approach]] and the [[syntactic approach]]. Both these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.

Robinson's original formulation of non-standard analysis falls into the category of the ''semantic approach''. As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular [[saturated model]]s) of a [[theory]]. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to [[Elias Zakon]]) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called [[Universe (mathematics)|superstructures]]. In this approach ''a model of a theory'' is replaced by an object called a ''superstructure'' {{math|''V''(''S'')}} over a set {{mvar|S}}. Starting from a superstructure {{math|''V''(''S'')}} one constructs another object {{math|*''V''(''S'')}} using the [[ultrapower]] construction together with a mapping {{math|''V''(''S'') → *''V''(''S'')}} that satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. The map * relates formal properties of {{math|''V''(''S'')}} and {{math|*''V''(''S'')}}. Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called [[countable]] saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.

The ''syntactic approach'' requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician [[Edward Nelson]]. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of non-standard analysis that he called [[Internal Set Theory]] (IST).&lt;ref name="Nel"&gt;[[Edward Nelson]]: ''Internal Set Theory: A New Approach to Nonstandard Analysis'', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 83, Number 6, November 1977. A chapter on Internal Set Theory is available at [http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf http://www.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; IST is an extension of [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation ∈, it introduces a new unary predicate ''standard'', which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.

Syntactic non-standard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the [[axiom of comprehension]]), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of ''[[illegal set formation]]''. For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here ''standard'' is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.&lt;ref name="Nel" /&gt;

Another example of the syntactic approach is the [[Alternative Set Theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Vopěnka, P. Mathematics in the Alternative Set Theory. Teubner, Leipzig, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by [[Vopěnka]], trying to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the non-standard analysis than the axioms of ZF.

==Robinson's book==
Abraham Robinson's book ''Non-standard analysis'' was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of non-standard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre–non-standard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s "sum theorem" in [[Cours d'Analyse]] concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.

==Invariant subspace problem==
Abraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used non-standard analysis to prove that every [[polynomially compact]] [[linear operator]] on a [[Hilbert space]] has an [[invariant subspace]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen Bernstein and Abraham Robinson, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994835 ''Solution of an invariant subspace problem of K. T. Smith and P. R. Halmos''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics 16:3 (1966) 421-431&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an operator {{mvar|T}} on Hilbert space {{mvar|''H''}}, consider the orbit of a point {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|H}} under the iterates of {{mvar|T}}. Applying Gram-Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{mvar|H}}. Let {{math|(''H&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} be the corresponding nested sequence of "coordinate" subspaces of {{mvar|H}}. The matrix {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;i,j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} expressing {{mvar|T}} with respect to {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if {{mvar|T}} is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index {{mvar|w}} such that the matrix coefficient {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''w''+1,''w''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|*''H''}}. If {{mvar|y}} in {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has finite norm, then {{math|''T''(''y'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Now let {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the operator &lt;math&gt;P_w \circ T&lt;/math&gt; acting on {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the orthogonal projection to {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Denote by {{mvar|q}} the polynomial such that {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is compact. The subspace {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis {{math|(''e&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} for {{math|''H&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''}} where {{mvar|k}} runs from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|w}}, such that each of the corresponding {{mvar|k}}-dimensional subspaces {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{mvar|T}}-invariant. Denote by {{math|Π&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} the projection to the subspace {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. For a nonzero vector {{mvar|x}} of finite norm in {{mvar|H}}, one can assume that {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} is nonzero, or {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}} to fix ideas. Since {{math|''q''(''T'')}} is a compact operator, {{math|(''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''))(''x'')}} is infinitely close to {{math|''q''(''T'')(''x'')}} and therefore one has also {{math|{{!}}''q''(''T&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'')(''x''){{!}} &gt; 1}}. Now let {{mvar|j}} be the greatest index such that &lt;math&gt;|q(T_w) \left (\Pi_j(x) \right)|&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the desired invariant subspace.

Upon reading a preprint of the Bernstein-Robinson paper, [[Paul Halmos]] reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques.&lt;ref&gt;P. Halmos, [http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.pjm/1102994836 ''Invariant subspaces for Polynomially Compact Operators''], Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 16:3 (1966) 433-437.&lt;/ref&gt; Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the ''Pacific Journal of Mathematics''. Some of the ideas used in Halmos' proof reappeared many years later in Halmos' own work on quasi-triangular operators.

==Other applications==
Other results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Kamae's proof&lt;ref&gt;T. Kamae: ''A simple proof of the ergodic theorem using nonstandard analysis'', Israel Journal of Mathematics vol. 42, Number 4, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[individual ergodic theorem]] or van den Dries and Wilkie's treatment&lt;ref&gt;L. van den Dries and A. J. Wilkie: ''Gromov's Theorem on Groups of Polynomial Growth and Elementary Logic'', Journal of Algebra, Vol 89, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and [[Shmuel Weinberger]] to prove a result in algebraic topology.&lt;ref&gt;Manevitz, Larry M.; Weinberger, Shmuel: Discrete circle actions: a note using non-standard analysis. Israel J. Math. 94 (1996), 147--155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The real contributions of non-standard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilizes the new extended language of non-standard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability &lt;ref name="Ele"/&gt;
hydrodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Capinski&amp;nbsp;M., [[Nigel Cutland|Cutland]]&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;J. ''Nonstandard Methods for Stochastic Fluid Mechanics.''
Singapore&amp;nbsp;etc., World Scientific Publishers (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; measure theory,&lt;ref&gt;Cutland N. ''[[Peter A. Loeb|Loeb]] Measures in Practice: Recent Advances.'' Berlin&amp;nbsp;etc.: Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; nonsmooth and harmonic analysis,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon E. I., [[Semën Samsonovich Kutateladze|Kutateladze S. S.]], and Kusraev A. G. ''Infinitesimal Analysis'' Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

There are also applications of non-standard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et-al&lt;ref name="Alb" /&gt; have an excellent introduction to this area of research.

===Applications to calculus===
As an application to [[mathematical education]], [[H. Jerome Keisler]] wrote ''[[Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach]]''.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Covering [[non-standard calculus]], it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of non-standard analysis depend on the existence of the ''[[standard part function|standard part]]'' of a finite hyperreal {{mvar|r}}. The standard part of {{mvar|r}}, denoted {{math|st(''r'')}}, is a standard real number infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together. Keisler's book is now out of print, but is freely available from his website; see references below.

==Critique==
{{summarize|from|criticism of non-standard analysis|section=y}}
Despite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of non-standard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by E. Bishop, A. Connes, and P. Halmos, as documented at [[criticism of non-standard analysis]].

==Logical framework==
Given any set {{mvar|S}}, the ''superstructure'' over a set {{mvar|S}} is the set {{math|''V''(''S'')}} defined by the conditions

:&lt;math&gt;V_0(S) = S, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_{n+1}(S) = V_{n}(S) \cup \wp (V_{n}(S)), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbf{N}} V_{n}(S).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the superstructure over {{mvar|S}} is obtained by starting from {{mvar|S}} and iterating the operation of adjoining the [[power set]] of {{mvar|S}} and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains [[isomorphic]] copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

The working view of nonstandard analysis is a set {{math|*'''R'''}} and a mapping {{math|* : ''V''('''R''') → ''V''(*'''R''')}} which satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.

A formula has ''bounded quantification'' if and only if the only quantifiers which occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \exists x \in A, \Phi(x, \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, the formula

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y \in 2^B, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

has bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable {{mvar|x}} ranges over {{mvar|A}}, the existentially quantified variable {{mvar|y}} ranges over the powerset of {{mvar|B}}. On the other hand,

:&lt;math&gt; \forall x \in A, \ \exists y, \quad x \in y &lt;/math&gt;

does not have bounded quantification because the quantification of ''y'' is unrestricted.

==Internal sets==
A set ''x'' is ''internal'' if and only if ''x'' is an element of *''A'' for some element ''A'' of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}. *''A'' itself is internal if ''A'' belongs to {{math|''V''('''R''')}}.

We now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:
* [[Extension principle]]: The mapping * is the identity on {{math|'''R'''}}.
* ''Transfer principle'': For any formula {{math|''P''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} with bounded quantification and with free variables {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and for any elements {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|''V''('''R''')}}, the following equivalence holds:

::&lt;math&gt;P(A_1, \ldots, A_n) \iff P(*A_1, \ldots, *A_n) &lt;/math&gt;

* ''Countable saturation'': If {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''k'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; is a decreasing sequence of nonempty internal sets, with ''k'' ranging over the natural numbers, then

::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_k A_k \neq \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;

One can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of {{math|''V''('''R''')}} are called ''standard''. Elements of {{math|*'''R'''}} are called [[hyperreal number]]s.

==First consequences==
The symbol {{math|*'''N'''}} denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of {{math|'''N'''}}. The set {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}} is nonempty. To see this, apply countable [[saturated model|saturation]] to the sequence of internal sets

:&lt;math&gt; A_n = \{k \in {^*\mathbf{N}}: k \geq n\} &lt;/math&gt;

The sequence {{math|{''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}&lt;sub&gt;''n'' ∈ '''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.

We begin with some definitions: Hyperreals ''r'', ''s'' are ''infinitely close'' [[if and only if]]

:&lt;math&gt; r \cong s \iff \forall \theta \in \mathbf{R}^+, \ |r - s| \leq \theta&lt;/math&gt;

A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''infinitesimal'' if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if {{mvar|n}} is a [[hyperinteger]], i.e. an element of {{math|*'''N''' − '''N'''}}, then {{math|1/''n''}} is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal {{mvar|r}} is ''limited'' (or ''finite'') if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of {{math|*'''R'''}} containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]].

The set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are ''external'' subsets of {{math|''V''(*'''R''')}}; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.

'''Example''': The plane {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} ranging over {{math|*'''R'''}} is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} restricted to limited values (analogous to the [[Dehn planes|Dehn plane]]) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point {{math|(0, 1)}} on the {{mvar|y}}-axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis.

'''Theorem.''' For any limited hyperreal {{mvar|r}} there is a unique standard real denoted {{math|st(''r'')}} infinitely close to {{mvar|r}}. The mapping {{math|st}} is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to {{math|'''R'''}}.

The mapping st is also external.

One way of thinking of the [[standard part function|standard part]] of a hyperreal, is in terms of [[Dedekind cut]]s; any limited hyperreal {{mvar|s}} defines a cut by considering the pair of sets {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} where {{mvar|L}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|a}} less than {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|U}} is the set of standard rationals {{mvar|b}} greater than {{mvar|s}}. The real number corresponding to {{math|(''L'', ''U'')}} can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of {{mvar|s}}.

One intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal {{mvar|x}} in the interval {{math|*[''a'', ''b'']}}, we have: {{math|*''f''(''x'') ≅ *''f''(st(''x''))}}.

(see [[microcontinuity]] for more details). Similarly,

'''Theorem.''' A real-valued function {{mvar|f}} is differentiable at the real value {{mvar|x}} if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number {{mvar|h}}, the value

:&lt;math&gt; f'(x)= \operatorname{st} \left(\frac{{^*f}(x+h) - {^*f}(x)}{h}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

exists and is independent of {{mvar|h}}. In this case {{math|''f''′(''x'')}} is a real number and is the derivative of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|x}}.

=={{mvar|κ}}-saturation==
It is possible to "improve" the saturation by allowing collections of higher cardinality to be intersected. A model is {{mvar|κ}}-[[Saturated model|saturated]] if whenever &lt;math&gt;\{A_i\}_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of internal sets with the [[finite intersection property]] and &lt;math&gt;|I|\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful, for instance, in a topological space {{mvar|X}}, where we may want {{math|{{!}}2&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;{{!}}}}-saturation to ensure the intersection of a standard [[neighborhood base]] is nonempty.&lt;ref&gt;Salbany, S.; Todorov, T. [http://www.esi.ac.at/static/esiprpr/esi666.pdf Nonstandard Analysis in Point-Set Topology]. Erwing Schrodinger Institute for Mathematical Physics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For any cardinal {{mvar|κ}}, a {{mvar|κ}}-saturated extension can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C.; Keisler, H. J. Model theory. Third edition.

'''The Offences Against the Person Act 1828''' (9 Geo. 4 c. 31) (also known as Lord Lansdowne's Act) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. It consolidated provisions in the law related to [[offences against the person]] (an expression which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier [[statutes]] into a single Act. It was part of the criminal law reforms known collectively as "[[Peel's Acts]]", passed with the objective of simplifying the law.  Among the laws it replaced was clause XXXVI of the [[Magna Carta]], the first time any part of the Magna Carta was repealed, and the [[Buggery Act 1533]]. It also abolished the crime of [[petty treason]].

The Act only applied to [[England and Wales]] (then described as England). A similar statute was passed for Ireland the following year (10 Geo. 4 c. 34).

A number of the Act's provisions were repealed and replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]]. The death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent (s.12), and for post-[[quickening]] abortions (s.13) under this Act was abolished by [[repeal]] of those sections by section 1 of the 1837 Act (sections 12 and 13 of this act were replaced by sections 4 and 6 of the 1837 Act, respectively).

The death penalty for rape (s.16) and [[carnal knowledge]] of a girl under ten (s.17) was abolished by amendment of those sections by section 3 of the [[Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841]]. Section 18 made provision in relation to proof of carnal knowledge.

The Act was wholly replaced by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

Under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1828, several sections pertained to the crime of rape. The penalty for being convicted of rape was still death, and remained so until 1841. The Act also made it a felony punishable by death to carnally know a girl under the age of ten. Carnally knowing a girl over the age of ten and under the age of twelve was a [[misdemeanor]] punishable with imprisonment with the option of [[Penal labour|hard labor]] for a term to be determined by the court.  

The Act also affirmed that proof of penetration was sufficient to reach the conclusion that one person had had carnal knowledge of another; before the 1828 statute, victims of rape had to prove that the perpetrator [[Ejaculation|ejaculated]]. Historian [[Anna Clark (historian)|Anna Clark]] has argued that medical experts used ejaculation as proof of rape because it was tangible evidence that reduced the need for a victim's testimony.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Clark also contends that requiring proof of ejaculation allowed judges and magistrates to ask victims humiliating and explicit questions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} By changing the definition of carnal knowledge from ejaculation to proof of penetration, the 1828 act made it a little easier for victims to prosecute their rapists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Records show that from 1828 to 1841, 63 defendants accused of rape were tried at the [[Old Bailey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Of those 63 defendants, 16 were found guilty and 12 were sentenced to death. Three had their sentenced reduced to imprisonment, and one had his judgment respited altogether.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The Act and its focus on interpersonal violence also had the effect of increasing formal accusations of [[domestic violence]], by reducing the stigma surrounding such activity and diminishing judicial delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lisa-surridge-on-the-offenses-against-the-person-act-1828|last=Surridge|first=Lisa|title=On the Offenses Against the Person Act, 1828|website=www.branchcollective.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 9). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of job opportunities in the United States has sharply polarized over the past two decades, with expanding job opportunities in both high-skill, high-wage occupations and low-skill, low wage occupations, coupled with contracting opportunities in middle-wage, middle-skill white-collar and blue-collar jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=The Polarization of Job Opportunities in the U.S. Labor Market Implications for Employment and Earnings |first=David |last=Autor |publisher=MIT Department of Economics and National Bureau of Economic Research |date=April 2010 |url=http://economics.mit.edu/files/5554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this has contributed to the rise of [[income inequality in the U.S.]] it is a minor factor compared to the relatively rapid rise in income and wealth by the top 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E.

Over the past decades, wage gains were also polarized, with modest gains at the extremes and smaller gains in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorn|first=David|date=December 2015|title=The Rise of the Machines - How Computers Have Changed Work|url=http://www.ubscenter.uzh.ch/assets/publicpapers/PP4_the_rise_of_the_machines.pdf|journal=UBS Center Public Paper|volume=#4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A good description of polarization in Great Britain is one of the first uses of the term, economic polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Maarten |last=Goos |first2=Alan |last2=Manning |title=Lousy and Lovely Jobs: The Rising Polarization of Work in Britain |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |year=2007 |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=118–133 |doi=10.1162/rest.89.1.118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David H. |last=Autor |first2=Lawrence F. |last2=Katz |first3=Melissa S. |last3=Kearney |title=The Polarization of the Labor Market |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=96 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=189–194 |jstor=30034640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although "polarization" is a relatively young concept in economic analysis, the phenomenon of wage and labor skill polarization is as old as economics.  More recently economic polarization has been connected to both automation and the export of jobs to low wage countries.  Many middle-skilled jobs are routine and demand only average skills and abilities.  As a result, current computer technologies are able to handle them, or, alternatively, they can be [[outsource]]d electronically to foreign websites to be performed by comparatively low-wage workers.

==Causes==
Because polarization appears similar in 16 European countries as well as the U.S. it seems likely that similar forces affect  these shared economic developments.  Loss of American manufacturing jobs to overseas global competitors has removed many middle skill jobs.  Structural changes with more investment in robotics has removed other middle skill jobs globally, but not the lowest skill or the highest skill.  As computers become more competent, this may change. Changes in education in the [[Third World]], with increased education levels in the rest of the world compared to levels in industrial nations, has affected highly industrial economies. Unionization has mixed effects on polarization, since it tends to raise wages at all levels, but reduces the differences between managerial and other employees.  The decline in unionization in America may increase polarization slightly. Globalization also lowers wages across the board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}The most powerful causes are the redistributive effects of government,  through laws such as those that discourage unionization, determine corporate governance, and limit the extent of monopoly rents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}  These laws generally are plutocratic and accrue benefit to those at the top, at the expense of those in the middle, driving many of the latter into the bottom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} As an example of how polarization is affected by labor demand, rather than skill distributions, changing patterns of employment and earnings show strong correlations between wages and the proportion of a skill group employed.  When fewer are employed, the wages go down rather than up as simple supply and demand would predict.  Another factor is the levelling off of the supply of college graduates after the 1970s in the US and the consequent increase in the wage gap between college graduates and high school graduates.  Whether this is also occurring in other industrial countries is not so clear.

==Consequences==
One way of quantifying the polarization of the economy is to compare the fraction of those with incomes that are close to the middle—for example, a range that goes from 50 percent greater than the median to 50 percent less than the median—has fallen since 1970 from just over 50 percent to just over 42 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Krueger, “The Rise and Consequences of Inequality in the United States,” address delivered at the Center for American Progress, January 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the U.S. and the E.U. have shown almost identical trends in the share of employment rise by the high and low skill jobs, and a loss by the middle skill jobs, between 1993 and 2006. Polarization became an issue during the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]] when [[Joe Biden]] asserted that the previous policies had "eviscerated" and "buried" the middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/huntfish/ci_21680497/biden-blasts-romney-tax-plans-during-stop-nc |accessdate=November 1, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-19/biden-says-romney-policies-would-eviscerate-middle-class  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704223902/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-19/biden-says-romney-policies-would-eviscerate-middle-class |date=July 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This picked up on Stiglitz' statement: "But in recent years, America’s middle class has become eviscerated,..."&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (2012-06-04). The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future (p. 9). Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Job polarization has also changed the nature of business cycle recoveries. Prior to polarization, employment would recover quickly following recessions because employment in routine jobs would bounce back. Since the 1980s, job polarization has led to the permanent loss of routine jobs, especially during recessions. Following the recessions of the 1990s and 2000s, employment would not recover because routine jobs are not coming back. This has led to jobless recoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nir |last=Jaimovich |first2=Henry E. |last2=Siu |title=The Trend is the Cycle: Job Polarization and Jobless Recoveries |work=NBER Working Paper No. 18334 |date=August 2012 |doi=10.3386/w18334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">'''Political Terror Scale''' is a yearly measure of state inflicted political terror. It was developed in the early 1980s by researchers at [[Purdue University]] and is currently managed by Mark Gibney of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}

==Introduction==
The Political Terror Scale is a yearly measure of terror inflicted upon a population. "Terror" is defined as state terror, or violations of physical and personal integrity rights carried out by the state or its agents. Examples of political terror include extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and political imprisonment.

Originally, only 59 countries were coded for within the database between 1976 and 1983. In 1984, Mark Gibney took over as manager of the database and expanded the list of countries coded to 180 and the range of years to the most recent years available (currently 2012).{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=369}}The Political Terror Scale uses three sources to code each country: [[State Department|The State Department's]] ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,'' the ''Annual Report'' from [[Amnesty International]] and most recently the ''World Report'' from [[Human Rights Watch]].{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=372}}The database can be viewed and downloaded from its [http://www.politicalterrorscale.org website].

==The Coding Process==
===The Scale===
The Political Terror Scale is a five-point fixed scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/Data/Documentation.html|title=Documentation: Coding Rules|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Countries are under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their views, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are rare
# There is a limited amount of imprisonment for nonviolent  political activity. However, a few persons are affected; torture and beating are exceptional. Political murder is rare.
# There is extensive political imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without trial, for political views is accepted.
# The practices of Level 3 are expanded to larger numbers. Murders, disappearances, and torture are part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects primarily those who interest themselves in politics or ideas.
# The terrors of Level 4 have been extended to the whole population. The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.

The scale is based on the assessment of violence along three dimensions:scope, intensity, and range. '''Scope''' is the type of violence carried out by the state, '''Intensity''' refers to the frequency at which the state employs a given type of violence, and '''Range''' is the portion of the population targeted for abuse (can also be thought of as the selectivity of violence).&lt;ref&gt;Wood and Gibney 2010, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=373}}

===The Coders===
The principle researchers consist of professors from several universities.
* '''Mark Gibney''' - Belk Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Linda Cornett''' - Chair and Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Reed Wood''' - Assistant Professor of the School of Politics and Global Studies at [[Arizona State University]].
* '''Peter Haschke''' - Assistant Professor of Political Science at the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]].
* '''Daniel Arnon''' - PhD Student at [[Emory University]].

Coding is also supplemented by undergraduate and graduate students from several universities. Research assistants for the 2012-2013 year are: Daniel Arnon, Gray Barrett, Minori Hinds, and Kelsey Tavares of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]], Alexander Liffiton and Rachel Olson of Arizona State University, Max Scott of the [[London School of Economics]], and Shea Streeter, a recent graduate of the [[University of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politicalterrorscale.org/About/Researchers/|title=Researchers|work=The Political Terror Scale|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Process===
The data for each country is analyzed by at least two senior coders and undergraduate assistants. Each nation receives two scores - one from the State Department's report and one from Amnesty International's report. Coders agree with each other regarding a country's score at a rate of roughly 85%. If coders cannot come to an agreement than a third coder will settle the dispute. Due to the contextual nature of the source data, coding is highly subjective, and coders are instructed to ignore their own personal biases or knowledge when determining a country's score. Coders are also instructed to give countries the benefit of any doubt when scoring. If a coder cannot decided between two numbers, they are instructed to use the lower number when scoring.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=|pp=372-374}}

===Challenges and Examples===
The Political Terror Scale only measures acts of political terror inflicted by the state. Due to this fact, it may be difficult to score countries when it is not immediately clear which groups are committing acts of violence. [[Colombia]] is a perfect example of this dilemma, as although overall violence has decreased since 2000, violence from local militias and paramilitary groups has continued at a relatively stable rate. Although the government has attempted to mitigate the violence, certain actors within the government have either allowed the violence to continue or contributed to it in some way. Therefore, Colombia's score reflects the close level of involvement between government and private actors.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=371}}

Another challenge is that the Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or acts of violence and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed acts of violence in the past to deter resistance generally do not have to commit many acts of violence in order to maintain control. For example, the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.{{Sfn|Wood|Gibney|2010|p=370}}

In [[computational complexity theory]], a '''polynomial reduction''' is a [[reduction (complexity)|reduction]] of one problem to another that is performed in [[Time_complexity#Polynomial_time|polynomial time]]. A polynomial reduction takes polynomial time to pre-process inputs and post-process outputs. In such a reduction, the number of calls of the algorithm used to solve the problem being reduced also takes polynomial time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4416">In [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]], a '''product''' of ''types'' is another, compounded, type in a structure.  The "operands" of the product are [[data type|type]]s, and the structure of a product type is determined by the fixed order of the operands in the product.  An instance of a product type retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its [[primitive data type]]s.  The expression of an instance of a product type will be a [[tuple]], and is called a "tuple type" of expression. A product of types is a [[direct product]] of two or more types.

If there are only two component types, it can be called a "pair type". For example, if two component types '''A''' and '''B''' are the set of all possible values that type, the product type written '''A''' &amp;times; '''B''' contains elements that are pairs (a,b), where "a" and "b" are instances of '''A''' and '''B''' respectively. The pair type is a special case of the [[Dependent type#Dependent pair type|dependent pair type]], where the type '''B''' may depend on the instance picked from '''A'''.

In many languages, product types take the form of a [[record (computer science)|record]] type, for which the components of a tuple can be accessed by [[identifier|label]]. In languages that have [[algebraic data type]]s, as in most [[functional programming]] languages, algebraic data types with one constructor are isomorphic to a product type.

In the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], product types are associated with [[logical conjunction]] (AND) in logic.

The notion directly extends to the product of an arbitrary finite number of types (a n-ary product type), and in this case, it characterizes the expressions which behave as [[tuple]]s of expressions of the corresponding types. A degenerated form of product type is the [[unit type]]: it is the [[empty product|product of no type]]s.

In [[Evaluation strategy#Call by value|call-by-value]] programming languages, a product type can be interpreted as a set of pairs whose first component is a [[value (computer science)|value]] in the first type and whose second component is a value in the second type. In short, it is a [[cartesian product]] and it corresponds to a [[product (category theory)|product]] in the category of types.

Most [[functional programming]] languages have a [[primitive notion]] of product type. For instance, the product of ''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is written ''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt; * &lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt; * &lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in [[ML programming language|ML]] and &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;''type&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]. In both these languages, tuples are written &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt;''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;''v&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; and the components of a tuple are extracted by [[pattern-matching]].  Additionally, many functional programming languages provide more general [[algebraic data type]]s, which extend both product and [[sum type]]s. Product types are the [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of sum types.

==Example==
An example of a product type is the type of a vector in a [[vector space]] or an [[algebra over a field]]: the type is a product of a number type, and a direction type.  Thus, for example, the brochure for the [http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure International System of Units] starts out in section 1.1 saying "The value of a quantity is generally expressed as the product of a number and a unit", and also presents the unit product of a Newton and a meter with the product notation of mathematics: Newton meter (N m or N · m). This is properly indicative of the [[vector space]] nature of SI units over the [[abelian group]] of [[dimensional analysis#SI units|dimensions]] under multiplication, and the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s -- the SI units form an [[algebra over a field]].

[[Jainism]] emphasises that '''ratnatraya''' (triple gems of Jainism) — the right faith (''Samyak Darshana''), right knowledge (''Samyak Gyana'') and right conduct (''Samyak Charitra'') — constitutes the path to liberation. These are known as the triple gems (or jewels) of Jainism and hence also known as ''Ratnatr
== The Path to liberation ==
The very first ''sloka'' (aphorism) of the Sacred [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]] reads:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1-1){{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}}}}

Ācārya [[Pujyapada]] writes in ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' (translated by Prof. S.A. Jain):{{quote|Perfect release from all karmas is liberation. The path to liberation is the method by which it can be attained. The singular ‘path’ is used in order to indicate that all the three together constitute the path to liberation. This controverts the views that each of these singly constitutes a path. Hence it must be understood that these three— right faith, right knowledge and right conduct — together constitute the direct path to liberation.{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=4}}}}

#bondage ([[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]])- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)– obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.

Many disciplines of knowledge are developed based on certain fundamental givens, or axioms.  For example, [[Euclidean geometry]] is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] ("true statements given the axioms") are derived from a finite number of axioms. [[Special theory of relativity]] bases itself on one of the fundamental principles called "The Principle of Invariant Light Speed".  It takes it as given that light in vacuum propagates with the constant speed in terms of any system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source. These seven fundamental concepts, provide the metaphysical structure of [[Jain philosophy]].&lt;ref name=MehtaTU&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/jainism/database/BOOK/arhat.doc |title= Path of Arhat - A Religious Democracy |author= Mehta, T.U |volume = 63 |publisher = Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha |year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human state of existence, right faith acquired from destruction as well as from destruction-cum- subsidence. An intelligent conviction and profound faith in the essential nature of the soul, of matter, and of their mutual relationships, actions and reactions, is a necessary condition for launching upon the path of liberation.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad&gt;Jyoti Prasad Jain Dr. Essence of Jainism, Shuchita Publications, Varanasi, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism declares that a person with the right faith will have spiritual calmness (''Prasanna''), desire for liberation from the endless birth-life-death cycles (''Samvega''), without any attachment or aversion to anything (''Nirveda''), kindness (''Anukampa''), and belief in the ''tattvas'' (fundamental principles) described just above (''āstika'').

=== Right knowledge ===
Jain texts mention that knowledge is of five kinds – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy, and omniscience.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=5}} Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=13}} Most of our knowledge is sensory-based (''mati'') and based on recorded knowledge developed by our ancestors in the form of books, articles, papers and other medium (''sruta''). Jain philosophers also include knowledge acquired directly without any medium. This is achieved by removing the karmic veil on the soul.
*A person who sees objects illuminated by coloured light may not be able to judge the true colour of the objects. However, the same person viewing these objects illuminated by sunlight will see the true nature of their colours, without difficulty. Similarly, proper knowledge is essential to provide the right guidance to the soul in its journey towards spiritual uplifting.
*The Jain theory of knowledge is a highly developed one based on comprehensive apprehension of reality in multitude of view points and relativity.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad/&gt;
*[[Anekantavada]], which literally means search of truth from different points of view, is the application of the principle of equality of souls in the sphere of thought. It is a jain philosophical standpoint just as there is the Advaitic standpoint of Sankara and the standpoint of the Middle Path of the Buddhists.&lt;ref name=Ramjee&gt;Singh Ramjee Dr. Jaina Perspective in Philosophy and Religion,Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, Faridabad, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This search leads to understanding and toleration of different and even conflicting views.  When this happens, prejudices subside and the tendency to accommodate increases.  The theory of [[Anekanta]] is therefore a unique experiment of non-violence at the root.&lt;ref name=MehtaTU/&gt;
*A derivation of this principle is the doctrine of [[Syadvada]] which highlights that every view is relative to its view point. For example, an object may seem heavy when carried on planet earth, yet lightweight when carried on the moon, where gravity is different.  It is a matter of our daily experience that the same object which gives pleasure to us under certain circumstances becomes boring under different situations.  Nonetheless relative truth is undoubtedly useful as it is a stepping stone to the ultimate realisation of reality.  The theory of [[Syadvada]] is based on the premise that every proposition is only relatively true.  It all depends on the particular aspect from which we approach that proposition. Jains therefore developed a logic that encompasses sevenfold predication so as to assist in the construction of proper judgement about any proposition.
*[[Syadvada]] provides Jainas with a systematic methodology to explore the real nature of reality and consider the problem in a non-violent way from different perspectives. This process ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, and thus it is known as theory of conditioned predication. These seven propositions are described as follows:
::1.Syād-asti — "in some ways it is"
::2.Syād-nāsti — "in some ways it is not"
::3.Syād-asti-nāsti — "in some ways it is and it is not"
::4.Syād-asti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is and it is indescribable"
::5.Syād-nāsti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is not and it is indescribable"
::6.Syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavya — "in some ways it is, it is not and it is indescribable"
::7.Syād-avaktavya — "in some ways it is indescribable"

*This means, no model of reality is absolute including religious/spiritual/philosophical concepts.  However, each model provides insight into the working of the universe that are useful within the bounds of its framework and therefore useful under certain conditions.

=== Right conduct ===

Right conduct is the application of the knowledge developed, so as to exercise control over our inner desires and reach a stage where there is no attachment or aversion.

Right conduct includes:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=57}}
* Five kinds of spiritual purity
# ''[[Sāmāyika]]'' (equanimity),
# penalties for faults arising from inadvertence, or negligence, on account of which one loses equanimity,
# refraining from ''himsa'' (injury),
# control of passions, and
# contemplation of one's own soul

* Observance of [[Mahavrata]]s (five major vows) and seven supplementary vows.

The interesting aspect is that on this path there is a place for every one from the beginner to the most advanced seekers. Further, it encompasses all aspects of human life, namely social, personal, economic and spiritual leading to integrated development of the individual.

== Right Faith and Right Knowledge ==
Right view and right knowledge are inter-dependent. For instance, when the clouds disappear, both the heat and the light of the sun are manifested simultaneously. Similarly, when right faith is attained by the soul owing to the subsidence, destruction or destruction- cum-subsidence of faith-deluding karmas, right sensory knowledge and right scriptural knowledge are attained by the soul
at the same time by the removal of wrong sensory and wrong scriptural knowledge.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=4}}

== Right Knowledge and Right Conduct ==
Right Knowledge must be accompanied by Right conduct which is necessary for the destruction of karmic bonds.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=182}} Without it there is no release from the cycle of transmigration, i.e., repeated births and deaths. Just like the light from millions of lamps is of no avail to a blind person, studying scriptures alone is of no use to a person who does not apply them.

=== Stages on the Path to liberation ===
{{main|gunasthana}}
[[File:Fourteen stages.JPG|thumb|Fourteen stages on the Path to liberation]]
Jainism acknowledges that the soul advances to its liberated stage in various steps, called ''Gunasthana''. Jain literature describes these states in detail. The following provides a concise summary on the various statuses of soul on its journey to spiritual advancement.

;Awakening - Developing right view
#Lowest stage with ignorance, delusion, and with intense attachments and aversions.  This is the normal condition of all souls involved in the ''samsara'', and is the starting point of spiritual evolution.
#Indifference to reality with occasional vague memory of spiritual insight.
#Fleeting moments of curiosity towards understanding reality.
#Awareness of reality with trust developed in the right view, combined with willingness to practice self-discipline. The soul may be able to subdue the four passions, namely anger, pride, deceit and greed.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;Developing right view and discipline
5. The soul now begins to observe some of the rules of right conduct with a view to perfecting itself.  With the discipline of introductory or minor vows, the soul starts on the process of climbing the spiritual ladder.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Major vows taken up with firm resolve to control passions.  There may be failures due to lack of full control over passions or carelessness.

;Developing self discipline and knowledge
7. Intense practice of vows assisted in better self-control and virtually replaced carelessness with spiritual vigilance and vigor.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Closer to perfect self-control over actions, higher control over mind, thought and passions with the soul ready for reduction of the effects of conduct-deluding karma.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Higher control over removal of passions, and elimination of conduct-deluding karma begins.&lt;br /&gt;
10. Complete elimination of all passions except for subtle degree of attachment.

;Gaining absolute knowledge and bliss
11. Suppressed passions and lingering conduct-deluding karma may rise to drag the soul to lower stages; fleeting experiences of equanimity.&lt;br /&gt;
12. This is the point of no return. All passions as well as conduct-deluding karma are eliminated.  Permanent internal peace achieved.  No new bondage from this point onwards.&lt;br /&gt;
13. All inimical karma destroyed. Omniscience achieved and Arihant stage reached. However the perfected soul is still trapped in the physical body (with right knowledge attained).&lt;br /&gt;
14. This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the ''aghātiā karmas''. Those who pass this stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

[[File:Red and blue pill.jpg|thumb|A red pill and a blue pill]]
{{wiktionary|red piller}}

The '''red pill''' and its opposite, the '''blue pill''', are a popular cultural [[meme]], a metaphor representing the choice between: 
*[[Knowledge]], [[freedom]], [[uncertainty]] and the brutal [[truth]]s of [[reality]] (red pill) 
*[[Security]], [[happiness]], [[beauty]], and the [[blissful ignorance effect|blissful ignorance]] of [[illusion]] (blue pill) 

The terms, popularized in [[science fiction]] culture, are directly derived from the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]''. However, it is speculated that the scriptwriters may have borrowed the idea from the 1865 [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'', in which the central character has a choice to drink or eat potions to enable her adventure to continue. In the Matrix, the main character [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. The red pill represented an uncertain future—it would free him from the enslaving control of the machine-generated [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]] and allow him to escape into the real world, but living the "truth of reality" is harsher and more difficult. On the other hand, the blue pill represented a beautiful [[prison]]—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the [[simulated reality]] of the Matrix.

===Background: draft lottery (1969)===
{{main|Draft lottery (1969)#Method}}
On December 1, 1969 the [[Selective Service System]] of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the [[Vietnam War]] for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque blue plastic capsules that resembled large blue pills. The blue pills were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. The blue pills were then drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The order that each birthdate was drawn signified the draft order for that birthdate. From this first draft lottery, 195 birth dates were selected to serve in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Selective Service System |url=http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |title=1970 Draft Lottery Results drawn December 1, 1969 sorted by date |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915232321/http://www.sss.gov/LOTTER8.HTM |archivedate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gödel, Escher, Bach'' (1979)===
[[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' features a pair of characters who "push-into" and "pop-out of" the two-dimensional world of [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] prints. The way they do this is to drink from a blue or a red phial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Douglas Hofstadter – Little Harmonic Labyrinth |url=https://genius.com/Douglas-hofstadter-little-harmonic-labyrinth-annotated |work=''[[Genius (website)|Genius]]'' |location=New York City |accessdate=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofstadter2000_116"&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas R. Hofstadter |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach. Anniversary Edition: An Eternal Golden Braid |url=https://books.google.com/?id=63yk44Sc59EC |year=1999 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-465-02656-2 |pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=63yk44Sc59EC&amp;q=red+blue+%22two+phials%22 106], [https://books.google.com/?id=63yk44Sc59EC&amp;q=phial 116]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further reference could be taken later in the story when the pair encounter a paradox during which "The System crashed". Hofstadter cites [[Lewis Carroll]] as a strong influence on the book (the front cover of the book has a line that says that the book is "in the spirit of Lewis Carroll".) The "push-into" and "pop-out of" phials are reminiscent of the ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' "drink me" and "eat me" potion and cake, which cause Alice to shrink and grow.

===''Total Recall'' (1990)===
The [[science fiction]] film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) features a red pill which is offered to [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s character, Douglas Quaid, by one Dr. Edgemar. He is told "it's a symbol, of your desire to return to reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Parker (psychologist) |title=Psychology, Science Fiction and Postmodern Space |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/008124639602600303 |journal=South African Journal of Psychology |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] |date=September 1996 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=143−149 |doi=10.1177/008124639602600303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[YouTube]] |title=''Total Recall'' - The Red Pill |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWfh0OuTKKE |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he {{em|is}} dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words "inside your dream, you'll fall asleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Ian |title=Psychoanalytic Culture.

The implication is that if the dream is not a dream but reality, Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid, and the pill is simply poison. He had also told Quaid that if Quaid killed him, "the walls of reality will come crashing down"; moments after his death, the walls of the hotel room literally come crashing down.&lt;ref name="Killing the Bearer of the Red Pill"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100802/trivia?item=tr0742282 |title=Total Recall Spoilers |publisher=[[IMDb]] | accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{UGC|date=March 2018}}

===''The Matrix'' (1999)===
{{see also|Influences and interpretations of The Matrix}}

''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), directed by [[The Wachowskis]], makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including [[gnosticism]], [[existentialism]], and [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/arts/24MATR.html|title=Philosophers Draw on the Film 'Matrix'|first=Edward|last=Rothstein|date=May 24, 2003|accessdate=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/gnostic.htm|title=Journal of Religion &amp; Film: Wake Up!

Japanese director [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' was a strong influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Matrix Virtual Theatre'' (interview with the Wachowskis)| publisher=''[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studios]]'', Official Website | url=http://www.warnervideo.com/matrixevents/wachowski.html |date=1999-11-06| accessdate=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Matrix'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]. Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]), introduces Neo to Morpheus.

Morpheus ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:

{{quotation|This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the {{em|red}} pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.}}

As narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a "location device" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be "unplugged" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.

Neo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and [[bioelectricity]] consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.

In a 2012 interview, [[The Wachowskis|Lana Wachowski]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviecitynews.com/2012/10/dp30-cloud-atlas-screenwriterdirectors-lana-wachowski-tom-tykwer-andy-wachowski/|title=DP/30: Cloud Atlas, Screenwriter/Directors Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer, Andy Wachowski|at=18:49|last=Poland|first=David|publisher=moviecitynews.com|date=October 13, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|source=Lana Wachowski, ''Movie City News'', October 13, 2012|quote=What we were trying to achieve with the story overall was a shift, the same kind of shift that happens for Neo, that Neo goes from being in this sort of cocooned and programmed world, to having to participate in the construction of meaning to his life. And we're like, "Well, can the audience go through the three movies and experience something similar to what the main character experiences?" So the first movie is sort of classical in its approach. The second movie is deconstructionist, and it assaults all of the things that you thought to be true in the first movie, and so people get very upset, and they're like "Stop attacking me!" in the same way that people get upset with deconstructionist philosophy. I mean, Derrida and Foucault, these people upset us. And then the third movie is the most ambiguous, because it asks you to actually participate in the construction of meaning...}}

===''The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'' (2013)===
In ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'', when [[Ben Stiller]]'s character lands at [[Nuuk]] in Greenland, he asks the man in the airport booth: "Do you have any cars available?"

==Analysis==
An essay written by [[Russell Blackford]] discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first ''Matrix'' film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to "shove the red pill right up [his] ass." When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, "Ignorance is bliss." Blackford argues that the ''Matrix'' films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer [[James Patrick Kelly]] feel that ''The Matrix'' stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vX7HCkNTv0wC&amp;pg=PA169|title=Jacking in to the Matrix franchise: cultural reception and interpretation|isbn=978-0-8264-1588-2|author1=Kapell, Matthew|author2=Doty, William G|date=2004-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matrix Warrior: Being the One'' author [[Jason Horsley|Jake Horsley]] compared the red pill to [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as [[addiction|addictive]], calling ''The Matrix'' series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-FfxGSgdnsC&amp;pg=PA125|title=Matrix Warrior: Being the One|isbn=978-0-312-32264-9|author1=Horsley, Jake|date=2003-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Art of the Start]]'', author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gXlwJnnNoEC&amp;pg=PA92|title=The art of the start: the time-tested, battle-hardened guide for anyone starting anything|isbn=978-1-59184-056-5|author1=Kawasaki, Guy|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Blue Pill (software)|Blue Pill]] [[rootkit]] ("[[malware]]")—named in reference to the pill as are the Red Pill techniques used to combat it—is a special type of software that utilizes the virtualization techniques of modern [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) to execute as a [[hypervisor]]; as a virtual platform on which the entire operating system runs, it is capable of examining the entire state of the machine and to cause any behavior with full privilege, while the operating system "believes" itself to be running directly on physical hardware, creating a parallel to the illusory Matrix. Blue Pill describes the concept of infecting a machine while Red Pill techniques help the operating system to detect the presence of such a hypervisor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joanna Rutkowska]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070911024318/http://invisiblethings.org/papers/redpill.html "Red Pill... or how to detect VMM using (almost) one CPU instruction"] (archive), Invisible Things Lab&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts were described by [[Joanna Rutkowska]] in 2006.
* In cybersecurity, a red pill is any means of detecting [[hooking]] or [[virtualization]]. It is frequently used by [[anti-cheat]], [[antirootkit]] software, [[malware]], and [[digital rights management]], etc. Red pills usually make use of [[real-time clock]]s to measure the time it takes for [[Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements#Virtualization theorems|critical operations]] and interactions with peripheral hardware to occur, and compare the length of them with the expected length of such operations as they occur without virtualization. If the clock is compromised, the hypervisor can hide its presence by slowing the clock down in a controlled way, to hide the extra time imposed by virtualization. 
* Until they were removed from the [[Maemo]] operating system application installer in January 2010, certain advanced features were unlocked by a "Red Pill Mode" [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] to prevent accidental use by novice users but make them readily available to experienced users. This was activated by starting to add a catalog whose URL was "matrix" and then choosing to cancel. A dialog box would appear asking "Which pill?" with the choices "Red" or "Blue", allowing the user to enter red pill mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.maemo.org/index.php?title=Red_Pill_mode&amp;oldid=26816|title=Red Pill mode|work=maemo.org wiki|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mxr.maemo.org/fremantle/source/hildon-application-manager/src/repo.cc#153|title=src/repo.cc|work=hildon-application-manager|at=Line 153|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Red Pill" mode, the installer allows the user to view and reconfigure system packages whose existence it normally does not acknowledge. In Blue Pill mode the installer displays only software installed by a user, creating the illusion that system software does not exist on the system.
* The choice between taking a blue or red pill is a central metaphor in the 2011 [[Arte]] documentary film ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'', in which philosophers including [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Nina Power]] explore solutions to the global [[Great Recession|economic and financial crisis of 2008–09]]. The film also contains an animated parody of the red/blue pill scene in ''The Matrix'', with [[Leon Trotsky]] as Morpheus and [[Karl Marx]] as Neo.&lt;ref name="Marx Reloaded"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybvsZ7YjBL0 | title=Marx Reloaded trailer  | accessdate=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revisionist school of Islamic studies''', (also '''Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies''') is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a [[paradigm shift]] in Islamic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, edited by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main thesis and the concept of Revisionism ==

The core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since [[Ignác Goldziher]]'s time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about [[Islam]]'s early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to [[Muhammad]]'s biography, the formation history of the [[Quran]], and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the [[historical criticism|historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''Revisionism'' was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/judith-herrin/patricia-crone-brief-memoir Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar], openDemocracy 12 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Today, also the adherents of the new movement use ''Revisionism'' to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/42023/among-the-believers Among the Believers], Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The major representatives ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
The new movement originated at the [[SOAS, University of London]] by two publications of [[John Wansbrough]]: ''Quranic Studies'' (1977) and ''The Sectarian Milieu'' (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: [[Andrew Rippin]], [[Norman Calder]], [[G. R. Hawting]], [[Patricia Crone]] and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]. With their work ''Hagarism'' (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in ''[[Hagarism]]''. Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. [[Martin Hinds]], too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. [[Robert G. Hoyland]] is a student of Patricia Crone.

A second local focus of the new movement is at the [[Saarland University]] in [[Saarbrücken]], Germany ({{ill|Saarbrücker Schule|de}}). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by [[Günter Lüling]] und [[Gerd R. Puin|Gerd-Rüdiger Puin]]. Also in Saarbrücken, [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]] developed in the 2000s together with [[Volker Popp]], [[Christoph Luxenberg]] and [[Markus Groß]] a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.

Further representatives are: [[Hans Jansen]] from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. [[Yehuda D. Nevo]] published in 2003 his work ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. [[James A. Bellamy]] is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. [[Fred Donner]] published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.

[[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work ''[[In the Shadow of the Sword (book)|In the Shadow of the Sword]]'' (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.

[[Sven Kalisch]] is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in [[Münster]].

== The thesis of the incredibility of the traditional Islamic accounts ==
The arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. [[Hans Jansen]] in his work ''De Historische Mohammed''. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by [[Ibn Ishaq]] resp. [[Ibn Hisham]] which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.

Some examples:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jansen, ''De Historische Mohammed'', 2005/7&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although there were [[leap month]]s at the time of Muhammad which had to be intercalated frequently into the moon calendar and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq is in a leap month.
* The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later is not very credible.
* The depiction of a strong relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha is motivated politically resp. theologically: [[Aisha]] was the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]], who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, [[Ali]]. In order to legitimate this succession against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]], who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that the prophet consummated marriage with Aisha allegedly at an astonishingly early age. 
* The depiction of slaughtering the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qurayza]] is motivated politically resp. theologically: As the "[[Constitution of Medina|treaty of Medina]]" shows, the Jews were initially part of the [[Umma]] and were addressed as "believers"; cf. the research of Prof. [[Fred Donner]]. When Islam later separated from Judaism, [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished but not each single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the "treaty of Medina". Finally, such an mass slaughtering would not have gone unnoticed, even not in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews: Jews used to live in international trading networks, and Jews are known to write down their history. Most likely, the slaughtering of the Banu Quraiza never happened.
* The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to boldly exaggerate the capacities of the prophet. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad always kills more enemies than according to other traditions. Even the depiction of he prophet's male potency (who allegedly could satisfy all his wives in one night) is exaggerated in a questionable way. Of the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as an illiterate person. The [[revelation]] of the [[Quran]]ic text is all the more miraculous and the capacity of the prophet is all the more astonishing if Muhammad was an illiterate person.
* The account of [[Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State]] including the emperor of Byzantium, that they should convert to Islam, retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion.

Jansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.

In her work ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: ''""These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there ''was'' an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities."''&lt;ref name="crone-encounter"&gt;Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1987, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

== The new theses about the true beginnings of Islam ==
Starting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:

* The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later resp. were reworked later. In addition to that many small deviations came into the text as usual with ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.&lt;ref&gt;John Wansbrough: ''Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation'' (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd-Rüdiger Puin: ''Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San’a’'', in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur’an as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and meaning of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially with the question whether any and how many parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or, whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ in this question.&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing'' (1998), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Quran is not written in a "pure" Arabic yet the syriac Aramaic language seems to have a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: ''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran – A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, yet in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The "infidels" were no pagan polytheists yet monotheists who were considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Hawting: ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History'' (1999); Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit to Mecca. They rather point to  a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. to Petra in Jordania.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'' (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: ''Quranic Geography'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The connection of Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Also Jews were called "believers" and were part of the umma. Antisemitic texts as e.g. the slaughtering of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam separated from Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: ''Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam'' (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: ''God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Islamic expansion probably was no Islamic, religiously motivated expansion, yet a secular, Arabic expansion. The expansion did not yet result in an oppression of the non-Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Hoyland: ''In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
* After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape:
** Under the Umayyad caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word "Islam" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply "believers", and coins ware minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: ''Hagarism'' (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: ''Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State'' (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): ''Der frühe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgenössischer Quellen'' (2007) pp. 336 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest to legitimize their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Crone: ''Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity'' (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: ''Mohammed'' (2005/7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of Revisionism ==

The consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book ''Hagarism'' (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.
&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ ''What is the Koran?''], in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism is expressed by researchers like [[Tilman Nagel]], who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/sachbuch/islamwissenschaft-befreit-den-propheten-aus-seiner-religioesen-umklammerung-1464313.html Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religiösen Umklammerung!] in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to "revisionism" alone but to "extreme revisionism" or "ultra-revisionism".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: [https://books.google.de/books?id=xI_7uosa4FMC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=EMLqEHO3nI&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity] (2012), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gregor Schoeler]] discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: "To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'."&lt;ref&gt;Gregor Schoeler, ''Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen Überlieferung über das Leben Mohammeds'', de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: "dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/rezensionen/rezension-tilman-nagel-eine-sackgasse-ohlig/ Review of: Mohammed. Leben und Legende, by Tilman Nagel], in:  imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in his famous work [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.

Continuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. François de Blois, [https://books.google.de/books?id=GcgCErhKGrAC&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615], in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam ==
{{POV check|section|date=October 2016}}
The [[relationship between religion and science]] had always been shaped by conflicts...{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself;{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious [[reform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison (ed.): The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion (2010) pp. 292 f. - Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;

By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/wissenschaftliches-arbeiten-in-der-islamwissenschaft/ Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft], in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad.{{Attribution needed|date=October 2016}} According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):
* As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[Patricia Crone]], [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], [[Fred Donner]], [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]], [[Günter Lüling]].
* As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: [[John Wansbrough]], [[Hans Jansen]], [[Karl-Heinz Ohlig]], [[Yehuda D. Nevo]].

Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:&lt;ref&gt;Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: [http://inarah.de/bereits-veroeffentlichte-artikel/islam-und-islamismus-zur-gegenwaertigen-diskussion/ Islam und Islamismus], in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet ''not'' from the beginning - are not true.
* The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged.
* Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words.
* Muhammad did not live in Mecca.
* The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been.

==Revisionism by non-specialists==
[[Ibn Warraq]], an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, ''[[The Quest for the Historical Muhammad (Ibn Warraq)|The Quest for the Historical Muhammad]].'' [[Fred Donner]], reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a "one-sided selection" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is "a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader."&lt;ref&gt;Fred Donner: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-middle-east-studies/article/the-quest-for-the-historical-muhammad-edited-and-translated-by-warraqibn-554-pages-glossary-list-of-tribes-and-individuals-chronology-amherst-ny-prometheus-books-2000-3495-cloth-isbn-1-57392-787-2/4C3D7FD138EF645D933ADDB0BCB33D6B Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq],  Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]], in this book ''Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,'' advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the [[Abbasids]] to justify the empire.

Plotted lines are: ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(red), ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' (green), ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log(''x'')&amp;nbsp;(blue).]]
In [[science]] and [[engineering]], a '''semi-log graph''' or '''semi-log plot''' is a way of visualizing data that are related according to an [[exponential curve|exponential]] relationship. One axis is plotted on a [[logarithmic scale]]. 

This kind of plotting method is useful when one of the [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s being plotted covers a large range of values and the other has only a restricted range – the advantage being that it can bring out features in the data that would not easily be seen if both variables had been plotted linearly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Exponential-logarithmic-functions/7_Graphs-log-semilog.php M. Bourne ''Graphs on Logarithmic and Semi-Logarithmic Paper'' (www.intmath.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

All equations of the form &lt;math&gt;y=\lambda a^{\gamma x}&lt;/math&gt; form straight lines when plotted semi-logarithmically, since taking logs of both sides gives

:&lt;math&gt;\log_a y = \gamma x + \log_a \lambda. &lt;/math&gt;

This can easily be seen as a line in slope-intercept form with &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; as the slope and &lt;math&gt;\log_a \lambda&lt;/math&gt; as the vertical intercept.  To facilitate use with logarithmic tables, one usually takes logs to base 10 or e, or sometimes base 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\log (y) = (\gamma \log (a)) x + \log (\lambda).&lt;/math&gt;

The term '''log-lin''' is used to describe a semi-log plot with a logarithmic scale on the ''y''-axis, and a [[linear]] scale on the ''x''-axis.  Likewise, a '''lin-log''' plot uses a logarithmic scale on the ''x''-axis, and a [[linear]] scale on the ''y''-axis. Note that the naming is ''output-input'' (''y''-''x''), the opposite order from (''x'', ''y'').

On a semi-log plot the spacing of the scale on the ''y''-axis (or ''x''-axis) is proportional to the logarithm of the number, not the number itself. It is equivalent to converting the ''y'' values (or ''x'' values) to their log, and plotting the data on lin-lin scales. A [[log-log plot]] uses the logarithmic scale for both axes, and hence is not a semi-log plot.

==Equations==
The equation for a line with an [[ordinate]] axis logarithmically scaled would be:

:&lt;math&gt; \log_{10}(F(x)) = mx + b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = 10^{mx + b} = (10^{mx})(10^b). &lt;/math&gt;

The equation of a line on a plot where the [[abscissa]] axis is scaled logarithmically would be

:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = m \log_{10}(x) + b. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Real-world examples==
===Phase diagram of water===
In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], a plot of logarithm of pressure against temperature can be used to illustrate the various [[phase_(matter)#Number_of_phases|phases]] of a substance, as in the following for [[water]]:
[[Image:Phase_diagram_of_water.svg|thumb|none|500px|Log-lin pressure–temperature [[phase diagram]] of water. The [[Roman numeral]]s indicate various [[Ice#Phases|ice phases]].]]

===2009 "swine flu" progression===
While ten is the most common [[base (exponentiation)|base]], there are times when other bases are more appropriate, as in this example:

[[File:Influenza-2009-cases-logarithmic.png|thumb|none|500px|A semi-logarithmic plot of cases and deaths in the [[2009 outbreak of influenza A (H1N1)]].  Notice that while the horizontal (time) axis is linear, with the dates evenly spaced, the vertical (cases) axis is logarithmic, with the evenly spaced divisions being labelled with successive powers of two.]]

===Microbial growth===
In [[biology]] and [[biological engineering]], the change in numbers of [[microbes]] due to [[asexual reproduction]] and nutrient exhaustion is commonly illustrated by a semi-log plot. Time is usually the independent axis, with the logarithm of the number or mass of [[bacteria]] or other microbe as the dependent variable. This forms a plot with four distinct phases, as shown below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1606">:''This article is about the set theory. If you are looking for the way of splitting sets, see [[Semialgebraic set]].''

In [[set theory]], a '''semiset''' is a [[class (set theory)|proper class]] that is contained in a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].
The theory of semisets was proposed and developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[mathematician]]s [[Petr Vopěnka]] and [[Petr Hájek]] (1972). It is based on a modification of the [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]; in standard NBG, the existence of semisets is precluded by the [[axiom of separation]].

The concept of semisets opens the way for a formulation of an [[alternative set theory]].
In particular, Vopěnka's [[Alternative Set Theory]] (1979) axiomatizes the concept of semiset, supplemented with several additional principles.

Semisets can be used to represent sets with imprecise boundaries. Novák (1984) studied approximation of semisets by [[fuzzy set]]s, which are often more suitable for practical applications of the modeling of imprecision.

'''Simplexity''' is an emerging theory that proposes a possible complementary relationship between [[complexity]] and [[simplicity]]. The term draws from [[General Systems Theory]], [[Dialectics]] (philosophy) and [[Design]]. Jeffrey Kluger wrote a book about this phenomenon that describes how house plants can be more complicated than industrial plants, how a truck driver's job can be as difficult as a CEO's and why 90% of the money donated to help cure diseases are given only to the research of 10% of them (and vice versa).

The term has been adopted in [[advertising]], [[marketing]] and other industries.

== Design aspects ==
* Complexity tends to rise as system elements specialize and diversify to solve specific challenges.
* Simple interfaces tend to improve the usability of complex systems.

== History of the term ==
Like most terms, it has been shaped through dialogues and discussion. Several individuals have participated in the development of the meaning of this term in both formal and informal venues. Most notable is Anuraj Gambhir who is attributed with the creation and popularisation of this term through various presentations and conferences around the world.

=== Education ===

One of the first formally published instances of the word was in the journal 'Childhood Education' (1924), in the article it appears to be used to discuss education and psychology related issues.&lt;ref name="unknown"&gt;(Unknown).  [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0U0D8M_nRfBL9oKrN_&amp;id=d5vHZ2xXBa0C&amp;q=simplexity&amp;dq=simplexity&amp;pgis=1 Childhood Education] Published 1924. Association for Childhood Education International.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In science ===

[[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and  [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] authors of the book ''[[The Collapse of Chaos]]'' (1995), a non-fiction book that attempts to explain [[chaos theory]] and [[complex systems]] to the general public.

The [[analysis of algorithms|complexity of algorithms and of mathematical problems]] is one of the central subjects of [[theoretical computer science]].  Simplexity was whimsically defined by computer scientists [[Andrei Broder|Broder]] and [[Jorge Stolfi|Stolfi]] as a concept worthy of as much attention as complexity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P .  An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-cast inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P"&lt;ref name="Broder"&gt;Broder, Andrei and Jorge Stolfi. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=990536 "Pessimal Algorithms and Simplexity Analysis."]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of Simplexity was amplified in the mid 1970s by Bruce Schiff (self-described theorist) and restated as "The process by which nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. The result of a simple random act can only be predicted by complicated means. The spatial placement of each atom in a transplanted plant root ball is difficult to predict, but, the plant will adapt its root ball to the hole, and continue to thrive. This conceptual expression harkens back to original statements of Newton, "Nature is pleased with simplicity", Dalton, "rule of greatest simplicity," and Einstein, "Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas."

In 1974 [[Rustum Roy]] and Olaf Müller noted simplexity in the structure of [[ternary compound]]s:
:By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's 'simplexity'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rustum Roy]] &amp; Olaf Müller (1974) ''The Major Ternary Structural Families'', pages 3 &amp; 4,Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|9780387064307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, simplexity has been defined by Philippe Compain in the context of an article on the future of synthetic chemistry as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Simplexity may be defined as the combination of simplicity and complexity within the context of a dynamic relationship between means and ends.";&lt;ref name="Compain"&gt;[http://www.lactualitechimique.org/spip.php?numero_article437 Philippe Compain "The challenge of simplexity. The simple and the complex in organic synthesis" Act. Chim., 2003, 263-264, pages 129-134.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pCompain"&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2006/nj/b601837h#!divAbstract Philippe Compain et al. "Looking forward: a glance into the future of organic chemistry" New J. Chem., 2006, 30, pages 823-831.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The quest for simplicity constitutes indeed the basis for all future challenges of [[chemical synthesis]] including diversity, selectivity and [[green chemistry]]. Due to the almost infinity of molecules that could in theory be synthesized,&lt;ref name="Lipinski"&gt;A. Lipinski, F. Lombardo, B. W. Dominy, P. J. Feeney, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001,46,3.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus of synthetic research has been shifted gradually from target-oriented synthesis to  diversity-oriented synthesis ([[divergent synthesis]]). A scientific approach based on the power of the molecular construction game and guided by an ideal for simplicity, has a high potential for discovery. The creative combination of synthetic methodologies, mixing simplicity and maximization of structural complexity, is indeed expected to be a powerful tool to produce unprecedented molecular structures with beneficial properties for mankind.

=== Interdisciplinary ===

Simplexity became the topic of formal discussion at the Hamburg Trend Day in Germany.  Among the formal contributors were [[Peter Wippermann]], Dr. [[Norbert Bolz]], [[David Bosshart]], Designer [[Ora Ito]], [[Markus Shepherd]], [[Susane Tide Frater]].

''Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple)'' by [[Jeffrey Kluger]] details many ways in which simplexity theory can be applied to multiple disciplines.  Kluger offers a look at simplexity at work in economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine, and dozens of human behaviors.  ''Simplexity'' also provides insight into how readers can improve their lives by understanding the interplay of complexity and simplicity.

=== Finance ===
Simplexity has been used by [[Jens Nordvig]] to describe the particular aim of his analytics firm Exante Data.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Maybe the best word for what we are trying to achieve is ''simplexity''. A research product that draws on a very complex analytical foundation, but is presented in a very simple and easy to digest manner. ... This concept of ''simplexity'' may be important in a much broader sense. The general idea of simplexity could be key to effectively service a growing community of so-called “quantmental” fund managers that use large amounts of data and modeling in their processes, while still applying a human touch in the final investment decisions. We think ''simplexity'' will be increasingly important to how we develop our overall research at Exante."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://exantedata.com/news/letter-simplexity-in-research|title=Letter: Simplexity in Research|last=|first=|date=|work=exante data|access-date=2018-05-03|publisher=Exante Data|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Social aspects ==
Professor [[Peter Wipperman]] proposed a social definition &lt;blockquote&gt;"We long for simplicity and satisfaction.  Simplexity therefore stands for a balance between the growing complexity of daily life and our own personal satisfaction.  In order to attain this state, we have to stop always striving to make optimal decisions.  In the future, it will be more important to make judgments that are just good enough."&lt;ref name="Wipperman"&gt;Wipperman, Peter. (year unknown).

Dan Geesin first used the term 'Simplexity' in his essay 'The melancholy of the set square', 2002, when describing how technology creates more distance through complex interfaces whilst performing a simple task. For example, getting money from a bank machine. He describes how in between the chain of interfaces there is more room for error. More interfaces, more potential problems.

{{Expert needed|computer science|date=July 2009}}

In [[computer science]], '''soft computing''' (sometimes referred to as [[computational intelligence]], though CI does not have an agreed definition) is the use of inexact solutions to computationally hard tasks such as the solution of [[NP-complete]] problems, for which there is no known algorithm that can compute an exact solution in [[polynomial time]]. Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and [[approximation]]. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the [[human]] [[mind]].

The principal constituents of Soft Computing (SC) are [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy Logic]] (FL), [[Evolutionary computation|Evolutionary Computation]] (EC), [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] (ML) and [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic Reasoning]] (PR), with the latter subsuming [[Bayesian network|belief networks]] and parts of learning theory.

==Introduction==
Soft Computing became a formal area of study in Computer Science in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, Lotfi A., "Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Soft Computing,"  Communications of the ACM, March 1994, Vol. 37 No. 3, pages 77-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple systems. More complex systems arising in [[biology]], [[medicine]], the [[humanities]], [[management science]]s, and similar fields often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and analytical methods.  However, it should be pointed out that complexity of systems is relative and that many conventional mathematical models have been very productive in spite of their complexity.

Soft computing deals with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve computability, robustness and low solution cost. As such it forms the basis of a considerable amount of [[machine learning]] techniques. Recent trends tend to involve evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algorithms and bio-inspired computation.&lt;ref&gt;X. S. Yang, Z. H. Cui, R. Xiao, A. Gandomi, M. Karamanoglu, Swarm Intelligence and Bio-Inspired Computation: Theory and Applications, Elsevier, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Chaturvedi, "Soft Computing: Techniques and Its Applications in Electrical Engineering", Springer, (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Components of soft computing include:
*[[Machine learning]], including:
** [[Neural network]]s (NN)
*** [[Perceptron]]
** [[Support Vector Machine]]s (SVM)
* [[Fuzzy logic]] (FL)
* [[Evolutionary computation]] (EC), including:
** [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s
*** [[Genetic algorithm]]s
*** [[Differential evolution]]
** [[Metaheuristic]] and [[Swarm Intelligence]]
*** [[Ant colony optimization]]
*** [[Particle swarm optimization]]
* Ideas about [[probability]] including:
** [[Bayesian network]]

Generally speaking, soft computing techniques resemble biological processes more closely than traditional techniques, which are largely based on formal [[logical system]]s, such as [[sentential logic]] and [[predicate logic]], or rely heavily on computer-aided numerical analysis (as in [[finite element analysis]]). Soft computing techniques are intended to complement each other.

Unlike hard computing schemes, which strive for exactness and full truth, soft computing techniques exploit the given tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, and uncertainty for a particular problem. Another common contrast comes from the observation that [[inductive reasoning]] plays a larger role in soft computing than in hard computing.

{{Buddhism}}
In [[Buddhism]], a '''sotāpanna''' ([[Pali]]), '''srotāpanna''' ([[Sanskrit]]; {{zh|p=rùliú|t=入流}}, [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]]: རྒྱུན་ཞུགས་, [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''rgyun zhugs''&lt;ref&gt;Meditative States in Tibetan Buddhism By Lati Rinpoche, Denma Locho Rinpoche, Leah Zahler, Jeffrey Hopkins. pg 63&lt;/ref&gt;), "stream-winner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#sotapanna|title=A Glossary of Pali and Buddhist Terms|publisher=[[Access to Insight]]|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "stream-entrant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=David|title=Definition of a Buddhist|url=http://www.thedhamma.com/definition.htm|website=The Dhamma}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who has seen the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and consequently, has dropped the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetters]] (''saŋyojana'') that bind a being to rebirth, namely self-view (''sakkāya-ditthi''), clinging to rites and rituals (''sīlabbata-parāmāsa''), and skeptical indecision ([[Vicikitsa]]).

The word ''sotāpanna'' literally means "one who entered (''āpanna'') the stream (''sota'')", after a metaphor which calls the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]] a stream which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbāna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Intro the Stream: A Study Guide on the First Stage of Awakening|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/into_the_stream.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — is the stream."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entering the stream (''sotāpatti'') is the first of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhikkhu|title=A Swift Pair of Messengers|url=http://santipada.org/aswiftpairofmessengers/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_Swift_Pair_of_Messengers_Bhikkhu_Sujato.html|website=Santipada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attainment==

The first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (''sotāpatti-magga''), which cuts through the first three fetters. The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (''sotāpanna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title= The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sotāpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Even these great sal trees,43 Mahanama, if they could understand what is well spoken and what is ill spoken, I would declare them to be streamwinners, no longer bound to the lower world, of fixed destiny, sure of awakening!}}&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|wisdom]] being called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right view|right view]] (''sammā diṭṭhi'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Maha-cattarisaka Sutta: The Great Forty|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.117.than.html|website=Access to Insight|quote="And what is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, the path factor of right view[1] in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has unshakable confidence in the [[Buddha]], [[Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, sometimes taken to be the [[Three Jewels|triple refuge]], are at other times listed as being objects of recollection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=(Agata,phala) Mahanama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/15.3-Agataphala-Mahanama-S-a6.10-piya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general though, confirmed confidence in the ''Buddha''', ''Dharma'' and ''Sangha'', respectively, is considered to be one of the four limbs of stream-winning (''sotāpannassa angāni'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nandiya Sutta: To Nandiya|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn55/sn55.040.than.html|quote=There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma...Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha...|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Sotapannassa angani|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapannassa_angani|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna is said to have "opened the eye of the Dhamma" (''dhammacakka''), because they have realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Upatissa-pasine: Upatissa's (Sariputta's) Question|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/mv/mv.01.23.01-10.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this Dhamma exposition, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their conviction in the true dharma would be unshakable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Sarakani Sutta 1|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/3.6-Sarakani-S-1-s55.24-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=11 The 4 qualities of a streamwinner: (1) unshakable faith in the Buddha, (2) in the Dharma, and (3) in the Sangha; and (4) moral virtue dear to the saints.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have had their first glimpse of the unconditioned element, the ''asankhata'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyanatiloka|first1=Maha Thera|title=Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Asankhata|website=Dhamma Wiki|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they see the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|goal]], in the moment of the fruition of their path (magga-phala). Whereas the stream-entrant has seen nibbāna and, thus has verified confidence in it, the [[Arhat|arahant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Sekha Sutta: The Learner|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn48/sn48.053.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can drink fully of its waters, so to speak, to use a simile from the Kosambi Sutta (SN 12.68) — of a "well", encountered along a desert road.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Kosambi Sutta: At Kosambi (On Knowing Dependent Co-arising)|url="My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended. [2] It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted, dehydrated, &amp; thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with his body. [3] In the same way, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended."|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sotapanna "may state this about himself: 'Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry shades is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening!'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Vera Sutta: Animosity|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.092.than.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the remaining three paths, namely: once-return (sakadāgāmin), non-return (anāgāmin), and sainthood (arahatta) become 'destined' (''sammatta niyāma'') for the stream-entrant.  Their enlightenment as a disciple (''ariya-sāvaka'') becomes inevitable within seven lives transmigrating among gods and humans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thera|first1=Piyadassi|title=Ratana Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.01.piya.html|website=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Velama Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/16.6-Velama-S-a9.20-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|quote=Furthermore, Sariputta, here a certain person fulfills moral virtue, but gains only limited concentration, gains only limited wisdom.20 With the total destruction of the three fetters, he is a seven-at-most,21 having re-arisen and wandered amongst gods and humans for seven lives at the most, makes an end of suffering.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; if they are diligent (''appamatta'', ''appamāda'') in the practice of the Teacher's (''satthāra'') message, they may fully awaken within their present life. They have very little future suffering to undergo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Nakhasikha Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn13/sn13.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pāli Canon|early Buddhist texts]] (e.g. the Ratana Sutta) say that a stream-entrant will no longer be born in the animal womb, or hell realms; nor as a hungry ghost. The pathways to unfortunate rebirth destinations (''duggati'') have been closed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro|title=Cakkhu Sutta|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn25/sn25.001.than.html|website=Access to Insight|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three fetters===
In the [[Pali Canon]], the qualities of a sotāpanna are described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html|title=Alagaddupama Sutta|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|…those monks who have abandoned the three fetters, are all stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening. This is how the Dharma well-proclaimed by me is clear, open, evident, stripped of rags.|Alagaddupama Sutta}}

The three fetters which the sotāpanna eradicates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/stream2.html|title=Stream Entry|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title=The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Thanissaro Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Self-view''' — The view of substance, or that what is compounded (''sankhata'') could be eternal in the [[Skandha#The five skandhas|five aggregates]] (form, feelings, perception, intentions, cognizance), and thus possessed or owned as [[Ātman (Buddhism)|'I']], 'me', or 'mine'. A sotāpanna doesn't actually have a view about self (''sakkāya-ditthi''), as that doctrine is proclaimed to be a subtle form of clinging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.011.ntbb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Clinging to rites and rituals''' - Eradication of the view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals (animal sacrifices, [[Ritual purification|ablutions]], chanting, etc.) or adhering to rigid [[moralism]] or relying on a god for non-causal delivery (''issara nimmāna''). Rites and rituals now function more to obscure, than to support the right view of the sotāpanna's now opened dharma eye. The sotāpanna realizes that deliverance can be won only through the practice of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. It is the elimination of the notion that there are shortcuts to perfecting all virtues.
# '''Skeptical doubt''' - Doubt about the Buddha, his teaching (Dharma), and his community (Sangha) is eradicated because the sotāpanna personally experiences the true nature of reality through insight, and this insight confirms the accuracy of the Buddha’s teaching. Seeing removes doubt, because the sight is a form of vision (''dassana''), that allows one to know (''ñāṇa'').

===Defilements===
According to the Pali Commentary, six types of defilement would be eventually abandoned by a sotāpanna, and no major transgressions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel061.html|title=The Simile of the Cloth &amp; The Discourse on Effacement|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Nyanaponika Thera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Envy
#Jealousy
#Hypocrisy
#Fraud
#Denigration
#Domineering

===Rebirth===
A sotāpanna will be safe from falling into the states of misery (they will not be born as an animal, [[ghost]], or hell being). Their lust, hatred and delusion will not be strong enough to cause rebirth in the lower realms. A sotāpanna will have to be reborn at most only seven more times in the human or heavenly worlds before attaining nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessary for a sotāpanna to be reborn seven more times before attaining nibbāna, as an ardent practitioner may progress to the higher stages in the same life in which he/she reaches the Sotāpanna level by making an aspiration and persistent effort to reach the final goal of nibbāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/gunaratana/wheel351.html|title=The Jhanas|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Henepola Gunaratana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Buddha, there are three types of sotapannas classifiable according to their possible rebirths:
(1) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters (personality-belief, skeptical doubt, attachment to rules and rituals;(samyojana), has entered the stream (to Nibbāna), he is no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is firmly established, destined to full enlightenment. After having passed amongst the heavenly and human beings only seven times more through the round of rebirths, he puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one with 7 births at the utmost' (sattakkhattu-parama).
(2) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having passed among noble families two or three times through the round of rebirths, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one passing from one noble family to another' (kolankola).
(3) "If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having only once more returned to human existence, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one germinating only once more' (eka-bījī).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sotapanna|url=http://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=Sotapanna|website=Dhamma Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Six actions that are not committed===
A sotāpanna will not commit six wrong actions:

#Murdering one's own mother.
#Murdering one's own father.
#Murdering an [[Arahant (Buddhism)|arahant]].
#Maliciously injuring the Buddha to the point of drawing blood.
#Deliberately creating a schism in the monastic community.
#Taking another Teacher [besides Buddha].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Piya|title=Bahu Dhatuka Sutta|url=http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/29.1a-Bahudhatuka-S-m115-piya.pdf|website=The Dharmafarers|accessdate=25 June 2015|quote=(4) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would deprive his mother of life—this is not possible.41 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his mother of life—this is possible. (5) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that [65] an individual attained to right view, would deprive his father of life—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would deprive his father of life—this is possible.

(7) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would draw the Tathagata’s blood—this is possible. (8) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would divide the monastic order [the Sangha]—this is not possible. And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would divide the monastic order—this is possible. (9) He understands that it is impossible, there is no chance, that an individual attained to right view, would proclaim another Teacher—this is not possible.42 And he understands that it is possible, there is the chance, that an ordinary worldling, would declare another Teacher—this is possible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suttas===
The Buddha spoke favorably about the sotapanna on many occasions, and even though it is (only) the first of ''ariya sangha'' members, he or she is welcomed by all other sangha-members for he or she practices for the benefit and welfare of many. In the literature, the ''arya sangha'' is described as "the four" when taken as pairs, and as "the eight" when taken as individual types. This refers to the four supra-mundane fruits (attainments: "phala") and the corresponding four supra-mundane paths (of those practicing to attain those fruits: "magga").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html|title=Sangha|accessdate=2010-08-22|publisher=Access to Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|"The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types [of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world."|[[Anguttara Nikaya]], 11.12}}

This is called "the recollection of the Sangha" (''sanghanussati''). It can also be interpreted as, "They are the Blessed One's disciples, who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced insight-fully, those who practice with integrity (to share what they have learned with others). They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world because gifts to them bear great fruit and benefit to the giver.
The fifty-fifth Samyutta of the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] is called the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta, and concerns sotapannas and their attainment. In the discourse-numbers (of that chapter) 1-4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-20, 22-36, 39-49, 51, 53, 54, sotapannas are praised as Sangha members by and to: the sick, lay followers, people on their deathbed, bhikkhunis, bhikkhus, and devas, and end up becoming the well-being and benefit of many.

===Dhammapada===
From '''[[Dhammapada]]''' verse 178:

:'''Sole dominion over the earth,'''
:'''going to heaven,'''
:'''lordship over all worlds:'''
:'''the fruit of stream-entry'''
:'''excels them.'''

According to Mahāyāna Master [[Bhikshu]] [[Hsuan Hua]]'s Commentary on the [[Diamond Sutra|Vajra Sutra]], 
{{quote|A Shrotaapanna is a first stage [[Arhat]]. Certification to the first fruit of Arhatship, which is within the [[Hinayana|Small Vehicle]], comes when the eighty-eight categories of view delusions are smashed." p. 77 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/%7Erone/Buddhism/BTTStexts/ps.vajra.02.020503.screen.pdf|title=The Vajra Prajna Paramita Sutra - A General Explanation|accessdate=2009-09-16|publisher=Buddhist Text Translation Society|last=Venerable Master Hsuan Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Venerable Hsuan Hua continues, 
{{quote|The first fruit is that of Srotāpanna, a Sanskrit word which means "One Who Has Entered the Flow."

'''Stochastic terrorism''' is an "obscure and non-legal"&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"/&gt; term describing speech that can be expected to incite terrorism as an act of stochastic terrorism, with the word "stochastic" describing the random nature of the targets.&lt;ref name=Hamm2017/&gt;  The "stochastic terrorist" does not direct the actions of members of a group, rather, he is an ideologue speaking over mass media to individuals with who he is not affiliated as part of any form of organization.&lt;ref name=Hamm2017/&gt;  Instead, he depends on "the use of mass media to provoke random acts of ideologically motivated violence that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable".&lt;ref name=Hamm2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hamm |first1=Mark S. |last2=Spaaij |first2=Ramón |date=2017 |title=The Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-54377-4 |lccn=2016050672 |pages=84-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an anonymous blogger posting on the [[Daily Kos]], the speaker, whether intentionally or not, [[Incitement|incites]] those with a combination of personality traits that leads them to violence. Since the speaker only focuses animus towards the victim instead of directly participating, they may escape culpability and the perpetrator may be labeled a [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf]] by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=dailykos&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2011/1/10/934890/-Stochastic-Terrorism:-Triggering-the-shooters|title=Stochastic Terrorism:  Triggering the shooters.|work=Daily Kos|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2017}} The term has mostly been applied to domestic American incidents of violence.&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"/&gt;

In their 2017 book, [[Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism]],&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; criminologist Mark S. Hamm and sociologist Ramón Spaaij discuss stochastic terrorism as a form of "indirect enabling" of terrorists. They write that "stochastic terrorism is the method of international recruitment used by [[ISIS]]", and they refer to [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and [[Alex_Jones_(radio_host)|Alex Jones]] as stochastic terrorists.&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;{{rp|157}} They note that:&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt;

{{quote|What often matters most in stochastic terrorism is the emotional intensity of the messaging and the way it is socially constructed or interpreted by the consumer, not the intentions of the messenger. In other words, the messenger does not have to actively promote violence for it to occur.}}

Hamm and Spaaij discuss two instances of violence that "shine a light on the phenomenon of stochastic terrorism in the post-9/11 era."&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; In the [[2010 Oakland freeway shootout]], Byron Williams was said to be en route to offices of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Tides (organization)|Tides Foundation]], planning to commit mass murder, "indirectly enabled by the conspiracy theories"&lt;ref name="Hamm2017"/&gt; of [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Alex Jones]]. As a left-wing example, they cite the [[Family_Research_Council#2012_shooting_incident|2012 shooting incident]] at the headquarters of the [[Family Research Council]]. Hamm and Spaaij say the shooter's  radicalization was indirectly enabled by his reading a report in an online magazine of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], which "featured a 'Hate Map' giving the exact location of FRC headquarters."

Note that the phrase "stochastic terrorism model" typically does not refer to this concept of stochastic terrorism as a form of incitement. That is, a stochastic terrorism model is usually a [[Stochastic process|stochastic]], that is, random, [[Mathematical model|model]] of terror attacks intended by the random nature of their timing and targets to excite a generalized fear.&lt;ref name=Woo2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woo |first1=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Quantitative terrorism risk assessment |journal=Journal of Risk Finance |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=7-14 |doi=10.1108/eb022949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage to describe incitement==
After the [[2011 Tucson shooting]], the [[Daily Kos]]' "diarist" (blogger) G2geek posted "Stochastic Terrorism: Triggering the shooters." While saying it wasn't immediately clear that the murderer [[Jared Lee Loughner]] was triggered, G2geek accused [[Osama Bin Laden]] and personalities such as [[Glenn Beck]], [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], and [[Sean Hannity]] of inciting perpetrators such as [[Jim David Adkisson]], [[Scott Roeder]], and [[Byron Williams (shooter)|Byron Williams]].&lt;ref name=dailykos /&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2017}} ''[[Rawstory]]'' said that the 2015 [[Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting]] was incited by far-right Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarico|first1=Valerie|title=Here's how far-right Christians incited stochastic terrorism at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/12/heres-how-far-right-christians-incited-stochastic-terrorism-at-a-colorado-springs-planned-parenthood/|website=Raw Story|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An op-ed in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' referred to then presidential-candidate [[Donald Trump]]'s comment during one of his 2016 campaign rallies as stochastic terrorism. Trump said of his opponent [[Hillary Clinton]]: "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] people, maybe there is. I don't know".&lt;ref name="rolling-stone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=David S.|title=Trump's Assassination Dog Whistle Was Even Scarier Than You Think|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/trumps-assassination-dog-whistle-was-scarier-than-you-think-w433615|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crockett|first1=Emily|title=Trump's 2nd Amendment comment wasn't a joke.

==Concerns about usage==
[[CNN]]'s legal analyst Danny Cevallos opinion piece said Trump's comment was likely protected speech, even against a presidential candidate, because it wasn't directed to inciting imminent unlawful action. And with respect to it being stochastic terrorism added, "It's scary, and probably true.... It's hard to predict or measure the effect with any certainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/10/opinions/trump-second-amendment-remarks-cevallos/index.html|title=Did Trump comments break the law?|last=Cevallos|first=Danny|work=CNN|access-date=2017-09-27|quote=Some legal scholars have observed that Trump has engaged in 'stochastic terrorism,' using language and other forms of communication 'to incite random actors to carry out violent or terrorist acts that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable.'&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase "Scripted Violence" has been used in social science since at least 2010. As Darrell Y. Hamamoto argues, the concept of "scripted violence" provides "a sorely-needed corrective to the under-theorization of race and racism in understanding acts of scripted violence within hyper-militarized society." Hamamoto also suggests that "serial killing and mass murder are examples of civilian "blowback" that originates with heightened US military adventurism in the postwar period.
&lt;ref name="Hamamoto-2002"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Empire of Death: Militarized Society and the Rise of Serial Killing and Mass Murder | author=Hamamoto, Darrell Y. | journal=New Political Science | year=2002 | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=105-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in a sentence==
A stochastic terrorist is a [[demagogue]] who uses the rhetoric of scripted violence (such as  [[demonization]] or [[scapegoating]]) to portray a target group as involved in a malevolent [[conspiracy]] to undermine the society or nation, and thus prompt most acts of [[stochastic terrorism]]. See, for example, the work on demonization and scapegoating of scholars [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Gordon Allport]].

A '''supertaster''' is a person who experiences the sense of [[taste]] with far greater intensity than average, with some studies showing an increased sensitivity to bitter tastes.  It may be a cause of [[Selective eating disorder|selective eating]], but selective eaters are not necessarily supertasters, and vice versa.

==History==

The term originates with experimental psychologist [[Linda Bartoshuk]] who has spent much of her career studying genetic variation in taste perception. In the early 1980s, Bartoshuk and her colleagues noticed some individuals tested in the laboratory seemed to have an elevated taste response and took to calling them supertasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|5536670}} |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=L. M. |year=1991 |title=Sweetness: history, preference, and genetic variability |journal=Food technology |issn=0015-6639 |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=108–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Origin of term 'Supertaster' |reason=Earlier references available. Editor referencing Bartoshuk seems biased for Bartoshuk. |date=August 2013}} This increased taste response is not the result of [[response bias]] or a scaling artifact, but appears to have an anatomical/biological basis.

===Phenylthiocarbamide===

In 1931, Arthur L. Fox, a [[DuPont]] chemist, discovered that some persons found [[phenylthiocarbamide]] (PTC) to be bitter while others found it tasteless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=AF |title=Six in ten 'tasteblind' to bitter chemical |journal=Sci News Lett |year=1931 |volume=9 |pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartoshuk 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/appe.1999.0287 |title=Psychophysical advances aid the study of genetic variation in taste |year=2000 |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=LM |journal=Appetite |volume=34 |pages=105 |pmid=10744897 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1931 meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Fox collaborated with Albert F. Blakeslee, a geneticist, to have attendees taste PTC: 65% found it bitter, 28% found it tasteless, and 6% described other taste qualities. Subsequent work revealed that the ability to taste PTC was genetic.

===Propylthiouracil===

In the 1960s, [[Roland L. Fischer|Roland Fischer]] was the first to link the ability to taste PTC, and the related{{clarify|date=October 2016}} compound [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP), to food preference and body type{{which|date=October 2016}}. Today, PROP has replaced PTC in taste research because{{clarify|date=October 2016}} of a faint sulfurous odor and safety concerns with PTC.&lt;ref name="TexleyKwan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juliana Texley|author2=Terry Kwan|author3=John Summers|title=Investigating Safely: A Guide for High School Teachers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYGmkmnPT8C&amp;pg=PT90|date=1 January 2004|publisher=NSTA Press|isbn=978-0-87355-202-8|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described above, Bartoshuk and colleagues discovered that the taster group could be further divided into medium tasters and supertasters. Most estimates suggest 25% of the population are nontasters{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, 50% are medium tasters, and 25% are supertasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|title=Why taste is all in the senses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20640337|newspaper=BBC News Health|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==

The cause of this heightened response is unknown, although it is thought to be related to the presence of the TAS2R38 gene, the ability to taste PROP and PTC, and, at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90361-1 |title=PTC/PROP tasting: Anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects |year=1994 |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=Linda M. |last2=Duffy |first2=Valerie B. |last3=Miller |first3=Inglis J. |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1165–71 |pmid=7878086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any evolutionary advantage to supertasting is unclear. In some environments, heightened taste response, particularly to bitterness, would represent an important advantage in avoiding potentially toxic plant alkaloids. In other environments, increased response to bitterness may have limited the range of palatable foods.

===TAS2R38===

The bitter-taste-receptor gene [[TAS2R38]] has been associated with the ability to taste PROP&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000145789.55183.D4 |title=Bitter Receptor Gene (TAS2R38), 6-n-Propylthiouracil (PROP) Bitterness and Alcohol Intake |year=2004 |last1=Duffy |first1=Valerie B. |last2=Davidson |first2=Andrew C. |last3=Kidd |first3=Judith R. |last4=Kidd |first4=Kenneth K. |last5=Speed |first5=William C. |last6=Pakstis |first6=Andrew J. |last7=Reed |first7=Danielle R. |last8=Snyder |first8=Derek J. |last9=Bartoshuk |first9=Linda M. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=1629–37 |pmid=15547448 |pmc=1397913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and PTC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.047 |title=The Molecular Basis of Individual Differences in Phenylthiocarbamide and Propylthiouracil Bitterness Perception |year=2005 |last1=Bufe |first1=Bernd |last2=Breslin |first2=Paul A.S. |last3=Kuhn |first3=Christina |last4=Reed |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Tharp |first5=Christopher D. |last6=Slack |first6=Jay P. |last7=Kim |first7=Un-Kyung |last8=Drayna |first8=Dennis |last9=Meyerhof |first9=Wolfgang |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=322–7 |pmid=15723792 |pmc=1400547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot completely explain supertasting.&lt;ref name="pmid18209019"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjm084 |title=Supertasting and PROP Bitterness Depends on More Than the TAS2R38 Gene |year=2008 |last1=Hayes |first1=J.

==Prevalence==

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}
Women are more likely to be supertasters, as are those from Asia, South America, and Africa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/articles/senses/supertaster.shtml Science of supertasters] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
[[File:Blue tongue.jpg|thumb|150px|Tongue's fungiform papillae revealed with blue food dye.]]
Supertasters were initially identified on the basis of the perceived intensity of [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) compared to a reference salt solution. However, because supertasters have a larger sense of taste than medium or nontasters, this can cause [[Image scaling|scaling artifacts]].&lt;ref name="Bartoshuk 2000"/&gt; Subsequently, salt has been replaced with a non-oral auditory standard. That is, if two individuals rate the same physical stimulus at a comparable perceptual intensity, but one gives a rating twice as large for the bitterness of a PROP solution, the experimenter can be confident the difference is real and not merely the result of how the person is using the scale.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Today, there is a phenylalanine test strip.

'''Trialism''' in [[philosophy]] was introduced by [[John Cottingham]] as an alternative interpretation of the [[mind–body dualism]] of Rene [[Descartes]].  Trialism keeps the two substances of mind and body, but introduces a third attribute, sensation, belonging to the union of mind and body.  This allows animals, which do not have thought, to be regarded as having sensation and not as being mere [[automata]].

Christian trialism is the doctrine that humans have three separate essences (body, soul, spirit), based on a literal interpretation of [[1 Thessalonians]] 5:23 ''And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.'' This doctrine holds the [[soul]] to belong to the union of the body and the spirit, which makes it roughly compatible with philosophical trialism.  However, the [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Kenneth Copeland]] came under fire by critics such as [[Hank Hanegraff]] for extending trialism to each Person in the [[Trinity]], for a total of nine essences.

'''''United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.'''''  499 U.S. 187 (1991), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] establishing that [[private sector]] policies prohibiting women from knowingly working in potentially hazardous occupations are [[gender discrimination|discriminatory]] and in violation of [[Title VII]] and the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.|volume=499|page=187|pin=|year=1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the case was heard, it was considered one of the most important sex-discrimination cases since the passage of Title VII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Arlynn Leiber|last2=Bertin|first2=Joan|title=Women at Work: Should 'Fetal Protection' Policies Be Upheld|journal=ABA Journal|date=June 1990|volume=76|issue=6|pages=38–39|publisher=American Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The [[majority opinion]] by [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] held that that Title VII prohibits gender–specific [[fetal protection policies]]. Hence based on that statute,  the Court decided against [[Johnson Controls]] by concluding that the company’s fetal protection policy contravened Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act|PDA]]; and the company's gender-specific rule was biased and inequitable because it permitted fertile men, but not fertile women, to decide whether to work in jobs subjected to lead exposure while manufacturing batteries.&lt;ref name=Meze&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5831">'''VNS Matrix''' was an [[artist collective]] founded in [[Adelaide]], Australia, in 1991, by [[Josephine Starrs]], [[Julianne Pierce]], [[Francesca da Rimini (artist)|Francesca da Rimini]] and [[Virginia Barratt]]. Their work included installations, events, and posters distributed through the Internet, magazines, and billboards. Taking their point of departure in a sexualised and socially provocative relationship between women and technology the works subversively questioned discourses of domination and control in the expanding cyber space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmediale.de/content/vns-matrix/|title=VNS Matrix - transmediale|website=www.transmediale.de|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are credited as being amongst the first artists to use the term [[cyberfeminism]] to describe their practice.

== Background ==

VNS Matrix was an Australian feminist artist group who were active from 1991 to 1997. Their activist practice was concerned primarily with women's role in technology and art, specifically taking issue with "the gendered dominance and control of the new technologies"&lt;ref&gt;Mey, Kerstin, Art and Obscenity. I.B.Tauris 2007. p. 156-158&lt;/ref&gt; and exploring, "the construction of social space, identity and sexuality in cyberspace"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/vns-matrix/biography/|title=Media Art Net - VNS Matrix: Biography|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=14 May 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of their first works was a 6 by 18 foot billboard announcing "the clitoris is a direct line to the matrix...".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kay Schaffer, "The Game Girls of VNS Matrix: Challenging Gendered Identities in Cyberspace" Sexualities in History: A Reader 2013. p. 434 - 452&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, they wrote their "[https://anthology.rhizome.org/a-cyber-feminist-manifesto-for-the-21st-century A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthology.rhizome.org/a-cyber-feminist-manifesto-for-the-21st-century|title=NET ART ANTHOLOGY: A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century|date=27 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the manifesto was designed for the Internet—reposted to various websites—it also piratically circulated through traditional media, including radio broadcast, television, posted in public spaces and placed in the printed advertisements of magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1993 VNS Matrix debuted their computer art game/installation All New Gen at the Experimental Art Foundation Gallery in Adelaide which received national interest, critical acclaim, and wildly enthusiastic reviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{cquote|Welcome to the world of ALL NEW GEN: the radically transgressive, interactive computer game for non-specific genders. Thank you for playing. You are invited to join All New Gen and  her DNA Sluts—the super powerful Patina de Panties, Dentata, and the Princess of Slime—in their battle against Big Daddy Mainframe and his technobimbo sidekicks—Circuit Boy, Streetfighter and other total dicks—whom you will encounter in the Contested Zone. This is a zone where gender is a shufflable six-letter word and power is no longer centered in a specific organization."&lt;ref&gt;VNS Matrix, All New Gen. Multimedia installation at the Experimental Art Foundation, Adelaide, South Australia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After logging on to All New Gen, the first question asked of game players is: 'What is your gender? Male, Female, Neither.' 'Neither' is the correct answer, since clicking the Male or Female icon sends players spinning on a loop that takes them out of the game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1994 All New Gen was well received at the International Symposium on Electronic Art in Helsinki after which it toured to a number of galleries and art spaces in Australia, Europe, the United States, Canada and Japan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; VNS Matrix was later awarded a $100,000 grant from the Australian Film Commission to develop a prototype of an All Gen CD-ROM game for international distribution called Bad Code, which included a number of enhancements including sophisticated new images, 3D graphic spaces, animations, video sequences, characters and zones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''vulnerable''' [[species]] is one which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as likely to become [[Endangered species|endangered]] unless the circumstances that are [[threatened species|threatening]] its survival and [[reproduction]] improve.

Vulnerability is mainly caused by [[habitat loss]] or destruction of the species home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], an example being the [[military macaw]].

There are currently 5196 [[animal]]s and 6789 [[plant]]s classified as vulnerable, compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222, respectively.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf | title = IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EX, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List | accessdate = 2012-12-31 | author = [[IUCN]] | date = 2012 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Practices such as [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically.

==Criteria==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] uses several criteria to enter species in this category. A [[taxon]] is Vulnerable when it is not [[critically endangered]] or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future, as defined by any of the following criteria (A to E):

'''A) Population reduction in the form of either of the following:'''

#An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of ≥ 50% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, provided the causes of the reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased.&lt;ref name=iucnvu&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#critical&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement is based on (and specifying) any of the following:
##direct observation
##an index of abundance appropriate for the taxon
##a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence or quality of habitat
##actual or potential levels of exploitation
##the effects of [[Introduced species|introduced taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], pathogens, [[pollutants]], competitors or [[parasites]].
#A reduction of at least 20%, projected or suspected to be met within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of (2), (3), (4) or (5) above.

'''B) Extent of occurrence estimated to be less than 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or area of occupancy estimated to be less than 2000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and estimates indicating any two of the following:
'''

#Severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than ten locations.
#Continuing decline, inferred, observed or projected, in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##area, extent or quality of habitat
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals
#Extreme fluctuations in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals

'''C) Population estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and either:'''

#An estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer, or
#A continuing decline, observed, projected, or inferred, in numbers of mature individuals and population structure in the form of either:
##severely fragmented (i.e. no subpopulation estimated to contain more than 1000 mature individuals)
##all mature individuals are in a single subpopulation

'''D) Population very small or restricted in the form of either of the following:'''

#Population estimated to number less than 1000 mature individuals.
#Population is characterised by an acute restriction in its area of occupancy (typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name=iucnvu /&gt; or in the number of locations (typically less than five). Such a taxon would thus be prone to the effects of human activities (or stochastic events whose impact is increased by human activities) within a very short period of time in an unforeseeable future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short period.

'''E) Quantitative analysis showing the probability of extinction in the wild is at least 10% within 100 years.'''

The examples of vulnerable animal species are [[hyacinth macaw]], [[mountain zebra]], [[gaur]], [[kea]], [[black crowned crane]] and [[blue crane]]
